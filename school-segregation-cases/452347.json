Ervin, Sp. Florida Counsel, Tallahassee, and Gene W. Lafitte, President, New Orleans, La., for The American College of Trial Lawyers, amicus curiae.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>In November 1984 this Court heard oral argument in case numbers 65,197 and 65,877, encompassing a total revision of the bar rules.<sup>[*]</sup> Since that time, numerous petitions for revision of both the currently existing bar rules and of the proposed new rules have been filed with and considered by the Court, and the proposed new rules have been revised several times. After rearranging and revising portions of the bar's proposed rules, we now adopt these new rules, entitled \"Rules Regulating the Florida Bar.\" As can be seen in the new rules, the integration rule, bylaws, and code of professional responsibility no longer exist as separate entities. Rather, all rules pertaining to the bar have been integrated, in a chapter format, into a single document. It is the revisers' hope, as well as the Court's, that this new arrangement will make it easier to find things in the rules.</p>\n<p>Several noteworthy changes have been made from the current rules and from the board's proposals. For instance, while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*978</span> amendments to most of the rules still must be through petition to this Court, chapters 2, 7, and 9 can be amended by the board of governors without petitioning the Court. See rule 2-10. Dues, however, are still capped, and this Court will have to be petitioned for changes in the amount of members' dues. The new rules also provide for nonlawyer members of the board of governors; the period for disbarment has been raised to five years; and there are numerous changes in the disciplinary process, now set out in chapter 3.</p>\n<p>A few of the changes made by the Court in the board's proposal include: an addition to rule 4-3.6 regarding persons making extrajudicial statements in criminal cases; a proviso regarding holding and maintaining property as a client wishes added to rule 4-1.15(a); and expansion of confidentiality in minor misconduct reports in 3-5.1(b). Also, rule 4-7.3, as originally proposed, prohibited direct mail solicitation of persons known to have specific legal problems. After studying this matter, we have concluded that such mailing cannot be prohibited. Instead, we have revised rule 4-7.3 to regulate, rather than proscribe, such communications. If this regulation proves unworkable or if a pattern of abuse in direct mailings is established, we will consider amending the solicitation rule.</p>\n<p>The rules as finally adopted also include recent amendments regarding confidentiality for attorneys seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, 490 So.2d 937 (Fla. 1986), contingent fees, 494 So.2d 960 (Fla. 1986), and graduation from an accredited law school for emeritus attorneys, 490 So.2d 947 (Fla. 1986). The rules will be printed in both this year's edition of the bar <i>Journal</i> and the West rules pamphlet.</p>\n<p>We express our thanks to all members and officers of the bar who worked on these revisions and who favored the Court with their comments and suggestions regarding the proposed rules. These rules will become effective at 12:01 a.m., January 1, 1987, and we urge all members of the bar to familiarize themselves with these new rules.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>McDONALD, C.J., and ADKINS, BOYD, OVERTON, EHRLICH, SHAW and BARKETT, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ON REHEARING GRANTED</h2>\n<p>The board of governors of the Florida Bar has filed a petition for rehearing or clarification regarding this Court's adoption of new bar rules. The board seeks amendment of the opinion itself as to the applicability of the new rules as well as changes in the text of the rules to correct errors in and omissions from the rules as submitted by the board and requests rewording of several provisions. After reviewing these matters we adopt the changes set out in the petition.</p>\n<p>The last sentence of our original opinion is revised to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>These rules will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1987. Thereafter, the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar shall govern the conduct of all members of the Florida Bar. All disciplinary cases pending as of 12:01 a.m. January 1, 1987 shall thereafter be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar. We urge all members of the bar to familiarize themselves with these new rules.</blockquote>\n<p>The individual pages of the rules affected by the changes adopted hereby are attached to this rehearing opinion.<sup>[**]</sup></p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>McDONALD, C.J., and ADKINS, BOYD, OVERTON, EHRLICH, SHAW and BARKETT, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*979</span> RULES REGULATING THE FLORIDA BAR</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chapter 1</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>GENERAL</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Florida by these rules establishes the authority and responsibilities of The Florida Bar, an official arm of the Court.</p>\n<p>1-1 <i>Name.</i> The name of the body regulated by these rules shall be THE FLORIDA BAR.</p>\n<p>1-2 <i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of The Florida Bar shall be to inculcate in its members the principles of duty and service to the public, to improve the administration of justice, and to advance the science of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>1-3 <i>Membership.</i></p>\n<p>1-3.1 <i>Composition.</i> The membership of The Florida Bar shall be composed of all persons who are admitted by this Court to the practice of law in this state and who maintain their membership in good standing pursuant to these rules.</p>\n<p>1-3.2 <i>Active members.</i> Active members of The Florida Bar in good standing shall mean only those persons licensed to practice law in Florida who have paid annual membership fees or dues for the current year and who are not retired, resigned, delinquent or suspended members.

The finding of probable cause shall be made by a grievance committee or by the board in accordance with these rules.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Executive committee.</i> All acts and discretion required by the board under these Rules of Discipline may be exercised by its executive committee between meetings of the board as may from time to time be authorized by standing board of governors' policies.</p>\n<p>3-3.3 <i>Counsel for The Florida Bar.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Staff counsel.</i> The board may employ staff counsel and assistant staff counsel for The Florida Bar to perform such duties, as may be assigned, under the direction of the executive director.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Bar counsel.</i> Staff counsel may designate members of The Florida Bar to serve as bar counsel to represent The Florida Bar in disciplinary proceedings.

Such committees shall continue only until the completion of tasks assigned, and they shall have jurisdiction and power to proceed in all matters so assigned to them. All provisions concerning grievance committees shall be applicable to special grievance committees except those concerning terms of office and other restrictions thereon as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*997</span> may be imposed by the board.

Continuous service of a member shall not exceed three (3) years.

The chairperson and vice-chairperson shall be members of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Oath.</i> Each new member of a committee shall subscribe to an oath to fulfill the duties of the office.

The forum first asserting jurisdiction in a disciplinary matter shall retain the same to the exclusion of the other until the final determination of the cause.</p>\n<p>3-4 <i>Standards of conduct.</i></p>\n<p>3-4.1 <i>Notice and knowledge of rules.</i> Every member of The Florida Bar and every attorney of another state who is admitted to practice for the purpose of a specific case before a court of record of this state is within the jurisdiction of this Court and its agencies under this rule and is charged with notice and held to know the provisions of this rule and the standards of ethical and professional conduct prescribed by this Court. Jurisdiction over an attorney of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*998</span> another state who is not a member of The Florida Bar shall be limited to conduct as an attorney in relation to the business for which the attorney was permitted to practice in this state and the privilege in the future to practice law in the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>3-4.2 <i>Rules of Professional Conduct.</i> Violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted by the rules governing The Florida Bar is a cause for discipline.</p>\n<p>3-4.3 <i>Misconduct and minor misconduct.</i> The standards of professional conduct to be observed by members of the bar are not limited to the observance of rules and avoidance of prohibitive acts, and the enumeration herein of certain categories of misconduct as constituting grounds for discipline shall not be deemed to be all-inclusive nor shall the failure to specify any particular act of misconduct be construed as tolerance thereof. The commission by a lawyer of any act which is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice, whether the act is committed in the course of the attorney's relations as an attorney or otherwise, whether committed within or outside the State of Florida, and whether or not the act is a felony or misdemeanor, may constitute a cause for discipline.</p>\n<p>3-4.4 <i>Criminal misconduct.</i> Unless modified or stayed by the Supreme Court of Florida as provided elsewhere herein, a determination or judgment of guilt of a member of The Florida Bar by a court of competent jurisdiction of any crime or offense that is a felony under the laws of such jurisdiction is cause for automatic suspension from the practice of law in Florida. In addition, whether the alleged misconduct constitutes a felony or misdemeanor The Florida Bar may initiate disciplinary action regardless of whether the respondent has been tried, acquitted, or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense; however, the board may, in its discretion, withhold prosecution of disciplinary proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings against respondent. The acquittal of respondent in a criminal proceeding shall not necessarily be a bar to disciplinary proceedings nor shall the findings, judgment or decree of any court in civil proceedings necessarily be binding in disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p>3-4.5 <i>Removal from judicial office by the Supreme Court of Florida.</i> Whenever a judge is removed from office by the Supreme Court of Florida on the basis of a Judicial Qualifications Commission proceeding, the removal order, when the record in such proceedings discloses the appropriate basis, may also order the suspension of the judge as an attorney pending further proceedings hereunder.</p>\n<p>3-4.6 <i>Discipline by foreign or federal jurisdictions.</i> A final adjudication in a disciplinary proceeding by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another jurisdiction, state or federal, that an attorney licensed to practice in that jurisdiction is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action shall be considered as conclusive proof of such misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding under this rule.</p>\n<p>3-4.7 <i>Oath.</i> Violation of the oath taken by an attorney to support the constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida is ground for disciplinary action. Membership in, alliance with, or support of any organization, group, or party advocating or dedicated to the overthrow of the government by violence or by any means in violation of the Constitution of the United States or constitution of this state shall be a violation of the oath.</p>\n<p>3-5 <i>Types of discipline.</i></p>\n<p>3-5.1 <i>Generally.</i> A judgment entered, finding a member of The Florida Bar guilty of misconduct, shall include one or more of the following disciplinary measures:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Private reprimand.</i> A Supreme Court of Florida order adjudging a private reprimand may direct the respondent to appear before the Supreme Court of Florida, the board of governors, or the referee for administration of the reprimand. A grievance committee report and finding of minor misconduct or the board of governors, upon review of such report, may direct the respondent to appear before the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*999</span> board of governors or the grievance committee for administration of the reprimand. A memorandum of administering of such a reprimand shall thereafter be made a part of the record of the proceeding.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Minor misconduct.</i> Minor misconduct is the only type of misconduct for which a private reprimand is an appropriate disciplinary sanction.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Criteria.</i> In the absence of unusual circumstances misconduct shall not be regarded as minor if any of the following conditions exist:</p>\n<p>a. The misconduct involves misappropriation of a client's funds or property.</p>\n<p>b. The misconduct resulted in or is likely to result in actual prejudice (loss of money, legal rights or valuable property rights) to a client or other person.</p>\n<p>c. The respondent has been publicly disciplined in the past three (3) years.</p>\n<p>d. The misconduct involved is of the same nature as misconduct for which the respondent has been disciplined in the past five (5) years.</p>\n<p>e. The misconduct includes dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fraud on the part of the respondent.</p>\n<p>f. The misconduct constitutes the commission of a felony under applicable law.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Discretion of grievance committee.</i> Despite the presence of one or more of the criteria described in paragraph (1), above, a grievance committee may recommend a private reprimand for minor misconduct when unusual circumstances are present. When the grievance committee recommends a private reprimand for minor misconduct under such circumstances, its report shall contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the committee's recommendation.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Recommendation of minor misconduct.</i> If a grievance committee finds the respondent guilty of minor misconduct or if the respondent shall admit guilt of minor misconduct and the committee concurs, the grievance committee shall file its report recommending a private reprimand, recommending the manner of administration and for the taxing of costs against the respondent. The report recommending a private reprimand shall be forwarded to staff counsel and the designated reviewer for review. If staff counsel does not return the report to the grievance committee to remedy a defect therein, or if the report is not referred to the disciplinary review committee by the designated reviewer (as provided in rule 3-7.4(b)), the report shall then be served on the respondent by branch staff counsel. The report and finding of minor misconduct shall become final unless rejected by the respondent within fifteen (15) days after service of the report. If rejected by the respondent, the report shall be referred to bar counsel and referee for trial on complaint of minor misconduct to be prepared by branch staff counsel as in the case of a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Rejection of minor misconduct reports.</i> The rejection by the board of governors of a grievance committee report recommending a private reprimand for minor misconduct, without dismissal of the case, shall be deemed a finding of probable cause. The rejection of such report by a respondent shall be deemed a finding of probable cause for minor misconduct. If either the board or the respondent rejects a minor misconduct report, confidentiality shall remain in effect until the Supreme Court of Florida enters an order imposing public discipline. Upon trial before a referee following rejection by a respondent of a report of minor misconduct, the referee may recommend any discipline authorized under these rules.</p>\n<p>(5) <i>Admission of minor misconduct.</i> At any time prior to the filing of a complaint with the Supreme Court of Florida a respondent may tender a written admission of minor misconduct to branch staff counsel or the grievance committee. An admission of minor misconduct may be conditioned upon acceptance by the grievance committee, but the respondent may not condition the admission of minor misconduct upon the method of administration of the private reprimand or upon nonpayment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1000</span> of costs incurred in the proceedings. Such an admission may be tendered after a finding of probable cause (but before the filing of a complaint) only if such an admission has not been previously tendered. If the admission is tendered after a finding of probable cause, the grievance committee may consider such admission without further evidentiary hearing and may either reject the admission, thereby affirming its prior action, or accept the admission and issue its report of minor misconduct. If a respondent's admission is accepted by the grievance committee, the respondent may not thereafter reject a report of the committee recommending a private reprimand for minor misconduct. If the admission of minor misconduct is rejected, such admission shall not be considered or used against the respondent in subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Probation.</i> The respondent may be placed upon probation for a stated period of time of not less than six (6) months nor more than three (3) years or for an indefinite period determined by conditions stated in the order. The judgment shall state the conditions of the probation which may include but are not limited to the following: supervision of all or part of the respondent's work by a member of The Florida Bar; the making of reports to a designated agency; the satisfactory completion of a course of study or a paper on legal ethics approved by the Supreme Court of Florida; such supervision over fees and trust accounts as the Court may direct. The respondent will also reimburse the bar for the costs of supervision. Failure to observe the conditions of the probation or a finding of probable cause as to conduct of the respondent committed during the period of probation shall terminate the probation. In such event, even though such finding of probable cause shall be made after the expiration of the period of probation, the judgment shall be reconsidered and an appropriate judgment shall be entered. On termination of probation for failure to observe the conditions of probation or on a finding of probable cause for misconduct committed during the period of probation, the attorney may be punished for contempt or suspended from the practice of law on petition by The Florida Bar, and any such suspension shall continue until the respondent may be reinstated to the practice of law as provided elsewhere in these rules.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Public reprimand.</i> A public reprimand shall be administered in the manner prescribed in the judgment but all such reprimands shall be reported in the <i>Southern Reporter.</i> Due notice shall be given to the respondent of any proceeding set to administer the reprimand. The respondent shall appear personally before the Supreme Court of Florida, the board of governors, or the referee, if required, and such appearance shall be made a part of the record of the proceeding.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Suspension.</i> The respondent may be suspended from the practice of law for a definite period of time or an indefinite period thereafter to be determined by the conditions imposed by the judgment. During such suspension the respondent shall continue to be a member of The Florida Bar but without the privilege of practicing, and, upon the expiration of the suspension period and the satisfaction of all conditions accompanying the suspension, the respondent shall become eligible to all of the privileges of members in The Florida Bar. A suspension of ninety (90) days or less shall not require proof of rehabilitation or passage of the Florida bar examination. A suspension of more than ninety (90) days shall require proof of rehabilitation and may require passage of all or part of the Florida bar examination. No suspension shall be ordered for a specific period of time in excess of three (3) years.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Disbarment.</i> A judgment of disbarment terminates the respondent's status as a member of the bar. A former member who has been disbarred may only be admitted again upon full compliance with the rules and regulations governing admission to the bar. Except as might be otherwise provided in these rules, no application for admission may be tendered within five (5) years after the date of disbarment or such longer period as the Court might determine in the disbarment order.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1001</span> (g) <i>Temporary suspension and probation.</i> On petition of The Florida Bar, authorized by its president, president-elect, or executive director, supported by an affidavit demonstrating facts personally known to affiant showing that an attorney appears to be causing great public harm by misappropriating funds to his own use, or for other reasons, the Supreme Court of Florida may issue an order with such notice as the Court may prescribe imposing temporary conditions of probation on said attorney or temporarily suspending said attorney. Any order of temporary suspension or probation which restricts the attorney maintaining a trust account shall, when served on any bank maintaining an account against which said attorney may make withdrawals, serve as an injunction to prevent said bank from making further payment from such account or accounts on any obligation except in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Court. Any order of temporary suspension issued under this rule shall preclude the attorney from accepting any new cases and may preclude the attorney from continuing to represent existing clients during the first thirty (30) days after issuance of such temporary order. Any fees tendered to such attorney during such thirty-day period shall be deposited in a trust fund from which withdrawals may be made only in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Court. The attorney may for good cause request dissolution or amendment of any such temporary order by petition filed with the Supreme Court of Florida, a copy of which will be served on the executive director. Such petition for dissolution shall be set for immediate hearing before a referee designated by the chief justice. The designated referee shall hear such petition forthwith and submit his report and recommendation to the Supreme Court of Florida with the utmost speed consistent with due process.

Notice shall include a copy of the order(s) whereby such determination or judgment was entered.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Notice of determination or judgment of guilt by courts of the State of Florida.</i> If any such determination or judgment is entered by a court of the State of Florida, the judge or clerk thereof shall transmit to the Supreme Court of Florida and the executive director of The Florida Bar a certified copy of the order(s) whereby the determination or judgment was entered.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Suspension by judgment of guilt (felonies).</i> Upon receiving notice that a member of the bar has been determined or adjudicated guilty of a felony, branch staff counsel will file a \"Notice of Determination or Judgment of Guilt\" in the Supreme Court of Florida. A copy of the judgment shall be attached to the notice. Upon the filing with the Supreme Court of Florida by The Florida Bar and service upon the respondent of a notice of determination or judgment of guilt for offenses that are felonies under applicable law, the respondent shall stand suspended as a member of The Florida Bar on the eleventh day after filing of the notice of determination or judgment of guilt unless he shall, on or before the tenth day after filing of such notice, file a petition to terminate or modify such suspension.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Petition to modify or terminate suspension.</i></p>\n<p>(1) At any time after the filing of a notice of determination or judgment of guilt the respondent may file a petition with the Supreme Court of Florida to modify or terminate such suspension and shall serve a copy thereof upon the executive director.</p>\n<p>(2) If such petition is filed on or before the tenth day following the filing of the notice, the suspension will be deferred until entry of an order on the petition.</p>\n<p>(3) If such petition is filed after the tenth day following the filing of the notice of judgment of guilt, the suspension shall remain in effect pending disposition of the petition. Modification or termination of the suspension shall be granted only upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Response to petition to modify or terminate automatic suspension.</i> The Florida Bar shall be allowed twenty (20) days from the filing of a petition to modify or terminate automatic suspension to respond to the same.

The failure of a trial court to adjudicate the convicted attorney guilty of the offense(s) charged shall be considered as a matter of mitigation only.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Professional misconduct in foreign jurisdiction.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Notice of discipline by a foreign jurisdiction.</i> A member of The Florida Bar disbarred or suspended from the practice of law by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another state or by a federal court shall within thirty (30) days after the effective date of disbarment or suspension file with the Supreme Court of Florida a copy of the order or judgment effecting such disbarment or suspension.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Adjudication or discipline by a foreign jurisdiction.</i> In cases of a final adjudication by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another jurisdiction, such adjudication of misconduct shall be sufficient basis for the filing of a complaint by The Florida Bar and assignment for hearing before a referee without a finding of probable cause under these rules.</p>\n<p>3-7.3 <i>Grievance committee procedures.</i> When notice of a grievance committee hearing is sent to respondent, such notice shall be accompanied by a list of the grievance committee members.</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Complaint filed with grievance committee.</i> A complaint received by a committee direct from a complainant shall be reported to the appropriate branch staff counsel for docketing and assignment of a case number, unless the committee resolves the complaint within ten (10) days after receipt of the complaint. A written report to branch staff counsel shall include the following information: complainant's name and address; respondent's name; date complaint received by committee; copy of complaint letter or summary of the oral complaint made; and the name of the committee member assigned to the investigation. Formal investigation by a grievance committee may proceed after the matter has been referred to staff counsel for docketing.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Investigation.</i> A grievance committee is required to consider all charges of misconduct forwarded to the committee by staff counsel whether based upon a written complaint or not.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Conduct of proceedings.</i> The proceedings of grievance committees may be informal in nature and the committees shall not be bound by the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>No delay for civil or criminal proceedings.</i> An investigation shall not be deferred or suspended without the approval of the board even though the respondent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1006</span> is made a party of civil litigation, or is a defendant or is acquitted in a criminal action, notwithstanding that either of such proceedings involves the subject matter of the investigation.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Counsel and investigators.</i> Upon request of a grievance committee, staff counsel may appoint a bar counsel or an investigator to assist the committee in an investigation. Staff counsel shall assist each grievance committee in carrying out its investigative and administrative duties and shall prepare status reports for the committee, notify complainants and respondents of committee actions as appropriate, and prepare all reports reflecting committee findings of probable cause, no probable cause, recommended discipline for minor misconduct, and admonishments after no probable cause findings.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Quorum, vote.</i> Not fewer than three (3) members, one of whom must be the chairperson or vice-chairperson and another of whom must be a lawyer, shall constitute a quorum. All findings of probable cause and recommendations of guilt of minor misconduct shall be made by affirmative vote of a majority of the committee members present, which majority must number at least two (2) members. The number of committee members voting for or against the committee report shall be reflected in the transcript. Minority reports may be filed.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Rights and responsibilities of the respondent.</i> The respondent may be required to testify and to produce evidence as any other witness unless the respondent claims a privilege or right properly available to the respondent under applicable federal or state law. The respondent may be accompanied by counsel. At a reasonable time before any hearing at which any finding of probable cause or minor misconduct is made the respondent shall be advised of the conduct which is being investigated and the rules which have been violated, provided the bar may amend its statement as to which rules have been violated. The respondent shall be given an opportunity to make a statement personally or by counsel, verbally or in writing, sworn or unsworn, explaining, refuting, or admitting the alleged misconduct. The respondent shall be granted the right to be present at any grievance committee hearing when evidence is to be presented to the committee, to face the accuser, and to call witnesses or present evidence and to cross-examine, subject to reasonable limitation.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Rights of the complaining witness.</i> The complaining witness is not a party to the disciplinary proceeding. Unless found to be impractical by the chairman of the grievance committee due to unreasonable delay or other good cause, the complainant shall be granted the right to be present at any grievance committee hearing when evidence is to be presented, subject to reasonable limitations. Neither unwillingness nor neglect of the complaining witness to cooperate, nor settlement, compromise, or restitution will excuse the completion of an investigation. The complaining witness shall have no right of appeal.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>No finding of probable cause.</i> If a grievance committee upon termination of its investigation does not find probable cause, the committee shall dispose of its file in the manner directed by the board of governors. If the grievance committee has notified the respondent of the investigation, then the committee shall notify the respondent of the action of the committee. The failure of a grievance committee to find probable cause shall not preclude further proceedings.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Preparation, forwarding, and review of grievance committee complaints.</i> If a grievance committee finds probable cause, the branch staff counsel assigned to the committee shall promptly prepare a record of its investigation and a formal complaint. The formal complaint shall be signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the committee who participated in the proceeding. The formal complaint shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by the board. Such formal complaint shall be promptly forwarded to and reviewed by bar headquarters staff counsel. If the grievance committee chairperson or vice-chairperson <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1007</span> disagrees with the form of the complaint, he or she may direct branch staff counsel to make changes accordingly. If branch staff counsel does not agree with the directed changes, the matter shall be referred to the designated reviewer of the committee for appropriate action. When a formal complaint by a grievance committee is not referred to the designated reviewer, or returned to the grievance committee for further action, bar headquarters staff counsel shall furnish a copy of the formal complaint to the respondent, and a copy of the transcripts and exhibits shall be made available to the respondent at his expense.</p>\n<p>(k) <i>Letter reports in no probable cause cases.</i> Upon a finding of no probable cause, the committee chairperson or vice-chairperson will submit a short letter report of the no probable cause finding to branch staff counsel with a copy to the investigating member and the respondent if the respondent was notified of the investigation. The report to branch staff counsel should include any documentation deemed appropriate by the chairperson or vice-chairperson. The chairperson or vice-chairperson shall also send a letter to the complainant in confidence, without reference to any admonishment, with a copy to branch staff counsel, explaining why the complaint did not warrant further proceedings. Admonishments issued by a grievance committee shall be in writing and signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson and shall not be made a part of the respondent's record.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Recommendation of private reprimand for minor misconduct.</i> If the committee recommends an order of private reprimand for minor misconduct, the grievance committee report shall be drafted by branch staff counsel and signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson who participated in the hearing. The committee report need only include: (1) the committee's recommendations regarding the private reprimand, designation withdrawal, and conditions of redesignation; (2) the committee's recommendation as to whether the respondent should be required to appear before the board for administration of the reprimand; (3) a summary of any additional charges which will be dismissed if the private reprimand is approved; (4) any comment on mitigating, aggravating, or evidentiary matters which the committee believes will be helpful to the board in passing upon the private reprimand recommendation; and (5) an admission of minor misconduct signed by the respondent, if the respondent has admitted guilt of minor misconduct. No record need be submitted with such a report. After the chairperson or vice-chairperson signs the grievance committee report, he or she shall return the report to branch staff counsel. The report recommending a private reprimand shall be forwarded to staff counsel and the designated reviewer for review. If staff counsel does not return the report to the grievance committee to remedy a defect therein, or if the designated reviewer does not present the same to the disciplinary review committee for action by the board, the report shall then be served on the respondent by branch staff counsel.</p>\n<p>(m) <i>Rejection of private reprimand.</i> The order of private reprimand shall become final unless rejected by the respondent within fifteen (15) days after service upon the respondent. If rejected by the respondent, the report shall be referred to bar counsel and referee for trial on complaint of minor misconduct to be prepared by branch staff counsel as in the case of a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(n) <i>Staff counsel and grievance committee chairperson determinations of no probable cause.</i> If staff counsel and a grievance committee chairperson concur in a finding of no probable cause, the complaint may be closed on such finding without reference to a grievance committee.</p>\n<p>(<i>o</i>) <i>Appointment of bar counsel.</i> When a grievance committee formal complaint is not referred to the disciplinary review committee, or returned to the grievance committee, staff counsel of The Florida Bar headquarters in Tallahassee may appoint bar counsel unless bar counsel has been appointed, sign the complaint and file the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1008</span> same in the Supreme Court of Florida, serve a copy on the respondent, and request the Supreme Court of Florida to assign a referee to try the cause. If probable cause is found by the board, staff counsel will prepare the formal complaint.</p>\n<p>3-7.4 <i>Procedures before the board of governors.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Review of grievance committee matters.</i> The disciplinary review committee shall review those grievance committee matters referred to it by a designated reviewer. The committee shall make a report to the board and unless overruled by the board the report shall be final.</p>\n<p>(1) Whenever a grievance matter is referred to the disciplinary review committee by the designated reviewer, the disciplinary review committee shall promptly review the actions of the grievance committee and the recommendations of the designated reviewer and make a report to the board providing for the issuance of:</p>\n<p>a. A private reprimand which the respondent may thereafter reject in the same manner as a private reprimand recommended by a grievance committee;</p>\n<p>b. Confirmation of the formal complaint;</p>\n<p>c. Reversal of the grievance committee and a finding of no probable cause; or</p>\n<p>d. Return of the matter to the grievance committee for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>(2) The disciplinary review committee report shall be final unless overruled by the board. If the board shall find no probable cause, staff counsel shall notify the respondent, the grievance committee, and the complaining witness.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Review by the designated reviewer.</i> A designated reviewer at any time may review the actions of a grievance committee and shall review those grievance committee actions referred to him or her, in writing. If the designated reviewer disagrees with the grievance committee action the designated reviewer shall make a report and recommendation to the disciplinary review committee. In those matters referred in writing the designated reviewer shall make the report and recommendation within twenty-one (21) days following the mailing date of the referral; otherwise the grievance committee action shall stand.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Finding of probable cause.</i> The board, on the basis of the report of any regular or special grievance committee, may by majority vote find probable cause and direct the filing of a formal complaint against an attorney.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Finding of no probable cause.</i> A finding of no probable cause by the board shall be final and no further proceedings shall be had in the matter by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Control of proceedings.</i> Bar counsel, however appointed, at all times shall be subject to the direction of the board. In the exercise of its discretion as the governing body of The Florida Bar, the board prior to the receipt of evidence by the referee has the power to terminate disciplinary proceedings before a referee, whether such proceedings have been instituted upon a finding of probable cause by the board or a grievance committee.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Filing service on board of governors.</i> All matters to be filed with or served upon the board shall be addressed to the board of governors and filed with the executive director. The executive director shall be the custodian of the official records of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>3-7.5 <i>Procedures before a referee.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Referees.</i> The chief justice shall have the power to appoint referees to try disciplinary cases and to delegate to a chief judge of a judicial circuit the power to appoint referees for duty in the chief judge's respective circuit. Such appointees shall ordinarily be active county or circuit judges, but the chief justice may appoint retired judges.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Trial by referee.</i> When a finding has been made by a grievance committee or by the board that there is cause to believe that a member of The Florida Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action, and the formal complaint based on such finding of probable cause has been assigned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1009</span> by the chief justice for trial before a referee, the proceeding thereafter shall be an adversary proceeding which shall be conducted as hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Venue.</i> The trial shall be held in the county in which an alleged offense occurred or in the county where the respondent resides or practices law or last practiced law in Florida, whichever shall be designated by the Supreme Court of Florida; provided, however, that if the respondent is not a resident of Florida and if the alleged offense is not committed in Florida, the trial shall be held in a county designated by the chief justice.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Style of proceedings.</i> All proceedings instituted by The Florida Bar shall be styled \"The Florida Bar, Complainant v. (name of respondent), Respondent\" and \"In The Supreme Court of Florida (Before a Referee).\"</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Nature of proceedings.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Administrative in character.</i> A disciplinary proceeding is neither civil nor criminal but is a quasijudicial administrative proceeding. The Florida Rules of Civil Procedure apply except as otherwise provided in this rule.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Discovery.</i> Discovery shall be available to the parties in accordance with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Bar counsel.</i> Bar counsel shall make such investigation as is necessary and shall prepare and prosecute with utmost diligence any case assigned. Assistant bar counsel shall serve under the general supervision of bar counsel.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Pleadings.</i> Pleadings may be informal and shall comply with the following requirements:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Complaint; consolidation and severance.</i></p>\n<p>a. <i>Filing.</i> Staff counsel shall prepare the complaint and file the same in the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>b. <i>Content.</i> The complaint shall set forth the particular act or acts of conduct for which the attorney is sought to be disciplined.</p>\n<p>c. <i>Joinder of charges and respondents; severance.</i> A complaint may embrace any number of charges against one or more respondents, and charges may be against any one or any number of respondents; but a severance may be granted by the referee when the ends of justice require it.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Answer and motion.</i> The respondent may answer the complaint and, as a part thereof or by separate motion, may challenge only the sufficiency of the complaint and the jurisdiction of the forum. All other defenses shall be incorporated in the respondent's answer. All pleadings of the respondent must be filed within twenty (20) days of service of a copy of the complaint.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Reply.</i> If the respondent's answer shall contain any new matter or affirmative defense, a reply thereto may be filed within ten (10) days of the date of service of a copy upon bar counsel, but failure to file such a reply shall not prejudice The Florida Bar.

In the event of disqualification, the chief justice shall appoint a successor.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Notice of final hearing.</i> The cause may be set down for trial by either party or the referee upon not less than ten (10) days notice. The trial shall be held as soon as possible following the expiration of ten (10) days from the filing of respondent's answer, or if no answer is filed, then from the date when such answer is due.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>The respondent.</i> Unless the respondent claims a privilege or right properly available under applicable federal or state law, the respondent may be called as a witness by The Florida Bar to make specific and complete disclosure of all matters material to the issues. When the respondent is subpoenaed to appear and give testimony or to produce books, papers, or documents and refuses to answer or to produce such books, papers, or documents, or, having been duly sworn to testify, refuses to answer any proper question, the respondent may be cited for contempt of the court.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Complaining witness.</i> The complaining witness shall have no right other than those of any other witness; the complaining witness has no right to be present during a hearing or trial but may be called upon to testify and produce evidence as any other witness.

Prompt written notice of such termination date and the board's action, if any, shall be communicated to the respondent. The proceeding shall be commenced by filing with the Supreme Court of Florida a petition for review, specifying those portions of the report of a referee sought to be reviewed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1012</span> Within ten (10) days after service of such petition, the opposing party may file a cross-petition for review specifying any additional portion of the report which said party desires reviewed. The filing of such petition or cross-petition shall be jurisdictional as to a review to be procured as a matter of right, but the Court may, in its discretion, consider a late-filed petition or cross-petition upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Record on review.</i> The report and record filed by the referee shall constitute the record on review.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Briefs.</i> The party first seeking review shall file a brief in support of the petition for review within thirty (30) days of the filing of the petition. The opposing party shall file an answering brief within twenty (20) days after the service of the brief of the party seeking review, which answering brief shall also support any cross-petition for review. The party originally seeking petition for review may file a reply brief within ten (10) days after the service of the answering brief.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Oral argument.</i> Request for oral argument may be filed in any case wherein a petition for review is filed, at the time of filing the first brief. If no request is filed, the case will be disposed of without oral argument unless the Court orders otherwise.</p>\n<p>(5) <i>Burden.</i> Upon review, the burden shall be upon the party seeking review to demonstrate that a report of a referee sought to be reviewed is erroneous, unlawful, or unjustified.</p>\n<p>(6) <i>Judgment of Supreme Court of Florida.</i> After review, the Supreme Court of Florida shall enter an appropriate order or judgment. If no review is sought of a report of a referee entered under the rules and filed in the Court, the findings of fact shall be deemed conclusive and the disciplinary measure recommended by the referee shall be the disciplinary measure imposed by the Court, unless the Court directs the parties to submit briefs or oral argument directed to the suitability of the disciplinary measure recommended by the referee. A referee's report which becomes final when no review has been timely filed shall be reported in an order of the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Precedence of proceedings.</i> Petitions for review in disciplinary proceedings shall take precedence over all other civil causes in the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Extraordinary writs.</i> All applications for extraordinary writs which are concerned with disciplinary proceedings under these rules of discipline shall be made to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.</i> To the extent necessary to implement this rule and if not inconsistent herewith, the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure shall be applicable to petitions for review in disciplinary proceedings, provided service on The Florida Bar shall be accomplished by service on bar counsel and staff counsel.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Contempt by respondent.</i> Whenever it is alleged that a respondent is in contempt in a disciplinary proceeding, a petition for an order to show cause why the respondent should not be held in contempt and the proceedings on such petition may be filed in and determined by the Supreme Court of Florida or as provided under rule 3-7.10(f).</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Pending disciplinary cases.</i> If disbarment is ordered by the Court, dismissal without prejudice of other pending cases against the respondent may be ordered in the Court's disbarment order.</p>\n<p>3-7.7 <i>Procedures before a circuit court.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Filing of motion.</i> Whenever it shall be made known to any of the judges of the district courts of appeal or any judge of a circuit court or a county court in this state that a member of The Florida Bar practicing in any of the courts of the district or judicial circuit or county has been guilty of any unprofessional act as defined by these rules, such judge may direct the state attorney for the circuit in which the alleged offense occurred to make in writing a motion in the name of the State of Florida to discipline such attorney setting forth in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1013</span> motion the particular act or acts of conduct for which the attorney is sought to be disciplined.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Copy served upon respondent.</i> Upon the filing of a motion in circuit court to discipline an attorney a copy thereof shall be served upon the respondent attorney, and the respondent shall, within twenty (20) days after the service thereof, file an answer thereto.

If the board of governors or designated reviewer rejects a proposed consent judgment, staff counsel shall prepare and file a complaint as provided elsewhere in these rules.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>After filing of formal complaint.</i> If a respondent states his or her desire to plead guilty to a formal complaint that has been filed, then bar counsel, with the approval of the designated board reviewer, may consult established board guidelines for discipline and advise the respondent of the discipline the bar will recommend to the referee if a written plea of guilty is entered.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Approval of consent judgments.</i> Acceptance of any proposed consent judgment more severe than a private reprimand shall be conditional on final approval by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1014</span> Supreme Court of Florida, and the Court's order will recite the disciplinary charges against the respondent.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Content of conditional pleas.</i> All conditional pleas shall show clearly by reference or otherwise the disciplinary offenses to which the plea is made.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Authority of staff counsel.</i> Staff counsel has no authority to commit the board on any consent judgment not previously approved by the board. All consent judgments tentatively approved by staff counsel without prior approval of the board shall be subject to board approval. In negotiating consent judgments with a respondent or in recommending acceptance, rejection or offer of a tendered consent judgment the grievance committee, branch staff counsel and designated reviewer shall consider and express a recommendation on whether the consent judgment shall include withdrawal of any designations held by the attorney and restrictions to be placed on redesignation in such areas. When withdrawal of designation is agreed to in a consent judgment, the withdrawal and any conditions on redesignation will be reported to the designation staff for recording purposes.</p>\n<p>3-7.9 <i>Reinstatement and readmission procedures.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Readmission.</i> A former member who has been disbarred or who has been permitted to resign pending disciplinary proceedings, pursuant to rule 3-7.11, may only be admitted again upon full compliance with the rules and regulations governing admission to the bar.

A member of a grievance committee shall not represent any party except The Florida Bar while a member of a grievance committee and shall not thereafter represent such party for a period of one year without the express consent of the board; and</p>\n<p>f. A partner, associate, employer, or employee of an attorney prohibited from representation by paragraphs (3)c, (3)d, and (3)e of this rule shall not represent any party except The Florida Bar without the express consent of the board of governors.</p>\n<p>3-7.11 <i>Resignation from The Florida Bar.</i> If a disciplinary agency is investigating the conduct of an attorney, or if such an agency has recommended probable cause, then disciplinary proceedings shall be deemed to be pending and the resignation shall be made pursuant to this rule. An attorney may resign from The Florida Bar during the progress of disciplinary proceedings in the following manner:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Petition for leave to resign.</i> The petition for leave to resign shall be filed with the Supreme Court of Florida and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1020</span> shall contain a statement of all past and pending disciplinary actions and criminal proceedings against the petitioner. Such statement shall describe the charges made or those under investigation for professional misconduct, results of past proceedings and the status of pending investigations and proceedings. The petition shall state whether it is with or without leave to reapply. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the executive director of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Judgment.</i> Within sixty (60) days after filing and service of the petition, The Florida Bar may file with the Supreme Court of Florida its response to the petition either supporting or opposing the petition for leave to resign. A copy of the response shall be served upon petitioner. The Supreme Court of Florida shall consider the petition, any response thereto, and the charges against the petitioner. If it has been shown by the petitioner in a proper and competent manner that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the granting of the petition and that such will not adversely affect the purity of the courts nor hinder the administration of justice nor the confidence of the public in the legal profession, the Supreme Court of Florida shall enter an appropriate judgment granting leave to resign; otherwise, the petition shall be denied. If the judgment grants to the petitioner leave to resign, the judgment may require that the resignation be subject to appropriate conditions.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Delay of disciplinary proceedings.</i> The filing of a petition for leave to resign pending disciplinary proceedings shall not stay the progress of the disciplinary proceedings without the approval of the board or, if a referee has been appointed and evidence has been taken, then with the approval of the referee.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Dismissal of pending disciplinary cases.</i> If resignation is accepted under this rule, such resignation shall serve to dismiss all pending disciplinary cases. The resigned attorney may be readmitted as a member of The Florida Bar in good standing pursuant to rule 3-7.9(a) and (m) and upon full compliance with any conditions required by the judgment which granted the leave to resign. A rejection of such application may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>3-7.12 <i>Placement on inactive list for incapacity not related to misconduct.</i> Whenever an attorney who has not been adjudged incompetent is incapable of practicing law because of physical or mental illness, incapacity, or other infirmity, the attorney may be placed upon an inactive list and shall refrain from the practice of law for such reason even though no misconduct is alleged or proved. Proceedings with a view of placing an attorney on the inactive list under this section shall be processed under the Rules of Discipline in the same manner as proceedings involving acts of misconduct. A member who has been placed on such inactive list may be readmitted upon application to and approval by the board of governors. A rejection of such petition may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>A lawyer who has been adjudicated insane or mentally incompetent or hospitalized under the Florida Mental Health Act shall be placed on an inactive list and shall refrain from the practice of law. If an order of restoration is entered by a court having jurisdiction or the lawyer is discharged from hospitalization under the Florida Mental Health Act, the lawyer may be readmitted upon application to and approval by the board of governors. A rejection of such petition may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>3-7.13 <i>Florida Statutes superseded.</i> These Rules of Discipline shall supersede such parts of sections 454.18, 454.31, and 454.32, Florida Statutes (1977), as are in conflict herewith.</p>\n<p>3-7.14 <i>Amendments.</i> Petitions for revision of or amendments to chapter 3 will be entertained by this Court when presented by the board of governors or by not fewer than fifty (50) active members of The Florida Bar. Notice of intention to file such petition together with a copy of the proposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1021</span> amendment shall be published in The Florida Bar <i>News</i> not less than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such petition. The Court will thereafter accept objections or comments on such petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chapter 4</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PREAMBLE: A Lawyer's Responsibilities</h2>\n<p>A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system, and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.</p>\n<p>As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As an adviser, a lawyer provides a client with an informed understanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As an advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As a negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As an intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks to reconcile their interests as an adviser and, to a limited extent, as a spokesman for each client. A lawyer acts as an evaluator by examining a client's legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.</p>\n<p>In all professional functions a lawyer should be competent, prompt, and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure is required or permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or by law.</p>\n<p>A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's business and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers, and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also a lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.</p>\n<p>As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice, and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law, and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A lawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.</p>\n<p>Many of the lawyer's professional responsibilities are prescribed in the Rules of Professional Conduct and in substantive and procedural law. A lawyer is also guided by personal conscience and the approbation of professional peers. A lawyer should strive to attain the highest level of skill, to improve the law and the legal profession, and to exemplify the legal profession's ideals of public service.</p>\n<p>A lawyer's responsibilities as a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system, and a public citizen are usually harmonious. Zealous advocacy is not inconsistent with justice. Moreover, unless violations of law or injury to another or his property are involved, preserving client confidences ordinarily serves the public interest because people are more likely to seek legal advice, and thereby heed their legal obligations, when they know their communications will be private.</p>\n<p>In the practice of law conflicting responsibilities are often encountered. Difficult ethical problems may arise from a conflict between a lawyer's responsibility to a client and the lawyer's own sense of personal honor, including obligations to society and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1022</span> the legal profession. The Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe terms for resolving such conflicts. Within the framework of these rules many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. Such issues must be resolved through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the rules.</p>\n<p>Lawyers are officers of the court and they are responsible to the judiciary for the propriety of their professional activities. Within that context, the legal profession has been granted powers of self-government. Self-regulation helps maintain the legal profession's independence from undue government domination. An independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse to legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on the executive and legislative branches of government for the right to practice. Supervision by an independent judiciary, and conformity with the rules the judiciary adopts for the profession, assures both independence and responsibility.</p>\n<p>Thus, every lawyer is responsible for observance of the Rules of Professional Conduct. A lawyer should also aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Scope:</i></h2>\n<p>The Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason. They should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law itself. Some of the rules are imperatives, cast in the terms of \"shall\" or \"shall not.\" These define proper conduct for purposes of professional discipline. Others, generally cast in the term \"may,\" are permissive and define areas under the rules in which the lawyer has professional discretion. No disciplinary action should be taken when the lawyer chooses not to act or acts within the bounds of such discretion. Other rules define the nature of relationships between the lawyer and others. The rules are thus partly obligatory and disciplinary and partly constitutive and descriptive in that they define a lawyer's professional role.</p>\n<p>The comment accompanying each rule explains and illustrates the meaning and purpose of the rule. The comments are intended only as guides to interpretation, whereas the text of each rule is authoritative. Thus, comments, even when they use the term \"should,\" do not add obligations to the rules but merely provide guidance for practicing in compliance with the rules.</p>\n<p>The rules presuppose a larger legal context shaping the lawyer's role. That context includes court rules and statutes relating to matters of licensure, laws defining specific obligations of lawyers and substantive and procedural law in general. Compliance with the rules, as with all law in an open society, depends primarily upon understanding and voluntary compliance, secondarily upon reinforcement by peer and public opinion, and finally, when necessary, upon enforcement through disciplinary proceedings. The rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, for purposes of determining the lawyer's authority and responsibility, principles of substantive law external to these rules determine whether a client-lawyer relationship exists. Most of the duties flowing from the client-lawyer relationship attach only after the client has requested the lawyer to render legal services and the lawyer has agrees to do so. But there are some duties, such as that of confidentiality under rule 4-1.6, which may attach when the lawyer agrees to consider whether a client-lawyer relationship shall be established. Whether a client-lawyer relationship exists for any specific purpose can depend on the circumstances and may be a question of fact.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1023</span> Failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a rule is a basis for invoking the disciplinary process. The rules presuppose that disciplinary assessment of a lawyer's conduct will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the conduct in question in recognition of the fact that a lawyer often has to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence of the situation. Moreover, the rules presuppose that whether or not discipline should be imposed for a violation, and the severity of a sanction, depend on all the circumstances, such as the willfulness and seriousness of the violation, extenuating factors, and whether there have been previous violations.</p>\n<p>Violation of a rule should not give rise to a cause of action nor should it create any presumption that a legal duty has been breached. The rules are designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not designed to be a basis for civil liability. Furthermore, the purpose of the rules can be subverted when they are invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons. The fact that a rule is a just basis for a lawyer's self-assessment, or for sanctioning a lawyer under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply that an antagonist in a collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to seek enforcement of the rule. Accordingly, nothing in the rules should be deemed to augment any substantive legal duty of lawyers or the extra-disciplinary consequences of violating such duty.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these rules are not intended to govern or affect judicial application of either the attorney-client or work product privilege. Those privileges were developed to promote compliance with law and fairness in litigation. In reliance on the attorney-client privilege, clients are ordinarily entitled to expect that communications within the scope of the privilege will be protected against compelled disclosure. The attorney-client privilege is that of the client and not of the lawyer. In exceptional situations, the rules might allow or require the lawyer to disclose a client confidence. This, however, does not vitiate the proposition that, as a general matter, the client has a reasonable expectation that information relating to the client will not be voluntarily disclosed and that disclosure of such information may be compelled only in accordance with recognized exceptions to the attorney-client and work product privileges.</p>\n<p>The lawyer's exercise of discretion not to disclose information under rule 4-1.6 should not be subject to reexamination. Permitting such reexamination would be incompatible with the general policy of promoting compliance with law through assurances that communications will be protected against disclosure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Terminology:</i></h2>\n<p>\"Belief\" or \"believes\" denotes that the person involved actually supposed the fact in question to be true. A person's belief may be inferred from circumstances.</p>\n<p>\"Consult\" or \"consultation\" denotes communication of information reasonably sufficient to permit the client to appreciate the significance of the matter in question.</p>\n<p>\"Firm\" or \"law firm\" denotes a lawyer or lawyers in a private firm, lawyers employed in the legal department of a corporation or other organization and lawyers employed in a legal services organization. See comment, rule 4-1.10.</p>\n<p>\"Fraud\" or \"fraudulent\" denotes conduct having a purpose to deceive and not merely negligent misrepresentation or failure to apprise another of relevant information.</p>\n<p>\"Knowingly,\" \"known,\" or \"knows\" denotes actual knowledge of the fact in question. A person's knowledge may be inferred from circumstances.</p>\n<p>\"Lawyer\" denotes a person who is a member of The Florida Bar or otherwise authorized to practice in any court of the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>\"Partner\" denotes a member of a partnership and a shareholder in a law firm organized as a professional corporation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1024</span> \"Reasonable\" or \"reasonably\" when used in relation to conduct by a lawyer denotes the conduct of a reasonably prudent and competent lawyer.</p>\n<p>\"Reasonable belief\" or \"reasonably believes\" when used in reference to a lawyer denotes that the lawyer believes the matter in question and that the circumstances are such that the belief is reasonable.</p>\n<p>\"Reasonably should know\" when used in reference to a lawyer denotes that a lawyer of reasonable prudence and competence would ascertain the matter in question.</p>\n<p>\"Substantial\" when used in reference to degree or extent denotes a material matter of clear and weighty importance.</p>\n<p>4-1 <i>Client-lawyer relationship.</i></p>\n<p>4-1.1 <i>Competence.</i> A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Legal knowledge and skill</i></h2>\n<p>In determining whether a lawyer employs the requisite knowledge and skill in a particular matter, relevant factors include the relative complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer's general experience, the lawyer's training and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give the matter, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer of established competence in the field in question. In many instances the required proficiency is that of a general practitioner. Expertise in a particular field of law may be required in some circumstances.</p>\n<p>A lawyer need not necessarily have special training or prior experience to handle legal problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar. A newly admitted lawyer can be as competent as a practitioner with long experience. Some important legal skills, such as the analysis of precedent, the evaluation of evidence and legal drafting, are required in all legal problems. Perhaps the most fundamental legal skill consists of determining what kind of legal problems a situation may involve, a skill that necessarily transcends any particular specialized knowledge. A lawyer can provide adequate representation in a wholly novel field through necessary study. Competent representation can also be provided through the association of a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.</p>\n<p>In an emergency a lawyer may give advice or assistance in a matter in which the lawyer does not have the skill ordinarily required where referral to or consultation or association with another lawyer would be impractical. Even in an emergency, however, assistance should be limited to that reasonably necessary in the circumstances, for ill-considered action under emergency conditions can jeopardize the client's interest.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may accept representation where the requisite level of competence can be achieved by reasonable preparation. This applies as well to a lawyer who is appointed as counsel for an unrepresented person. See also rule 4-6.2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Thoroughness and preparation</i></h2>\n<p>Competent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem, and use of methods and procedures meeting the standards of competent practitioners. It also includes adequate preparation. The required attention and preparation are determined in part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more elaborate treatment than matters of lesser consequence. The lawyer should consult with the client about the degree of thoroughness and the level of preparation required as well as the estimated costs involved under the circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Maintaining competence</i></h2>\n<p>To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, a lawyer should engage in continuing study and education.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1025</span> 4-1.2 <i>Scope of representation.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, subject to paragraphs (c), (d), and (e), and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer shall abide by a client's decision whether to make or accept an offer of settlement of a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer's representation of a client, including representation by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client's political, economic, social, or moral views or activities.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer may limit the objectives of the representation if the client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is criminal or fraudulent. However, a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning, or application of the law.</p>\n<p>(e) When a lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a client expects assistance not permitted by the rules of professional conduct or by law, the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations on the lawyer's conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Scope of representation</i></h2>\n<p>Both lawyer and client have authority and responsibility in the objectives and means of representation. The client has ultimate authority to determine the purposes to be served by legal representation, within the limits imposed by law and the lawyer's professional obligations. Within those limits, a client also has a right to consult with the lawyer about the means to be used in pursuing those objectives. At the same time, a lawyer is not required to pursue objectives or employ means simply because a client may wish that the lawyer do so. A clear distinction between objectives and means sometimes cannot be drawn, and in many cases the client-lawyer relationship partakes of a joint undertaking. In questions of means, the lawyer should assume responsibility for technical and legal tactical issues but should defer to the client regarding such questions as the expense to be incurred and concern for third persons who might be adversely affected. Law defining the lawyer's scope of authority in litigation varies among jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>In a case in which the client appears to be suffering mental disability, the lawyer's duty to abide by the client's decisions is to be guided by reference to rule 4-1.14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Independence from client's views or activities</i></h2>\n<p>Legal representation should not be denied to people who are unable to afford legal services or whose cause is controversial or the subject of popular disapproval. By the same token representing a client does not constitute approval of the client's views or activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Services limited in objectives or means</i></h2>\n<p>The objectives or scope of services provided by a lawyer may be limited by agreement with the client or by the terms under which the lawyer's services are made available to the client. For example, a retainer may be for a specifically defined purpose. Representation provided through a legal aid agency may be subject to limitations on the types of cases the agency handles. When a lawyer has been retained by an insurer to represent an insured, the representation may be limited to matters related to the insurance coverage. The terms upon which representation is undertaken may exclude specific objectives or means. Such limitations may exclude objectives or means that the lawyer regards as repugnant or imprudent.</p>\n<p>An agreement concerning the scope of representation must accord with the Rules <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1026</span> of Professional Conduct and law. Thus, the client may not be asked to agree to representation so limited in scope as to violate rule 4-1.1 or to surrender the right to terminate the lawyer's services or the right to settle litigation that the lawyer might wish to continue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Criminal, fraudulent, and prohibited transactions</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is required to give an honest opinion about the actual consequences that appear likely to result from a client's conduct. The fact that a client uses advice in a course of action that is criminal or fraudulent does not, of itself, make a lawyer a party to the course of action. However, a lawyer may not assist a client in conduct which the lawyer knows or reasonably should know to be criminal or fraudulent. There is a critical distinction between presenting an analysis of legal aspects of questionable conduct and recommending the means by which a crime or fraud might be committed with impunity.</p>\n<p>When the client's course of action has already begun and is continuing, the lawyer's responsibility is especially delicate. The lawyer is not permitted to reveal the client's wrongdoing, except where permitted or required by rule 4-1.6. However, the lawyer is required to avoid furthering the purpose, for example, by suggesting how it might be concealed. A lawyer may not continue assisting a client in conduct that the lawyer originally supposes is legally proper but then discovers is criminal or fraudulent. Withdrawal from the representation, therefore, may be required.</p>\n<p>Where the client is a fiduciary, the lawyer may be charged with special obligations in dealings with a beneficiary.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (d) applies whether or not the defrauded party is a party to the transaction. Hence, a lawyer should not participate in a sham transaction; for example, a transaction to effectuate criminal or fraudulent escape of tax liability. Paragraph (d) does not preclude undertaking a criminal defense incident to a general retainer for legal services to a lawful enterprise. The last sentence of paragraph (d) recognizes that determining the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation may require a course of action involving disobedience of the statute or regulation or of the interpretation placed upon it by governmental authorities.</p>\n<p>4-1.3 <i>Diligence.</i> A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf of a client despite opposition, obstruction or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and may take whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client's cause or endeavor. A lawyer should act with commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client's behalf. However, a lawyer is not bound to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client. A lawyer has professional discretion in determining the means by which a matter should be pursued. See rule 4-1.2. A lawyer's workload should be controlled so that each matter can be handled adequately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps no professional shortcoming is more widely resented than procrastination. A client's interests often can be adversely affected by the passage of time or the change of conditions; in extreme instances, as when a lawyer overlooks a statute of limitations, the client's legal position may be destroyed. Even when the client's interests are not affected in substance, however, unreasonable delay can cause a client needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the lawyer.</p>\n<p>Unless the relationship is terminated as provided in rule 4-1.16, a lawyer should carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client. If a lawyer's employment is limited to a specific matter, the relationship terminates when the matter has been resolved. If a lawyer has served a client over a substantial period in a variety of matters, the client sometimes may assume that the lawyer will continue to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1027</span> serve on a continuing basis unless the lawyer gives notice of withdrawal. Doubt about whether a client-lawyer relationship still exists should be clarified by the lawyer, preferably in writing, so that the client will not mistakenly suppose the lawyer is looking after the client's affairs when the lawyer has ceased to do so. For example, if a lawyer has handled a judicial or administrative proceeding that produced a result adverse to the client but has not been specifically instructed concerning pursuit of an appeal, the lawyer should advise the client of the possibility of appeal before relinquishing responsibility for the matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4-1.4 <i>Communication.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and the means by which they are to be pursued, to the extent the client is willing and able to do so. For example, a lawyer negotiating on behalf of a client should provide the client with facts relevant to the matter, inform the client of communications from another party and take other reasonable steps that permit the client to make a decision regarding a serious offer from another party. A lawyer who receives from opposing counsel an offer of settlement in a civil controversy or a proffered plea bargain in a criminal case should promptly inform the client of its substance unless prior discussions with the client have left it clear that the proposal will be unacceptable. See rule 4-1.2(a). Even when a client delegates authority to the lawyer, the client should be kept advised of the status of the matter.</p>\n<p>Adequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance involved. For example, in negotiations where there is time to explain a proposal, the lawyer should review all important provisions with the client before proceeding to an agreement. In litigation a lawyer should explain the general strategy and prospects of success and ordinarily should consult the client on tactics that might injure or coerce others. On the other hand, a lawyer ordinarily cannot be expected to describe trial or negotiation strategy in detail. The guiding principle is that the lawyer should fulfill reasonable client expectations for information consistent with the duty to act in the client's best interests and the client's overall requirements as to the character of representation.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, the information to be provided is that appropriate for a client who is a comprehending and responsible adult. However, fully informing the client according to this standard may be impracticable, for example, where the client is a child or suffers from mental disability. See rule 4-1.14. When the client is an organization or group, it is often impossible or inappropriate to inform every one of its members about its legal affairs; ordinarily, the lawyer should address communications to the appropriate officials of the organization. See rule 4-1.13. Where many routine matters are involved, a system of limited or occasional reporting may be arranged with the client. Practical exigency may also require a lawyer to act for a client without prior consultation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Withholding information</i></h2>\n<p>In some circumstances, a lawyer may be justified in delaying transmission of information when the client would be likely to react imprudently to an immediate communication. Thus, a lawyer might withhold a psychiatric diagnosis of a client when the examining psychiatrist indicates that disclosure would harm the client. A lawyer may not withhold information to serve the lawyer's own interest or convenience. Rules or court orders governing litigation may provide that information supplied to a lawyer may not be disclosed to the client. Rule 4-3.4(c) directs compliance with such rules or orders.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1028</span> 4-1.5 <i>Fees.</i></p>\n<p>(A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.</p>\n<p>(B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee. Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>\n<p>(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>\n<p>(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</p>\n<p>(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>\n<p>(4) The amount involved and the results obtained;</p>\n<p>(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>\n<p>(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</p>\n<p>(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</p>\n<p>(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>\n<p>(C) When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.</p>\n<p>(D) As to contingent fees:</p>\n<p>(1) A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by paragraph (D)(3) or by law. A contingent fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial, or appeal, litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery, and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.</p>\n<p>(2) Every lawyer who accepts a retainer or enters into an agreement, express or implied, for compensation for services rendered or to be rendered in any action, claim, or proceeding whereby the lawyer's compensation is to be dependent or contingent in whole or in part upon the successful prosecution or settlement thereof shall do so only where such fee arrangement is reduced to a written contract, signed by the client, and by a lawyer for the lawyer or for the law firm representing the client. No lawyer or firm may participate in the fee without the consent of the client in writing. Each participating lawyer or law firm shall sign the contract with the client and shall agree to assume joint responsibility for the representation. The client shall be furnished with a copy of the signed contract and any subsequent notices or consents. All provisions of this rule shall apply to such fee contracts.</p>\n<p>(3) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>\n<p>(a) Any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof; or</p>\n<p>(b) A contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.</p>\n<p>(4) A lawyer who enters into an arrangement for, charges, or collects any fee in an action or claim for personal injury or for property damages or for death or loss of services resulting from personal injuries based upon tortious conduct of another, including products liability claims, whereby the compensation is to be dependent or contingent in whole or in part upon the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1029</span> successful prosecution or settlement thereof shall do so only under the following requirements:</p>\n<p>(a) The contract shall contain the following provisions:</p>\n<p>1. \"The undersigned client has, before signing this contract, received and read the statement of client's rights and understands each of the rights set forth therein. The undersigned client has signed the statement and received a signed copy to refer to while being represented by the undersigned attorney(s).\"</p>\n<p>2. \"This contract may be cancelled by written notification to the attorney at any time within three (3) business days of the date the contract was signed, as shown below, and if cancelled the client shall not be obligated to pay any fees to the attorney(s) for the work performed during that time. If the attorney(s) have advanced funds to others in representation of the client, the attorney(s) are entitled to be reimbursed for such amounts as they have reasonably advanced on behalf of the client.\"</p>\n<p>(b) The contract for representation of a client in a matter set forth in paragraph (D)(4) may provide for a contingent fee arrangement as agreed upon by the client and the lawyer, except as limited by the following provisions:</p>\n<p>1. Without prior court approval as specified below, any contingent fee which exceeds the following standards shall be presumed, unless rebutted, to be clearly excessive:</p>\n<p>a. 33-1/3% of any recovery up to $1 million through the time of filing of an answer or the demand for appointment of arbitrators;</p>\n<p>b. 40% of any recovery up to $1 million through the trial of the case;</p>\n<p>c. 30% of any recovery between $1 and $2 million;</p>\n<p>d. 20% of any recovery in excess of $2 million;</p>\n<p>e. If all defendants admit liability at the time of filing their answers and request a trial only on damages:</p>\n<p>(i) 33-1/3% of any recovery up to $1 million through trial;</p>\n<p>(ii) 20% of any recovery from that defendant between $1 and $2 million;</p>\n<p>(iii) 15% of any recovery from that defendant in excess of $2 million;</p>\n<p>f. An additional 5% of any recovery after notice of appeal is filed or post-judgment relief or action is required for recovery on the judgment.</p>\n<p>2. If any client is unable to obtain an attorney of the client's choice because of the limitations set forth in (D)(4)(b)1, the client may petition the circuit court for approval of any fee contract between the client and an attorney of the client's choosing. Such authorization shall be given if the court determines the client has a complete understanding of his or her rights and the terms of the proposed contract. The application for authorization of such a contract can be filed as a separate proceeding before suit or simultaneously with the filing of a complaint. Proceedings thereon may occur before service on the defendant and this aspect of the file may be sealed. Authorization of such a contract shall not bar subsequent inquiry as to whether the fee actually claimed or charged is clearly excessive under paragraphs (A) and (B).</p>\n<p>3. In cases where the client is to receive a recovery which will be paid to the client on a future structured or periodic basis, the contingent fee percentage shall only be calculated on the cost of the structured verdict or settlement or, if the cost is unknown, on the present money value of the structured verdict or settlement, whichever is less. If the damages and the fee are to be paid out over the long term future schedule, then this limitation does not apply. No attorney may separately negotiate with the defendant for that attorney's fees in a structured verdict or settlement where such separate negotiations would place the attorney in a position of conflict.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1030</span> (c) Before a lawyer enters into a contingent fee contract for representation of a client in a matter set forth in this rule, the lawyer shall provide the client with a copy of the statement of client's rights and shall afford the client with a full and complete opportunity to understand each of the rights as set forth therein. A copy of the statement, signed by both the client and the lawyer, shall be given to the client to retain and the lawyer shall keep a copy in the client's file. The statement shall be retained by the lawyer with the written fee contract and closing statement under the same conditions and requirements as paragraph (D)(5).</p>\n<p>(5) In the event there is a recovery, upon the conclusion of the representation, the lawyer shall prepare a closing statement reflecting an itemization of all costs and expenses, together with the amount of fee received by each participating lawyer or law firm. The closing statement shall be executed by all participating lawyers, as well as the client, and each shall receive a copy. Each participating lawyer shall retain a copy of the written fee contract and closing statement for six (6) years after execution of the closing statement. Any contingent fee contract and closing statement shall be available for inspection at reasonable times by the client, by any other person upon judicial order, or by the appropriate disciplinary agency.</p>\n<p>(E) A division of fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if:</p>\n<p>(1) The division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, by written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation;</p>\n<p>(2) The client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers involved; and</p>\n<p>(3) The total fee is reasonable.</p>\n<p>(F) Charges made by any lawyer or law firm under an approved credit plan shall be only for services actually rendered or cash actually paid on behalf of the client. No higher fee shall be charged and no additional charge shall be imposed by reason of a lawyer's or law firm's participation in an approved credit plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STATEMENT OF CLIENT'S RIGHTS</h2>\n<p>Before you, the prospective client, arrange a contingent fee agreement with a lawyer, you should understand this statement of your rights as a client. This statement is not a part of the actual contract between you and your lawyer, but, as a prospective client, you should be aware of these rights:</p>\n<p>1. There is no legal requirement that a lawyer charge a client a set fee or a percentage of money recovered in a case. You, the client, have the right to talk with your lawyer about the proposed fee and to bargain about the rate or percentage as in any other contract. If you do not reach an agreement with one lawyer you may talk with other lawyers.</p>\n<p>2. Any contingent fee contract must be in writing and you have three (3) business days to reconsider the contract. You may cancel the contract without any reason if you notify your lawyer in writing within three (3) business days of signing the contract. If you withdraw from the contract within the first three (3) business days, you do not owe the lawyer a fee although you may be responsible for the lawyer's actual costs during that time. If your lawyer begins to represent you, your lawyer may not withdraw from the case without giving you notice, delivering necessary papers to you, and allowing you time to employ another lawyer. Often, your lawyer must obtain court approval before withdrawing from a case. If you discharge your lawyer without good cause after the three-day period, you may have to pay a fee for work the lawyer has done.</p>\n<p>3. Before hiring a lawyer, you, the client, have the right to know about the lawyer's education, training, and experience. If you ask, the lawyer should tell you specifically about his or her actual experience dealing with cases similar to yours. If you ask, the lawyer should provide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1031</span> information about special training or knowledge and give you this information in writing if you request it.</p>\n<p>4. Before signing a contingent fee contract with you, a lawyer must advise you whether he or she intends to handle your case alone or whether other lawyers will be helping with the case. If your lawyer intends to refer the case to other lawyers he or she should tell you what kind of fee sharing arrangement will be made with the other lawyers. If lawyers from different law firms will represent you, at least one lawyer from each law firm must sign the contingent fee contract.</p>\n<p>5. If your lawyer intends to refer your case to another lawyer or counsel with other lawyers, your lawyer should tell you about that at the beginning. If your lawyer takes the case and later decides to refer it to another lawyer or to associate with other lawyers, you should sign a new contract which includes the new lawyers. You, the client, also have the right to consult with each lawyer working on your case and each lawyer is legally responsible to represent your interests and is legally responsible for the acts of the other lawyers involved in the case.</p>\n<p>6. You, the client, have the right to know in advance how you will need to pay the expenses and the legal fees at the end of the case. If you pay a deposit in advance for costs, you may ask reasonable questions about how the money will be or has been spent and how much of it remains unspent. Your lawyer should give a reasonable estimate about future necessary costs. If your lawyer agrees to lend or advance you money to prepare or research the case, you have the right to know periodically how much money your lawyer has spent on your behalf. You also have the right to decide, after consulting with your lawyer, how much money is to be spent to prepare a case. If you pay the expenses, you have the right to decide how much to spend. Your lawyer should also inform you whether the fee will be based on the gross amount recovered or on the amount recovered minus the costs.</p>\n<p>7. You, the client, have the right to be told by your lawyer about possible adverse consequences if you lose the case. Those adverse consequences might include money which you might have to pay to your lawyer for costs and liability you might have for attorney's fees to the other side.</p>\n<p>8. You, the client, have the right to receive and approve a closing statement at the end of the case before you pay any money. The statement must list all of the financial details of the entire case, including the amount recovered, all expenses, and a precise statement of your lawyer's fee. Until you approve the closing statement you need not pay any money to anyone, including your lawyer. You also have the right to have every lawyer or law firm working on your case sign this closing statement.</p>\n<p>9. You, the client, have the right to ask your lawyer at reasonable intervals how the case is progressing and to have these questions answered to the best of your lawyer's ability.</p>\n<p>10. You, the client, have the right to make the final decision regarding settlement of a case. Your lawyer must notify you of all offers of settlement before and after the trial. Offers during the trial must be immediately communicated and you should consult with your lawyer regarding whether to accept a settlement. However, you must make the final decision to accept or reject a settlement.</p>\n<p>11. If at any time, you, the client, believe that your lawyer has charged an excessive or illegal fee, you, the client, have the right to report the matter to The Florida Bar, the agency that oversees the practice and behavior of all lawyers in Florida. For information on how to reach The Florida Bar, call XXX-XXX-XXXX, or contact the local bar association. Any disagreement between you and your lawyer about a fee can be taken to court and you may wish to hire another lawyer to help you resolve this disagreement. Usually fee disputes must be handled in a separate lawsuit.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1032</span>\n____________________  ______________________\n  Client Signature      Attorney Signature\n____________________  ______________________\n  Date                  Date\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Basis or rate of fee</i></h2>\n<p>When the lawyer has regularly represented a client, they ordinarily will have evolved an understanding concerning the basis or rate of the fee. In a new client-lawyer relationship, however, an understanding as to the fee should be promptly established. It is not necessary to recite all the factors that underlie the basis of the fee, but only those that are directly involved in its computation. It is sufficient, for example, to state the basic rate is an hourly charge or a fixed amount or an estimated amount, or to identify the factors that may be taken into account in finally fixing the fee. When developments occur during the representation that render an earlier estimate substantially inaccurate, a revised estimate should be provided to the client. A written statement concerning the fee reduces the possibility of misunderstanding. Furnishing the client with a simple memorandum or a copy of the lawyer's customary fee schedule is sufficient if the basis or rate of the fee is set forth.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.8(e) should be consulted regarding a lawyer's providing financial assistance to a client in connection with litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Terms of payment</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer may require advance payment of a fee, but is obliged to return any unearned portion. See rule 4-1.16(d). A lawyer is not, however, required to return retainers which, pursuant to an agreement with a client, are not refundable. A lawyer may accept property in payment for services, such as an ownership interest in an enterprise, providing this does not involve acquisition of a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of the litigation contrary to rule 4-1.8(i). However, a fee paid in property instead of money may be subject to special scrutiny because it involves questions concerning both the value of the services and the lawyer's special knowledge of the value of the property.</p>\n<p>An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest. For example, a lawyer should not enter into an agreement whereby services are to be provided only up to a stated amount when it is foreseeable that more extensive services probably will be required, unless the situation is adequately explained to the client. Otherwise, the client might have to bargain for further assistance in the midst of a proceeding or transaction. However, it is proper to define the extent of services in light of the client's ability to pay. A lawyer should not exploit a fee arrangement based primarily on hourly charges by using wasteful procedures. When there is doubt whether a contingent fee is consistent with the client's best interest, the lawyer should offer the client alternative bases for the fee and explain their implications. Applicable law may impose limitations on contingent fees, such as a ceiling on the percentage.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(3) does not apply to lawyers seeking to obtain or enforce judgments for arrearages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Contingent fee regulation</i></h2>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4) should not be construed to apply to actions or claims seeking property or other damages arising in the commercial litigation context.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) is intended to apply only to contingent aspects of fee agreements. In the situation where a lawyer and client enter a contract for part noncontingent and part contingent attorney's fees, rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) should not be construed to apply to and prohibit or limit the noncontingent portion of the fee agreement. An attorney could properly charge and retain the noncontingent portion of the fee even if the matter was not successfully prosecuted or if the noncontingent portion of the fee exceeded the schedule set forth in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b). Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) should, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1033</span> however, be construed to apply to any additional contingent portion of such a contract when considered together with earned noncontingent fees. Thus, under such a contract a lawyer may demand or collect only such additional contingent fees as would not cause the total fees to exceed the schedule set forth in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b).</p>\n<p>The limitations in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b)1.d. are only to be applied in the case where all the defendants admit liability at the time they file their initial answer and the trial is only on the issue of the amount or extent of the loss or the extent of injury suffered by the client. If the trial involves not only the issue of damages but such questions as proximate cause, affirmative defenses, seat belt defense, or other similar matters, the limitations are not to be applied because of the contingent nature of the case being left for resolution by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b)2. provides the limitations set forth in paragraph (D)(4)(b)1. may be waived by the client upon approval by a circuit court judge. This waiver provision may not be used to authorize a lawyer to charge a client a fee which would exceed rule 4-1.5(A) or (B). It is contemplated that this waiver provision will not be necessary except where the client wants to retain a particular lawyer to represent him or her or the case involves complex, difficult, or novel questions of law or fact which would justify a contingent fee greater than the schedule but not a contingent fee which would exceed rule 4-1.5(B).</p>\n<p>Upon a petition by a client, the trial court reviewing the waiver request must grant that request if the trial court finds the client: (a) understands his or her right to have the limitations in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) applied in the specific matter; and (b) understands and approves the terms of the proposed contract. The consideration by the trial court of the waiver petition is not to be used as an opportunity for the court to inquire into the merits or details of the particular action or claim which is the subject of the contract.</p>\n<p>The proceedings before the trial court and the trial court's decision on a waiver request are to be confidential and not subject to discovery by any of the parties to the action or by any other individual or entity except The Florida Bar. However, terms of the contract approved by the trial court may be subject to discovery if the contract (without court approval) was subject to discovery under applicable case law or rules of evidence.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b)3. prohibits a lawyer from charging the contingent fee percentage on the total, future value of a recovery being paid on a structured or periodic basis. This prohibition does not apply if the lawyer's fee is being paid over the same length of time as the schedule of payments to the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Division of fee</i></h2>\n<p>A division of fee is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers who are not in the same firm. A division of fee facilitates association of more than one lawyer in a matter in which neither alone could serve the client as well, and most often is used when the fee is contingent and the division is between a referring lawyer and a trial specialist. Paragraph (E) permits the lawyers to divide a fee on either the basis of the proportion of services they render or by agreement between the participating lawyers if all assume responsibility for the representation as a whole and the client is advised and does not object. It does require disclosure to the client of the share that each lawyer is to receive. Joint responsibility for the representation entails the obligations stated in rule 4-5.1 for purposes of the matter involved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disputes over fees</i></h2>\n<p>If a procedure has been established for resolution of fee disputes, such as an arbitration or mediation procedure established by the bar, the lawyer should conscientiously consider submitting to it. Law may prescribe a procedure for determining a lawyer's fee, for example, in representation of an executor or administrator, a class, or a person entitled to a reasonable fee as part of the measure of damages. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1034</span> The lawyer entitled to such a fee and a lawyer representing another party concerned with the fee should comply with the prescribed procedure.</p>\n<p>4-1.6 <i>Confidentiality of information.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client except as stated in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) unless the client consents after disclosure to the client.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall reveal such information to the extent the lawyer believes necessary:</p>\n<p>(1) To prevent a client from committing a crime; or</p>\n<p>(2) To prevent a death or substantial bodily harm to another.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer believes necessary:</p>\n<p>(1) To serve the client's interest unless it is information the client specifically requires not to be disclosed;</p>\n<p>(2) To establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and client;</p>\n<p>(3) To establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved;</p>\n<p>(4) To respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client; or</p>\n<p>(5) To comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p>(d) When required by a tribunal to reveal such information, a lawyer may first exhaust all appellate remedies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The lawyer is part of a judicial system charged with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their rights.</p>\n<p>The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people to seek early legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's confidences must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.</p>\n<p>A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.</p>\n<p>The principle of confidentiality is given effect in two related bodies of law, the attorney-client privilege (which includes the work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The attorney-client privilege applies in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality rule applies not merely to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the Rules of Professional Conduct or by law. However, none of the foregoing limits the requirement of disclosure in paragraph (b). This disclosure is required to prevent a lawyer from becoming an unwitting accomplice in the fraudulent acts of a client. See also Scope.</p>\n<p>The requirement of maintaining confidentiality of information relating to representation applies to government lawyers who may disagree with the policy goals <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1035</span> that their representation is designed to advance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Authorized disclosure</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the representation, except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that authority. In litigation, for example, a lawyer may disclose information by admitting a fact that cannot properly be disputed or in negotiation by making a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion.</p>\n<p>Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm's practice, disclose to each other information relating to a client of the firm, unless the client has instructed that particular information be confined to specified lawyers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disclosure adverse to client</i></h2>\n<p>The confidentiality rule is subject to limited exceptions. In becoming privy to information about a client, a lawyer may foresee that the client intends serious harm to another person. However, to the extent a lawyer is required or permitted to disclose a client's purposes, the client will be inhibited from revealing facts which would enable the lawyer to counsel against a wrongful course of action. While the public may be protected if full and open communication by the client is encouraged, several situations must be distinguished.</p>\n<p>First, the lawyer may not counsel of assist a client in conduct that is criminal or fraudulent. See rule 4-1.2(d). Similarly, a lawyer has a duty under rule 4-3.3(a)(4) not to use false evidence. This duty is essentially a special instance of the duty prescribed in rule 4-1.2(d) to avoid assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p>Second, the lawyer may have been innocently involved in past conduct by the client that was criminal or fraudulent. In such a situation the lawyer has not violated rule 4-1.2(d), because to \"counsel or assist\" criminal or fraudulent conduct requires knowing that the conduct is of that character.</p>\n<p>Third, the lawyer may learn that a client intends prospective conduct that is criminal. As stated in paragraph (b)(1), the lawyer shall reveal information in order to prevent such consequences. It is admittedly difficult for a lawyer to \"know\" when the criminal intent will actually be carried out, for the client may have a change of mind.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b)(2) contemplates past acts on the part of a client which may result in present or future consequences that may be avoided by disclosure of otherwise confidential communications. Rule 4-1.6(b)(2) would now require the attorney to disclose information necessary to prevent the future death or substantial bodily harm to another, even though the act of the client has been completed.</p>\n<p>The lawyer's exercise of discretion requires consideration of such factors as the nature of the lawyer's relationship with the client and with those who might be injured by the client, the lawyer's own involvement in the transaction and factors that may extenuate the conduct in question. Where practical the lawyer should seek to persuade the client to take suitable action. In any case, a disclosure adverse to the client's interest should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to the purpose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>If the lawyer's services will be used by the client in materially furthering a course of criminal or fraudulent conduct, the lawyer must withdraw, as stated in rule 4-1.16(a)(1).</p>\n<p>After withdrawal the lawyer is required to refrain from making disclosure of the client's confidences, except as otherwise provided in rule 4-1.6. Neither this rule nor rule 4-1.8(b) nor rule 4-1.16(d) prevents the lawyer from giving notice of the fact of withdrawal, and the lawyer may also withdraw or disaffirm any opinion, document, affirmation, or the like.</p>\n<p>Where the client is an organization, the lawyer may be in doubt whether contemplated conduct will actually be carried out by the organization. Where necessary to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1036</span> guide conduct in connection with the rule, the lawyer may make inquiry within the organization as indicated in rule 4-1.13(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Dispute concerning lawyer's conduct</i></h2>\n<p>Where a legal claim or disciplinary charge alleges complicity of the lawyer in a client's conduct or other misconduct of the lawyer involving representation of the client, the lawyer may respond to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to establish a defense. The same is true with respect to a claim involving the conduct or representation of a former client. The lawyer's right to respond arises when an assertion of such complicity has been made. Paragraph (c) does not require the lawyer to await the commencement of an action or proceeding that charges such complicity, so that the defense may be established by responding directly to a third party who has made such an assertion. The right to defend, of course, applies where a proceeding has been commenced. Where practicable and not prejudicial to the lawyer's ability to establish the defense, the lawyer should advise the client of the third party's assertion and request that the client respond appropriately. In any event, disclosure should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes is necessary to vindicate innocence, the disclosure should be made in a manner which limits access to the information to the tribunal or other persons having a need to know it, and appropriate protective orders or other arrangements should be sought by the lawyer to the fullest extent practicable.</p>\n<p>If the lawyer is charged with wrongdoing in which the client's conduct is implicated, the rule of confidentiality should not prevent the lawyer from defending against the charge. Such a charge can arise in a civil, criminal or professional disciplinary proceeding and can be based on a wrong allegedly committed by the lawyer against the client or on a wrong alleged by a third person; for example, a person claiming to have been defrauded by the lawyer and client acting together. A lawyer entitled to a fee is permitted by paragraph (c) to prove the services rendered in an action to collect it. This aspect of the rule expresses the principle that the beneficiary of a fiduciary relationship may not exploit it to the detriment of the fiduciary. As stated above, the lawyer must make every effort practicable to avoid unnecessary disclosure of information relating to a representation, to limit disclosure to those having the need to know it, and to obtain protective orders or make other arrangements minimizing the risk of disclosure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disclosures otherwise required or authorized</i></h2>\n<p>The attorney-client privilege is differently defined in various jurisdictions. If a lawyer is called as a witness to give testimony concerning a client, absent waiver by the client, rule 4-1.6(a) requires the lawyer to invoke the privilege when it is applicable. The lawyer must comply with the final orders of a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction requiring the lawyer to give information about the client.</p>\n<p>The Rules of Professional Conduct in various circumstances permit or require a lawyer to disclose information relating to the representation. See rules 4-2.2, 4-2.3, 4-3.3, and 4-4.1. In addition to these provisions, a lawyer may be obligated or permitted by other provisions of law to give information about a client. Whether another provision of law supersedes rule 4-1.6 is a matter of interpretation beyond the scope of these rules, but a presumption should exist against such a supersession.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Former client</i></h2>\n<p>The duty of confidentiality continues after the client-lawyer relationship has terminated.</p>\n<p>4-1.7 <i>Conflict of interest; general rule.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to the interests of another client, unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the lawyer's responsibilities to and relationship with the other client; and</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1037</span> (2) Each client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the lawyer's exercise of independent professional judgment in the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person or by the lawyer's own interest, unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</p>\n<p>(2) The client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(c) When representation of multiple clients in a single matter is undertaken, the consultation shall include explanation of the implications of the common representation and the advantages and risks involved.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer related to another lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse shall not represent a client in a representation directly adverse to a person who the lawyer knows is represented by the other lawyer except upon consent by the client after consultation regarding the relationship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Loyalty to a client</i></h2>\n<p>Loyalty is an essential element in the lawyer's relationship to a client. An impermissible conflict of interest may exist before representation is undertaken, in which event the representation should be declined. If such a conflict arises after representation has been undertaken, the lawyer should withdraw from the representation. See rule 4-1.16. Where more than one client is involved and the lawyer withdraws because a conflict arises after representation, whether the lawyer may continue to represent any of the clients is determined by rule 4-1.9. See also rule 4-2.2(c). As to whether a client-lawyer relationship exists or, having once been established, is continuing, see comment to rule 4-1.3 and scope.</p>\n<p>As a general proposition, loyalty to a client prohibits undertaking representation directly adverse to that client or another client's interests without the affected client's consent. Paragraph (a) expresses that general rule. Thus, a lawyer ordinarily may not act as advocate against a person the lawyer represents in some other matter, even if it is wholly unrelated. On the other hand, simultaneous representation in unrelated matters of clients whose interests are only generally adverse, such as competing economic enterprises, does not require consent of the respective clients. Paragraph (a) applies only when the representation of one client would be directly adverse to the other and where the lawyer's responsibilities of loyalty and confidentiality of the other client might be compromised.</p>\n<p>Loyalty to a client is also impaired when a lawyer cannot consider, recommend, or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of the lawyer's other responsibilities or interests. The conflict in effect forecloses alternatives that would otherwise be available to the client. Paragraph (b) addresses such situations. A possible conflict does not itself preclude the representation. The critical questions are the likelihood that a conflict will eventuate and, if it does, whether it will materially interfere with the lawyer's independent professional judgment in considering alternatives or foreclose courses of action that reasonably should be pursued on behalf of the client. Consideration should be given to whether the client wishes to accommodate the other interest involved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consultation and consent</i></h2>\n<p>A client may consent to representation notwithstanding a conflict. However, as indicated in paragraph (a)(1) with respect to representation directly adverse to a client and paragraph (b)(1) with respect to material limitations on representation of a client, when a disinterested lawyer would conclude that the client should not agree to the representation under the circumstances, the lawyer involved cannot properly ask for such agreement or provide representation on the basis of the client's consent. When more than one client is involved, the question of conflict must be resolved as to each <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1038</span> client. Moreover, there may be circumstances where it is impossible to make the disclosure necessary to obtain consent. For example, when the lawyer represents different clients in related matters and one of the clients refuses to consent to the disclosure necessary to permit the other client to make an informed decision, the lawyer cannot properly ask the latter to consent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Lawyer's interests</i></h2>\n<p>The lawyer's own interests should not be permitted to have adverse effect on representation of a client. For example, a lawyer's need for income should not lead the lawyer to undertake matters that cannot be handled competently and at a reasonable fee. See rules 4-1.1 and 4-1.5. If the probity of a lawyer's own conduct in a transaction is in serious question, it may be difficult or impossible for the lawyer to give a client detached advice. A lawyer may not allow related business interests to affect representation, for example, by referring clients to an enterprise in which the lawyer has an undisclosed interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conflicts in litigation</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (a) prohibits representation of opposing parties in litigation. Simultaneous representation of parties whose interests in litigation may conflict, such as co-plaintiffs or co-defendants, is governed by paragraphs (b) and (c). An impermissible conflict may exist by reason of substantial discrepancy in the parties' testimony, incompatibility in positions in relation to an opposing party or the fact that there are substantially different possibilities of settlement of the claims or liabilities in question. Such conflicts can arise in criminal cases as well as civil. The potential for conflict of interest in representing multiple defendants in a criminal case is so grave that ordinarily a lawyer should decline to represent more than one co-defendant. On the other hand, common representation of persons having similar interests is proper if the risk of adverse effect is minimal and the requirements of paragraph (b) are met. Compare rule 4-2.2 involving intermediation between clients.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, a lawyer may not act as advocate against a client the lawyer represents in some other matter, even if the other matter is wholly unrelated. However, there are circumstances in which a lawyer may act as advocate against a client. For example, a lawyer representing an enterprise with diverse operations may accept employment as an advocate against the enterprise in an unrelated matter if doing so will not adversely affect the lawyer's relationship with the enterprise or conduct of the suit and if both clients consent upon consultation. By the same token, government lawyers in some circumstances may represent government employees in proceedings in which a government agency is the opposing party. The propriety of concurrent representation can depend on the nature of the litigation. For example, a suit charging fraud entails conflict to a degree not involved in a suit for a declaratory judgment concerning statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may represent parties having antagonistic positions on a legal question that has arisen in different cases, unless representation of either client would be adversely affected. Thus, it is ordinarily not improper to assert such positions in cases pending in different trial courts, but it may be improper to do so in cases pending at the same time in an appellate court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Interest of person paying for a lawyer's service</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer may be paid from a source other than the client, if the client is informed of that fact and consents and the arrangement does not compromise the lawyer's duty of loyalty to the client. See rule 4-1.8(f). For example, when an insurer and its insured have conflicting interests in a matter arising from a liability insurance agreement and the insurer is required to provide special counsel for the insured, the arrangement should assure the special counsel's professional independence. So also, when a corporation and its directors or employees are involved in a controversy in which they have conflicting interests, the corporation may provide funds for separate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1039</span> legal representation of the directors of employees, if the clients consent after consultation and the arrangement ensures the lawyer's professional independence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Other conflict situations</i></h2>\n<p>Conflicts of interest in contexts other than litigation sometimes may be difficult to assess. Relevant factors in determining whether there is potential for adverse effect include the duration and intimacy of the lawyer's relationship with the client or clients involved, the functions being performed by the lawyer, the likelihood that actual conflict will arise and the likely prejudice to the client from the conflict if it does arise. The question is often one of proximity and degree.</p>\n<p>For example, a lawyer may not represent multiple parties to a negotiation whose interests are fundamentally antagonistic to each other, but common representation is permissible where the clients are generally aligned in interest even though there is some difference of interest among them.</p>\n<p>Conflict questions may also arise in estate planning and estate administration. A lawyer may be called upon to prepare wills for several family members, such as husband and wife, and, depending upon the circumstances, a conflict of interest may arise. In estate administration the identity of the client may be unclear under the law of some jurisdictions. In Florida, the personal representative is the client rather than the estate or the beneficiaries. The lawyer should make clear the relationship to the parties involved.</p>\n<p>A lawyer for a corporation or other organization who is also a member of its board of directors should determine whether the responsibilities of the two roles may conflict. The lawyer may be called on to advise the corporation in matters involving actions of the directors. Consideration should be given to the frequency with which such situations may arise, the potential intensity of the conflict, the effect of the lawyer's resignation from the board and the possibility of the corporation's obtaining legal advice from another lawyer in such situations. If there is material risk that the dual role will compromise the lawyer's independence of professional judgment, the lawyer should not serve as a director.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conflict charged by an opposing party</i></h2>\n<p>Resolving questions of conflict of interest is primarily the responsibility of the lawyer undertaking the representation. In litigation, a court may raise the question when there is reason to infer that the lawyer has neglected the responsibility. In a criminal case, inquiry by the court is generally required when a lawyer represents multiple defendants. Where the conflict is such as clearly to call in question the fair or efficient administration of justice, opposing counsel may properly raise the question. Such an objection should be viewed with caution, however, for it can be misused as a technique of harassment. See scope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Family relationships between lawyers</i></h2>\n<p>Rule 4-1.7(d) applies to related lawyers who are in different firms. Related lawyers in the same firm are also governed by rules 4-1.9 and 4-1.10. The disqualification stated in rule 4-1.7(d) is personal and is not imputed to members of firms with whom the lawyers are associated.</p>\n<p>4-1.8 <i>Conflict of interest; prohibited transactions.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client, except a lien granted by law to secure a lawyer's fee or expenses, unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client;</p>\n<p>(2) The client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction; and</p>\n<p>(3) The client consents in writing thereto.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not use information relating to representation of a client to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1040</span> disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultation, except as permitted or required by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee.</p>\n<p>(d) Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.</p>\n<p>(e) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:</p>\n<p>(1) A lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter; and</p>\n<p>(2) A lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of the client.</p>\n<p>(f) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The client consents after consultation;</p>\n<p>(2) There is no interference with the lawyer's independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and</p>\n<p>(3) Information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>(g) A lawyer who represents two (2) or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients, or in a criminal case an aggregated agreement as to guilty or nolo contendere pleas, unless each client consents after consultation, including disclosure of the existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.</p>\n<p>(h) A lawyer shall not make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a client for malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in making the agreement. A lawyer shall not settle a claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client without first advising that person in writing that independent representation is appropriate in connection therewith.</p>\n<p>(i) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:</p>\n<p>(1) Acquire a lien granted by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses; and</p>\n<p>(2) Contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Transactions between client and lawyer</i></h2>\n<p>As a general principle, all transactions between client and lawyer should be fair and reasonable to the client. In such transactions a review by independent counsel on behalf of the client is often advisable. Furthermore, a lawyer may not exploit information relating to the representation to the client's disadvantage. For example, a lawyer who has learned that the client is investing in specific real estate may not, without the client's consent, seek to acquire nearby property where doing so would adversely affect the client's plan for investment. Paragraph (a) does not, however, apply to standard commercial transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally markets to others, for example, banking or brokerage services, medical services, products manufactured or distributed by the client, and utilities services. In such transactions the lawyer has no advantage in dealing with the client, and the restrictions in paragraph (a) are unnecessary and impracticable. Likewise, paragraph (a) does not prohibit a lawyer from acquiring or asserting a lien granted by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1041</span> A lawyer may accept a gift from a client, if the transaction meets general standards of fairness. For example, a simple gift such as a present given at a holiday or as a token of appreciation is permitted. If effectuation of a substantial gift requires preparing a legal instrument such as a will or conveyance, however, the client should have the detached advice that another lawyer can provide. Paragraph (c) recognizes an exception where the client is a relative of the donee or the gift is not substantial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Literary rights</i></h2>\n<p>An agreement by which a lawyer acquires literary or media rights concerning the conduct of the representation creates a conflict between the interests of the client and the personal interests of the lawyer. Measures suitable in the representation of the client may detract from the publication value of an account of the representation. Paragraph (d) does not prohibit a lawyer representing a client in a transaction concerning literary property from agreeing that the lawyer's fee shall consist of a share in ownership in the property if the arrangement conforms to rule 4-1.5 and paragraph (i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Person paying for lawyer's services</i></h2>\n<p>Rule 4-1.8(f) requires disclosure of the fact that the lawyer's services are being paid for by a third party. Such an arrangement must also conform to the requirements of rule 4-1.6 concerning confidentiality and rule 4-1.7 concerning conflict of interest. Where the client is a class, consent may be obtained on behalf of the class by court-supervised procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Acquisition of interest in litigation</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (i) states the traditional general rule that lawyers are prohibited from acquiring a proprietary interest in litigation. This general rule, which has its basis in common law champerty and maintenance, is subject to specific exceptions developed in decisional law and continued in these rules, such as the exception for reasonable contingent fees set forth in rule 4-1.5 and the exception for certain advances of the costs of litigation set forth in paragraph (e).</p>\n<p>This rule is not intended to apply to customary qualification and limitations in legal opinions and memoranda.</p>\n<p>4-1.9 <i>Conflict of interest; former client.</i> A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:</p>\n<p>(a) Represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents after consultation; or</p>\n<p>(b) Use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as rule 4-1.6 would permit with respect to a client or when the information has become generally known.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>After termination of a client-lawyer relationship, a lawyer may not represent another client except in conformity with this rule. The principles in rule 4-1.7 determine whether the interests of the present and former client are adverse. Thus, a lawyer could not properly seek to rescind on behalf of a new client a contract drafted on behalf of the former client. So also a lawyer who has prosecuted an accused person could not properly represent the accused in a subsequent civil action against the government concerning the same transaction.</p>\n<p>The scope of a \"matter\" for purposes of rule 4-1.9(a) may depend on the facts of a particular situation or transaction. The lawyer's involvement in a matter can also be a question of degree. When a lawyer has been directly involved in a specific transaction, subsequent representation of other clients with materially adverse interests clearly is prohibited. On the other hand, a lawyer who recurrently handled a type of problem for a former client is not precluded from later representing another client in a wholly distinct problem of that type even though the subsequent representation involves a position adverse to the prior client. Similar considerations can apply to the reassignment of military lawyers between defense and prosecution functions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1042</span> within the same military jurisdiction. The underlying question is whether the lawyer was so involved in the matter that the subsequent representation can be justly regarded as a changing of sides in the matter in question.</p>\n<p>Information acquired by the lawyer in the course of representing a client may not subsequently be used by the lawyer to the disadvantage of the client. However, the fact that a lawyer has once served a client does not preclude the lawyer from using generally known information about that client when later representing another client.</p>\n<p>Disqualification from subsequent representation is for the protection of clients and can be waived by them. A waiver is effective only if there is disclosure of the circumstances, including the lawyer's intended role in behalf of the new client.</p>\n<p>With regard to an opposing party's raising a question of conflict of interest, see comment to rule 4-1.7. With regard to disqualification of a firm with which a lawyer is associated, see rule 4-1.10.</p>\n<p>4-1.10 <i>Imputed disqualification; general rule.</i></p>\n<p>(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by rule 4-1.7, 4-1.8(c), 4-1.9, or 4-2.2.</p>\n<p>(b) When a lawyer becomes associated with a firm, the firm may not knowingly represent a person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that lawyer, or a firm with which the lawyer was associated, had previously represented a client whose interests are materially adverse to that person and about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9(b) that is material to the matter.</p>\n<p>(c) When a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm is not prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests materially adverse to those of a client represented by the formerly associated lawyer unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The matter is the same or substantially related to that in which the formerly associated lawyer represented the client; and</p>\n<p>(2) Any lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9(b) that is material to the matter.</p>\n<p>(d) A disqualification prescribed by this rule may be waived by the affected client under the conditions stated in rule 4-1.7.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Definition of \"firm\"</i></h2>\n<p>For purposes of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the term \"firm\" includes lawyers in a private firm and lawyers employed in the legal department of a corporation or other organization or in a legal services organization. Whether two (2) or more lawyers constitute a firm within this definition can depend on the specific facts. For example, two (2) practitioners who share office space and occasionally consult or assist each other ordinarily would not be regarded as constituting a firm. However, if they present themselves to the public in a way suggesting that they are a firm or conduct themselves as a firm, they should be regarded as a firm for purposes of the rules. The terms of any formal agreement between associated lawyers are relevant in determining whether they are a firm, as is the fact that they have mutual access to confidential information concerning the clients the serve. Furthermore, it is relevant in doubtful cases to consider the underlying purpose of the rule that is involved. A group of lawyers could be regarded as a firm for purposes of the rule that the same lawyer should not represent opposing parties in litigation, while it might not be so regarded for purposes of the rule that information acquired by one lawyer is attributed to another.</p>\n<p>With respect to the law department of an organization, there is ordinarily no question that the members of the department constitute a firm within the meaning of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, there can be uncertainty as to the identity of the client. For example, it may not be clear <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1043</span> whether the law department of a corporation represents a subsidiary or an affiliated corporation, as well as the corporation by which the members of the department are directly employed. A similar question can arise concerning an unincorporated association and its local affiliates.</p>\n<p>Similar questions can also arise with respect to lawyers in legal aid. Lawyers employed in the same unit of a legal service organization constitute a firm, but not necessarily those employed in separate units. As in the case of independent practitioners, whether the lawyers should be treated as associated with each other can depend on the particular rule that is involved and on the specific facts of the situation.</p>\n<p>Where a lawyer has joined a private firm after having represented the government, the situation is governed by rule 4-1.11(a) and (b); where a lawyer represents the government after having served private clients, the situation is governed by rule 4-1.11(c)(1). The individual lawyer involved is bound by the rules generally, including rules 4-1.6, 4-1.7, and 4-1.9.</p>\n<p>Different provisions are thus made for movement of a lawyer from one private firm to another and for movement of a lawyer between a private firm and the government. The government is entitled to protection of its client confidences and, therefore, to the protections provided in rules 4-1.6, 4-1.9, and 4-1.11. However, if the more extensive disqualification in rule 4-1.10 were applied to former government lawyers, the potential effect on the government would be unduly burdensome. The government deals with all private citizens and organizations and thus has a much wider circle of adverse legal interests than does any private law firm. In these circumstances, the government's recruitment of lawyers would be seriously impaired if rule 4-1.10 were applied to the government. On balance, therefore, the government is better served in the long run by the protections stated in rule 4-1.11.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Principles of imputed disqualification</i></h2>\n<p>The rule of imputed disqualification stated in paragraph (a) gives effect to the principle of loyalty to the client as it applies to lawyers who practice in a law firm. Such situations can be considered from the premise that a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer for purposes of the rules governing loyalty to the client or from the premise that each lawyer is vicariously bound by the obligation of loyalty owed by each lawyer with whom the lawyer is associated. Paragraph (a) operates only among the lawyers currently associated in a firm. When a lawyer moves from one firm to another the situation is governed by paragraphs (b) and (c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Lawyers moving between firms</i></h2>\n<p>When lawyers have been associated in a firm but then end their association, however, the problem is more complicated. The fiction that the law firm is the same as a single lawyer is no longer wholly realistic. There are several competing considerations. First, the client previously represented must be reasonably assured that the principle of loyalty to the client is not compromised. Second, the rule of disqualification should not be so broadly cast as to preclude other persons from having reasonable choice of legal counsel. Third, the rule of disqualification should not unreasonably hamper lawyers from forming new associations and taking on new clients after having left a previous association. In this connection, it should be recognized that today many lawyers practice in firms, that many to some degree limit their practice to one field or another, and that many move from one association to another several times in their careers. If the concept of imputed disqualification were defined with unqualified rigor, the result would be radical curtailment of the opportunity of lawyers to move from one practice setting to another and of the opportunity of clients to change counsel.</p>\n<p>Reconciliation of these competing principles in the past has been attempted under two (2) rubrics. One approach has been to seek per se rules of disqualification. For <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1044</span> example, it has been held that a partner in a law firm is conclusively presumed to have access to all confidences concerning all clients of the firm. Under this analysis, if a lawyer has been a partner in one law firm and then becomes a partner in another law firm, there is a presumption that all confidences known by a partner in the first firm are known to all partners in the second firm. This presumption might properly be applied in some circumstances, especially where the client has been extensively represented, but may be unrealistic where the client was represented only for limited purposes. Furthermore, such a rigid rule exaggerates the difference between a partner and an associate in modern law firms.</p>\n<p>The other rubric formerly used for dealing with vicarious disqualification is the appearance of impropriety and was proscribed in former Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. This rubric has a two-fold problem. First, the appearance of impropriety can be taken to include any new client-lawyer relationship that might make a former client feel anxious. If that meaning were adopted, disqualification would become little more than a question of subjective judgment by the former client. Second, since \"impropriety\" is undefined, the term \"appearance of impropriety\" is question-begging. It therefore has to be recognized that the problem of imputed disqualification cannot be properly resolved either by simple analogy to a lawyer practicing alone or by the very general concept of appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p>A rule based on a functional analysis is more appropriate for determining the question of vicarious disqualification. Two (2) functions are involved: preserving confidentiality and avoiding positions adverse to a client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Confidentiality</i></h2>\n<p>Preserving confidentiality is a question of access to information. Access to information, in turn, is essentially a question of fact in particular circumstances, aided by inferences, deductions or working presumptions that reasonably may be made about the way in which lawyers work together. A lawyer may have general access to files of all clients of a law firm and may regularly participate in discussions of their affairs; it should be inferred that such a lawyer in fact is privy to all information about all the firm's clients. In contrast, another lawyer may have access to the files of only a limited number of clients and participate in discussion of the affairs of no other clients; in the absence of information to the contrary, it should be inferred that such a lawyer in fact is privy to information about the clients actually served but not those of other clients.</p>\n<p>Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) depends on a situation's particular facts. In any such inquiry, the burden of proof should rest upon the firm whose disqualification is sought.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs (b) and (c) operate to disqualify the firm only when the lawyer involved has actual knowledge of information protected by rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9(b). Thus, if a lawyer while with one firm acquired no knowledge or information relating to a particular client of the firm and that lawyer later joined another firm, neither the lawyer individually nor the second firm is disqualified from representing another client in the same or a related matter even though the interests of the two (2) clients conflict.</p>\n<p>Independent of the question of disqualification of a firm, a lawyer changing professional association has a continuing duty to preserve confidentiality of information about a client formerly represented. See rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Adverse positions</i></h2>\n<p>The second aspect of loyalty to client is the lawyer's obligation to decline subsequent representations involving positions adverse to a former client arising in substantially related matters. This obligation requires abstention from adverse representation by the individual lawyer involved, but does not properly entail abstention of other lawyers through imputed disqualification. Hence, this aspect of the problem is governed by rule 4-1.9(a). Thus, if a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1045</span> lawyer left one firm for another, the new affiliation would not preclude the firms involved from continuing to represent clients with adverse interests in the same or related matters so long as the conditions of rule 4-1.10(b) and (c) concerning confidentiality have been met.</p>\n<p>4-1.11 <i>Successive government and private employment.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not represent a private client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency consents after consultation. No lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is directly apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>\n<p>(2) Written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having information that the lawyer knows is confidential government information about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the material disadvantage of that person. A firm with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer serving as a public officer or employee shall not:</p>\n<p>(1) Participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice or nongovernmental employment, unless under applicable law no one is, or by lawful delegation may be, authorized to act in the lawyer's stead in the matter; or</p>\n<p>(2) Negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved as a party or as attorney for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially.</p>\n<p>(d) As used in this rule, the term \"matter\" includes:</p>\n<p>(1) Any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, investigation, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter involving a specific party or parties; and</p>\n<p>(2) Any other matter covered by the conflict of interest rules of the appropriate government agency.</p>\n<p>(e) As used in this rule, the term \"confidential government information\" means information which has been obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and which is not otherwise available to the public.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule prevents a lawyer from exploiting public office for the advantage of a private client. It is a counterpart of rule 4-1.10(b), which applies to lawyers moving from one firm to another.</p>\n<p>A lawyer representing a government agency, whether employed or specially retained by the government, is subject to the rules of professional conduct, including the prohibition against representing adverse interests stated in rule 4-1.7 and the protections afforded former clients in rule 4-1.9. In addition, such a lawyer is subject to rule 4-1.11 and to statutes and government regulations regarding conflict of interest. Such statutes and regulations may circumscribe the extent to which the government agency may give consent under this rule.</p>\n<p>Where the successive clients are a public agency and a private client, the risk exists that power or discretion vested in public authority might be used for the special benefit of a private client. A lawyer should not be in a position where benefit to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1046</span> a private client might affect performance of the lawyer's professional functions on behalf of public authority. Also, unfair advantage could accrue to the private client by reason of access to confidential government information about the client's adversary obtainable only through the lawyer's government service. However, the rules governing lawyers presently or formerly employed by a government agency should not be so restrictive as to inhibit transfer of employment to and from the government. The government has a legitimate need to attract qualified lawyers as well as to maintain high ethical standards. The provisions for screening and waiver are necessary to prevent the disqualification rule from imposing too severe a deterrent against entering public service.</p>\n<p>When the client is an agency of one government, the agency should be treated as a private client for purposes of this rule if the lawyer thereafter represents an agency of another government, as when a lawyer represents a city and subsequently is employed by a federal agency.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) do not prohibit a lawyer from receiving a salary or partnership share established by prior independent agreement. They prohibit directly relating the attorney's compensation to the fee in the matter in which the lawyer is disqualified.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (a)(2) does not require that a lawyer give notice to the government agency at a time when premature disclosure would injure the client; a requirement for premature disclosure might preclude engagement of the lawyer. Such notice is, however, required to be given as soon as practicable in order that the government agency or affected person will have a reasonable opportunity to ascertain that the lawyer is complying with rule 4-1.11 and to take appropriate action if they believe the lawyer is not complying.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) operates only when the lawyer in question has knowledge of the information, which means actual knowledge; it does not operate with respect to information that merely could be imputed to the lawyer.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs (a) and (c) do not prohibit a lawyer from jointly representing a private party and a government agency when doing so is permitted by rule 4-1.7 and is not otherwise prohibited by law.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (c) does not disqualify other lawyers in the agency with which the lawyer in question has become associated.</p>\n<p>4-1.12 <i>Former judge or arbitrator.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (d), a lawyer shall not represent anyone in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer, arbitrator, or law clerk to such a person, unless all parties to the proceeding consent after disclosure.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not negotiate for employment with any person who is involved as a party or as attorney for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer or arbitrator. A lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge, other adjudicative officer, or arbitrator may negotiate for employment with a party or attorney involved in a matter in which the clerk is participating personally and substantially, but only after the lawyer has notified the judge, other adjudicative officer, or arbitrator.</p>\n<p>(c) If a lawyer is disqualified by paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in the matter unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is directly apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>\n<p>(2) Written notice is promptly given to the appropriate tribunal to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.</p>\n<p>(d) An arbitrator selected as a partisan of a party in a multimember arbitration panel is not prohibited from subsequently representing that party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1047</span> <i>Comment:</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This rule generally parallels rule 4-1.11. The term \"personally and substantially\" signifies that a judge who was a member of a multimember court, and thereafter left judicial office to practice law, is not prohibited from representing a client in a matter pending in the court, but in which the former judge did not participate. So also the fact that a former judge exercised administrative responsibility in a court does not prevent the former judge from acting as a lawyer in a matter where the judge had previously exercised remote or incidental administrative responsibility that did not affect the merits. Compare the comment to rule 4-1.11. The term \"adjudicative officer\" includes such officials as judges pro tempore, referees, special masters, hearing officers, and other parajudicial officers and also lawyers who serve as part-time judges. Compliance Canons A(2), B(2), and C of Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct provide that a part-time judge, judge pro tempore, or retired judge recalled to active service may not \"act as a lawyer in any proceeding in which he served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto.\" Although phrased differently from this rule, those rules correspond in meaning.</p>\n<p>4-1.13 <i>Organization as client.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.</p>\n<p>(b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee, or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to act, or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the organization or a violation of law which reasonably might be imputed to the organization and is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the organization. In determining how to proceed, the lawyer shall give due consideration to the seriousness of the violation and its consequences, the scope and nature of the lawyer's representation, the responsibility in the organization and the apparent motivation of the person involved, the policies of the organization concerning such matters, and any other relevant considerations. Any measures taken shall be designed to minimize disruption of the organization and the risk of revealing information relating to the representation to persons outside the organization. Such measures may include among others:</p>\n<p>(1) Asking reconsideration of the matter;</p>\n<p>(2) Advising that a separate legal opinion on the matter be sought for presentation to appropriate authority in the organization; and</p>\n<p>(3) Referring the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the seriousness of the matter, referral to the highest authority that can act in behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.</p>\n<p>(c) If, despite the lawyer's efforts in accordance with paragraph (b), the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists upon action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law and is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, the lawyer may resign in accordance with rule 4-1.16.</p>\n<p>(d) In dealing with an organization's directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders, or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the identity of the client when it is apparent that the organization's interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.</p>\n<p>(e) A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders, or other constituents, subject to the provisions of rule 4-1.7. If the organization's consent to the dual representation is required by rule 4-1.7, the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The entity as the client</i></h2>\n<p>An organizational client is a legal entity, but it cannot act except through its officers, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> directors, employees, shareholders, and other constituents. Officers, directors, employees, and shareholders are the constituents of the corporate organizational client. The duties defined in this comment apply equally to unincorporated associations. \"Other constituents\" as used in this comment means the positions equivalent to officers, directors, employees, and shareholders held by persons acting for organizational clients that are not corporations.</p>\n<p>When one of the constituents of an organizational client communicates with the organization's lawyer in that person's organizational capacity, the communication is protected by rule 4-1.6. Thus, by way of example, if an organizational client requests its lawyer to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, interviews made in the course of that investigation between the lawyer and the client's employees or other constituents are covered by rule 4-1.6. This does not mean, however, that constituents of an organizational client are the clients of the lawyer. The lawyer may not disclose to such constituents information relating to the representation except for disclosures explicitly or impliedly authorized by the organizational client in order to carry out the representation or as otherwise permitted by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>When constituents of the organization make decisions for it, the decisions ordinarily must be accepted by the lawyer even if their utility or prudence is doubtful. Decisions concerning policy and operations, including ones entailing serious risk, are not as such in the lawyer's province. However, different considerations arise when the lawyer knows that the organization may be substantially injured by action of a constituent that is in violation of law. In such a circumstance, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to ask the constituent to reconsider the matter. If that fails, or if the matter is of sufficient seriousness and importance to the organization, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to take steps to have the matter reviewed by a higher authority in the organization. Clear justification should exist for seeking review over the head of the constituent normally responsible for it. The stated policy of the organization may define circumstances and prescribe channels for such review, and a lawyer should encourage the formulation of such a policy. Even in the absence of organization policy, however, the lawyer may have an obligation to refer a matter to higher authority, depending on the seriousness of the matter and whether the constituent in question has apparent motives to act at variance with the organization's interest. Review by the chief executive officer or by the board of directors may be required when the matter is of importance commensurate with their authority. At some point it may be useful or essential to obtain an independent legal opinion.</p>\n<p>In an extreme case, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to refer the matter to the organization's highest authority. Ordinarily, that is the board of directors or similar governing body. However, applicable law may prescribe that under certain conditions highest authority reposes elsewhere; for example, in the independent directors of a corporation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Relation to other rules</i></h2>\n<p>The authority and responsibility provided in paragraph (b) are concurrent with the authority and responsibility provided in other rules. In particular, this rule does not limit or expand the lawyer's responsibility under rule 4-1.6, 4-1.8, 4-1.16, 4-3.3, or 4-4.1. If the lawyer's services are being used by an organization to further a crime or fraud by the organization, rule 4-1.2(d) can be applicable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Government agency</i></h2>\n<p>The duty defined in this rule applies to governmental organizations. However, when the client is a governmental organization, a different balance may be appropriate between maintaining confidentiality and assuring that the wrongful official act is prevented or rectified, for public business is involved. In addition, duties of lawyers employed by the government or lawyers in military service may be defined by statutes and regulation. Therefore, defining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> precisely the identity of the client and prescribing the resulting obligations of such lawyers may be more difficult in the government context. Although in some circumstances the client may be a specific agency, it is generally the government as a whole. For example, if the action or failure to act involves the head of a bureau, either the department of which the bureau is a part or the government as a whole may be the client for purposes of this rule. Moreover, in a matter involving the conduct of government officials, a government lawyer may have authority to question such conduct more extensively than that of a lawyer for a private organization in similar circumstances. This rule does not limit that authority. See note on scope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Clarifying the lawyer's role</i></h2>\n<p>There are times when the organization's interest may be or become adverse to those of one or more of its constituents. In such circumstances the lawyer should advise any constituent whose interest the lawyer finds adverse to that of the organization of the conflict or potential conflict of interest that the lawyer cannot represent such constituent and that such person may wish to obtain independent representation. Care must be taken to assure that the constituent understands that, when there is such adversity of interest, the lawyer for the organization cannot provide legal representation for that constituent and that discussions between the lawyer for the organization and the constituent may not be privileged.</p>\n<p>Whether such a warning should be given by the lawyer for the organization to any constituent may turn on the facts of each case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Dual representation</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (e) recognizes that a lawyer for an organization may also represent a principal officer or major shareholder.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Derivative actions</i></h2>\n<p>Under generally prevailing law, the shareholders or members of a corporation may bring suit to compel the directors to perform their legal obligations in the supervision of the organization. Members of unincorporated associations have essentially the same right. Such an action may be brought nominally by the organization, but usually is, in fact, a legal controversy over management of the organization.</p>\n<p>The question can arise whether counsel for the organization may defend such an action. The proposition that the organization is the lawyer's client does not alone resolve the issue. Most derivative actions are a normal incident of an organization's affairs, to be defended by the organization's lawyer like any other suit. However, if the claim involves serious charges of wrongdoing by those in control of the organization, a conflict may arise between the lawyer's duty to the organization and the lawyer's relationship with the board. In those circumstances, rule 4-1.7 governs who should represent the directors and the organization.</p>\n<p>4-1.14 <i>Client under a disability.</i></p>\n<p>(a) When a client's ability to make adequately considered decisions in connection with the representation is impaired, whether because of minority, mental disability, or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer may seek the appointment of a guardian or take other protective action with respect to a client only when the lawyer reasonably believes that the client cannot adequately act in the client's own interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The normal client-lawyer relationship is based on the assumption that the client, when properly advised and assisted, is capable of making decisions about important matters. When the client is a minor or suffers from a mental disorder or disability, however, maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer relationship may not be possible in all respects. In particular, an incapacitated person may have no power to make legally binding decisions. Nevertheless, a client lacking legal competence often has the ability to understand, deliberate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> upon, and reach conclusions about matters affecting the client's own well-being. Furthermore, to an increasing extent the law recognizes intermediate degrees of competence. For example, children as young as five (5) or six (6) years of age, and certainly those of ten (10) or twelve (12), are regarded as having opinions that are entitled to weight in legal proceedings concerning their custody. So also, it is recognized that some persons of advanced age can be quite capable of handling routine financial matters while needing special legal protection concerning major transactions.</p>\n<p>The fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the lawyer's obligation to treat the client with attention and respect. If the person has no guardian or legal representative, the lawyer often must act as de facto guardian. Even if the person does have a legal representative, the lawyer should as far as possible accord the represented person the status of client, particularly in maintaining communication.</p>\n<p>If a legal representative has already been appointed for the client, the lawyer should ordinarily look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client. If a legal representative has not been appointed, the lawyer should see to such an appointment where it would serve the client's best interests. Thus, if a disabled client has substantial property that should be sold for the client's benefit, effective completion of the transaction ordinarily requires appointment of a legal representative. In many circumstances, however, appointment of a legal representative may be expensive or traumatic for the client. Evaluation of these considerations is a matter of professional judgment on the lawyer's part.</p>\n<p>If the lawyer represents the guardian as distinct from the ward and is aware that the guardian is acting adversely to the ward's interest, the lawyer may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian's misconduct. See rule 4-1.2(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disclosure of client's condition</i></h2>\n<p>Rules of procedure in litigation generally provide that minors or persons suffering mental disability shall be represented by a guardian or next friend if they do not have a general guardian. However, disclosure of the client's disability can adversely affect the client's interests. The lawyer may seek guidance from an appropriate diagnostician.</p>\n<p>4-1.15 <i>Safekeeping property.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall hold in trust, separate from the lawyer's own property, funds and property of clients or third persons that are in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation. All funds, including advances for costs and expenses, shall be kept in a separate account maintained in the state where the lawyer's office is situated or elsewhere with the consent of the client or third person, provided that funds may be separately held and maintained other than in a bank account if the lawyer receives written permission from the client to do so and provided that such written permission is received prior to maintaining the funds other than in a separate bank account. In no event may the lawyer commingle the client's funds with those of his or hers or those of his or her law firm. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and other property, including client funds not maintained in a separate bank account, shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of six (6) years after termination of the representation.</p>\n<p>(b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</p>\n<p>(c) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which both the lawyer and another person <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> claim interests, the property shall be treated by the lawyer as trust property, but the portion belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be withdrawn within a reasonable time after it becomes due unless the right of the lawyer or law firm to receive it is disputed, in which event the portion in dispute shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall comply with The Florida Bar Rules Regulating Trust Accounts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary. Securities should be kept in a safe deposit box, except when some other form of safekeeping is warranted by special circumstances. All property which is the property of clients or third persons should be kept separate from the lawyer's business and personal property and, if money, in one or more trust accounts, unless requested otherwise in writing by the client. Separate trust accounts may be warranted when administering estate money or acting in similar fiduciary capacities.</p>\n<p>Lawyers often receive funds from third parties from which the lawyer's fee will be paid. If there is risk that the client may divert the funds without paying the fee, the lawyer is not required to remit the portion from which the fee is to be paid. However, a lawyer may not hold funds to coerce a client into accepting the lawyer's contention. The disputed portion of the funds should be kept in trust and the lawyer should suggest means for prompt resolution of the dispute, such as arbitration. The undisputed portion of the funds shall be promptly distributed.</p>\n<p>Third parties, such as a client's creditors, may have just claims against funds or other property in a lawyer's custody. A lawyer may have a duty under applicable law to protect such third party claims against wrongful interference by the client and, accordingly, may refuse to surrender the property to the client. However, a lawyer should not unilaterally assume to arbitrate a dispute between the client and the third party and where appropriate the lawyer should consider the possibility of depositing the property or funds in dispute into the registry of the applicable court so that the matter may be adjudicated.</p>\n<p>The obligations of a lawyer under this rule are independent of those arising from activity other than rendering legal services. For example, a lawyer who serves as an escrow agent is governed by the applicable law relating to fiduciaries even though the lawyer does not render legal services in the transaction.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (d) of this rule requires each lawyer to be familiar with and comply with Rules Regulating Trust Accounts as adopted by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>Money or other property entrusted to a lawyer for a specific purpose, including advances for costs and expenses, is held in trust and must be applied only to that purpose. Money and other property of clients coming into the hands of a lawyer are not subject to counterclaim or setoff for attorney's fees, and a refusal to account for and deliver over such property upon demand shall be a conversion. This is not to preclude the retention of money or other property upon which a lawyer has a valid lien for services or to preclude the payment of agreed fees from the proceeds of transactions or collections.</p>\n<p>4-1.16 <i>Declining or terminating representation.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if:</p>\n<p>(1) The representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or law;</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client; or</p>\n<p>(3) The lawyer is discharged.</p>\n<p>(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if withdrawal can be accomplished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> without material adverse effect on the interests of the client, or if:</p>\n<p>(1) The client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer's services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;</p>\n<p>(2) The client has used the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;</p>\n<p>(3) A client insists upon pursuing an objective that the lawyer considers repugnant or imprudent;</p>\n<p>(4) The client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer's services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;</p>\n<p>(5) The representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or</p>\n<p>(6) Other good cause for withdrawal exists.</p>\n<p>(c) When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.</p>\n<p>(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interest, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers and other property relating to or belonging to the client to the extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer should not accept representation in a matter unless it can be performed competently, promptly, without improper conflict of interest and to completion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Mandatory withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer ordinarily must decline or withdraw from representation if the client demands that the lawyer engage in conduct that is illegal or violates the Rules of Professional Conduct or law. The lawyer is not obliged to decline or withdraw simply because the client suggests such a course of conduct; a client may make such a suggestion in the hope that a lawyer will not be constrained by a professional obligation.</p>\n<p>When a lawyer has been appointed to represent a client, withdrawal ordinarily requires approval of the appointing authority. See also rule 4-6.2. Difficulty may be encountered if withdrawal is based on the client's demand that the lawyer engage in unprofessional conduct. The court may wish an explanation for the withdrawal, while the lawyer may be bound to keep confidential the facts that would constitute such an explanation. The lawyer's statement that professional considerations require termination of the representation ordinarily should be accepted as sufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Discharge</i></h2>\n<p>A client has a right to discharge a lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to liability for payment for the lawyer's services. Where future dispute about the withdrawal may be anticipated, it may be advisable to prepare a written statement reciting the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Whether a client can discharge appointed counsel may depend on applicable law. A client seeking to do so should be given a full explanation of the consequences. These consequences may include a decision by the appointing authority that appointment of successor counsel is unjustified, thus requiring the client to represent himself.</p>\n<p>If the client is mentally incompetent, the client may lack the legal capacity to discharge the lawyer, and in any event the discharge may be seriously adverse to the client's interests. The lawyer should make special effort to help the client consider the consequences and, in an extreme case, may initiate proceedings for a conservatorship or similar protection of the client. See rule 4-1.14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Optional withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer may withdraw from representation in some circumstances. The lawyer has the option to withdraw if it can be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> accomplished without material adverse effect on the client's interests. Withdrawal is also justified if the client persists in a course of action that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent, for a lawyer is not required to be associated with such conduct even if the lawyer does not further it. Withdrawal is also permitted if the lawyer's services were misused in the past even if that would materially prejudice the client. The lawyer also may withdraw where the client insists on a repugnant or imprudent objective.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may withdraw if the client refuses to abide by the terms of an agreement relating to the representation, such as an agreement concerning fees or court costs or an agreement limiting the objectives of the representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Assisting the client upon withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>Even if the lawyer has been unfairly discharged by the client, a lawyer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences to the client. The lawyer may retain papers and other property as security for a fee only to the extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p>Whether or not a lawyer for an organization may under certain unusual circumstances have a legal obligation to the organization after withdrawing or being discharged by the organization's highest authority is beyond the scope of these rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Refunding advance payment of unearned fee</i></h2>\n<p>Upon termination of representation, a lawyer should refund to the client any advance payment of a fee that has not been earned. This does not preclude a lawyer from retaining any reasonable nonrefundable fee which the client agreed would be deemed earned when the lawyer commenced the client's representation. See also rule 4-1.5.</p>\n<p>4-2 <i>Counselor.</i></p>\n<p>4-2.1 <i>Adviser.</i> In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social, and political factors that may be relevant to the client's situation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Scope of advice</i></h2>\n<p>A client is entitled to straightforward advice expressing the lawyer's honest assessment. Legal advice often involves unpleasant facts and alternatives that a client may be disinclined to confront. In presenting advice, a lawyer endeavors to sustain the client's morale and may put advice in as acceptable a form as honesty permits. However, a lawyer should not be deterred from giving candid advice by the prospect that the advice will be unpalatable to the client.</p>\n<p>Advice couched in narrowly legal terms may be of little value to a client, especially where practical considerations, such as cost or effects on other people, are predominant. Purely technical legal advice, therefore, can sometimes be inadequate. It is proper for a lawyer to refer to relevant moral and ethical considerations in giving advice. Although a lawyer is not a moral adviser as such, moral and ethical considerations impinge upon most legal questions and may decisively influence how the law will be applied.</p>\n<p>A client may expressly or impliedly ask the lawyer for purely technical advice. When such a request is made by a client experienced in legal matters, the lawyer may accept it at face value. When such a request is made by a client inexperienced in legal matters, however, the lawyer's responsibility as adviser may include indicating that more may be involved than strictly legal considerations.</p>\n<p>Matters that go beyond strictly legal questions may also be in the domain of another profession. Family matters can involve problems within the professional competence of psychiatry, clinical psychology, or social work; business matters can involve problems within the competence of the accounting profession or of financial specialists. Where consultation with a professional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> in another field is itself something a competent lawyer would recommend, the lawyer should make such a recommendation. At the same time, a lawyer's advice at its best often consists of recommending a course of action in the face of conflicting recommendations of experts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Offering advice</i></h2>\n<p>In general, a lawyer is not expected to give advice until asked by the client. However, when a lawyer knows that a client proposes a course of action that is likely to result in substantial adverse legal consequences to the client, duty to the client under rule 4-1.4 may require that the lawyer act if the client's course of action is related to the representation. A lawyer ordinarily has no duty to initiate investigation of a client's affairs or to give advice that the client has indicated is unwanted, but a lawyer may initiate advice to a client when doing so appears to be in the client's interest.</p>\n<p>4-2.2 <i>Intermediary.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer may act as intermediary between clients if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer consults with each client concerning the implications of the common representation, including the advantages and risks involved, and the effect on the attorney-client privileges and obtains each client's consent to the common representation;</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer reasonably believes that the matter can be resolved on terms compatible with the clients' best interests, that each client will be able to make adequately informed decisions in the matter, and that there is little risk of material prejudice to the interests of any of the clients if the contemplated resolution is unsuccessful; and</p>\n<p>(3) The lawyer reasonably believes that the common representation can be undertaken impartially and without improper effect on other responsibilities the lawyer has to any of the clients.</p>\n<p>(b) While acting as intermediary, the lawyer shall consult with each client concerning the decisions to be made and the considerations relevant in making them, so that each client can make adequately informed decisions.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall withdraw as intermediary if any of the clients so requests or if any of the conditions stated in paragraph (a) is no longer satisfied. Upon withdrawal, the lawyer shall not continue to represent any of the clients in the matter that was the subject of the intermediation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer acts as intermediary under this rule when the lawyer represents two (2) or more parties with potentially conflicting interests. A key factor in defining the relationship is whether the parties share responsibility for the lawyer's fee, but the common representation may be inferred from other circumstances. Because confusion can arise as to the lawyer's role where each party is not separately represented, it is important that the lawyer make clear the relationship.</p>\n<p>The rule does not apply to a lawyer acting as arbitrator or mediator between or among parties who are not clients of the lawyer, even where the lawyer has been appointed with the concurrence of the parties. In performing such a role the lawyer may be subject to applicable codes of ethics, such as the Code of Ethics for Arbitration in Commercial Disputes prepared by a joint committee of the American Bar Association and the American Arbitration Association.</p>\n<p>A lawyer acts as intermediary in seeking to establish or adjust a relationship between clients on an amicable and mutually advantageous basis; for example, in helping to organize a business in which two (2) or more clients are entrepreneurs, working out the financial reorganization of an enterprise in which two (2) or more clients have an interest, arranging a property distribution in settlement of an estate, or mediating a dispute between clients. The lawyer seeks to resolve potentially conflicting interests by developing the parties' mutual interests. The alternative can be that each <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1055</span> party may have to obtain separate representation, with the possibility in some situations of incurring additional cost, complication, or even litigation. Given these and other relevant factors, all the clients may prefer that the lawyer act as intermediary.</p>\n<p>In considering whether to act as intermediary between clients, a lawyer should be mindful that if the intermediation fails the result can be additional cost, embarrassment and recrimination. In some situations the risk of failure is so great that intermediation is plainly impossible. For example, a lawyer cannot undertake common representation of clients between whom contentious litigation is imminent or who contemplate contentious negotiations. More generally, if the relationship between the parties has already assumed definite antagonism, the possibility that the clients' interests can be adjusted by intermediation ordinarily is not very good.</p>\n<p>The appropriateness of intermediation can depend on its form. Forms of intermediation range from informal arbitration, where each client's case is presented by the respective client and the lawyer decides the outcome, to mediation, to common representation where the clients' interests are substantially though not entirely compatible. One form may be appropriate in circumstances where another would not. Other relevant factors are whether the lawyer subsequently will represent both parties on a continuing basis and whether the situation involves creating a relationship between the parties or terminating one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Confidentiality and privilege</i></h2>\n<p>A particularly important factor in determining the appropriateness of intermediation is the effect on client-lawyer confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege. In a common representation, the lawyer is still required both to keep each client adequately informed and to maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation. See rules 4-1.4 and 4-1.6. Complying with both requirements while acting as intermediary requires a delicate balance. If the balance cannot be maintained, the common representation is improper. With regard to the attorney-client privilege, the prevailing rule is that as between commonly represented clients the privilege does not attach. Hence, it must be assumed that if litigation eventuates between the clients, the privilege will not protect any such communications, and the clients should be so advised.</p>\n<p>Since the lawyer is required to be impartial between commonly represented clients, intermediation is improper when that impartiality cannot be maintained. For example, a lawyer who has represented one of the clients for a long period and in a variety of matters might have difficulty being impartial between that client and one to whom the lawyer has only recently been introduced.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consultation</i></h2>\n<p>In acting as intermediary between clients, the lawyer is required to consult with the clients on the implications of doing so and to proceed only upon consent based on such a consultation. The consultation should make clear that the lawyer's role is not that of partisanship normally expected in other circumstances.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) is an application of the principle expressed in rule 4-1.4. Where the lawyer is intermediary, the clients ordinarily must assume greater responsibility for decisions than when each client is independently represented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>Common representation does not diminish the rights of each client in the client-lawyer relationship. Each has the right to loyal and diligent representation, the right to discharge the lawyer as stated in rule 4-1.16, and the protection of rule 4-1.9 concerning obligations to a former client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4-2.3 <i>Evaluation for use by third persons.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(a) A lawyer may undertake an evaluation of a matter affecting a client for the use of someone other than the client if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes that making the evaluation is compatible with other aspects of the lawyer's relationship with the client; and</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1056</span> (2) The client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(b) In reporting the evaluation, the lawyer shall indicate any material limitations that were imposed on the scope of the inquiry or on the disclosure of information.</p>\n<p>(c) Except as disclosure is required in connection with a report of an evaluation, information relating to the evaluation is otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Definition</i></h2>\n<p>An evaluation may be performed at the client's direction but for the primary purpose of establishing information for the benefit of third parties; for example, an opinion concerning the title of property rendered at the behest of a vendor for the information of a prospective purchaser or at the behest of a borrower for the information of a prospective lender. In some situations, the evaluation may be required by a government agency; for example, an opinion concerning the legality of the securities registered for sale under the securities laws. In other instances, the evaluation may be required by a third person, such as a purchaser of a business.</p>\n<p>Lawyers for the government may be called upon to give a formal opinion on the legality of contemplated government agency action. In making such an evaluation, the government lawyer acts at the behest of the government as the client but for the purpose of establishing the limits of the agency's authorized activity. Such an opinion is to be distinguished from confidential legal advice given agency officials. The critical question is whether the opinion is to be made public.</p>\n<p>A legal evaluation should be distinguished from an investigation of a person with whom the lawyer does not have a client-lawyer relationship. For example, a lawyer retained by a purchaser to analyze a vendor's title to property does not have a client-lawyer relationship with the vendor. So also, an investigation into a person's affairs by a government lawyer, or by special counsel employed by the government, is not an evaluation as that term is used in this rule. The question is whether the lawyer is retained by the person whose affairs are being examined. When the lawyer is retained by that person, the general rules concerning loyalty to client and preservation of confidences apply, which is not the case if the lawyer is retained by someone else. For this reason, it is essential to identify the person by whom the lawyer is retained. This should be made clear not only to the person under examination, but also to others to whom the results are to be made available.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Duty to third person</i></h2>\n<p>When the evaluation is intended for the information or use of a third person, a legal duty to that person may or may not arise. That legal question is beyond the scope of this rule. However, since such an evaluation involves a departure from the normal client-lawyer relationship, careful analysis of the situation is required. The lawyer must be satisfied as a matter of professional judgment that making the evaluation is compatible with other functions undertaken in behalf of the client. For example, if the lawyer is acting as an advocate in defending the client against charges of fraud, it would normally be incompatible with that responsibility for the lawyer to perform an evaluation for others concerning the same or a related transaction. Assuming no such impediment is apparent, however, the lawyer should advise the client of the implications of the evaluation, particularly the lawyer's responsibilities to third persons and the duty to disseminate the findings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Access to and disclosure of information</i></h2>\n<p>The quality of an evaluation depends on the freedom and extent of the investigation upon which it is based. Ordinarily, a lawyer should have whatever latitude of investigation seems necessary as a matter of professional judgment. Under some circumstances, however, the terms of the evaluation may be limited. For example, certain issues or sources may be categorically excluded or the scope of search may be limited by time constraints or the non-cooperation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1057</span> of persons having relevant information. Any such limitations which are material to the evaluation should be described in the report. If, after a lawyer has commenced an evaluation, the client refuses to comply with the terms upon which it was understood the evaluation was to have been made, the lawyer's obligations are determined by law, having reference to the terms of the client's agreement and the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Financial auditors' requests for information</i></h2>\n<p>When a question concerning the legal situation of a client arises at the instance of the client's financial auditor and the question is referred to the lawyer, the lawyer's response may be made in accordance with procedures recognized in the legal profession. Such a procedure is set forth in the American Bar Association Statement of Policy Regarding Lawyer's Responses to Auditors' Requests for Information, adopted in 1975.</p>\n<p>4-3 <i>Advocate.</i></p>\n<p>4-3.1 <i>Meritorious claims and contentions.</i> A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The advocate has a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client's cause, but also a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive, establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. However, the law is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in determining the proper scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law's ambiguities and potential for change.</p>\n<p>The filing of an action or defense or similar action taken for a client is not frivolous merely because the facts have not first been fully substantiated or because the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery. Such action is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes that the client's position ultimately will not prevail. The action is frivolous, however, if the client desires to have the action taken primarily for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring a person or if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.</p>\n<p>4-3.2 <i>Expediting litigation.</i> A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Dilatory practices bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Delay should not be indulged merely for the convenience of the advocates or for the purpose of frustrating an opposing party's attempt to obtain rightful redress or repose. It is not a justification that similar conduct is often tolerated by the bench and bar. The question is whether a competent lawyer acting in good faith would regard the course of action as having some substantial purpose other than delay. Realizing financial or other benefit from otherwise improper delay in litigation is not a legitimate interest of the client.</p>\n<p>4-3.3 <i>Candor toward the tribunal.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>\n<p>(1) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal;</p>\n<p>(2) Fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by the client;</p>\n<p>(3) Fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1058</span> to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or</p>\n<p>(4) Offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.</p>\n<p>(b) The duties stated in paragraph (a) continue beyond the conclusion of the proceeding and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.</p>\n<p>(d) In an ex parte proceeding a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer which will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The advocate's task is to present the client's case with persuasive force. Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client is qualified by the advocate's duty of candor to the tribunal. However, an advocate does not vouch for the evidence submitted in a cause; the tribunal is responsible for assessing its probative value.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Representations by a lawyer</i></h2>\n<p>An advocate is responsible for pleadings and other documents prepared for litigation, but is usually not required to have personal knowledge of matters asserted therein, for litigation documents ordinarily present assertions by the client, or by someone on the client's behalf, and not assertions by the lawyer. Compare rule 4-3.1. However, an assertion purporting to be on the lawyer's own knowledge, as in an affidavit by the lawyer or in a statement in open court, may properly be made only when the lawyer knows the assertion is true or believes it to be true on the basis of a reasonably diligent inquiry. There are circumstances where failure to make a disclosure is the equivalent of an affirmative misrepresentation. The obligation prescribed in rule 4-1.2(d) not to counsel a client to commit or assist the client in committing a fraud applies in litigation. Regarding compliance with rule 4-1.2(d), see the comment to that rule. See also the comment to rule 4-8.4(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Misleading legal argument</i></h2>\n<p>Legal argument based on a knowingly false representation of law constitutes dishonesty toward the tribunal. A lawyer is not required to make a disinterested exposition of the law, but must recognize the existence of pertinent legal authorities. Furthermore, as stated in paragraph (a)(3), an advocate has a duty to disclose directly adverse authority in the controlling jurisdiction which has not been disclosed by the opposing party. The underlying concept is that legal argument is a discussion seeking to determine the legal premises properly applicable to the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>False evidence</i></h2>\n<p>When evidence that a lawyer knows to be false is provided by a person who is not the client, the lawyer must refuse to offer it regardless of the client's wishes.</p>\n<p>When false evidence is offered by the client, however, a conflict may arise between the lawyer's duty to keep the client's revelations confidential and the duty of candor to the court. Upon ascertaining that material evidence is false, the lawyer should seek to persuade the client that the evidence should not be offered or, if it has been offered, that its false character should immediately be disclosed. If the persuasion is ineffective, the lawyer must take reasonable remedial measures.</p>\n<p>Except in the defense of a criminal accused, the rule generally recognized is that, if necessary to rectify the situation, an advocate must disclose the existence of the client's deception to the court or to the other party. Such a disclosure can result in grave consequences to the client, including not only a sense of betrayal but also loss of the case and perhaps a prosecution for perjury. But the alternative is that the lawyer cooperate in deceiving the court, thereby subverting the truth-finding process which the adversary system is designed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1059</span> to implement. See rule 4-1.2(d). Furthermore, unless it is clearly understood that the lawyer will act upon the duty to disclose the existence of false evidence the client can simply reject the lawyer's advice to reveal the false evidence and insist that the lawyer keep silent. Thus, the client could in effect coerce the lawyer into being a party to fraud on the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Perjury by a criminal defendant</i></h2>\n<p>Whether an advocate for a criminally accused has the same duty of disclosure has been intensely debated. While it is agreed that the lawyer should seek to persuade the client to refrain from perjurious testimony, there has been dispute concerning the lawyer's duty when that persuasion fails. If the confrontation with the client occurs before trial, the lawyer ordinarily can withdraw. Withdrawal before trial may not be possible if trial is imminent, if the confrontation with the client does not take place until the trial itself, or if no other counsel is available.</p>\n<p>The most difficult situation, therefore, arises in a criminal case where the accused insists on testifying when the lawyer knows that the testimony is perjurious. The lawyer's effort to rectify the situation can increase the likelihood of the client's being convicted as well as opening the possibility of a prosecution for perjury. On the other hand, if the lawyer does not exercise control over the proof, the lawyer participates, although in a merely passive way, in deception of the court.</p>\n<p>Three (3) resolutions of this dilemma have been proposed. One is to permit the accused to testify by a narrative without guidance through the lawyer's questioning. This compromises both competing principles; it exempts the lawyer from the duty to disclose false evidence but subjects the client to an implicit disclosure of information imparted to counsel. Another suggested resolution, of relatively recent origin, is that the advocate be entirely excused from the duty to reveal perjury if the perjury is that of the client. This is a coherent solution but makes the advocate a knowing instrument of perjury.</p>\n<p>The third resolution of the dilemma is that the lawyer must reveal the client's perjury if necessary to rectify the situation. A criminal accused has a right to the assistance of an advocate, a right to testify and a right of confidential communication with counsel. However, an accused should not have a right to assistance of counsel in committing perjury. Furthermore, an advocate has an obligation, not only in professional ethics but under the law as well, to avoid implication in the commission of perjury or other falsification of evidence. See rule 4-1.2(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Remedial measures</i></h2>\n<p>If perjured testimony or false evidence has been offered, the advocate's proper course ordinarily is to remonstrate with the client confidentially. If that fails, the advocate should seek to withdraw if that will remedy the situation. If withdrawal will not remedy the situation or is impossible, the advocate should make disclosure to the court. It is for the court then to determine what should be done â making a statement about the matter to the trier of fact, ordering a mistrial, or perhaps nothing. If the false testimony was that of the client, the client may controvert the lawyer's version of their communication when the lawyer discloses the situation to the court. If there is an issue whether the client has committed perjury, the lawyer cannot represent the client in resolution of the issue and a mistrial may be unavoidable. An unscrupulous client might in this way attempt to produce a series of mistrials and thus escape prosecution. However, a second such encounter could be construed as a deliberate abuse of the right to counsel and as such a waiver of the right to further representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Constitutional requirements</i></h2>\n<p>The general rule â that an advocate must disclose the existence of perjury with respect to a material fact, even that of a client â applies to defense counsel in criminal cases, as well as in other instances. However, the definition of the lawyer's ethical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1060</span> duty in such a situation may be qualified by constitutional provisions for due process and the right to counsel in criminal cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Refusing to offer proof believed to be false</i></h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, a lawyer has authority to refuse to offer testimony or other proof that the lawyer believes is untrustworthy. Offering such proof may reflect adversely on the lawyer's ability to discriminate in the quality of evidence and thus impair the lawyer's effectiveness as an advocate. In criminal cases, however, a lawyer may, in some jurisdictions, be denied this authority by constitutional requirements governing the right to counsel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Ex parte proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>Ordinarily, an advocate has the limited responsibility of presenting one side of the matters that a tribunal should consider in reaching a decision; the conflicting position is expected to be presented by the opposing party. However, in an ex parte proceeding, such as an application for a temporary restraining order, there is no balance of presentation by opposing advocates. The object of an ex parte proceeding is nevertheless to yield a substantially just result. The judge has an affirmative responsibility to accord the absent party just consideration. The lawyer for the represented party has the correlative duty to make disclosures of material facts known to the lawyer and that the lawyer reasonably believes are necessary to an informed decision.</p>\n<p>4-3.4 <i>Fairness of opposing party and counsel.</i> A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p>(a) Unlawfully obstruct another party's access to evidence; or otherwise unlawfully alter, destroy, or conceal a document or other material that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is relevant to a pending or a reasonably foreseeable proceeding. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act.</p>\n<p>(b) Fabricate evidence, counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely, or offer an inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law.</p>\n<p>(c) Knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists.</p>\n<p>(d) In pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or intentionally fail to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party.</p>\n<p>(e) In trial, allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, assert personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, or state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil litigant, or the guilt or innocence of an accused.</p>\n<p>(f) Request a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information to another party unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The person is a relative or an employee or other agent of a client; and</p>\n<p>(2) It is reasonable to believe that the person's interests will not be adversely affected by refraining from giving such information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The procedure of the adversary system contemplates that the evidence in a case is to be marshalled competitively by the contending parties. Fair competition in the adversary system is secured by prohibitions against destruction or concealment of evidence, improperly influencing witnesses, obstructive tactics in discovery procedure, and the like.</p>\n<p>Documents and other items of evidence are often essential to establish a claim or defense. Subject to evidentiary privileges, the right of an opposing party, including the government, to obtain evidence through discovery or subpoena is an important procedural right. The exercise of that right can be frustrated if relevant material is altered, concealed or destroyed. Applicable law in many jurisdictions makes it an offense to destroy material for the purpose of impairing its availability in a pending proceeding or one whose commencement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1061</span> can be foreseen. Falsifying evidence is also generally a criminal offense. Paragraph (a) applies to evidentiary material generally, including computerized information.</p>\n<p>With regard to paragraph (b), it is not improper to pay a witness's expenses or to compensate an expert witness on terms permitted by law. The common law rule in most jurisdictions is that it is improper to pay an occurrence witness any fee for testifying and that it is improper to pay an expert witness a contingent fee.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (f) permits a lawyer to advise employees of a client to refrain from giving information to another party, for the employees may identify their interests with those of the client. See also rule 4-4.2.</p>\n<p>4-3.5 <i>Impartiality and decorum of the tribunal.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not seek to influence a judge, juror, prospective juror, or other decision maker except as permitted by law or the rules of court.</p>\n<p>(b) In an adversary proceeding a lawyer shall not communicate or cause another to communicate as to the merits of the cause with a judge or an official before whom the proceeding is pending except:</p>\n<p>(1) In the course of the official proceeding in the cause;</p>\n<p>(2) In writing if the lawyer promptly delivers a copy of the writing to the opposing counsel or to the adverse party if not represented by a lawyer;</p>\n<p>(3) Orally upon notice to opposing counsel or to the adverse party if not represented by a lawyer; or</p>\n<p>(4) As otherwise authorized by law.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall not engage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p>(1) Before the trial of a case with which he or she is connected, communicate or cause another to communicate with anyone he or she knows to be a member of the venire from which the jury will be selected.</p>\n<p>(2) During the trial of a case with which he or she is connected, communicate or cause another to communicate with any member of the jury.</p>\n<p>(3) During the trial of a case with which he or she is not connected, communicate or cause another to communicate with a juror concerning the case.</p>\n<p>(4) After dismissal of the jury in a case with which he or she is connected, initiate communication with or cause another to initiate communication with any juror regarding the trial except to determine whether the verdict may be subject to legal challenge. Provided, a lawyer may not interview jurors for this purpose unless he or she has reason to believe that grounds for such challenge may exist. Provided further, before conducting any such interview the lawyer must file in the cause a notice of intention to interview setting forth the name of the juror or jurors to be interviewed. A copy of the notice must be delivered to the trial judge and opposing counsel a reasonable time before such interview. The provisions of this rule do not prohibit a lawyer from communicating with veniremen or jurors in the course of official proceedings or as authorized by court rule or written order of the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Many forms of improper influence upon a tribunal are proscribed by criminal law. Others are specified in Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct, with which an advocate should be familiar. A lawyer is required to avoid contributing to a violation of such provisions.</p>\n<p>The advocate's function is to present evidence and argument so that the cause may be decided according to law. Refraining from abusive or obstreperous conduct is a corollary of the advocate's right to speak on behalf of litigants. A lawyer may stand firm against abuse by a judge but should avoid reciprocation; the judge's default is no justification for similar dereliction by an advocate. An advocate can present the cause, protect the record for subsequent review and preserve professional integrity by patient firmness no less effectively than by belligerence or theatrics.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1062</span> 4-3.6 <i>Trial publicity.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to make such a statement. Prosecutors and defense counsel shall exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, employees, or other persons assisting in or associated with a criminal case from making extrajudicial statements that are prohibited under this rule.</p>\n<p>(b) A statement referred to in paragraph (a) ordinarily is likely to have such an effect when it refers to a civil matter triable to a jury, a criminal matter, or any other proceeding that could result in incarceration, and the statement relates to:</p>\n<p>(1) The character, credibility, reputation, or criminal record of a party, suspect in a criminal investigation, or witness or the identity of a witness or the expected testimony of a party or witness;</p>\n<p>(2) In a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration, the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense, or the existence or contents of any confession, admission, or statement given by a defendant or suspect or that person's refusal or failure to make a statement;</p>\n<p>(3) The performance or results of any examination or test or the refusal or failure of a person to submit to an examination or test or the identity or nature of physical evidence expected to be presented;</p>\n<p>(4) Any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant or suspect in a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration;</p>\n<p>(5) Information the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to be inadmissible as evidence in a trial and would if disclosed create a substantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial; or</p>\n<p>(6) The fact that a defendant has been charged with a crime, unless there is included therein a statement explaining that the charge is merely an accusation and that the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.</p>\n<p>(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) through (5), a lawyer involved in the investigation or litigation of a matter may state without elaboration:</p>\n<p>(1) The general nature of the claim or defense;</p>\n<p>(2) The information contained in a public record;</p>\n<p>(3) That an investigation of the matter is in progress, including the general scope of the investigation, the offense or claim, or defense involved and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the persons involved;</p>\n<p>(4) The scheduling or result of any step in litigation;</p>\n<p>(5) A request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary thereto;</p>\n<p>(6) A warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and</p>\n<p>(7) In a criminal case:</p>\n<p>a. The identity, residence, occupation, and family status of the accused;</p>\n<p>b. If the accused has not been apprehended, information necessary to aid in apprehension of that person;</p>\n<p>c. The fact, time, and place of arrest; and</p>\n<p>d. The identity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>It is difficult to strike a balance between protecting the right to a fair trial and safeguarding the right of free expression. Preserving the right to a fair trial necessarily entails some curtailment of the information that may be disseminated about a party prior to trial, particularly where trial by jury is involved. If there were no such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1063</span> limits, the result would be the practical nullification of the protective effect of the rules of forensic decorum and the exclusionary rules of evidence. On the other hand, there are vital social interests served by the free dissemination of information about events having legal consequences and about legal proceedings themselves. The public has a right to know about threats to its safety and measures aimed at assuring its security. It also has a legitimate interest in the conduct of judicial proceedings, particularly in matters of general public concern. Furthermore, the subject matter of legal proceedings is often of direct significance in debate and deliberation over questions of public policy.</p>\n<p>Special rules of confidentiality may validly govern proceedings in juvenile, domestic relations and mental disability proceedings and perhaps other types of litigation. Rule 4-3.4(c) requires compliance with such rules.</p>\n<p>4-3.7 <i>Lawyer as witness.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness on behalf of his or her client except where:</p>\n<p>(1) The testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</p>\n<p>(2) The testimony will relate solely to a matter of formality and there is no reason to believe that substantial evidence will be offered in opposition to the testimony;</p>\n<p>(3) The testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</p>\n<p>(4) Disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer may act as advocate in a trial in which another lawyer in the lawyer's firm is likely to be called as a witness unless precluded from doing so by rule 4-1.7 or 4-1.9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Combining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the opposing party and can involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client.</p>\n<p>The opposing party has proper objection where the combination of roles may prejudice that party's rights in the litigation. A witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (a)(1) recognizes that if the testimony will be uncontested, the ambiguities in the dual role are purely theoretical. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) recognize that, where the testimony concerns the extent and value of legal services rendered in the action in which the testimony is offered, permitting the lawyers to testify avoids the need for a second trial with new counsel to resolve that issue. Moreover, in such a situation the judge has first-hand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is less dependence on the adversary process to test the credibility of the testimony.</p>\n<p>Apart from these two (2) exceptions, paragraph (a)(4) recognizes that a balancing is required between the interests of the client and those of the opposing party. Whether the opposing party is likely to suffer prejudice depends on the nature of the case, the importance and probable tenor of the lawyer's testimony, and the probability that the lawyer's testimony will conflict with that of other witnesses. Even if there is risk of such prejudice, in determining whether the lawyer should be disqualified due regard must be given to the effect of disqualification on the lawyer's client. It is relevant that one or both parties could reasonably foresee that the lawyer would probably be a witness. The principle of imputed disqualification stated in rule 4-1.10 has no application to this aspect of the problem.</p>\n<p>Whether the combination of roles involves an improper conflict of interest with respect to the client is determined by rule 4-1.7 or 4-1.9. For example, if there is likely to be substantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer or a member of the lawyer's firm, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1064</span> the representation is improper. The problem can arise whether the lawyer is called as a witness on behalf of the client or is called by the opposing party. Determining whether or not such a conflict exists is primarily the responsibility of the lawyer involved. See comment to rule 4-1.7. If a lawyer who is a member of a firm may not act as both advocate and witness by reason of conflict of interest, rule 4-1.10 disqualifies the firm also.</p>\n<p>4-3.8 <i>Special responsibilities of a prosecutor.</i> The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:</p>\n<p>(a) Refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probably cause;</p>\n<p>(b) Not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important pretrial rights such as a right to a preliminary hearing;</p>\n<p>(c) Make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations such as making a reasonable effort to assure that the accused has been advised of the right to, and the procedure for, obtaining counsel and has been given a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel so that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence. Precisely how far the prosecutor is required to go in this direction is a matter of debate. Florida has adopted the American Bar Association Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to Prosecution Function. This is the product of prolonged and careful deliberation by lawyers experienced in criminal prosecution and defense and should be consulted for further guidance. See also rule 4-3.3(d) governing ex parte proceedings, among which grand jury proceedings are included. Applicable law may require other measures by the prosecutor and knowing disregard of these obligations or systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion could constitute a violation of rule 4-8.4.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) does not apply to an accused appearing pro se with the approval of the tribunal, nor does it forbid the lawful questioning of a suspect who has knowingly waived the rights to counsel and silence.</p>\n<p>The exception in paragraph (c) recognizes that a prosecutor may seek an appropriate protective order from the tribunal if disclosure of information to the defense could result in substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.</p>\n<p>4-3.9 <i>Advocate in nonadjudicative proceedings.</i> A lawyer representing a client before a legislative or administrative tribunal in a nonadjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in a representative capacity and shall conform to the provisions of rules 4-3.3(a) through (c), 4-3.4(a) through (c), and 4-3.5(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>In representation before bodies such as legislatures, municipal councils, and executive and administrative agencies acting in a rule-making or policy-making capacity, lawyers present facts, formulate issues, and advance argument in the matters under consideration. The decision-making body, like a court, should be able to rely on the integrity of the submissions made to it. A lawyer appearing before such a body should deal with the tribunal honestly and in conformity with applicable rules of procedure.</p>\n<p>Lawyers have no exclusive right to appear before nonadjudicative bodies, as they do before a court. The requirements of this rule therefore may subject lawyers to regulations inapplicable to advocates who are not lawyers. However, legislatures and administrative agencies have a right to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1065</span> expect lawyers to deal with them as they deal with courts.</p>\n<p>This rule does not apply to representation of a client in a negotiation or other bilateral transaction with a governmental agency; representation in such a transaction is governed by rules 4-4.1 through 4-4.4.</p>\n<p>4-4 <i>Transactions with persons other than clients.</i></p>\n<p>4-4.1 <i>Truthfulness in statements to others.</i> In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>\n<p>(a) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; or</p>\n<p>(b) Fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Misrepresentation</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a client's behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if the lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by failure to act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Statements of fact</i></h2>\n<p>This rule refers to statements of fact. Whether a particular statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances. Under generally accepted conventions in negotiation, certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of material fact. Estimates of price or value placed on the subject of a transaction and a party's intentions as to an acceptable settlement of a claim are in this category and so is the existence of an undisclosed principal except where nondisclosure of the principal would constitute fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Fraud by client</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (b) recognizes that substantive law may require a lawyer to disclose certain information to avoid being deemed to have assisted the client's crime or fraud. The requirement of disclosure created by this paragraph is, however, subject to the obligations created by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>4-4.2 <i>Communication with person represented by counsel.</i> In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule does not prohibit communication with a party, or an employee or agent of a party, concerning matters outside the representation. For example, the existence of a controversy between a government agency and a private party, or between two (2) organizations, does not prohibit a lawyer for either from communicating with nonlawyer representatives of the other regarding a separate matter. Also, parties to a matter may communicate directly with each other and a lawyer having independent justification for communicating with the other party is permitted to do so. Communications authorized by law include, for example, the right of a party to a controversy with a government agency to speak with government officials about the matter.</p>\n<p>In the case of an organization, this rule prohibits communications by a lawyer for one party concerning the matter in representation with persons having a managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization and with any other person whose act or omission in connection with that matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization. If an agent or employee of the organization is represented in the matter by his or her own counsel, the consent by that counsel to a communication will be sufficient for purposes of this rule. Compare rule 4-3.4(f). This rule also covers any person, whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1066</span> or not a party to a formal proceeding, who is represented by counsel concerning the matter in question.</p>\n<p>4-4.3 <i>Dealing with unrepresented persons.</i> In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer's role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>An unrepresented person, particularly one not experienced in dealing with legal matters, might assume that a lawyer is disinterested in loyalties or is a disinterested authority on the law even when the lawyer represents a client. During the course of a lawyer's representation of a client, the lawyer should not give advice to an unrepresented person other than the advice to obtain counsel.</p>\n<p>4-4.4 <i>Respect for rights of third persons.</i> In representing a client a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person or knowingly use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Responsibility to a client requires a lawyer to subordinate the interests of others to those of the client, but that responsibility does not imply that a lawyer may disregard the rights of third persons. It is impractical to catalogue all such rights, but they include legal restrictions on methods of obtaining evidence from third persons.</p>\n<p>4-5 <i>Law firms and associations.</i></p>\n<p>4-5.1 <i>Responsibilities of a partner or supervisory lawyer.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having direct supervisory authority over another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer's violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, or has direct supervisory authority over the other lawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraphs (a) and (b) refer to lawyers who have supervisory authority over the professional work of a firm or legal department of a government agency. This includes members of a partnership and the shareholders in a law firm organized as a professional corporation; lawyers having supervisory authority in the law department of an enterprise or government agency; and lawyers who have intermediate managerial responsibilities in a firm.</p>\n<p>The measures required to fulfill the responsibility prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) can depend on the firm's structure and the nature of its practice. In a small firm, informal supervision and occasional admonition ordinarily might be sufficient. In a large firm, or in practice situations in which intensely difficult ethical problems frequently arise, more elaborate procedures may be necessary. Some firms, for example, have a procedure whereby junior lawyers can make confidential referral of ethical problems directly to a designated senior partner or special committee. See rule 4-5.2. Firms, whether large or small, may also rely on continuing legal education in professional ethics. In any event the ethical atmosphere of a firm can influence the conduct of all its members and a lawyer having authority over the work of another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1067</span> may not assume that the subordinate lawyer will inevitably conform to the rules.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (c)(1) expresses a general principle of responsibility for acts of another. See also rule 4-8.4(a).</p>\n<p>Paragraph (c)(2) defines the duty of a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over performance of specific legal work by another lawyer. Whether a lawyer has such supervisory authority in particular circumstances is a question of fact. Partners of a private firm have at least indirect responsibility for all work being done by the firm, while a partner in charge of a particular matter ordinarily has direct authority over other firm lawyers engaged in the matter. Appropriate remedial action by a partner would depend on the immediacy of the partner's involvement and the seriousness of the misconduct. The supervisor is required to intervene to prevent avoidable consequences of misconduct if the supervisor knows that the misconduct occurred. Thus, if a supervising lawyer knows that a subordinate misrepresented a matter to an opposing party in negotiation, the supervisor as well as the subordinate has a duty to correct the resulting misapprehension.</p>\n<p>Professional misconduct by a lawyer under supervision could reveal a violation of paragraph (b) on the part of the supervisory lawyer even though it does not entail a violation of paragraph (c) because there was no direction, ratification, or knowledge of the violation.</p>\n<p>Apart from this rule and rule 4-8.4(a), a lawyer does not have disciplinary liability for the conduct of a partner, associate, or subordinate. Whether a lawyer may be liable civilly or criminally for another lawyer's conduct is a question of law beyond the scope of these rules.</p>\n<p>4-5.2 <i>Responsibilities of a subordinate lawyer.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer is bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person.</p>\n<p>(b) A subordinate lawyer does not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if that lawyer acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyer's reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Although a lawyer is not relieved of responsibility for a violation by the fact that the lawyer acted at the direction of a supervisor, that fact may be relevant in determining whether a lawyer had the knowledge required to render conduct a violation of the rules. For example, if a subordinate filed a frivolous pleading at the direction of a supervisor, the subordinate would not be guilty of a professional violation unless the subordinate knew of the document's frivolous character.</p>\n<p>When lawyers in a supervisor-subordinate relationship encounter a matter involving professional judgment as to ethical duty, the supervisor may assume responsibility for making the judgment. Otherwise a consistent course of action or position could not be taken. If the question can reasonably be answered only one way, the duty of both lawyers is clear and they are equally responsible for fulfilling it. However, if the question is reasonably arguable, someone has to decide upon the course of action. That authority ordinarily reposes in the supervisor, and a subordinate may be guided accordingly. For example, if a question arises whether the interests of two (2) clients conflict under rule 4-1.7, the supervisor's reasonable resolution of the question should protect the subordinate professionally if the resolution is subsequently challenged.</p>\n<p>4-5.3 <i>Responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants.</i> With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</p>\n<p>(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1068</span> reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the person is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the person, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Lawyers generally employ assistants in their practice, including secretaries, investigators, law student interns, and paraprofessionals. Such assistants, whether employees or independent contractors, act for the lawyer in rendition of the lawyer's professional services. A lawyer should give such assistants appropriate instruction and supervision concerning the ethical aspects of their employment, particularly regarding the obligation not to disclose information relating to representation of the client, and should be responsible for their work product. The measures employed in supervising nonlawyers should take account of the fact that they do not have legal training and are not subject to professional discipline.</p>\n<p>4-5.4 <i>Professional independence of a lawyer.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer, except that:</p>\n<p>(1) An agreement by a lawyer with the lawyer's firm, partner, or associate may provide for the payment of money, over a reasonable period of time after the lawyer's death, to the lawyer's estate, or to one or more specified persons;</p>\n<p>(2) A lawyer who undertakes to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased lawyer may pay to the estate of the deceased lawyer that proportion of the total compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased lawyer; and</p>\n<p>(3) A lawyer or law firm may include nonlawyer employees in a compensation or retirement plan, even though the plan is based in whole or in part on a profit-sharing arrangement.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of the partnership consist of the practice of law.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer's professional judgment in rendering such legal services.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit if:</p>\n<p>(1) A nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of the estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable time during administration;</p>\n<p>(2) A nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof; or</p>\n<p>(3) A nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the professional judgment of a lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The provisions of this rule express traditional limitations on sharing fees. These limitations are to protect the lawyer's professional independence of judgment. Where someone other than the client pays the lawyer's fee or salary, or recommends employment of the lawyer, that arrangement does not modify the lawyer's obligation to the client. As stated in paragraph (c), such arrangements should not interfere with the lawyer's professional judgment.</p>\n<p>4-5.5 <i>Unlicensed practice of law.</i> A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1069</span> (a) Practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; or</p>\n<p>(b) Assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unlicensed practice of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The definition of the practice of law is established by law and varies from one jurisdiction to another. Whatever the definition, limiting the practice of law to members of the bar protects the public against rendition of legal services by unqualified persons. Paragraph (b) does not prohibit a lawyer from employing the services of paraprofessionals and delegating functions to them, so long as the lawyer supervises the delegated work and retains responsibility for their work. See rule 4-5.3. Likewise, it does not prohibit lawyers from providing professional advice and instruction to nonlawyers whose employment requires knowledge of law; for example, claims adjusters, employees of financial or commercial institutions, social workers, accountants, and persons employed in government agencies. In addition, a lawyer may counsel nonlawyers who wish to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p>4-5.6 <i>Restrictions on right to practice.</i> A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:</p>\n<p>(a) A partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; or</p>\n<p>(b) An agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer's right to practice is part of the settlement of a controversy between private parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>An agreement restricting the right of partners or associates to practice after leaving a firm not only limits their professional autonomy, but also limits the freedom of clients to choose a lawyer. Paragraph (a) prohibits such agreements except for restrictions incident to provisions concerning retirement benefits for service with the firm.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) prohibits a lawyer from agreeing not to represent other persons in connection with settling a claim on behalf of a client.</p>\n<p>4-6 <i>Public service.</i></p>\n<p>4-6.1 <i>Pro bono publico service.</i> A lawyer should render public interest legal service. A lawyer may discharge this responsibility by:</p>\n<p>(a) Providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to persons of limited means or to public service or charitable groups or organizations;</p>\n<p>(b) Service without compensation in public interest activities that improve the law, the legal system or the legal profession; or</p>\n<p>(c) Financial support for organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Each lawyer engaged in the practice of law has a responsibility to provide public interest legal services without fee, or at a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, charitable organization representation, and the administration of justice. This rule expresses that policy but is not intended to be enforced through disciplinary process.</p>\n<p>The rights and responsibilities of individuals and organizations in the United States are increasingly defined in legal terms. As a consequence, legal assistance in coping with the web of statutes, rules, and regulations is imperative for all persons.</p>\n<p>The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable to pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer. Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of legal services to the disadvantaged. The provision of free legal services to those unable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1070</span> to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer as well as the profession generally, but the efforts of individual lawyers are often not enough to meet the need. Thus, it has been necessary for the profession and government to institute additional programs to provide legal services. Accordingly, legal aid offices, lawyer referral services, and other related programs have been developed, and others will be developed by the profession and government. Every lawyer should support all proper efforts to meet this need for legal services.</p>\n<p>4-6.2 <i>Accepting appointments.</i> A lawyer shall not seek to avoid appointment by a tribunal to represent a person except for good cause, such as:</p>\n<p>(a) Representing the client is likely to result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or law;</p>\n<p>(b) Representing the client is likely to result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer; or</p>\n<p>(c) The client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer's ability to represent the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer ordinarily is not obliged to accept a client whose character or cause the lawyer regards as repugnant. The lawyer's freedom to select clients is, however, qualified. All lawyers have a responsibility to assist in providing pro bono publico service. See rule 4-6.1. An individual lawyer fulfills this responsibility by accepting a fair share of unpopular matters or indigent or unpopular clients. A lawyer may also be subject to appointment by a court to serve unpopular clients or persons unable to afford legal services.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appointed counsel</i></h2>\n<p>For good cause a lawyer may seek to decline an appointment to represent a person who cannot afford to retain counsel or whose cause is unpopular. Good cause exists if the lawyer could not handle the matter competently, see rule 4-1.1, or if undertaking the representation would result in an improper conflict of interest, for example, when the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer's ability to represent the client. A lawyer may also seek to decline an appointment if acceptance would be unreasonably burdensome, for example, when it would impose a financial sacrifice so great as to be unjust.</p>\n<p>An appointed lawyer has the same obligations to the client as retained counsel, including the obligations of loyalty and confidentiality, and is subject to the same limitations on the client-lawyer relationship, such as the obligation to refrain from assisting the client in violation of the rules.</p>\n<p>4-6.3 <i>Membership in legal services organization.</i> A lawyer may serve as a director, officer or member of a legal services organization, apart from the law firm in which the lawyer practices, notwithstanding that the organization serves persons having interests adverse to the client of the lawyer. The lawyer shall not knowingly participate in a decision or action of the organization:</p>\n<p>(a) If participating in the decision would be incompatible with the lawyer's obligations to a client under rule 4-1.7; or</p>\n<p>(b) Where the decision could have a material adverse effect on the representation of a client of the organization whose interests are adverse to a client of the lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Lawyers should be encouraged to support and participate in legal service organizations. A lawyer who is an officer or a member of such an organization does not thereby have a client-lawyer relationship with persons served by the organization. However, there is potential conflict between the interests of such persons and the interests of the lawyer's clients. If the possibility of such conflict disqualified a lawyer from serving on the board of a legal services organization, the profession's involvement in such organizations would be severely curtailed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1071</span> It may be necessary in appropriate cases to reassure a client of the organization that the representation will not be affected by conflicting loyalties of a member of the board. Established, written policies in this respect can enhance the credibility of such assurances.</p>\n<p>4-6.4 <i>Law reform activities affecting client interests.</i> A lawyer may serve as a director, officer, or member of an organization involved in reform of the law or its administration notwithstanding that the reform may affect the interests of a client of the lawyer. When the lawyer knows that the interests of a client may be materially affected by a decision in which the lawyer participates, the lawyer shall disclose that fact but need not identify the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Lawyers involved in organizations seeking law reform generally do not have a client-lawyer relationship with the organization. Otherwise, it might follow that a lawyer could not be involved in a bar association law reform program that might indirectly affect a client. See also rule 4-1.2(b). For example, a lawyer specializing in antitrust litigation might be regarded as disqualified from participating in drafting revisions of rules governing that subject. In determining the nature and scope of participation in such activities, a lawyer should be mindful of obligations to clients under other rules, particularly rule 4-1.7. A lawyer is professionally obligated to protect the integrity of the program by making an appropriate disclosure within the organization when the lawyer knows a private client might be materially affected.</p>\n<p>4-7 <i>Information about legal services.</i></p>\n<p>4-7.1 <i>Communications concerning a lawyer's services.</i> A lawyer shall not make or permit to be made a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer's services. A communication is false or misleading if it:</p>\n<p>(a) Contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading;</p>\n<p>(b) Is likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve or states or implies that the lawyer can achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; or</p>\n<p>(c) Compares the lawyer's services with other lawyers' services, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule governs all communications about a lawyer's services, including advertising permitted by rule 4-7.2. Whatever means are used to make known a lawyer's services, statements about them should be truthful. This includes any material misrepresentation or misleading omission such as where a lawyer states or implies certification or recognition as a specialist other than in accord with rule 4-7.4 or where a lawyer implies that any court, tribunal or other public body or official can be improperly influenced.</p>\n<p>The prohibition in paragraph (b) of statements that may create \"unjustified expectations\" would ordinarily preclude advertisements about results obtained on behalf of a client, such as the amount of a damage award or the lawyer's record in obtaining favorable verdicts, and advertisements containing client endorsements. Such information may create the unjustified expectation that similar results can be obtained for others without reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances.</p>\n<p>4-7.2 <i>Advertising.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Subject to the requirements of rule 4-7.1, a lawyer may advertise services through public media, such as a telephone directory, legal directory, newspaper or other periodical, outdoor, radio, or television advertising, or through written communication not involving solicitation as defined in rule 4-7.3.</p>\n<p>(b) A copy or recording of an advertisement or written communication shall be kept for three (3) years after its last dissemination along with a record of when and where it was used.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1072</span> (c) A lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer's services, except that a lawyer may pay the reasonable cost of advertising or written communication permitted by these rules and may pay the usual charges of a lawyer referral service or other legal service organization.</p>\n<p>(d) Any communication made pursuant to this rule shall include the name of at least one lawyer or the lawyer referral service responsible for its content.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>To assist the public in obtaining legal services, lawyers should be allowed to make known their services not only through reputation but also through organized information campaigns in the form of advertising. Advertising involves an active quest for clients, contrary to the tradition that a lawyer should not seek clientele. However, the public's need to know about legal services can be fulfilled in part through advertising. This need is particularly acute in the case of persons of moderate means who have not made extensive use of legal services. The interest in expanding public information about legal services ought to prevail over considerations of tradition. Nevertheless, advertising by lawyers entails the risk of practices that are misleading or overreaching.</p>\n<p>This rule permits public dissemination of information concerning a lawyer's name or firm name, address, and telephone number; the kinds of services the lawyer will undertake; the basis on which the lawyer's fees are determined, including prices for specific services and payment and credit arrangements; a lawyer's foreign language ability; names of references and, with their consent, names of clients regularly represented; and other information that might invite the attention of those seeking legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Questions of effectiveness and taste in advertising are matters of speculation and subjective judgment. Television is now one of the most powerful media for getting information to the public, particularly persons of low and moderate income; prohibiting television advertising, therefore, would impede the flow of information about legal services to many sectors of the public. Limiting the information that may be advertised has a similar effect and assumes that the bar can accurately forecast the kind of information that the public would regard as relevant. However, the content and format of a legal advertisement should comport with the dignity of the profession and promote public confidence in our legal system. Advertisements utilizing slogans, gimmicks, or other garish techniques, or the use of large electrical and neon signs, soundtracks, or other extravagant media, fail to meet these standards and diminish public confidence in the legal system.</p>\n<p>Neither this rule nor rule 4-7.3 prohibits communications authorized by law, such as notice to members of a class in class action litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Record of advertising</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (b) requires that a record of the content and use of advertising be kept in order to facilitate enforcement of this rule. It does not require that advertising be subject to review prior to dissemination. Such a requirement would be burdensome and expensive relative to its possible benefits, and may be of doubtful constitutionality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Paying others to recommend a lawyer</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is allowed to pay for advertising permitted by this rule, but otherwise is not permitted to pay another person for channeling professional work. This restriction does not prevent an organization or person other than the lawyer from advertising or recommending the lawyer's services. Thus, a legal aid agency or prepaid legal services plan may pay to advertise legal services provided under its auspices. Likewise, a lawyer may participate in lawyer referral programs and pay the usual fees charged by such programs, subject, however to the limitations imposed by rule 4-7.6. Paragraph (c) does not prohibit paying regular compensation to an assistant, such as a secretary, to prepare communications permitted by this rule.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1073</span> 4-7.3 <i>Direct contact with prospective clients.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer may not solicit professional employment from a prospective client with whom the lawyer has no family or prior professional relationship, in person or otherwise, when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain. The term \"solicit\" includes contact in person, by telephone or telegraph, or by other communication directed to a specific recipient and includes any written form of communication directed to a specific recipient and not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this rule.</p>\n<p>(b) Written communication.</p>\n<p>(1) Written communications to prospective clients for the purpose of obtaining professional employment are subject to the following requirements:</p>\n<p>a. Such written communications shall be plainly marked \"advertisement\" on the face of the envelope and at the top of each page of the written communication in type one size larger than the largest type used in the written communication.</p>\n<p>b. A copy of each such written communication shall be sent to staff counsel at bar headquarters and another copy shall be retained by the lawyer for three (3) years. If written communications identical in content are sent to two (2) or more prospective clients, the lawyer may comply with this requirement by sending a single copy together with a list of the names and addresses of persons to whom the written communication was sent to staff counsel at bar headquarters as well as retaining the same information.</p>\n<p>(2) A lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit to be sent, on behalf of himself, his firm, his partner, an associate, or any other lawyer affiliated with him or his firm a written communication to a prospective client for the purpose of obtaining professional employment if:</p>\n<p>a. The written communication concerns a specific matter and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person to whom the communication is directed is represented by a lawyer in the matter;</p>\n<p>b. It has been made known to the lawyer that the person does not want to receive such communications from the lawyer;</p>\n<p>c. The communication involves coercion, duress, fraud, overreaching, harassment, intimidation, or undue influence;</p>\n<p>d. The communication contains a false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive statement or claim or is improper under rule 4-7.1; or</p>\n<p>e. The lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the physical, emotional, or mental state of the person makes it unlikely that the person would exercise reasonable judgment in employing a lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>There is a potential for abuse inherent in direct solicitation by a lawyer of prospective clients known to need legal services. It subjects the lay person to the private importuning of a trained advocate, in a direct interpersonal encounter. A prospective client often feels overwhelmed by the situation giving rise to the need for legal services and may have an impaired capacity for reason, judgment, and protective self-interest. Furthermore, the lawyer seeking the retainer is faced with a conflict stemming from the lawyer's own interest, which may color the advice and representation offered the vulnerable prospect.</p>\n<p>The situation is therefore fraught with the possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching. This potential for abuse inherent in direct solicitation of prospective clients justifies its prohibition, particularly since lawyer advertising permitted under rule 4-7.2 offers an alternative means of communicating necessary information to those who may be in need of legal services.</p>\n<p>Advertising makes it possible for a prospective client to be informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available lawyers and law firms, without subjecting the prospective <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1074</span> client to direct personal persuasion that may overwhelm the client's judgment.</p>\n<p>The use of general advertising to transmit information from lawyer to prospective client, rather than direct private contact, will help to assure that the information flows cleanly as well as freely. Advertising is out in public view, thus subject to scrutiny by those who know the lawyer. This informal review is itself likely to help guard against statements and claims that might constitute false or misleading communications in violation of rule 4-7.1. Direct private communications from a lawyer to a prospective client are not subject to such third-party scrutiny and consequently are much more likely to approach (and occasionally cross) the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading.</p>\n<p>Direct written communications seeking employment by specific prospective clients present less potential for abuse or overreaching than in-person solicitation and are therefore not prohibited, but are subject to reasonable restrictions designed to minimize or preclude abuse and overreaching and to ensure lawyer accountability if such should occur. Thus, it is appropriate to limit the circumstances under which such direct contact is permitted; require the identification of such communication by nature; and require the keeping of a record of such direct contact for a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>Similarly, this rule would not prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or groups that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for its members, insureds, beneficiaries, or other third parties for the purpose of informing such entities of the availability of and details concerning the plan or arrangement which the lawyer or his or her firm is willing to offer. This form of communication is not directed to a specific prospective client known to need legal services related to a particular matter. Rather, it is usually addressed to an individual acting in a fiduciary capacity seeking a supplier of legal services for others who may, if they choose, become prospective clients of the lawyer. Under these circumstances, the activity which the lawyer undertakes in communicating with such representatives and the type of information transmitted to the individual are functionally similar to and serve the same purpose as advertising permitted under rule 4-7.2.</p>\n<p>4-7.4 <i>Communication of fields of practice.</i> A lawyer may communicate the fact that the lawyer does or does not practice in particular fields of law. A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is a specialist except as follows:</p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer admitted to engage in patent practice before the United States patent and trademark office may use the designation \"patent attorney\" or a substantially similar designation;</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer engaged in admiralty practice may use the designation \"admiralty,\" \"proctor in admiralty,\" or a substantially similar designation;</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer who complies with the Florida Certification Plan as set forth in chapter 6, Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, or who is certified by a national group which has standards for certification substantially the same as those set out in chapter 6, may inform the public and other lawyers of his or her certified areas of legal practice; and</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer who complies with the Florida Designation Plan as set forth in chapter 6, Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, may inform the public and other lawyers of his or her designated areas of legal practice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule permits a lawyer to indicate areas of practice in communications about the lawyer's services; for example, in a telephone directory or other advertising. If a lawyer practices only in certain fields, or will not accept matters except in such fields, the lawyer is permitted so to indicate.</p>\n<p>Recognition of specialization in patent matters is a matter of long-established policy of the patent and trademark office. Designation of admiralty practice has a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1075</span> long historical tradition associated with maritime commerce and the federal courts.</p>\n<p>4-7.5 <i>Firm names and letterheads.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not use a firm name, letterhead, or other professional designation that violates rule 4-7.1. A trade name may be used by a lawyer in private practice if it does not imply a connection with a government agency or with a public or charitable legal services organization and is not otherwise in violation of rule 4-7.1.</p>\n<p>(b) A law firm with offices in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located.</p>\n<p>(c) The name of a lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any substantial period in which the lawyer is not actively and regularly practicing with the firm.</p>\n<p>(d) Lawyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization only when that is the fact.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A firm may be designated by the names of all or some of its members, by the names of deceased members where there has been a continuing succession in the firm's identity or by a trade name such as the \"ABC Legal Clinic.\" Although the United States Supreme Court has held that legislation may prohibit the use of trade names in professional practice, use of such names in law practice is acceptable so long as it is not misleading. If a private firm uses a trade name that includes a geographical name such as \"Springfield Legal Clinic,\" an express disclaimer that it is a public legal aid agency may be required to avoid a misleading implication. It may be observed that any firm name including the name of a deceased partner is, strictly speaking, a trade name. The use of such names to designate law firms has proven a useful means of identification. However, it is misleading to use the name of a lawyer not associated with the firm or a predecessor of the firm.</p>\n<p>With regard to paragraph (d), lawyers sharing office facilities, but who are not in fact partners, may not denominate themselves as, for example, \"Smith and Jones,\" for that title suggests partnership in the practice of law.</p>\n<p>4-7.6 <i>Lawyer referral services.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not accept referrals from a lawyer referral service unless the service:</p>\n<p>(1) Engages in no communication with the public and in no direct contact with prospective clients in a manner that would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if the communication or contact were made by the lawyer;</p>\n<p>(2) Receives no fee or charge that constitutes a division or sharing of fees, unless the service is a not-for-profit service approved by The Florida Bar pursuant to chapter 8 of these rules;</p>\n<p>(3) Refers clients only to persons lawfully permitted to practice law in Florida when the services to be rendered constitute the practice of law in Florida.</p>\n<p>(4) Requires the lawyer to waive confidentiality for the purpose of enabling The Florida Bar to inform the service of the lawyer's grievance history and the status of each complaint against the lawyer in which there has been a finding of probable cause;</p>\n<p>(5) Carries or requires each lawyer participating in the service to carry professional liability insurance in an amount not less than $100,000 per claim or occurrence;</p>\n<p>(6) Furnishes The Florida Bar with the names of all lawyers participating in the service; and</p>\n<p>(7) Neither represents nor implies to the public that the service is endorsed or approved by The Florida Bar, unless the service is operated by or has been expressly approved by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(b) A \"lawyer referral service\" is any person, group of persons, association, organization, or entity that receives a fee or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1076</span> charge for referring or causing the direct or indirect referral of a potential client to a lawyer drawn from a specific group or panel of lawyers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Every citizen of the state should have ready access to the legal system. A person's access to the legal system is enhanced by the assistance of a lawyer qualified to handle that person's legal needs. Many of the citizens of the state who are potential consumers of legal services encounter difficulty in identifying and locating lawyers who are willing and qualified to consult with them about their legal needs. Lawyer referral services can facilitate the identification and intelligent selection of lawyers qualified to render assistance. However, because a potential for abuse exists, the participation of lawyers in referral services must be regulated to ensure protection of the public.</p>\n<p>It is in the public interest that a person seeking the assistance of counsel receive accurate information to select or be matched with counsel qualified to render the needed services. Therefore, a lawyer should not participate in a lawyer referral service that communicates misleading information to the public or that directly contacts prospective clients about available legal services in a manner that constitutes impermissible solicitation.</p>\n<p>A person who avails himself of legal services is well served only if those services are rendered by a lawyer who exercises independent legal judgment. The division or sharing of a fee risks the creation of an obligation that impairs a lawyer's ability to exercise independent legal judgment. Therefore, the public interest usually compels the ethical prohibition against the division or sharing of fees and that ethical prohibition should likewise apply to the division or sharing of fees with a lawyer referral service. The prohibition does not extend to the lawyer's paying a pre-arranged, fixed-sum participation fee. Furthermore, the prohibition does not apply when the referring agency is a not-for-profit service operated by a bona fide state or local bar association under the supervision of and approved by The Florida Bar in order to ensure that such service fulfills the public-interest purposes of a lawyer referral service and to ensure that the risk of impairment of the lawyer's ability to exercise independent legal judgment is in that circumstance minimal.</p>\n<p>It is in the public interest that a person receive legal services only from someone who is qualified to render them. Lawyers should strive to prevent harm resulting from the rendering of legal services by persons not legally qualified to do so. Therefore, a lawyer should not participate in a lawyer referral service that refers clients to persons not lawfully permitted to practice law in Florida when the services to be rendered constitute the practice of law in Florida.</p>\n<p>A lawyer whose conduct is or has been the subject of disciplinary action by The Florida Bar should not be able to conceal that fact from prospective clients through the initial anonymity provided by a lawyer referral service. Therefore, a lawyer should participate in a lawyer referral service only if that service requires him to waive confidentiality for the purpose of permitting the service to obtain from The Florida Bar information about the lawyer's disciplinary record so that the service can take appropriate action.</p>\n<p>The quasi-institutionalization of legal services by a lawyer referral service implies that the service has screened the qualifications and financial responsibility of its participating lawyers. That implication may be misleading and does not exist when a prospective client directly selects a lawyer at arm's length. Therefore, it is in the public interest that only lawyers who have established a certain amount of financial responsibility for professional liability participate in a lawyer referral service. Accordingly, a lawyer should participate in a lawyer referral service only if the service requires proof of that financial responsibility.</p>\n<p>To enable The Florida Bar to fulfill its obligation to protect the public from unethical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1077</span> or other improper conduct by those who practice law in Florida, The Florida Bar must have available to it the identity of all lawyers participating in a lawyer referral service. Therefore, a lawyer should participate in a lawyer referral service only if the service furnishes The Florida Bar with the names of its participating lawyers.</p>\n<p>4-8 <i>Maintaining the integrity of the profession.</i></p>\n<p>4-8.1 <i>Bar admission and disciplinary matters.</i> An applicant for admission to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</p>\n<p>(a) Knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or</p>\n<p>(b) Fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The duty imposed by this rule extends to persons seeking admission to the bar as well as to lawyers. Hence, if a person makes a material false statement in connection with an application for admission, it may be the basis for subsequent disciplinary action if the person is admitted and in any event may be relevant in a subsequent admission application. The duty imposed by this rule applies to a lawyer's own admission or discipline as well as that of others. Thus, it is a separate professional offense for a lawyer to knowingly make a misrepresentation or omission in connection with a disciplinary investigation of the lawyer's own conduct. This rule also requires affirmative clarification of any misunderstanding on the part of the admissions or disciplinary authority of which the person involved becomes aware.</p>\n<p>This rule is subject to the provisions of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of Florida's Constitution. A person relying on such a provision in response to a question, however, should do so openly and not use the right of nondisclosure as a justification for failure to comply with this rule.</p>\n<p>A lawyer representing an applicant for admission to the bar, or representing a lawyer who is the subject of a disciplinary inquiry or proceeding, is governed by the rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship.</p>\n<p>4-8.2 <i>Judicial and legal officials.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge, adjudicatory officer, or public legal officer or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial or legal office.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable provisions of Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Assessments by lawyers are relied on in evaluating the professional or personal fitness of persons being considered for election or appointment to judicial office and to public legal offices, such as attorney general, prosecuting attorney and public defender. Expressing honest and candid opinions on such matters contributes to improving the administration of justice. Conversely, false statements by a lawyer can unfairly undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p>When a lawyer seeks judicial office, the lawyer should be bound by applicable limitations on political activity.</p>\n<p>To maintain the fair and independent administration of justice, lawyers are encouraged to continue traditional efforts to defend judges and courts unjustly criticized.</p>\n<p>4-8.3 <i>Reporting professional misconduct.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer having knowledge that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1078</span> as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the appropriate professional authority.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having knowledge that a judge has committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question as to the judge's fitness for office shall inform the appropriate authority.</p>\n<p>(c) This rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Self-regulation of the legal profession requires that members of the profession initiate disciplinary investigation when they know of a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Lawyers have a similar obligation with respect to judicial misconduct. An apparently isolated violation may indicate a pattern of misconduct that only a disciplinary investigation can uncover. Reporting a violation is especially important where the victim is unlikely to discover the offense.</p>\n<p>A report about misconduct is not required where it would involve violation of rule 4-1.6. However a lawyer should encourage a client to consent to disclosure where prosecution would not substantially prejudice the client's interests.</p>\n<p>If a lawyer were obliged to report every violation of the rules, the failure to report any violation would itself be a professional offense. Such a requirement existed in many jurisdictions, but proved to be unenforceable. This rule limits the reporting obligation to those offenses that a self-regulating profession must vigorously endeavor to prevent. A measure of judgment is, therefore, required in complying with the provisions of this rule. The term \"substantial\" refers to the seriousness of the possible offense and not the quantum of evidence of which the lawyer is aware.</p>\n<p>The duty to report professional misconduct does not apply to a lawyer retained to represent a lawyer whose professional conduct is in question. Such a situation is governed by the rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship.</p>\n<p>4-8.4 <i>Misconduct.</i> A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p>(a) Violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</p>\n<p>(b) Commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</p>\n<p>(c) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;</p>\n<p>(d) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;</p>\n<p>(e) State or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official; or</p>\n<p>(f) Knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Many kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on fitness to practice law, such as offenses involving fraud and the offense of willful failure to file an income tax return. However, some kinds of offense carry no such implication. Traditionally, the distinction was drawn in terms of offenses involving \"moral turpitude.\" That concept can be construed to include offenses concerning some matters of personal morality, such as adultery and comparable offenses, that have no specific connection to fitness for the practice of law. Although a lawyer is personally answerable to the entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally answerable only for offenses that indicate lack of those characteristics relevant to law practice. Offenses involving violence, dishonesty, or breach of trust or serious interference with the administration of justice are in that category. A pattern of repeated offenses, even ones of minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to legal obligation.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may refuse to comply with an obligation imposed by law upon a good faith belief that no valid obligation exists. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1079</span> The provisions of rule 4-1.2(d) concerning a good faith challenge to the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law apply to challenges of legal regulation of the practice of law.</p>\n<p>Lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of other citizens. A lawyer's abuse of public office can suggest an inability to fulfill the professional role of attorney. The same is true of abuse of positions of private trust such as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or agent and officer, director, or manager of a corporation or other organization.</p>\n<p>4-8.5 <i>Jurisdiction.</i> A lawyer admitted to practice in this jurisdiction is subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction although engaged in practice elsewhere.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>In modern practice lawyers frequently act outside the territorial limits of the jurisdiction in which they are licensed to practice, either in another state or outside the United States. In doing so, they remain subject to the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which they are licensed to practice. If their activity in another jurisdiction is substantial and continuous, it may constitute practice of law in that jurisdiction. See rule 4-5.5.</p>\n<p>If the Rules of Professional Conduct in the two (2) jurisdictions differ, principles of conflict of laws may apply. Similar problems can arise when a lawyer is licensed to practice in more than one jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Where the lawyer is licensed to practice law in two (2) jurisdictions which impose conflicting obligations, applicable rules of choice of law may govern the situation. A related problem arises with respect to practice before a federal tribunal where the general authority of the states to regulate the practice of law must be reconciled with such authority as federal tribunals may have to regulate practice before them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chapter 5</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>RULES REGULATING TRUST ACCOUNTS</h2>\n<p>5-1 <i>Generally.</i></p>\n<p>5-1.1 <i>Trust accounts.</i> Money or other property entrusted to an attorney for a specific purpose, including advances for costs and expenses, is held in trust and must be applied only to that purpose. Money and other property of clients coming into the hands of an attorney are not subject to counterclaim or setoff for attorney fees, and a refusal to account for and deliver over such property upon demand shall be deemed a conversion. This is not to preclude the retention of money or other property upon which the lawyer has a valid lien for services or to preclude the payment of agreed fees from the proceeds of transactions or collection. Controversies as to the amount of fees are not grounds for disciplinary proceedings unless the amount demanded is clearly excessive, extortionate, or fraudulent. In a controversy alleging a clearly excessive, extortionate, or fraudulent fee, announced willingness of an attorney to submit a dispute as to the amount of a fee to a competent tribunal for determination may be considered in any determination as to intent or in mitigation of discipline; provided, such willingness shall not preclude admission of any other relevant admissible evidence relating to such controversy, including evidence as to the withholding of funds or property of the client, or to other injury to the client occasioned by such controversy.</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Trust accounts required</i> Any bank or savings and loan association account maintained by a member of The Florida Bar to comply with rule 4-1.5, Rules of Professional Conduct, is and shall be clearly labeled and designated as a trust account. Any safe deposit box used in connection with the practice of law in Florida maintained by a member of The Florida Bar to comply with rule 4-1.15 shall be located in this state unless the client otherwise consents in writing. A member of The Florida Bar shall advise any institution in which such deposit box is located that it may include property of clients.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Trust accounts as official records.</i> A member of The Florida Bar shall preserve or cause to be preserved the records of all bank and savings and loan association <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1080</span> accounts or other records pertaining to the funds or property of a client maintained in compliance with rule 4-1.5 for a period of not less than six (6) years subsequent to the final conclusion of the representation of a client relative to such funds or property, whichever shall last occur. Such records shall include checkbooks, cancelled checks, check stubs, vouchers, ledgers and journals, closing statements, accountings or other statements of disbursements rendered to clients or other parties with regard to trust funds, or similar equivalent records clearly and expressly reflecting the date, amount, source, and reason for all receipts, withdrawals, deliveries, and disbursements of the funds or property of a client. Such records shall be kept pursuant to these rules as a specific prerequisite to the right to receive, deliver and disburse funds or property of a client and to have a public aspect relating to the protection of clients and to fitness of a member of The Florida Bar to practice law. In any instance of an alleged violation by a member of The Florida Bar of this rule or of any of the Rules of Professional Conduct, such records insofar as they may relate in any way to the transaction, occurrence, or client in question shall be produced by the members of The Florida Bar for inspection, audit, and copying by a designated representative of The Florida Bar upon the direction of this Court, a grievance committee, the board of governors if acting pursuant to rule 3-7.4(b), or a referee. Such records or copies thereof shall be admissible in evidence in any proceeding under this rule; provided notice of such intended use shall be given to any client involved, if practicable, unless such client is already aware of such intended use, and upon good cause shown by such client the admission of the same shall be under such conditions as shall be reasonably calculated thereafter to protect the confidences of such client in the event that the proceedings otherwise become public records. Permissible means of protection shall not prejudice the respondent and may include but are not limited to excision, in camera production, retention in sealed envelopes, or similar devices. Failure to maintain such records or to produce them upon such direction shall constitute ground for disciplinary action under this rule without regard to any other matter. The cost of any audit or investigation necessitated by such failure may be taxed against a respondent.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Trust accounting.</i> Minimum trust accounting records shall be maintained and minimum trust accounting procedures must be followed by all attorneys practicing in Florida who receive or disburse trust money or property.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Interest-bearing trust accounts.</i> A member of The Florida Bar who elects to create or maintain an interest-bearing trust account for client's funds which are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time for the benefit of The Florida Bar Foundation shall comply with the following provisions:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Eligible institutions.</i> An interest-bearing trust account may be established with any bank or savings and loan association authorized by federal or state law to do business in Florida and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Funds in each interest-bearing trust account shall be subject to withdrawal upon request and without delay.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Interest rates.</i> The rate of interest payable on any interest-bearing trust account shall not be less than the rate paid by the depository institution to regular, nonattorney depositors. Higher rates offered by the institution to customers whose deposits exceed certain time or quantity minima, such as those offered in the form of certificates of deposit, may be obtained by a lawyer or law firm on some or all of deposited funds so long as there is no impairment of the right to withdraw or transfer principal immediately.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Remittance instructions.</i> Lawyers or law firms electing to deposit client funds in a trust savings account shall direct the depository institution:</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1081</span> a. <i>Quarterly remittance.</i> To remit interest or dividends, as the case may be, on the average monthly balance in the account or as otherwise computed in accordance with an institution's standard accounting practice, at least quarterly, to The Florida Bar Foundation, Inc.;</p>\n<p>b. <i>Remit to bar foundation.</i> To transmit with each remittance to the foundation a statement showing the name of the lawyer or law firm for whom the remittance is sent and the rate of interest applied; and</p>\n<p>c. <i>Report to law firm.</i> To transmit to the depositing lawyer or law firm at the same time a report showing the amount paid to the foundation, the rate of interest applied, and the average account balance of the period for which the report is made.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Unidentifiable trust fund accumulations and trust funds held for missing owners.</i> When an attorney's trust account contains an unidentifiable accumulation of trust funds or property, or trust funds or property held for missing owners, such funds or property shall be so designated. Diligent search and inquiry shall then be made by the attorney to determine the beneficial owner of any unidentifiable accumulation or the address of any missing owner. If the beneficial owner of a unidentified accumulation is determined, the funds shall be properly identified as his or her trust property. If a missing beneficial owner is located, the trust funds or property shall be paid over or delivered to the beneficial owner if he or she is then entitled to receive the same. Trust funds and property which remain unidentifiable and funds or property which are held for missing owners after being designated as such shall, after diligent search and inquiry fails to identify the beneficial owner or owner's address, be disposed of as provided in chapter 717, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>(f) A lawyer generally may not use, endanger, or encumber money held in trust for a client for purposes of carrying out the business of another client without the permission of the owner given after full disclosure of the circumstances. However, certain categories of trust account deposits are considered to carry a limited and acceptable risk of failure so that disbursements of trust account funds may be made in reliance on such deposits without disclosure to and permission of clients owning trust account funds subject to possibly being affected. Except for disbursements based upon any of the six (6) categories of limited-risk uncollected deposits enumerated below, a lawyer may not disburse funds held for a client or on behalf of that client unless the funds held for that client are collected funds. For purposes of this provision, \"collected funds\" means funds deposited, finally settled, and credited to the lawyer's trust account. Notwithstanding that a deposit made by a lawyer to his or her trust account has not been finally settled and credited to the account, the lawyer may disburse funds from his or her trust account in reliance on such deposit under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>(1) When the deposit is made by certified check or cashier's check.</p>\n<p>(2) When the deposit is made by a check or draft representing loan proceeds issued by a federally or state-chartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or other duly licensed or chartered institutional lender.</p>\n<p>(3) When the deposit is made by a bank check, official check, treasurer's check, money order, or other such instrument issued by a bank, savings and loan association, or credit union within the State of Florida when the lawyer has reasonable and prudent grounds to believe the instrument will clear and constitute collected funds in the lawyer's trust account within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>(4) When the deposit is made by a check drawn on the trust account of a lawyer licensed to practice in the State of Florida or on the escrow or trust account of a real estate broker licensed under chapter 475 of the Florida Statutes when the lawyer has a reasonable and prudent belief that the deposit will clear and constitute collected funds in his or her trust account within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1082</span> (5) When the deposit is made by a check issued by the United States government, the State of Florida, or any agency or political subdivision of the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>(6) When the deposit is made by a check or draft issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Florida and the lawyer has a reasonable and prudent belief that the instrument will clear and constitute collected funds in his or her trust account within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>A lawyer's disbursement of funds from his or her trust account in reliance on deposits that are not yet collected funds in any circumstances other than those set forth above, when it results in funds of other clients being used, endangered, or encumbered without authorization, may be grounds for a finding of professional misconduct. In any event, such a disbursement is at the risk of the lawyer making the disbursement. If any of the deposits fail, the lawyer upon obtaining knowledge of the failure must immediately act to protect the property of his or her other clients. However, if the lawyer accepting any such check personally pays the amount of any failed deposit or secures or arranges payment from sources available to him or her other than trust account funds of other clients, the lawyer shall not be considered guilty of professional misconduct.</p>\n<p>5-1.2 <i>Trust accounting records and procedures.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Applicability.</i> The provisions of these rules apply to all trust funds received or disbursed by members of The Florida Bar in the course of their professional practice of law within the State of Florida except special trust funds received or disbursed by attorney as guardian, personal representative, receiver, or in a similar capacity such as trustee under a specific trust document where the trust funds are maintained in a segregated special trust account and not the general trust account and wherein this special trust position has been created, approved, or sanctioned by law or an order of a court which has authority or duty to issue orders pertaining to maintenance of such special trust account.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Minimum trust accounting records.</i> The minimum trust accounting records which shall be maintained are:</p>\n<p>(1) A separate bank account or accounts and, if utilized, a separate savings and loan association account or accounts. Such accounts shall be located in the State of Florida unless the client otherwise directs, in writing, or unless the financial institution in which the funds are maintained voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida. Such voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida shall be on the form prescribed by the board of governors of The Florida Bar. The account or accounts shall be in the name of the lawyer or law firm and clearly labeled and designated as a \"trust account.\"</p>\n<p>(2) Original or duplicate deposit slips and, in the case of currency or coin, an additional cash receipts book, clearly identifying:</p>\n<p>a. The date and source of all trust funds received; and</p>\n<p>b. The client or matter for which the funds were received.</p>\n<p>(3) Original canceled checks, all of which must be numbered consecutively.</p>\n<p>(4) Other documentary support for all disbursements and transfers from the trust account.</p>\n<p>(5) A separate cash receipts and disbursements journal, including columns for receipts, disbursements, transfers, and the account balance, and containing at least:</p>\n<p>a. The identification of the client or matter for which the funds were received, disbursed, or transferred;</p>\n<p>b. The date on which all trust funds were received, disbursed, or transferred;</p>\n<p>c. The check number for all disbursements; and</p>\n<p>d. The reason for which all trust funds were received, disbursed, or transferred.</p>\n<p>(6) A separate file or ledger with an individual card or page for each client or matter, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1083</span> showing all individual receipts, disbursements, or transfers and any unexpended balance, and containing:</p>\n<p>a. The identification of the client or matter for which trust funds were received, disbursed, or transferred;</p>\n<p>b.

In addition to actual pretrial and trial process, \"civil trial law\" includes evaluating, handling, and resolving civil controversies prior to the initiation of suit.</p>\n<p>(b) The \"practice of law\" for this area is defined as set out at rule 6-3.5(c)(1). Practice of law which otherwise satisfies these requirements but which is on a part-time basis will satisfy the requirement if the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1092</span> balance of the applicant's activity is spent as a teacher of civil trial subjects in an accredited law school.</p>\n<p>6-4.3 <i>Minimum standards.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Substantial involvement.</i> To become certified as a civil trial lawyer, a lawyer must demonstrate substantial involvement in civil trial law. Substantial involvement shall include:</p>\n<p>(1) At least five (5) years of actual practice of law of which at least thirty (30) percent has been spent in active participation in civil trial law. At least three (3) years of this practice shall be immediately preceding application or, during those three (3) years, the applicant may have served as a judge of a court of general civil jurisdiction adjudicating civil trial matters.</p>\n<p>(2) The trial of a minimum of fifteen (15) contested civil cases in courts of general jurisdiction (excluding dissolution of marriage cases) during his or her practice. Of these fifteen (15) cases several shall have been jury cases, several shall have been conducted by the applicant as lead counsel and several shall have been submitted to the trier of fact.

An applicant must furnish information concerning the frequency of his or her work and the nature of the issues involved. For the purposes of this section the \"practice of law\" shall be as defined in rules 6-3.5(b)(1) and 6-9.2(b) except that it shall also include time devoted to lecturing and/or authoring books or articles on fields of real estate law if the applicant was engaged in the practice of law during such period.

A person's access to the legal system is enhanced by the assistance of a qualified lawyer. Citizens often encounter difficulty in identifying and locating lawyers who are willing and qualified to consult with them about their legal needs. To this end bona fide not-for-profit state and local bar associations are uniquely qualified to provide lawyer referral services under supervision by The Florida Bar for the benefit of the public. It is the policy of The Florida Bar to support the establishment of local lawyer referral services and to encourage those services to: (a) make legal services readily available to the general public through a referral method which considers the client's financial circumstances, spoken language, geographical convenience, and the type and complexity of the client's legal problem; (b) provide information about lawyers and the availability of legal services that will aid in the selection of a lawyer; (c) inform the public when and where to seek legal services and provide an initial determination of whether those services are necessary or advisable; and (d) provide referral to consumer, government, and other agencies when the individual's best interests so dictate.</p>\n<p>8-2 <i>Requirements.</i></p>\n<p>8-2.1 <i>Requirements for establishing a lawyer referral service sponsored by a local bar association.</i> The board of governors of The Florida Bar may adopt such regulations as it deems desirable governing the establishment, operation and termination of lawyer referral services operated by a local bar association.</p>\n<p>No local bar association shall operate a lawyer referral service except upon application to and approval by the board of governors of The Florida Bar.

Such application shall contain:</p>\n<p>(a) A statement of the benefits to the public to be achieved by the implementation of the lawyer referral service.</p>\n<p>(b) Proof that the referral service is established and operated by a nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), or 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p>(c) The proposed bylaws or rules and regulations which will govern the lawyer referral service. The proposed bylaws shall include the following regulations:</p>\n<p>(1) All members of the proposed referral service shall provide proof of professional liability insurance in the minimum amount of $100,000 unless the proposed lawyer referral service itself carries professional liability insurance in an amount not less than $100,000 per claim or occurrence.</p>\n<p>(2) The proposed lawyer referral service shall accept membership applications only from attorneys who maintain an office in the geographic area served by the proposed lawyer referral service.</p>\n<p>(3) The proposed lawyer referral service shall require a waiver of confidentiality for each member limited to and for the sole purpose of enabling The Florida Bar to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1108</span> inform the service of the lawyer's grievance history and the status of each complaint against the lawyer in which there has been a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(4) The proposed lawyer referral service shall agree to maintain an alphabetical member list, updated quarterly, with The Florida Bar. In turn, The Florida Bar shall notify the service of any unresolved finding of probable cause against a member. When probable cause has been found at the local grievance committee level, and the lawyer referral service has been notified, such service shall be required to hold referral to the member in question until the matter is resolved. If the member is in good standing with The Florida Bar after the resolution of the matter, then he or she may be returned to the service.</p>\n<p>(d) The estimated number of lawyers who will participate in the service.</p>\n<p>(e) The number of lawyers in the area.</p>\n<p>(f) A statement of the condition that evidences a need for such service in the area.</p>\n<p>(g) The geographic area in which the proposed referral service will operate.</p>\n<p>(h) A statement of how the lawyer referral service will be conducted.</p>\n<p>(i) A statement of fees to be charged by the lawyer referral service, including but not limited to fees charged by the referral service to members of the public using such service and fees charged by the referral service or remitted to the referral service by member attorneys.</p>\n<p>(j) A statement that such lawyer referral service will be open for referral to the members of the public without regard to race, sex, national origin, or economic status.</p>\n<p>(k) A statement that the local bar association is representative of the profession in the area of the service and is open to all members of the profession on an equal basis.</p>\n<p>8-2.3 <i>Approval of application.</i> The board of governors may approve or disapprove the application to operate a lawyer referral service or it may call for additional information upon which to base its decision.

A legal aid organization seeking approval from the Supreme Court of Florida for the purposes of this chapter shall file a petition with the clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida certifying that it is a not-for-profit organization and reciting with specificity:</p>\n<p>(1) The structure of the organization and whether it accepts funds from its clients;</p>\n<p>(2) The major sources of funds used by the organization;</p>\n<p>(3) The criteria used to determine potential clients' eligibility for legal services performed by the organization;</p>\n<p>(4) The types of legal and nonlegal services performed by the organization;</p>\n<p>(5) The names of all members of The Florida Bar who are employed by the organization or who regularly perform legal work for the organization; and</p>\n<p>(6) The existence and extent of malpractice insurance which will cover the emeritus attorney.</p>\n<p>(c) A \"supervising attorney\" as used herein is an active member of The Florida Bar who directs and supervises an emeritus attorney engaged in activities permitted by this chapter.

The approved legal aid organization shall be entitled to receive all court-awarded attorneys' fees for any representation rendered by the emeritus attorney.</p>\n<p>12-1.5 <i>Certification.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Permission for an emeritus attorney to perform services under this chapter shall become effective upon filing with and approval by the clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida of:</p>\n<p>(1) A certification by an approved legal aid organization stating that the emeritus attorney is currently associated with that legal aid organization and that an attorney employed by or participating as a volunteer with that organization will assume the duties of the supervising attorney required hereunder;</p>\n<p>(2) A certificate from the highest court or agency in the state, territory, or district in which the emeritus attorney previously has been licensed to practice law, certifying that the emeritus attorney has fulfilled the requirements of active bar membership and has a clear disciplinary record as required by rule 12-1.2(a)(2); and</p>\n<p>(3) A sworn statement by the emeritus attorney that he or she:</p>\n<p>a.

The emeritus attorney has ceased to be associated with the organization, which notice must be filed within five (5) days after such association has ceased; or</p>\n<p>b. Certification of such attorney is withdrawn. An approved legal aid organization may withdraw certification at any time and it is not necessary that the notice state the cause for such withdrawal.</p>\n<p>A copy of the notice filed with the clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida shall be mailed by the organization to the emeritus attorney concerned.</p>\n<p>(2) By the Supreme Court of Florida, in its discretion, at any time, stating that permission to perform services under this chapter has been revoked. A copy of such notice shall be mailed by the clerk of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1121</span> Supreme Court of Florida to the emeritus attorney involved and to the approved legal aid organization by which he or she had been certified.</p>\n<p>(b) If an emeritus attorney's certification is withdrawn, for any reason, the supervising attorney shall immediately file a notice of such action in the official file of each matter pending before any court or tribunal in which the emeritus attorney was involved.</p>\n<p>12-1.7 <i>Discipline.</i> In addition to any appropriate proceedings and discipline which may be imposed by the Supreme Court of Florida under the Rules of Discipline and/or the Rules of Professional Conduct the emeritus attorney shall be subject to the following disciplinary measures:</p>\n<p>(a) The presiding judge or hearing officer for any matter in which the emeritus attorney has participated may hold the emeritus attorney in civil contempt for any failure to abide by such tribunal's orders; and</p>\n<p>(b) The Supreme Court of Florida or the approved legal aid organization may, at any time, with or without cause, withdraw certification hereunder.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The board of governors, during oral argument on no. 67,085, lawyer referral services, asked that we consider that petition in conjunction with, rather than separately from, nos. 65,197 and 65,877.

Ervin, Sp. Florida Counsel, Tallahassee, and Gene W. Lafitte, President, New Orleans, La., for The American College of Trial Lawyers, amicus curiae.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>In November 1984 this Court heard oral argument in case numbers 65,197 and 65,877, encompassing a total revision of the bar rules.<sup>[*]</sup> Since that time, numerous petitions for revision of both the currently existing bar rules and of the proposed new rules have been filed with and considered by the Court, and the proposed new rules have been revised several times. After rearranging and revising portions of the bar's proposed rules, we now adopt these new rules, entitled \"Rules Regulating the Florida Bar.\" As can be seen in the new rules, the integration rule, bylaws, and code of professional responsibility no longer exist as separate entities. Rather, all rules pertaining to the bar have been integrated, in a chapter format, into a single document. It is the revisers' hope, as well as the Court's, that this new arrangement will make it easier to find things in the rules.</p>\n<p>Several noteworthy changes have been made from the current rules and from the board's proposals. For instance, while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*978</span> amendments to most of the rules still must be through petition to this Court, chapters 2, 7, and 9 can be amended by the board of governors without petitioning the Court. See rule 2-10. Dues, however, are still capped, and this Court will have to be petitioned for changes in the amount of members' dues. The new rules also provide for nonlawyer members of the board of governors; the period for disbarment has been raised to five years; and there are numerous changes in the disciplinary process, now set out in chapter 3.</p>\n<p>A few of the changes made by the Court in the board's proposal include: an addition to rule 4-3.6 regarding persons making extrajudicial statements in criminal cases; a proviso regarding holding and maintaining property as a client wishes added to rule 4-1.15(a); and expansion of confidentiality in minor misconduct reports in 3-5.1(b). Also, rule 4-7.3, as originally proposed, prohibited direct mail solicitation of persons known to have specific legal problems. After studying this matter, we have concluded that such mailing cannot be prohibited. Instead, we have revised rule 4-7.3 to regulate, rather than proscribe, such communications. If this regulation proves unworkable or if a pattern of abuse in direct mailings is established, we will consider amending the solicitation rule.</p>\n<p>The rules as finally adopted also include recent amendments regarding confidentiality for attorneys seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></span> (Fla. 1986), contingent fees, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></span> (Fla. 1986), and graduation from an accredited law school for emeritus attorneys, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></span> (Fla. 1986). The rules will be printed in both this year's edition of the bar <i>Journal</i> and the West rules pamphlet.</p>\n<p>We express our thanks to all members and officers of the bar who worked on these revisions and who favored the Court with their comments and suggestions regarding the proposed rules. These rules will become effective at 12:01 a.m., January 1, 1987, and we urge all members of the bar to familiarize themselves with these new rules.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>McDONALD, C.J., and ADKINS, BOYD, OVERTON, EHRLICH, SHAW and BARKETT, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ON REHEARING GRANTED</h2>\n<p>The board of governors of the Florida Bar has filed a petition for rehearing or clarification regarding this Court's adoption of new bar rules. The board seeks amendment of the opinion itself as to the applicability of the new rules as well as changes in the text of the rules to correct errors in and omissions from the rules as submitted by the board and requests rewording of several provisions. After reviewing these matters we adopt the changes set out in the petition.</p>\n<p>The last sentence of our original opinion is revised to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>These rules will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1987. Thereafter, the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar shall govern the conduct of all members of the Florida Bar. All disciplinary cases pending as of 12:01 a.m. January 1, 1987 shall thereafter be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar. We urge all members of the bar to familiarize themselves with these new rules.</blockquote>\n<p>The individual pages of the rules affected by the changes adopted hereby are attached to this rehearing opinion.<sup>[**]</sup></p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>McDONALD, C.J., and ADKINS, BOYD, OVERTON, EHRLICH, SHAW and BARKETT, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*979</span> RULES REGULATING THE FLORIDA BAR</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chapter 1</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>GENERAL</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Florida by these rules establishes the authority and responsibilities of The Florida Bar, an official arm of the Court.</p>\n<p>1-1 <i>Name.</i> The name of the body regulated by these rules shall be THE FLORIDA BAR.</p>\n<p>1-2 <i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of The Florida Bar shall be to inculcate in its members the principles of duty and service to the public, to improve the administration of justice, and to advance the science of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>1-3 <i>Membership.</i></p>\n<p>1-3.1 <i>Composition.</i> The membership of The Florida Bar shall be composed of all persons who are admitted by this Court to the practice of law in this state and who maintain their membership in good standing pursuant to these rules.</p>\n<p>1-3.2 <i>Active members.</i> Active members of The Florida Bar in good standing shall mean only those persons licensed to practice law in Florida who have paid annual membership fees or dues for the current year and who are not retired, resigned, delinquent or suspended members.

Jurisdiction over an attorney of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*998</span> another state who is not a member of The Florida Bar shall be limited to conduct as an attorney in relation to the business for which the attorney was permitted to practice in this state and the privilege in the future to practice law in the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>3-4.2 <i>Rules of Professional Conduct.</i> Violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted by the rules governing The Florida Bar is a cause for discipline.</p>\n<p>3-4.3 <i>Misconduct and minor misconduct.</i> The standards of professional conduct to be observed by members of the bar are not limited to the observance of rules and avoidance of prohibitive acts, and the enumeration herein of certain categories of misconduct as constituting grounds for discipline shall not be deemed to be all-inclusive nor shall the failure to specify any particular act of misconduct be construed as tolerance thereof. The commission by a lawyer of any act which is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice, whether the act is committed in the course of the attorney's relations as an attorney or otherwise, whether committed within or outside the State of Florida, and whether or not the act is a felony or misdemeanor, may constitute a cause for discipline.</p>\n<p>3-4.4 <i>Criminal misconduct.</i> Unless modified or stayed by the Supreme Court of Florida as provided elsewhere herein, a determination or judgment of guilt of a member of The Florida Bar by a court of competent jurisdiction of any crime or offense that is a felony under the laws of such jurisdiction is cause for automatic suspension from the practice of law in Florida. In addition, whether the alleged misconduct constitutes a felony or misdemeanor The Florida Bar may initiate disciplinary action regardless of whether the respondent has been tried, acquitted, or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense; however, the board may, in its discretion, withhold prosecution of disciplinary proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings against respondent. The acquittal of respondent in a criminal proceeding shall not necessarily be a bar to disciplinary proceedings nor shall the findings, judgment or decree of any court in civil proceedings necessarily be binding in disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p>3-4.5 <i>Removal from judicial office by the Supreme Court of Florida.</i> Whenever a judge is removed from office by the Supreme Court of Florida on the basis of a Judicial Qualifications Commission proceeding, the removal order, when the record in such proceedings discloses the appropriate basis, may also order the suspension of the judge as an attorney pending further proceedings hereunder.</p>\n<p>3-4.6 <i>Discipline by foreign or federal jurisdictions.</i> A final adjudication in a disciplinary proceeding by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another jurisdiction, state or federal, that an attorney licensed to practice in that jurisdiction is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action shall be considered as conclusive proof of such misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding under this rule.</p>\n<p>3-4.7 <i>Oath.</i> Violation of the oath taken by an attorney to support the constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida is ground for disciplinary action. Membership in, alliance with, or support of any organization, group, or party advocating or dedicated to the overthrow of the government by violence or by any means in violation of the Constitution of the United States or constitution of this state shall be a violation of the oath.</p>\n<p>3-5 <i>Types of discipline.</i></p>\n<p>3-5.1 <i>Generally.</i> A judgment entered, finding a member of The Florida Bar guilty of misconduct, shall include one or more of the following disciplinary measures:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Private reprimand.</i> A Supreme Court of Florida order adjudging a private reprimand may direct the respondent to appear before the Supreme Court of Florida, the board of governors, or the referee for administration of the reprimand. A grievance committee report and finding of minor misconduct or the board of governors, upon review of such report, may direct the respondent to appear before the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*999</span> board of governors or the grievance committee for administration of the reprimand. A memorandum of administering of such a reprimand shall thereafter be made a part of the record of the proceeding.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Minor misconduct.</i> Minor misconduct is the only type of misconduct for which a private reprimand is an appropriate disciplinary sanction.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Criteria.</i> In the absence of unusual circumstances misconduct shall not be regarded as minor if any of the following conditions exist:</p>\n<p>a. The misconduct involves misappropriation of a client's funds or property.</p>\n<p>b. The misconduct resulted in or is likely to result in actual prejudice (loss of money, legal rights or valuable property rights) to a client or other person.</p>\n<p>c. The respondent has been publicly disciplined in the past three (3) years.</p>\n<p>d. The misconduct involved is of the same nature as misconduct for which the respondent has been disciplined in the past five (5) years.</p>\n<p>e. The misconduct includes dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fraud on the part of the respondent.</p>\n<p>f. The misconduct constitutes the commission of a felony under applicable law.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Discretion of grievance committee.</i> Despite the presence of one or more of the criteria described in paragraph (1), above, a grievance committee may recommend a private reprimand for minor misconduct when unusual circumstances are present. When the grievance committee recommends a private reprimand for minor misconduct under such circumstances, its report shall contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the committee's recommendation.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Recommendation of minor misconduct.</i> If a grievance committee finds the respondent guilty of minor misconduct or if the respondent shall admit guilt of minor misconduct and the committee concurs, the grievance committee shall file its report recommending a private reprimand, recommending the manner of administration and for the taxing of costs against the respondent. The report recommending a private reprimand shall be forwarded to staff counsel and the designated reviewer for review. If staff counsel does not return the report to the grievance committee to remedy a defect therein, or if the report is not referred to the disciplinary review committee by the designated reviewer (as provided in rule 3-7.4(b)), the report shall then be served on the respondent by branch staff counsel. The report and finding of minor misconduct shall become final unless rejected by the respondent within fifteen (15) days after service of the report. If rejected by the respondent, the report shall be referred to bar counsel and referee for trial on complaint of minor misconduct to be prepared by branch staff counsel as in the case of a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Rejection of minor misconduct reports.</i> The rejection by the board of governors of a grievance committee report recommending a private reprimand for minor misconduct, without dismissal of the case, shall be deemed a finding of probable cause. The rejection of such report by a respondent shall be deemed a finding of probable cause for minor misconduct. If either the board or the respondent rejects a minor misconduct report, confidentiality shall remain in effect until the Supreme Court of Florida enters an order imposing public discipline. Upon trial before a referee following rejection by a respondent of a report of minor misconduct, the referee may recommend any discipline authorized under these rules.</p>\n<p>(5) <i>Admission of minor misconduct.</i> At any time prior to the filing of a complaint with the Supreme Court of Florida a respondent may tender a written admission of minor misconduct to branch staff counsel or the grievance committee. An admission of minor misconduct may be conditioned upon acceptance by the grievance committee, but the respondent may not condition the admission of minor misconduct upon the method of administration of the private reprimand or upon nonpayment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1000</span> of costs incurred in the proceedings. Such an admission may be tendered after a finding of probable cause (but before the filing of a complaint) only if such an admission has not been previously tendered. If the admission is tendered after a finding of probable cause, the grievance committee may consider such admission without further evidentiary hearing and may either reject the admission, thereby affirming its prior action, or accept the admission and issue its report of minor misconduct. If a respondent's admission is accepted by the grievance committee, the respondent may not thereafter reject a report of the committee recommending a private reprimand for minor misconduct. If the admission of minor misconduct is rejected, such admission shall not be considered or used against the respondent in subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Probation.</i> The respondent may be placed upon probation for a stated period of time of not less than six (6) months nor more than three (3) years or for an indefinite period determined by conditions stated in the order. The judgment shall state the conditions of the probation which may include but are not limited to the following: supervision of all or part of the respondent's work by a member of The Florida Bar; the making of reports to a designated agency; the satisfactory completion of a course of study or a paper on legal ethics approved by the Supreme Court of Florida; such supervision over fees and trust accounts as the Court may direct. The respondent will also reimburse the bar for the costs of supervision. Failure to observe the conditions of the probation or a finding of probable cause as to conduct of the respondent committed during the period of probation shall terminate the probation. In such event, even though such finding of probable cause shall be made after the expiration of the period of probation, the judgment shall be reconsidered and an appropriate judgment shall be entered. On termination of probation for failure to observe the conditions of probation or on a finding of probable cause for misconduct committed during the period of probation, the attorney may be punished for contempt or suspended from the practice of law on petition by The Florida Bar, and any such suspension shall continue until the respondent may be reinstated to the practice of law as provided elsewhere in these rules.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Public reprimand.</i> A public reprimand shall be administered in the manner prescribed in the judgment but all such reprimands shall be reported in the <i>Southern Reporter.</i> Due notice shall be given to the respondent of any proceeding set to administer the reprimand. The respondent shall appear personally before the Supreme Court of Florida, the board of governors, or the referee, if required, and such appearance shall be made a part of the record of the proceeding.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Suspension.</i> The respondent may be suspended from the practice of law for a definite period of time or an indefinite period thereafter to be determined by the conditions imposed by the judgment. During such suspension the respondent shall continue to be a member of The Florida Bar but without the privilege of practicing, and, upon the expiration of the suspension period and the satisfaction of all conditions accompanying the suspension, the respondent shall become eligible to all of the privileges of members in The Florida Bar. A suspension of ninety (90) days or less shall not require proof of rehabilitation or passage of the Florida bar examination. A suspension of more than ninety (90) days shall require proof of rehabilitation and may require passage of all or part of the Florida bar examination. No suspension shall be ordered for a specific period of time in excess of three (3) years.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Disbarment.</i> A judgment of disbarment terminates the respondent's status as a member of the bar. A former member who has been disbarred may only be admitted again upon full compliance with the rules and regulations governing admission to the bar. Except as might be otherwise provided in these rules, no application for admission may be tendered within five (5) years after the date of disbarment or such longer period as the Court might determine in the disbarment order.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1001</span> (g) <i>Temporary suspension and probation.</i> On petition of The Florida Bar, authorized by its president, president-elect, or executive director, supported by an affidavit demonstrating facts personally known to affiant showing that an attorney appears to be causing great public harm by misappropriating funds to his own use, or for other reasons, the Supreme Court of Florida may issue an order with such notice as the Court may prescribe imposing temporary conditions of probation on said attorney or temporarily suspending said attorney. Any order of temporary suspension or probation which restricts the attorney maintaining a trust account shall, when served on any bank maintaining an account against which said attorney may make withdrawals, serve as an injunction to prevent said bank from making further payment from such account or accounts on any obligation except in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Court. Any order of temporary suspension issued under this rule shall preclude the attorney from accepting any new cases and may preclude the attorney from continuing to represent existing clients during the first thirty (30) days after issuance of such temporary order. Any fees tendered to such attorney during such thirty-day period shall be deposited in a trust fund from which withdrawals may be made only in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Court. The attorney may for good cause request dissolution or amendment of any such temporary order by petition filed with the Supreme Court of Florida, a copy of which will be served on the executive director. Such petition for dissolution shall be set for immediate hearing before a referee designated by the chief justice. The designated referee shall hear such petition forthwith and submit his report and recommendation to the Supreme Court of Florida with the utmost speed consistent with due process. Upon receipt of the referee's report, the Supreme Court of Florida shall modify its order if appropriate and continue such provision of the order as may be appropriate until final disposition of all pending disciplinary charges against said attorney.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Notice to clients.</i> Upon service on the respondent of an order of disbarment, suspension, resignation for cause, temporary suspension, or placement on the inactive list, the respondent shall, unless this requirement is waived or modified in the Court's order, forthwith furnish a copy of the order to all of his clients with matters pending in the respondent's practice, and within thirty (30) days after service of the order the respondent shall furnish staff counsel of The Florida Bar with a sworn affidavit listing the names and addresses of all clients who have been furnished copies of the order.</p>\n<p>3-6 <i>Employment of certain disciplined attorneys.</i></p>\n<p>3-6.1 <i>Generally.</i> When attorneys have been placed on the inactive list, suspended, disbarred, or allowed resignation pursuant to rule 3-7.11 by order of this Court, they are ineligible to practice law until reinstated or readmitted. However, this shall not preclude a lawyer, law firm, or professional association from employing the suspended, disbarred, or resigned individual to perform such services only as may ethically be performed by other lay persons employed in attorneys' offices under the following conditions:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Notice of employment.</i> Notice of employment along with a full job description will be provided to staff counsel before employment commences.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Reports by employee and employer.</i> Information reports verified by the employee and employer will be submitted to staff counsel quarterly. Such reports shall contain a statement by the employing lawyer certifying that no aspect of the employee's work for the period involved the unlicensed practice of law.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Client contact.</i> No suspended or disbarred attorney shall have direct contact with any client or receive, disburse, or otherwise handle funds or property of a client.</p>\n<p>3-7 <i>Procedures.</i></p>\n<p>3-7.1 <i>Confidentiality.</i> All matters including files, preliminary investigation reports, inter-office memoranda, records of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1002</span> investigations, and the records in trials and other proceedings under these rules, excepting only those matters in connection with proceedings initiated in circuit courts, are all property of The Florida Bar. All of such matters having to do with (1) investigation and other proceedings to determine probable cause and (2) resignations pending disciplinary proceedings shall be confidential to all parties participating therein or having knowledge thereof except as otherwise provided in these rules. All persons shall be admonished by the agency before whom they appear to observe the confidential nature of such proceedings. However, the confidential nature of such proceedings is subject to the following exceptions:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Public record.</i> The record, as defined in rule 3-7.5(1), and any reports, correspondence, papers, and/or transcripts of hearings furnished to or served on the respondent and any responses in the proceedings shall become public information in the following instances:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Action of respondent.</i></p>\n<p>a. If the respondent shall file in the proceeding a request, in writing, that the proceedings be made public information.</p>\n<p>b. If the respondent shall, orally or in writing, disclose the status or pendency of the proceedings to the media or any person or entity not within the purview of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>c. If the respondent shall institute proceedings in a court or before any administrative body thereby disclosing the status or pendency of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>d. If respondent shall resign, pending disciplinary proceedings which are confidential, confidentiality of the proceedings shall terminate on the filing of the petition for leave to resign and the general nature of the disciplinary charges shall be stated in the resignation order.</p>\n<p>e. If a member of The Florida Bar who is a candidate for public office makes public the fact of and circumstances surrounding the administration of discipline to that member at the level of a private reprimand or higher, The Florida Bar may disclose information necessary to correct a false or misleading statement by such candidate.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Action of The Florida Bar.</i> Upon the filing by staff counsel in the Supreme Court of Florida of a formal complaint for other than minor misconduct.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Circuit court proceeding.</i> If the proceeding is in a circuit court. However, proceedings in contempt of confidential proceedings shall preserve the confidentiality of the disciplinary proceeding as elsewhere provided.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Limitations on public disclosure.</i> Public disclosure of all or any portion of the record, as defined in rule 3-7.5(1), is subject, in all instances, to the following limitations:</p>\n<p>(1) Any material or information provided to The Florida Bar in the course of an investigation which is confidential under applicable law shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed except as authorized by such applicable law.</p>\n<p>(2) The disclosure does not affect the right of confidentiality under these rules of any other member of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Limited disclosure; access to confidential information.</i> Upon request, and to the extent necessary to provide the information required therefor, any portion of the record, as defined in rule 3-7.5(1) and any reports, correspondence, papers, and/or transcripts of hearings furnished to or served upon the respondent and any response in the proceedings shall be provided to:</p>\n<p>(1) The Florida Board of Bar Examiners and the comparable body having jurisdiction of an application for admission in another jurisdiction for the purpose of evaluating the applicant's competency to practice law.</p>\n<p>(2) Judicial nominating commissions for the purpose of evaluating an applicant's qualification for judicial appointment.</p>\n<p>(3) The Clients' Security Fund Committee to assist in preparing its recommendation on the validity of an application for relief.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1003</span> (4) Any judge of a court of record having a judicial interest in the matter.</p>\n<p>(5) A complainant for advice as to the pending status or final disposition of the complaint.</p>\n<p>(6) In all cases where a complaint alleges a trust fund violation, the present partners, employed lawyers, professional association shareholders, employed associates, and \"of counsel\" of the respondent, as determined by the designated board reviewer, to prevent further trust fund violations by the respondent.</p>\n<p>(7) Any individual or organization for whom a member of The Florida Bar has signed a waiver of confidentiality for the purposes expressed in such waiver.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Limitations on limited disclosure.</i> Disclosures authorized in rule 3-7.1(c) above are subject, in all instances, to the limitations on public disclosures set forth in rules 3-7.1(b)1 and 3-7.1(b)2 and are further subject to the following:</p>\n<p>(1) The attorney who is the subject of a request for limited disclosure, as described in rule 3-7.1(c), shall forthwith be advised of the content of all reports and information provided to the requesting party.</p>\n<p>(2) All confidential information provided shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed by the recipient thereof except as may be provided in these rules.</p>\n<p>(3) A complainant will not be advised of an admonishment accompanying a finding of no probable cause.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Information concerning proceeding.</i> No information concerning the pendency or status of an investigation or other confidential matter shall be given unless authorized by the Supreme Court of Florida or these rules.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Evidence of crime.</i> The confidential nature of disciplinary proceedings and the oath given to witnesses therein shall not proscribe the filing of informations and the giving of testimony before grand juries or other prosecuting authorities by individuals having knowledge of facts indicating the commission of crime.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Confidentiality regarding treatment for alcohol abuse.</i></p>\n<p>(1) Evidence that an attorney has voluntarily sought, received, or accepted treatment for alcoholism or alcohol abuse shall be deemed confidential.</p>\n<p>(2) No qualified person furnishing treatment, advisory, consultive, or other services or who offers such services, or with whom an attorney has consulted for the purpose of considering or securing treatment, advisory, consultive, or other services relating to alcoholism or alcohol abuse may give evidence with respect to the consultation or treatment by such attorney in any disciplinary proceeding without the written consent of the attorney(s) affected.</p>\n<p>(3) It is the purpose of this paragraph (g) to encourage attorneys to voluntarily seek advice, counsel, and treatment available to such attorney, without fear that such advice, counsel, and treatment, or the fact of its being sought or offered, will or might cause embarrassment in any future disciplinary matter.</p>\n<p>3-7.2 <i>Procedures upon criminal or professional misconduct; discipline upon determination or judgment of guilt of criminal misconduct.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Definitions.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Judgment of guilt.</i> For the purposes of these rules \"judgment of guilt\" shall include only those cases in which the trial court in the criminal proceeding enters an order adjudicating the respondent guilty of the offense(s) charged.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Determination of guilt.</i> For the purposes of these rules \"determination of guilt\" shall include only those cases in which the trial court in the criminal proceeding enters an order withholding adjudication of respondent's guilt of the offense(s) charged.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Convicted attorney.</i> For the purposes of these rules \"convicted attorney\" shall mean an attorney who has had either a determination or judgment of guilt entered by the trial court in the criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1004</span> (b) <i>Determination or judgment of guilt.</i> Determination or judgment of guilt of a member of The Florida Bar by a court of competent jurisdiction upon trial of or plea to any crime or offense that is a felony under the laws of this state, or under the laws under which any other court making such determination or entering such judgment exercises its jurisdiction, shall be conclusive proof of guilt of the criminal offense(s) charged for the purposes of these rules.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Notice of determination or judgment of guilt.</i> Upon the entry of a determination or judgment of guilt against a member of The Florida Bar by a court of competent jurisdiction upon trial of or plea to any offense that is a felony under the laws applicable to such court, such convicted attorney shall within thirty (30) days of such determination or judgment notify the executive director of The Florida Bar of such determination or judgment. Notice shall include a copy of the order(s) whereby such determination or judgment was entered.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Notice of determination or judgment of guilt by courts of the State of Florida.</i> If any such determination or judgment is entered by a court of the State of Florida, the judge or clerk thereof shall transmit to the Supreme Court of Florida and the executive director of The Florida Bar a certified copy of the order(s) whereby the determination or judgment was entered.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Suspension by judgment of guilt (felonies).</i> Upon receiving notice that a member of the bar has been determined or adjudicated guilty of a felony, branch staff counsel will file a \"Notice of Determination or Judgment of Guilt\" in the Supreme Court of Florida. A copy of the judgment shall be attached to the notice. Upon the filing with the Supreme Court of Florida by The Florida Bar and service upon the respondent of a notice of determination or judgment of guilt for offenses that are felonies under applicable law, the respondent shall stand suspended as a member of The Florida Bar on the eleventh day after filing of the notice of determination or judgment of guilt unless he shall, on or before the tenth day after filing of such notice, file a petition to terminate or modify such suspension.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Petition to modify or terminate suspension.</i></p>\n<p>(1) At any time after the filing of a notice of determination or judgment of guilt the respondent may file a petition with the Supreme Court of Florida to modify or terminate such suspension and shall serve a copy thereof upon the executive director.</p>\n<p>(2) If such petition is filed on or before the tenth day following the filing of the notice, the suspension will be deferred until entry of an order on the petition.</p>\n<p>(3) If such petition is filed after the tenth day following the filing of the notice of judgment of guilt, the suspension shall remain in effect pending disposition of the petition. Modification or termination of the suspension shall be granted only upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Response to petition to modify or terminate automatic suspension.</i> The Florida Bar shall be allowed twenty (20) days from the filing of a petition to modify or terminate automatic suspension to respond to the same. Staff counsel will oppose all petitions to modify or withhold an automatic suspension on a notice of determination or judgment of guilt unless the designated reviewer recommends and the executive committee concurs in not opposing such a petition.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Term of suspension.</i> Unless the Supreme Court of Florida permits an earlier application for reinstatement, the suspension imposed on the determination or judgment of guilt shall remain in effect for three (3) years and thereafter until civil rights have been restored and until the respondent is reinstated under rule 3-7.9 hereof.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Continuation during appeal.</i> A final termination of the criminal cause resulting in the affirmance of a determination or judgment of guilt shall continue the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1005</span> suspension until expiration of all periods for appeal and rehearing.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Continuation of suspension until final disposition.</i> If an appeal is taken by the respondent from the determination or judgment of the trial court in the criminal proceeding, and on review the cause is remanded for further proceedings, the suspension shall remain in effect until the final disposition of the criminal cause unless modified or terminated by the Supreme Court of Florida as elsewhere provided.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Termination of suspension.</i> A final disposition of the criminal cause resulting in acquittal will terminate the suspension.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>Separate disciplinary action.</i> The Florida Bar may, at any time, initiate separate disciplinary action against the respondent.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Conclusive proof of probable cause.</i> A determination or judgment of guilt, where the offense is a felony under applicable law, shall constitute conclusive proof of probable cause and The Florida Bar may file a complaint with the Supreme Court of Florida, or proceed under rule 3-7.8, without there first having been a separate finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Determination or judgment of guilt as evidence.</i> A determination or judgment of guilt, whether for charges that are felony or misdemeanor in nature, shall be admissible in disciplinary proceedings under these rules, and in those cases where the underlying criminal charges constitute felony charges, determinations or judgments of guilt shall, for purposes of these rules, constitute conclusive proof of the criminal offense(s) charged. The failure of a trial court to adjudicate the convicted attorney guilty of the offense(s) charged shall be considered as a matter of mitigation only.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Professional misconduct in foreign jurisdiction.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Notice of discipline by a foreign jurisdiction.</i> A member of The Florida Bar disbarred or suspended from the practice of law by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another state or by a federal court shall within thirty (30) days after the effective date of disbarment or suspension file with the Supreme Court of Florida a copy of the order or judgment effecting such disbarment or suspension.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Adjudication or discipline by a foreign jurisdiction.</i> In cases of a final adjudication by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another jurisdiction, such adjudication of misconduct shall be sufficient basis for the filing of a complaint by The Florida Bar and assignment for hearing before a referee without a finding of probable cause under these rules.</p>\n<p>3-7.3 <i>Grievance committee procedures.</i> When notice of a grievance committee hearing is sent to respondent, such notice shall be accompanied by a list of the grievance committee members.</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Complaint filed with grievance committee.</i> A complaint received by a committee direct from a complainant shall be reported to the appropriate branch staff counsel for docketing and assignment of a case number, unless the committee resolves the complaint within ten (10) days after receipt of the complaint. A written report to branch staff counsel shall include the following information: complainant's name and address; respondent's name; date complaint received by committee; copy of complaint letter or summary of the oral complaint made; and the name of the committee member assigned to the investigation. Formal investigation by a grievance committee may proceed after the matter has been referred to staff counsel for docketing.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Investigation.</i> A grievance committee is required to consider all charges of misconduct forwarded to the committee by staff counsel whether based upon a written complaint or not.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Conduct of proceedings.</i> The proceedings of grievance committees may be informal in nature and the committees shall not be bound by the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>No delay for civil or criminal proceedings.</i> An investigation shall not be deferred or suspended without the approval of the board even though the respondent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1006</span> is made a party of civil litigation, or is a defendant or is acquitted in a criminal action, notwithstanding that either of such proceedings involves the subject matter of the investigation.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Counsel and investigators.</i> Upon request of a grievance committee, staff counsel may appoint a bar counsel or an investigator to assist the committee in an investigation. Staff counsel shall assist each grievance committee in carrying out its investigative and administrative duties and shall prepare status reports for the committee, notify complainants and respondents of committee actions as appropriate, and prepare all reports reflecting committee findings of probable cause, no probable cause, recommended discipline for minor misconduct, and admonishments after no probable cause findings.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Quorum, vote.</i> Not fewer than three (3) members, one of whom must be the chairperson or vice-chairperson and another of whom must be a lawyer, shall constitute a quorum. All findings of probable cause and recommendations of guilt of minor misconduct shall be made by affirmative vote of a majority of the committee members present, which majority must number at least two (2) members. The number of committee members voting for or against the committee report shall be reflected in the transcript. Minority reports may be filed.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Rights and responsibilities of the respondent.</i> The respondent may be required to testify and to produce evidence as any other witness unless the respondent claims a privilege or right properly available to the respondent under applicable federal or state law. The respondent may be accompanied by counsel. At a reasonable time before any hearing at which any finding of probable cause or minor misconduct is made the respondent shall be advised of the conduct which is being investigated and the rules which have been violated, provided the bar may amend its statement as to which rules have been violated. The respondent shall be given an opportunity to make a statement personally or by counsel, verbally or in writing, sworn or unsworn, explaining, refuting, or admitting the alleged misconduct. The respondent shall be granted the right to be present at any grievance committee hearing when evidence is to be presented to the committee, to face the accuser, and to call witnesses or present evidence and to cross-examine, subject to reasonable limitation.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Rights of the complaining witness.</i> The complaining witness is not a party to the disciplinary proceeding. Unless found to be impractical by the chairman of the grievance committee due to unreasonable delay or other good cause, the complainant shall be granted the right to be present at any grievance committee hearing when evidence is to be presented, subject to reasonable limitations. Neither unwillingness nor neglect of the complaining witness to cooperate, nor settlement, compromise, or restitution will excuse the completion of an investigation. The complaining witness shall have no right of appeal.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>No finding of probable cause.</i> If a grievance committee upon termination of its investigation does not find probable cause, the committee shall dispose of its file in the manner directed by the board of governors. If the grievance committee has notified the respondent of the investigation, then the committee shall notify the respondent of the action of the committee. The failure of a grievance committee to find probable cause shall not preclude further proceedings.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Preparation, forwarding, and review of grievance committee complaints.</i> If a grievance committee finds probable cause, the branch staff counsel assigned to the committee shall promptly prepare a record of its investigation and a formal complaint. The formal complaint shall be signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the committee who participated in the proceeding. The formal complaint shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by the board. Such formal complaint shall be promptly forwarded to and reviewed by bar headquarters staff counsel. If the grievance committee chairperson or vice-chairperson <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1007</span> disagrees with the form of the complaint, he or she may direct branch staff counsel to make changes accordingly. If branch staff counsel does not agree with the directed changes, the matter shall be referred to the designated reviewer of the committee for appropriate action. When a formal complaint by a grievance committee is not referred to the designated reviewer, or returned to the grievance committee for further action, bar headquarters staff counsel shall furnish a copy of the formal complaint to the respondent, and a copy of the transcripts and exhibits shall be made available to the respondent at his expense.</p>\n<p>(k) <i>Letter reports in no probable cause cases.</i> Upon a finding of no probable cause, the committee chairperson or vice-chairperson will submit a short letter report of the no probable cause finding to branch staff counsel with a copy to the investigating member and the respondent if the respondent was notified of the investigation. The report to branch staff counsel should include any documentation deemed appropriate by the chairperson or vice-chairperson. The chairperson or vice-chairperson shall also send a letter to the complainant in confidence, without reference to any admonishment, with a copy to branch staff counsel, explaining why the complaint did not warrant further proceedings. Admonishments issued by a grievance committee shall be in writing and signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson and shall not be made a part of the respondent's record.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Recommendation of private reprimand for minor misconduct.</i> If the committee recommends an order of private reprimand for minor misconduct, the grievance committee report shall be drafted by branch staff counsel and signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson who participated in the hearing. The committee report need only include: (1) the committee's recommendations regarding the private reprimand, designation withdrawal, and conditions of redesignation; (2) the committee's recommendation as to whether the respondent should be required to appear before the board for administration of the reprimand; (3) a summary of any additional charges which will be dismissed if the private reprimand is approved; (4) any comment on mitigating, aggravating, or evidentiary matters which the committee believes will be helpful to the board in passing upon the private reprimand recommendation; and (5) an admission of minor misconduct signed by the respondent, if the respondent has admitted guilt of minor misconduct. No record need be submitted with such a report. After the chairperson or vice-chairperson signs the grievance committee report, he or she shall return the report to branch staff counsel. The report recommending a private reprimand shall be forwarded to staff counsel and the designated reviewer for review. If staff counsel does not return the report to the grievance committee to remedy a defect therein, or if the designated reviewer does not present the same to the disciplinary review committee for action by the board, the report shall then be served on the respondent by branch staff counsel.</p>\n<p>(m) <i>Rejection of private reprimand.</i> The order of private reprimand shall become final unless rejected by the respondent within fifteen (15) days after service upon the respondent. If rejected by the respondent, the report shall be referred to bar counsel and referee for trial on complaint of minor misconduct to be prepared by branch staff counsel as in the case of a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(n) <i>Staff counsel and grievance committee chairperson determinations of no probable cause.</i> If staff counsel and a grievance committee chairperson concur in a finding of no probable cause, the complaint may be closed on such finding without reference to a grievance committee.</p>\n<p>(<i>o</i>) <i>Appointment of bar counsel.</i> When a grievance committee formal complaint is not referred to the disciplinary review committee, or returned to the grievance committee, staff counsel of The Florida Bar headquarters in Tallahassee may appoint bar counsel unless bar counsel has been appointed, sign the complaint and file the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1008</span> same in the Supreme Court of Florida, serve a copy on the respondent, and request the Supreme Court of Florida to assign a referee to try the cause. If probable cause is found by the board, staff counsel will prepare the formal complaint.</p>\n<p>3-7.4 <i>Procedures before the board of governors.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Review of grievance committee matters.</i> The disciplinary review committee shall review those grievance committee matters referred to it by a designated reviewer. The committee shall make a report to the board and unless overruled by the board the report shall be final.</p>\n<p>(1) Whenever a grievance matter is referred to the disciplinary review committee by the designated reviewer, the disciplinary review committee shall promptly review the actions of the grievance committee and the recommendations of the designated reviewer and make a report to the board providing for the issuance of:</p>\n<p>a. A private reprimand which the respondent may thereafter reject in the same manner as a private reprimand recommended by a grievance committee;</p>\n<p>b. Confirmation of the formal complaint;</p>\n<p>c. Reversal of the grievance committee and a finding of no probable cause; or</p>\n<p>d. Return of the matter to the grievance committee for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>(2) The disciplinary review committee report shall be final unless overruled by the board. If the board shall find no probable cause, staff counsel shall notify the respondent, the grievance committee, and the complaining witness.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Review by the designated reviewer.</i> A designated reviewer at any time may review the actions of a grievance committee and shall review those grievance committee actions referred to him or her, in writing. If the designated reviewer disagrees with the grievance committee action the designated reviewer shall make a report and recommendation to the disciplinary review committee. In those matters referred in writing the designated reviewer shall make the report and recommendation within twenty-one (21) days following the mailing date of the referral; otherwise the grievance committee action shall stand.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Finding of probable cause.</i> The board, on the basis of the report of any regular or special grievance committee, may by majority vote find probable cause and direct the filing of a formal complaint against an attorney.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Finding of no probable cause.</i> A finding of no probable cause by the board shall be final and no further proceedings shall be had in the matter by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Control of proceedings.</i> Bar counsel, however appointed, at all times shall be subject to the direction of the board. In the exercise of its discretion as the governing body of The Florida Bar, the board prior to the receipt of evidence by the referee has the power to terminate disciplinary proceedings before a referee, whether such proceedings have been instituted upon a finding of probable cause by the board or a grievance committee.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Filing service on board of governors.</i> All matters to be filed with or served upon the board shall be addressed to the board of governors and filed with the executive director. The executive director shall be the custodian of the official records of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>3-7.5 <i>Procedures before a referee.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Referees.</i> The chief justice shall have the power to appoint referees to try disciplinary cases and to delegate to a chief judge of a judicial circuit the power to appoint referees for duty in the chief judge's respective circuit. Such appointees shall ordinarily be active county or circuit judges, but the chief justice may appoint retired judges.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Trial by referee.</i> When a finding has been made by a grievance committee or by the board that there is cause to believe that a member of The Florida Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action, and the formal complaint based on such finding of probable cause has been assigned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1009</span> by the chief justice for trial before a referee, the proceeding thereafter shall be an adversary proceeding which shall be conducted as hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Venue.</i> The trial shall be held in the county in which an alleged offense occurred or in the county where the respondent resides or practices law or last practiced law in Florida, whichever shall be designated by the Supreme Court of Florida; provided, however, that if the respondent is not a resident of Florida and if the alleged offense is not committed in Florida, the trial shall be held in a county designated by the chief justice.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Style of proceedings.</i> All proceedings instituted by The Florida Bar shall be styled \"The Florida Bar, Complainant v. (name of respondent), Respondent\" and \"In The Supreme Court of Florida (Before a Referee).\"</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Nature of proceedings.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Administrative in character.</i> A disciplinary proceeding is neither civil nor criminal but is a quasijudicial administrative proceeding. The Florida Rules of Civil Procedure apply except as otherwise provided in this rule.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Discovery.</i> Discovery shall be available to the parties in accordance with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Bar counsel.</i> Bar counsel shall make such investigation as is necessary and shall prepare and prosecute with utmost diligence any case assigned. Assistant bar counsel shall serve under the general supervision of bar counsel.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Pleadings.</i> Pleadings may be informal and shall comply with the following requirements:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Complaint; consolidation and severance.</i></p>\n<p>a. <i>Filing.</i> Staff counsel shall prepare the complaint and file the same in the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>b. <i>Content.</i> The complaint shall set forth the particular act or acts of conduct for which the attorney is sought to be disciplined.</p>\n<p>c. <i>Joinder of charges and respondents; severance.</i> A complaint may embrace any number of charges against one or more respondents, and charges may be against any one or any number of respondents; but a severance may be granted by the referee when the ends of justice require it.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Answer and motion.</i> The respondent may answer the complaint and, as a part thereof or by separate motion, may challenge only the sufficiency of the complaint and the jurisdiction of the forum. All other defenses shall be incorporated in the respondent's answer. All pleadings of the respondent must be filed within twenty (20) days of service of a copy of the complaint.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Reply.</i> If the respondent's answer shall contain any new matter or affirmative defense, a reply thereto may be filed within ten (10) days of the date of service of a copy upon bar counsel, but failure to file such a reply shall not prejudice The Florida Bar. All affirmative allegations in the respondent's answer shall be considered as denied by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Disposition of motions.</i> Hearings upon motions may be deferred until the final hearing, and, whenever heard, rulings thereon may be reserved until termination of the final hearing.</p>\n<p>(5) <i>Filing and service of pleadings.</i></p>\n<p>a. <i>Prior to appointment of referee.</i> Any pleadings filed in a case prior to appointment of a referee shall be filed with the Supreme Court of Florida and shall bear a certificate of service showing parties upon whom service of copies has been made. On appointment of referee, the Supreme Court of Florida shall notify the parties of such appointment and forward all pleadings theretofore filed with the Court to the referee for action.</p>\n<p>b. <i>After appointment of referee.</i> All pleadings, motions, notices, and orders filed after appointment of a referee shall be filed with the referee and shall bear a certificate of service showing service of a copy on the staff counsel of The Florida <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1010</span> Bar and on all interested parties to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>(6) <i>Amendment.</i> Pleadings may be amended by order of the referee, and a reasonable time shall be given within which to respond thereto.</p>\n<p>(7) <i>Expediting the trial.</i> If it shall be made to appear that the date of final hearing should be expedited in the public interest, the referee may, in the referee's discretion, shorten the time for filing pleadings and the notice requirements as provided in this rule.</p>\n<p>(8) <i>Disqualification of referee.</i> Upon motion of either party, a referee may be disqualified from service in the same manner and to the same extent that a trial judge may be disqualified under existing law from acting in a judicial capacity. In the event of disqualification, the chief justice shall appoint a successor.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Notice of final hearing.</i> The cause may be set down for trial by either party or the referee upon not less than ten (10) days notice. The trial shall be held as soon as possible following the expiration of ten (10) days from the filing of respondent's answer, or if no answer is filed, then from the date when such answer is due.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>The respondent.</i> Unless the respondent claims a privilege or right properly available under applicable federal or state law, the respondent may be called as a witness by The Florida Bar to make specific and complete disclosure of all matters material to the issues. When the respondent is subpoenaed to appear and give testimony or to produce books, papers, or documents and refuses to answer or to produce such books, papers, or documents, or, having been duly sworn to testify, refuses to answer any proper question, the respondent may be cited for contempt of the court.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Complaining witness.</i> The complaining witness shall have no right other than those of any other witness; the complaining witness has no right to be present during a hearing or trial but may be called upon to testify and produce evidence as any other witness. Neither unwillingness nor neglect of the complaining witness to cooperate, nor settlement, compromise, or restitution will excuse failure to complete any trial.</p>\n<p>(k) <i>Referee's report.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Contents of report.</i> Within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of a trial before a referee or ten (10) days after the referee receives the transcripts of all hearings, whichever is later, or within such extended period of time as may be allowed by the chief justice for good cause shown, the referee shall make a report and enter it as part of the record, but failure to enter the report in the time prescribed shall not deprive the referee of jurisdiction. The referee's report shall include: (1) a finding of fact as to each item of misconduct of which the respondent is charged, which findings of fact shall enjoy the same presumption of correctness as the judgment of the trier of fact in a civil proceeding; (2) recommendations as to whether or not the respondent should be found guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary measures; (3) recommendations as to the disciplinary measures to be applied, provided that a private reprimand may be recommended only in cases based on a complaint of minor misconduct; (4) a statement of any past disciplinary measures as to the respondent which are on record with the executive director of The Florida Bar or which otherwise become known to the referee through evidence properly admitted by the referee during the course of the proceedings (after a finding of guilt all evidence of prior disciplinary measures may be offered by bar counsel subject to appropriate objection or explanation by respondent); and (5) a statement of costs of the proceedings and recommendations as to the manner in which costs should be taxed. The costs shall include court reporters' fees, copy costs, witness fees and traveling expenses, and reasonable traveling and out-of-pocket expenses of the referee and bar counsel, if any. Costs shall also include a $150 charge for administrative costs at the grievance committee level and a $150 charge for administrative costs at the referee level. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1011</span> Costs taxed shall be payable to The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Filing.</i> The referee's report and record of proceedings shall in all cases be transmitted together to the Supreme Court of Florida. Copies of the report shall be served on the parties including the staff counsel of The Florida Bar. The referee shall serve a copy of the record on staff counsel with the report. Staff counsel will make a copy of the record, as furnished, available to other parties on request and payment of the actual costs of reproduction.</p>\n<p>(<i>l</i>) <i>The record.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Reporting of testimony.</i> All hearings at which testimony is presented shall be reported and the transcript of the testimony shall be filed in the cause.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Contents.</i> The record shall include all items properly filed in the cause including pleadings, transcript of testimony, exhibits in evidence, and the report of the referee.</p>\n<p>(m) <i>Plea of guilty by respondent.</i> At any time during the progress of disciplinary proceedings a respondent may tender a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Before filing of complaint.</i> If the plea is tendered before filing of a complaint by staff counsel, such plea shall be tendered in writing to the grievance committee.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>After filing of complaint.</i> If the complaint has been filed against the respondent, the respondent may enter a plea of guilty thereto by filing the same in writing with the referee to whom the cause has been assigned for trial. Such referee shall take such testimony thereto as may be advised, following which the referee will enter a report as otherwise provided.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Unconditional.</i> An unconditional plea of guilty shall not preclude review as to disciplinary measures imposed.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Procedure.</i> Except as herein provided all procedure in relation to disposition of the cause on pleas of guilty shall be as elsewhere provided in these rules.</p>\n<p>(n) <i>Cost of reproduction.</i> The actual cost of reproduction for the purposes of these rules is determined by the board to be $1.00 per page.</p>\n<p>3-7.6 <i>Procedures before Supreme Court of Florida.</i> All reports of a referee and all judgments entered in proceedings under these rules shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of Florida in the following manner:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Right of review.</i></p>\n<p>(1) Any party to a proceeding may procure review of a report of a referee or a judgment, or any specified portion thereof, entered under these rules.</p>\n<p>(2) The Supreme Court of Florida shall review all reports and judgments of referees recommending probation, public reprimand, suspension, disbarment, or resignation pending disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p>(3) A referee's report that does not recommend probation, public reprimand, suspension, disbarment, or resignation pending disciplinary proceedings, shall be final if not appealed.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Appointment of bar counsel.</i> The board or staff counsel, if authorized by the board, may appoint new or additional bar counsel to represent The Florida Bar on any review.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Procedure for review.</i> Review by the Supreme Court of Florida shall be in accordance with the following procedures:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Time for review.</i> Proceedings for review shall be commenced within fifteen (15) days of the termination of the meeting of the board following by ten (10) days the mailing date of a letter from the referee serving a copy of the referee report on the respondent and The Florida Bar, but in all events the respondent shall be allowed at least thirty (30) days after the mailing date of such letter to commence review. Prompt written notice of such termination date and the board's action, if any, shall be communicated to the respondent. The proceeding shall be commenced by filing with the Supreme Court of Florida a petition for review, specifying those portions of the report of a referee sought to be reviewed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1012</span> Within ten (10) days after service of such petition, the opposing party may file a cross-petition for review specifying any additional portion of the report which said party desires reviewed. The filing of such petition or cross-petition shall be jurisdictional as to a review to be procured as a matter of right, but the Court may, in its discretion, consider a late-filed petition or cross-petition upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Record on review.</i> The report and record filed by the referee shall constitute the record on review.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Briefs.</i> The party first seeking review shall file a brief in support of the petition for review within thirty (30) days of the filing of the petition. The opposing party shall file an answering brief within twenty (20) days after the service of the brief of the party seeking review, which answering brief shall also support any cross-petition for review. The party originally seeking petition for review may file a reply brief within ten (10) days after the service of the answering brief.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Oral argument.</i> Request for oral argument may be filed in any case wherein a petition for review is filed, at the time of filing the first brief. If no request is filed, the case will be disposed of without oral argument unless the Court orders otherwise.</p>\n<p>(5) <i>Burden.</i> Upon review, the burden shall be upon the party seeking review to demonstrate that a report of a referee sought to be reviewed is erroneous, unlawful, or unjustified.</p>\n<p>(6) <i>Judgment of Supreme Court of Florida.</i> After review, the Supreme Court of Florida shall enter an appropriate order or judgment. If no review is sought of a report of a referee entered under the rules and filed in the Court, the findings of fact shall be deemed conclusive and the disciplinary measure recommended by the referee shall be the disciplinary measure imposed by the Court, unless the Court directs the parties to submit briefs or oral argument directed to the suitability of the disciplinary measure recommended by the referee. A referee's report which becomes final when no review has been timely filed shall be reported in an order of the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Precedence of proceedings.</i> Petitions for review in disciplinary proceedings shall take precedence over all other civil causes in the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Extraordinary writs.</i> All applications for extraordinary writs which are concerned with disciplinary proceedings under these rules of discipline shall be made to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.</i> To the extent necessary to implement this rule and if not inconsistent herewith, the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure shall be applicable to petitions for review in disciplinary proceedings, provided service on The Florida Bar shall be accomplished by service on bar counsel and staff counsel.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Contempt by respondent.</i> Whenever it is alleged that a respondent is in contempt in a disciplinary proceeding, a petition for an order to show cause why the respondent should not be held in contempt and the proceedings on such petition may be filed in and determined by the Supreme Court of Florida or as provided under rule 3-7.10(f).</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Pending disciplinary cases.</i> If disbarment is ordered by the Court, dismissal without prejudice of other pending cases against the respondent may be ordered in the Court's disbarment order.</p>\n<p>3-7.7 <i>Procedures before a circuit court.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Filing of motion.</i> Whenever it shall be made known to any of the judges of the district courts of appeal or any judge of a circuit court or a county court in this state that a member of The Florida Bar practicing in any of the courts of the district or judicial circuit or county has been guilty of any unprofessional act as defined by these rules, such judge may direct the state attorney for the circuit in which the alleged offense occurred to make in writing a motion in the name of the State of Florida to discipline such attorney setting forth in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1013</span> motion the particular act or acts of conduct for which the attorney is sought to be disciplined.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Copy served upon respondent.</i> Upon the filing of a motion in circuit court to discipline an attorney a copy thereof shall be served upon the respondent attorney, and the respondent shall, within twenty (20) days after the service thereof, file an answer thereto. A copy of such motion shall be filed with the executive director of The Florida Bar at the time of service upon the respondent.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Trial before a circuit judge.</i> Upon the filing of the answer, the chief judge of the judicial circuit in which the alleged offense occurred shall designate a judge other than the judge who directed the filing of the motion to try said cause. Such judge shall conduct a hearing thereon and shall hear the evidence to be offered by the State of Florida and the respondent. A representative or representatives of The Florida Bar, appointed by the board, shall have the right to be present and to observe the proceedings. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the judge shall enter such judgment of dismissal, reprimand, probation, suspension, or disbarment as shall be appropriate to the circumstances. The parties shall be entitled to compulsory process to force the attendance of any witnesses.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Judgment filed in Supreme Court of Florida.</i> If the judgment be one of public reprimand, probation, suspension, or disbarment, three (3) certified copies of the same shall be forthwith filed by the clerk of the trial court with the clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida. The clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida shall retain one copy for the Court's records, deliver to the executive director of The Florida Bar one copy of the judgment for The Florida Bar's official records, and shall forthwith serve the third copy upon the respondent.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Petition for appellate review.</i> The respondent may appeal from a judgment entered by a circuit court. Such appeal shall be made in the manner provided by rule 3-7.6.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Duty to expedite proceedings.</i> It shall be the duty of the state attorney who is directed to file said motion to file the same promptly and to dispose of said controversy expeditiously.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Readmission or reinstatement.</i> Readmission or reinstatement of attorneys disbarred or suspended by proceedings in circuit courts shall be governed as elsewhere provided in these rules.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Reporting misconduct to The Florida Bar.</i> Nothing herein shall be construed to discourage or restrict the right and responsibility of a judge to refer to The Florida Bar the conduct of its members which in the opinion of the judge warrants investigation to determine if a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct has occurred.</p>\n<p>3-7.8 <i>Consent judgment.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Before formal complaint is filed.</i> If before a formal complaint is filed a respondent states his or her desire to plead guilty to a grievance committee report that finds probable cause and recommends further disciplinary proceedings, then staff counsel with the approval of the designated board reviewer and concurrence of the board of governors, may consult established board guidelines for discipline, and advise the respondent of the discipline that will be recommended to the Supreme Court of Florida if a written plea of guilty is entered. If the board of governors or designated reviewer rejects a proposed consent judgment, staff counsel shall prepare and file a complaint as provided elsewhere in these rules.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>After filing of formal complaint.</i> If a respondent states his or her desire to plead guilty to a formal complaint that has been filed, then bar counsel, with the approval of the designated board reviewer, may consult established board guidelines for discipline and advise the respondent of the discipline the bar will recommend to the referee if a written plea of guilty is entered.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Approval of consent judgments.</i> Acceptance of any proposed consent judgment more severe than a private reprimand shall be conditional on final approval by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1014</span> Supreme Court of Florida, and the Court's order will recite the disciplinary charges against the respondent.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Content of conditional pleas.</i> All conditional pleas shall show clearly by reference or otherwise the disciplinary offenses to which the plea is made.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Authority of staff counsel.</i> Staff counsel has no authority to commit the board on any consent judgment not previously approved by the board. All consent judgments tentatively approved by staff counsel without prior approval of the board shall be subject to board approval. In negotiating consent judgments with a respondent or in recommending acceptance, rejection or offer of a tendered consent judgment the grievance committee, branch staff counsel and designated reviewer shall consider and express a recommendation on whether the consent judgment shall include withdrawal of any designations held by the attorney and restrictions to be placed on redesignation in such areas. When withdrawal of designation is agreed to in a consent judgment, the withdrawal and any conditions on redesignation will be reported to the designation staff for recording purposes.</p>\n<p>3-7.9 <i>Reinstatement and readmission procedures.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Readmission.</i> A former member who has been disbarred or who has been permitted to resign pending disciplinary proceedings, pursuant to rule 3-7.11, may only be admitted again upon full compliance with the rules and regulations governing admission to the bar.

Such costs in the discretion of the board of governors may include court reporters' fees, witness fees and traveling expenses, and reasonable traveling expenses and out-of-pocket costs of the referee and attorneys for The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Reference of petition for hearing.</i> The chief justice shall refer the petition for reinstatement to a referee for hearing. Provided, however, that no such reference shall be made until evidence is submitted showing that all costs assessed against the petitioner in all disciplinary proceedings have been paid.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Attorney for the bar.</i> When a petition for reinstatement is filed, the board of governors or staff counsel, if authorized by the board of governors, may appoint, from the active members of The Florida Bar designated by the staff counsel to serve as bar counsel, one or more attorneys to represent The Florida Bar in the proceeding. The duties of such attorneys shall be to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1015</span> appear at the hearings and to prepare and present to the referee evidence which, in the opinion of the referee or such attorneys, should be considered in passing upon the petition.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Determination of fitness by referee hearing.</i> The referee to which the petition for reinstatement is referred shall conduct the hearing as a trial, in the same manner, to the extent practical, as proceedings are conducted under the rule concerning trials.

Such report shall be in the form prescribed by the board. The referee shall file the report and record in the Supreme Court of Florida and shall serve a copy of the report and record on staff counsel and a copy of the report only on all other parties. Staff counsel shall make a copy of the record, as furnished, available to other parties upon request and payment of actual costs of reproduction.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Review.</i> Review of referee reports in reinstatement proceedings shall be in accordance with rule 3-7.6.</p>\n<p>(k) <i>Judgment.</i> If the petitioner is found unfit to resume the practice of law, the petition shall be dismissed. If the petitioner is found fit to resume the practice of law, the judgment shall reinstate him in The Florida Bar; provided, however, that the judgment may make such reinstatement conditional upon the payment of all or part of the costs of the proceeding and upon the making of partial or complete restitution to parties harmed by the petitioner's misconduct which led to the petitioner's suspension of membership in The Florida Bar; and further provided, however, if suspension of petitioner has continued for more than three (3) years, the reinstatement may be conditioned upon the furnishing of such proof of competency as may be required by the judgment in the discretion of the Supreme Court of Florida, which proof may include certification by the Florida Board of Bar Examiners of the successful completion of an examination for admission to The Florida Bar subsequent to the date of the suspension.</p>\n<p>(<i>l</i>) <i>Successive petitions.</i> No petition for reinstatement shall be filed within one year following an adverse judgment upon a petition for reinstatement filed by or on behalf of the same person.</p>\n<p>(m) <i>Readmission after resignation.</i> In the case of a resignation submitted in connection with a disciplinary action, no readmission application may be filed until three (3) years after the date of the order of the Supreme Court of Florida which accepted such resignation or such additional time as the attorney may have stated in a petition to resign and not until all costs in disciplinary cases that were dismissed because of the resignation have been paid by the applicant for readmission. If an attorney's petition to resign states that it is without leave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1016</span> to apply for readmission permanently, such condition shall preclude any readmission.</p>\n<p>(n) <i>Petitions for reinstatement to membership in good standing.</i> Petitions for reinstatement under this rule are available to suspended members of the bar when the disciplinary judgment conditions their reinstatement upon a showing of compliance with specified conditions.</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Style of petition.</i> Petitions shall be styled in the Supreme Court of Florida and filed with the Supreme Court of Florida in quadruplicate, with a copy served on staff counsel and The Florida Bar in Tallahassee.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Contents of petition.</i> The petition shall be verified by petitioner and shall be accompanied by a written authorization to the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service, authorizing the furnishing of certified copies of petitioner's tax returns for the past five (5) years or since admission to the bar, whichever is greater.

Every attorney of another state who is permitted to practice for the purpose of a specific case before a court of record of this state may be served by registered or certified mail addressed to said attorney in care of the Florida attorney who was associated or appeared with the attorney in the specific case for which the out-of-state attorney was permitted to practice or addressed to said attorney at any address listed by the attorney in the pleadings in such case.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Notice in lieu of process.</i> Every member of The Florida Bar is within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida and its agencies under these rules, and service of process is not required to obtain jurisdiction over respondents in disciplinary proceedings; but due process requires the giving of reasonable notice and such shall be effective by the service of the complaint upon the respondent by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail return receipt requested to the last-known address of the respondent according to the records of The Florida Bar or such later address as may be known to the person effecting the service.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Subpoenas.</i> Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence other than before a circuit court shall be issued as follows:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Referees.</i> Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and production of documentary evidence before a referee shall be issued by the referee and shall be served in the manner provided by law for the service of process.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Grievance committees.</i> Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1018</span> be issued by the chairperson or vice-chairperson of a grievance committee in pursuance of an investigation authorized by the committee. Such subpoenas may be served by any member of such committee or in the manner provided by law for the service of process.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Board of governors.</i> Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence before the board of governors shall be issued by the executive director under the seal of The Florida Bar and shall be served in the manner provided by law for the service of process.</p>\n<p>(4) <i>Confidential proceedings.</i> If the proceeding is confidential a subpoena shall not name the respondent but shall style the proceeding as \"Confidential Proceeding by The Florida Bar under the Rules of Discipline.\"</p>\n<p>(5) <i>Contempt.</i> Any persons who without adequate excuse fail to obey such a subpoena served upon them may be cited for contempt of this Court in the manner provided by this rule.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Oath of witnesses.</i> Every witness in every proceeding under these rules shall be sworn to tell the truth and not to disclose the existence of the proceeding and the identity of the respondent until the proceeding is no longer confidential under these rules. Violation of the oath shall be an act of contempt of this Court.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Contempt.</i> If an agency other than a circuit court shall find that a person is in contempt under these rules, such person shall be cited for contempt in the following manner, except that a respondent in a disciplinary proceeding may be cited for contempt by petition for an order to show cause filed and heard in the Supreme Court of Florida or in the circuit court:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Petition for order to show cause.</i> The agency shall direct bar counsel or chairperson of the agency if there is no bar counsel serving in the matter in which the contempt occurs to present to the circuit court having jurisdiction a petition for the issuance of an order to show cause why the person so accused should not be held in contempt of this Court.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Confidentiality.</i> If the proceeding in which the contempt occurs is a confidential proceeding, the confidentiality shall be preserved in the contempt proceeding in the following manner: pleadings shall be styled \"Proceeding by The Florida Bar under the Rules of Discipline, The Florida Bar v. (name of accused in contempt proceeding).\" No pleadings or matters shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court; instead all such matters shall be presented to the circuit judge hearing the same and shall be returned to the agency upon completion of the contempt proceedings and then filed with the record in the disciplinary case. Docket entries and sentences or judgments in contempt in the circuit court shall be styled as provided for in the pleadings and shall make no references to the respondent in the disciplinary proceedings in which the contempt occurred. If the name of the respondent shall become of public record, the court having jurisdiction in the contempt proceeding shall take appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of the disciplinary proceedings and shall consider whether or not the person responsible for the making of the name of the respondent of public record is also guilty of contempt under these Rules of Discipline.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Appellate review.</i> A judgment in such contempt proceedings may be appealed by either party in the manner provided in the rule on appellate review, except that a copy of the petition for review shall not be filed with the clerk of the circuit court, and the record shall be forwarded by the judge or the agency possessing the same.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Testimony of witnesses; contempt.</i> Unless the respondent claims a privilege or right properly available under applicable law, the respondent or any other person who is subpoenaed to appear and give testimony or produce books, papers, or documents and who refuses to appear or produce such books, papers, or documents or who, having been duly sworn to testify, refuses to answer any proper question may be cited for contempt of this Court. Any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1019</span> contempt proceedings instituted or prosecuted during the progress of an investigation or trial covered by the confidential rule shall be conducted in a manner consistent with such rule and shall not be made public except under conditions prescribed in such rule.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Court reporters.</i> Court reporters who are full- or part-time employees of The Florida Bar may be appointed to report any disciplinary proceeding. If the respondent attorney objects at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the matter to be recorded, an independent contract reporter may be retained. Reasonable costs for court reporter service may be taxed to a respondent for payment to The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>Disqualification as trier and attorney for respondent due to conflict.</i></p>\n<p>(1) <i>Employees and members of the board of governors.</i> No employee of The Florida Bar and no member of the board of governors of The Florida Bar shall represent a party other than The Florida Bar in any of the following specific matters:</p>\n<p>a. Designation appeals;</p>\n<p>b. Certification appeals;</p>\n<p>c. Appeals to or from the committee on professional ethics; and</p>\n<p>d. Cases being investigated or litigated involving the unlicensed practice of law.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Former members or employees.</i> No former member of the board of governors or former employee of The Florida Bar shall represent any party other than The Florida Bar in such matters if personally involved to any degree in the matter while a member of the board of governors or while an employee of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Attorneys precluded from representing parties other than The Florida Bar.</i> An attorney shall not represent any party other than The Florida Bar in proceedings provided for in these disciplinary rules under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>a. If the attorney is a member or former member of the board of governors, member or former member of any grievance committee, or employee or former employee of The Florida Bar and while in such capacity participated personally in any way in the investigation or prosecution of the matter or any related matter in which the attorney seeks to be a representative or if the attorney served in a supervisory capacity over such investigation or prosecution;</p>\n<p>b. A partner, associate, employer, or employee of an attorney prohibited from representation by paragraph (3) a shall likewise be prohibited from representing any such party;</p>\n<p>c. A member of the board shall not represent any party except The Florida Bar while serving as a member of the board of governors or for one year thereafter;</p>\n<p>d. An employee of The Florida Bar shall not represent any party except The Florida Bar while an employee of The Florida Bar and shall not thereafter represent such party for a period of one year without the express consent of the board;</p>\n<p>e. A member of a grievance committee shall not represent any party except The Florida Bar while a member of a grievance committee and shall not thereafter represent such party for a period of one year without the express consent of the board; and</p>\n<p>f. A partner, associate, employer, or employee of an attorney prohibited from representation by paragraphs (3)c, (3)d, and (3)e of this rule shall not represent any party except The Florida Bar without the express consent of the board of governors.</p>\n<p>3-7.11 <i>Resignation from The Florida Bar.</i> If a disciplinary agency is investigating the conduct of an attorney, or if such an agency has recommended probable cause, then disciplinary proceedings shall be deemed to be pending and the resignation shall be made pursuant to this rule. An attorney may resign from The Florida Bar during the progress of disciplinary proceedings in the following manner:</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Petition for leave to resign.</i> The petition for leave to resign shall be filed with the Supreme Court of Florida and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1020</span> shall contain a statement of all past and pending disciplinary actions and criminal proceedings against the petitioner. Such statement shall describe the charges made or those under investigation for professional misconduct, results of past proceedings and the status of pending investigations and proceedings. The petition shall state whether it is with or without leave to reapply. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the executive director of The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Judgment.</i> Within sixty (60) days after filing and service of the petition, The Florida Bar may file with the Supreme Court of Florida its response to the petition either supporting or opposing the petition for leave to resign. A copy of the response shall be served upon petitioner. The Supreme Court of Florida shall consider the petition, any response thereto, and the charges against the petitioner. If it has been shown by the petitioner in a proper and competent manner that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the granting of the petition and that such will not adversely affect the purity of the courts nor hinder the administration of justice nor the confidence of the public in the legal profession, the Supreme Court of Florida shall enter an appropriate judgment granting leave to resign; otherwise, the petition shall be denied. If the judgment grants to the petitioner leave to resign, the judgment may require that the resignation be subject to appropriate conditions.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Delay of disciplinary proceedings.</i> The filing of a petition for leave to resign pending disciplinary proceedings shall not stay the progress of the disciplinary proceedings without the approval of the board or, if a referee has been appointed and evidence has been taken, then with the approval of the referee.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Dismissal of pending disciplinary cases.</i> If resignation is accepted under this rule, such resignation shall serve to dismiss all pending disciplinary cases. The resigned attorney may be readmitted as a member of The Florida Bar in good standing pursuant to rule 3-7.9(a) and (m) and upon full compliance with any conditions required by the judgment which granted the leave to resign. A rejection of such application may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>3-7.12 <i>Placement on inactive list for incapacity not related to misconduct.</i> Whenever an attorney who has not been adjudged incompetent is incapable of practicing law because of physical or mental illness, incapacity, or other infirmity, the attorney may be placed upon an inactive list and shall refrain from the practice of law for such reason even though no misconduct is alleged or proved. Proceedings with a view of placing an attorney on the inactive list under this section shall be processed under the Rules of Discipline in the same manner as proceedings involving acts of misconduct. A member who has been placed on such inactive list may be readmitted upon application to and approval by the board of governors. A rejection of such petition may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>A lawyer who has been adjudicated insane or mentally incompetent or hospitalized under the Florida Mental Health Act shall be placed on an inactive list and shall refrain from the practice of law. If an order of restoration is entered by a court having jurisdiction or the lawyer is discharged from hospitalization under the Florida Mental Health Act, the lawyer may be readmitted upon application to and approval by the board of governors. A rejection of such petition may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p>3-7.13 <i>Florida Statutes superseded.</i> These Rules of Discipline shall supersede such parts of sections 454.18, 454.31, and 454.32, Florida Statutes (1977), as are in conflict herewith.</p>\n<p>3-7.14 <i>Amendments.</i> Petitions for revision of or amendments to chapter 3 will be entertained by this Court when presented by the board of governors or by not fewer than fifty (50) active members of The Florida Bar. Notice of intention to file such petition together with a copy of the proposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1021</span> amendment shall be published in The Florida Bar <i>News</i> not less than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such petition. The Court will thereafter accept objections or comments on such petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chapter 4</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PREAMBLE: A Lawyer's Responsibilities</h2>\n<p>A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system, and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.</p>\n<p>As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As an adviser, a lawyer provides a client with an informed understanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As an advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As a negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As an intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks to reconcile their interests as an adviser and, to a limited extent, as a spokesman for each client. A lawyer acts as an evaluator by examining a client's legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.</p>\n<p>In all professional functions a lawyer should be competent, prompt, and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure is required or permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or by law.</p>\n<p>A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's business and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers, and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also a lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.</p>\n<p>As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice, and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law, and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A lawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.</p>\n<p>Many of the lawyer's professional responsibilities are prescribed in the Rules of Professional Conduct and in substantive and procedural law. A lawyer is also guided by personal conscience and the approbation of professional peers. A lawyer should strive to attain the highest level of skill, to improve the law and the legal profession, and to exemplify the legal profession's ideals of public service.</p>\n<p>A lawyer's responsibilities as a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system, and a public citizen are usually harmonious. Zealous advocacy is not inconsistent with justice. Moreover, unless violations of law or injury to another or his property are involved, preserving client confidences ordinarily serves the public interest because people are more likely to seek legal advice, and thereby heed their legal obligations, when they know their communications will be private.</p>\n<p>In the practice of law conflicting responsibilities are often encountered. Difficult ethical problems may arise from a conflict between a lawyer's responsibility to a client and the lawyer's own sense of personal honor, including obligations to society and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1022</span> the legal profession. The Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe terms for resolving such conflicts. Within the framework of these rules many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. Such issues must be resolved through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the rules.</p>\n<p>Lawyers are officers of the court and they are responsible to the judiciary for the propriety of their professional activities. Within that context, the legal profession has been granted powers of self-government. Self-regulation helps maintain the legal profession's independence from undue government domination. An independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse to legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on the executive and legislative branches of government for the right to practice. Supervision by an independent judiciary, and conformity with the rules the judiciary adopts for the profession, assures both independence and responsibility.</p>\n<p>Thus, every lawyer is responsible for observance of the Rules of Professional Conduct. A lawyer should also aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Scope:</i></h2>\n<p>The Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason. They should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law itself. Some of the rules are imperatives, cast in the terms of \"shall\" or \"shall not.\" These define proper conduct for purposes of professional discipline. Others, generally cast in the term \"may,\" are permissive and define areas under the rules in which the lawyer has professional discretion. No disciplinary action should be taken when the lawyer chooses not to act or acts within the bounds of such discretion. Other rules define the nature of relationships between the lawyer and others. The rules are thus partly obligatory and disciplinary and partly constitutive and descriptive in that they define a lawyer's professional role.</p>\n<p>The comment accompanying each rule explains and illustrates the meaning and purpose of the rule. The comments are intended only as guides to interpretation, whereas the text of each rule is authoritative. Thus, comments, even when they use the term \"should,\" do not add obligations to the rules but merely provide guidance for practicing in compliance with the rules.</p>\n<p>The rules presuppose a larger legal context shaping the lawyer's role. That context includes court rules and statutes relating to matters of licensure, laws defining specific obligations of lawyers and substantive and procedural law in general. Compliance with the rules, as with all law in an open society, depends primarily upon understanding and voluntary compliance, secondarily upon reinforcement by peer and public opinion, and finally, when necessary, upon enforcement through disciplinary proceedings. The rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, for purposes of determining the lawyer's authority and responsibility, principles of substantive law external to these rules determine whether a client-lawyer relationship exists. Most of the duties flowing from the client-lawyer relationship attach only after the client has requested the lawyer to render legal services and the lawyer has agrees to do so. But there are some duties, such as that of confidentiality under rule 4-1.6, which may attach when the lawyer agrees to consider whether a client-lawyer relationship shall be established. Whether a client-lawyer relationship exists for any specific purpose can depend on the circumstances and may be a question of fact.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1023</span> Failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a rule is a basis for invoking the disciplinary process. The rules presuppose that disciplinary assessment of a lawyer's conduct will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the conduct in question in recognition of the fact that a lawyer often has to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence of the situation. Moreover, the rules presuppose that whether or not discipline should be imposed for a violation, and the severity of a sanction, depend on all the circumstances, such as the willfulness and seriousness of the violation, extenuating factors, and whether there have been previous violations.</p>\n<p>Violation of a rule should not give rise to a cause of action nor should it create any presumption that a legal duty has been breached. The rules are designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not designed to be a basis for civil liability. Furthermore, the purpose of the rules can be subverted when they are invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons. The fact that a rule is a just basis for a lawyer's self-assessment, or for sanctioning a lawyer under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply that an antagonist in a collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to seek enforcement of the rule. Accordingly, nothing in the rules should be deemed to augment any substantive legal duty of lawyers or the extra-disciplinary consequences of violating such duty.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these rules are not intended to govern or affect judicial application of either the attorney-client or work product privilege. Those privileges were developed to promote compliance with law and fairness in litigation. In reliance on the attorney-client privilege, clients are ordinarily entitled to expect that communications within the scope of the privilege will be protected against compelled disclosure. The attorney-client privilege is that of the client and not of the lawyer. In exceptional situations, the rules might allow or require the lawyer to disclose a client confidence. This, however, does not vitiate the proposition that, as a general matter, the client has a reasonable expectation that information relating to the client will not be voluntarily disclosed and that disclosure of such information may be compelled only in accordance with recognized exceptions to the attorney-client and work product privileges.</p>\n<p>The lawyer's exercise of discretion not to disclose information under rule 4-1.6 should not be subject to reexamination. Permitting such reexamination would be incompatible with the general policy of promoting compliance with law through assurances that communications will be protected against disclosure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Terminology:</i></h2>\n<p>\"Belief\" or \"believes\" denotes that the person involved actually supposed the fact in question to be true. A person's belief may be inferred from circumstances.</p>\n<p>\"Consult\" or \"consultation\" denotes communication of information reasonably sufficient to permit the client to appreciate the significance of the matter in question.</p>\n<p>\"Firm\" or \"law firm\" denotes a lawyer or lawyers in a private firm, lawyers employed in the legal department of a corporation or other organization and lawyers employed in a legal services organization. See comment, rule 4-1.10.</p>\n<p>\"Fraud\" or \"fraudulent\" denotes conduct having a purpose to deceive and not merely negligent misrepresentation or failure to apprise another of relevant information.</p>\n<p>\"Knowingly,\" \"known,\" or \"knows\" denotes actual knowledge of the fact in question. A person's knowledge may be inferred from circumstances.</p>\n<p>\"Lawyer\" denotes a person who is a member of The Florida Bar or otherwise authorized to practice in any court of the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>\"Partner\" denotes a member of a partnership and a shareholder in a law firm organized as a professional corporation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1024</span> \"Reasonable\" or \"reasonably\" when used in relation to conduct by a lawyer denotes the conduct of a reasonably prudent and competent lawyer.</p>\n<p>\"Reasonable belief\" or \"reasonably believes\" when used in reference to a lawyer denotes that the lawyer believes the matter in question and that the circumstances are such that the belief is reasonable.</p>\n<p>\"Reasonably should know\" when used in reference to a lawyer denotes that a lawyer of reasonable prudence and competence would ascertain the matter in question.</p>\n<p>\"Substantial\" when used in reference to degree or extent denotes a material matter of clear and weighty importance.</p>\n<p>4-1 <i>Client-lawyer relationship.</i></p>\n<p>4-1.1 <i>Competence.</i> A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Legal knowledge and skill</i></h2>\n<p>In determining whether a lawyer employs the requisite knowledge and skill in a particular matter, relevant factors include the relative complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer's general experience, the lawyer's training and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give the matter, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer of established competence in the field in question. In many instances the required proficiency is that of a general practitioner. Expertise in a particular field of law may be required in some circumstances.</p>\n<p>A lawyer need not necessarily have special training or prior experience to handle legal problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar. A newly admitted lawyer can be as competent as a practitioner with long experience. Some important legal skills, such as the analysis of precedent, the evaluation of evidence and legal drafting, are required in all legal problems. Perhaps the most fundamental legal skill consists of determining what kind of legal problems a situation may involve, a skill that necessarily transcends any particular specialized knowledge. A lawyer can provide adequate representation in a wholly novel field through necessary study. Competent representation can also be provided through the association of a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.</p>\n<p>In an emergency a lawyer may give advice or assistance in a matter in which the lawyer does not have the skill ordinarily required where referral to or consultation or association with another lawyer would be impractical. Even in an emergency, however, assistance should be limited to that reasonably necessary in the circumstances, for ill-considered action under emergency conditions can jeopardize the client's interest.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may accept representation where the requisite level of competence can be achieved by reasonable preparation. This applies as well to a lawyer who is appointed as counsel for an unrepresented person. See also rule 4-6.2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Thoroughness and preparation</i></h2>\n<p>Competent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem, and use of methods and procedures meeting the standards of competent practitioners. It also includes adequate preparation. The required attention and preparation are determined in part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more elaborate treatment than matters of lesser consequence. The lawyer should consult with the client about the degree of thoroughness and the level of preparation required as well as the estimated costs involved under the circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Maintaining competence</i></h2>\n<p>To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, a lawyer should engage in continuing study and education.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1025</span> 4-1.2 <i>Scope of representation.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, subject to paragraphs (c), (d), and (e), and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer shall abide by a client's decision whether to make or accept an offer of settlement of a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer's representation of a client, including representation by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client's political, economic, social, or moral views or activities.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer may limit the objectives of the representation if the client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is criminal or fraudulent. However, a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning, or application of the law.</p>\n<p>(e) When a lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a client expects assistance not permitted by the rules of professional conduct or by law, the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations on the lawyer's conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Scope of representation</i></h2>\n<p>Both lawyer and client have authority and responsibility in the objectives and means of representation. The client has ultimate authority to determine the purposes to be served by legal representation, within the limits imposed by law and the lawyer's professional obligations. Within those limits, a client also has a right to consult with the lawyer about the means to be used in pursuing those objectives. At the same time, a lawyer is not required to pursue objectives or employ means simply because a client may wish that the lawyer do so. A clear distinction between objectives and means sometimes cannot be drawn, and in many cases the client-lawyer relationship partakes of a joint undertaking. In questions of means, the lawyer should assume responsibility for technical and legal tactical issues but should defer to the client regarding such questions as the expense to be incurred and concern for third persons who might be adversely affected. Law defining the lawyer's scope of authority in litigation varies among jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>In a case in which the client appears to be suffering mental disability, the lawyer's duty to abide by the client's decisions is to be guided by reference to rule 4-1.14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Independence from client's views or activities</i></h2>\n<p>Legal representation should not be denied to people who are unable to afford legal services or whose cause is controversial or the subject of popular disapproval. By the same token representing a client does not constitute approval of the client's views or activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Services limited in objectives or means</i></h2>\n<p>The objectives or scope of services provided by a lawyer may be limited by agreement with the client or by the terms under which the lawyer's services are made available to the client. For example, a retainer may be for a specifically defined purpose. Representation provided through a legal aid agency may be subject to limitations on the types of cases the agency handles. When a lawyer has been retained by an insurer to represent an insured, the representation may be limited to matters related to the insurance coverage. The terms upon which representation is undertaken may exclude specific objectives or means. Such limitations may exclude objectives or means that the lawyer regards as repugnant or imprudent.</p>\n<p>An agreement concerning the scope of representation must accord with the Rules <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1026</span> of Professional Conduct and law. Thus, the client may not be asked to agree to representation so limited in scope as to violate rule 4-1.1 or to surrender the right to terminate the lawyer's services or the right to settle litigation that the lawyer might wish to continue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Criminal, fraudulent, and prohibited transactions</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is required to give an honest opinion about the actual consequences that appear likely to result from a client's conduct. The fact that a client uses advice in a course of action that is criminal or fraudulent does not, of itself, make a lawyer a party to the course of action. However, a lawyer may not assist a client in conduct which the lawyer knows or reasonably should know to be criminal or fraudulent. There is a critical distinction between presenting an analysis of legal aspects of questionable conduct and recommending the means by which a crime or fraud might be committed with impunity.</p>\n<p>When the client's course of action has already begun and is continuing, the lawyer's responsibility is especially delicate. The lawyer is not permitted to reveal the client's wrongdoing, except where permitted or required by rule 4-1.6. However, the lawyer is required to avoid furthering the purpose, for example, by suggesting how it might be concealed. A lawyer may not continue assisting a client in conduct that the lawyer originally supposes is legally proper but then discovers is criminal or fraudulent. Withdrawal from the representation, therefore, may be required.</p>\n<p>Where the client is a fiduciary, the lawyer may be charged with special obligations in dealings with a beneficiary.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (d) applies whether or not the defrauded party is a party to the transaction. Hence, a lawyer should not participate in a sham transaction; for example, a transaction to effectuate criminal or fraudulent escape of tax liability. Paragraph (d) does not preclude undertaking a criminal defense incident to a general retainer for legal services to a lawful enterprise. The last sentence of paragraph (d) recognizes that determining the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation may require a course of action involving disobedience of the statute or regulation or of the interpretation placed upon it by governmental authorities.</p>\n<p>4-1.3 <i>Diligence.</i> A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf of a client despite opposition, obstruction or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and may take whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client's cause or endeavor. A lawyer should act with commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client's behalf. However, a lawyer is not bound to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client. A lawyer has professional discretion in determining the means by which a matter should be pursued. See rule 4-1.2. A lawyer's workload should be controlled so that each matter can be handled adequately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps no professional shortcoming is more widely resented than procrastination. A client's interests often can be adversely affected by the passage of time or the change of conditions; in extreme instances, as when a lawyer overlooks a statute of limitations, the client's legal position may be destroyed. Even when the client's interests are not affected in substance, however, unreasonable delay can cause a client needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the lawyer.</p>\n<p>Unless the relationship is terminated as provided in rule 4-1.16, a lawyer should carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client. If a lawyer's employment is limited to a specific matter, the relationship terminates when the matter has been resolved. If a lawyer has served a client over a substantial period in a variety of matters, the client sometimes may assume that the lawyer will continue to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1027</span> serve on a continuing basis unless the lawyer gives notice of withdrawal. Doubt about whether a client-lawyer relationship still exists should be clarified by the lawyer, preferably in writing, so that the client will not mistakenly suppose the lawyer is looking after the client's affairs when the lawyer has ceased to do so. For example, if a lawyer has handled a judicial or administrative proceeding that produced a result adverse to the client but has not been specifically instructed concerning pursuit of an appeal, the lawyer should advise the client of the possibility of appeal before relinquishing responsibility for the matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4-1.4 <i>Communication.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and the means by which they are to be pursued, to the extent the client is willing and able to do so. For example, a lawyer negotiating on behalf of a client should provide the client with facts relevant to the matter, inform the client of communications from another party and take other reasonable steps that permit the client to make a decision regarding a serious offer from another party. A lawyer who receives from opposing counsel an offer of settlement in a civil controversy or a proffered plea bargain in a criminal case should promptly inform the client of its substance unless prior discussions with the client have left it clear that the proposal will be unacceptable. See rule 4-1.2(a). Even when a client delegates authority to the lawyer, the client should be kept advised of the status of the matter.</p>\n<p>Adequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance involved. For example, in negotiations where there is time to explain a proposal, the lawyer should review all important provisions with the client before proceeding to an agreement. In litigation a lawyer should explain the general strategy and prospects of success and ordinarily should consult the client on tactics that might injure or coerce others. On the other hand, a lawyer ordinarily cannot be expected to describe trial or negotiation strategy in detail. The guiding principle is that the lawyer should fulfill reasonable client expectations for information consistent with the duty to act in the client's best interests and the client's overall requirements as to the character of representation.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, the information to be provided is that appropriate for a client who is a comprehending and responsible adult. However, fully informing the client according to this standard may be impracticable, for example, where the client is a child or suffers from mental disability. See rule 4-1.14. When the client is an organization or group, it is often impossible or inappropriate to inform every one of its members about its legal affairs; ordinarily, the lawyer should address communications to the appropriate officials of the organization. See rule 4-1.13. Where many routine matters are involved, a system of limited or occasional reporting may be arranged with the client. Practical exigency may also require a lawyer to act for a client without prior consultation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Withholding information</i></h2>\n<p>In some circumstances, a lawyer may be justified in delaying transmission of information when the client would be likely to react imprudently to an immediate communication. Thus, a lawyer might withhold a psychiatric diagnosis of a client when the examining psychiatrist indicates that disclosure would harm the client. A lawyer may not withhold information to serve the lawyer's own interest or convenience. Rules or court orders governing litigation may provide that information supplied to a lawyer may not be disclosed to the client. Rule 4-3.4(c) directs compliance with such rules or orders.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1028</span> 4-1.5 <i>Fees.</i></p>\n<p>(A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.</p>\n<p>(B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee. Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>\n<p>(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>\n<p>(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</p>\n<p>(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>\n<p>(4) The amount involved and the results obtained;</p>\n<p>(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>\n<p>(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</p>\n<p>(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</p>\n<p>(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>\n<p>(C) When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.</p>\n<p>(D) As to contingent fees:</p>\n<p>(1) A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by paragraph (D)(3) or by law. A contingent fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial, or appeal, litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery, and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.</p>\n<p>(2) Every lawyer who accepts a retainer or enters into an agreement, express or implied, for compensation for services rendered or to be rendered in any action, claim, or proceeding whereby the lawyer's compensation is to be dependent or contingent in whole or in part upon the successful prosecution or settlement thereof shall do so only where such fee arrangement is reduced to a written contract, signed by the client, and by a lawyer for the lawyer or for the law firm representing the client. No lawyer or firm may participate in the fee without the consent of the client in writing. Each participating lawyer or law firm shall sign the contract with the client and shall agree to assume joint responsibility for the representation. The client shall be furnished with a copy of the signed contract and any subsequent notices or consents. All provisions of this rule shall apply to such fee contracts.</p>\n<p>(3) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>\n<p>(a) Any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof; or</p>\n<p>(b) A contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.</p>\n<p>(4) A lawyer who enters into an arrangement for, charges, or collects any fee in an action or claim for personal injury or for property damages or for death or loss of services resulting from personal injuries based upon tortious conduct of another, including products liability claims, whereby the compensation is to be dependent or contingent in whole or in part upon the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1029</span> successful prosecution or settlement thereof shall do so only under the following requirements:</p>\n<p>(a) The contract shall contain the following provisions:</p>\n<p>1. \"The undersigned client has, before signing this contract, received and read the statement of client's rights and understands each of the rights set forth therein. The undersigned client has signed the statement and received a signed copy to refer to while being represented by the undersigned attorney(s).\"</p>\n<p>2. \"This contract may be cancelled by written notification to the attorney at any time within three (3) business days of the date the contract was signed, as shown below, and if cancelled the client shall not be obligated to pay any fees to the attorney(s) for the work performed during that time. If the attorney(s) have advanced funds to others in representation of the client, the attorney(s) are entitled to be reimbursed for such amounts as they have reasonably advanced on behalf of the client.\"</p>\n<p>(b) The contract for representation of a client in a matter set forth in paragraph (D)(4) may provide for a contingent fee arrangement as agreed upon by the client and the lawyer, except as limited by the following provisions:</p>\n<p>1. Without prior court approval as specified below, any contingent fee which exceeds the following standards shall be presumed, unless rebutted, to be clearly excessive:</p>\n<p>a. 33-1/3% of any recovery up to $1 million through the time of filing of an answer or the demand for appointment of arbitrators;</p>\n<p>b. 40% of any recovery up to $1 million through the trial of the case;</p>\n<p>c. 30% of any recovery between $1 and $2 million;</p>\n<p>d. 20% of any recovery in excess of $2 million;</p>\n<p>e. If all defendants admit liability at the time of filing their answers and request a trial only on damages:</p>\n<p>(i) 33-1/3% of any recovery up to $1 million through trial;</p>\n<p>(ii) 20% of any recovery from that defendant between $1 and $2 million;</p>\n<p>(iii) 15% of any recovery from that defendant in excess of $2 million;</p>\n<p>f. An additional 5% of any recovery after notice of appeal is filed or post-judgment relief or action is required for recovery on the judgment.</p>\n<p>2. If any client is unable to obtain an attorney of the client's choice because of the limitations set forth in (D)(4)(b)1, the client may petition the circuit court for approval of any fee contract between the client and an attorney of the client's choosing. Such authorization shall be given if the court determines the client has a complete understanding of his or her rights and the terms of the proposed contract. The application for authorization of such a contract can be filed as a separate proceeding before suit or simultaneously with the filing of a complaint. Proceedings thereon may occur before service on the defendant and this aspect of the file may be sealed. Authorization of such a contract shall not bar subsequent inquiry as to whether the fee actually claimed or charged is clearly excessive under paragraphs (A) and (B).</p>\n<p>3. In cases where the client is to receive a recovery which will be paid to the client on a future structured or periodic basis, the contingent fee percentage shall only be calculated on the cost of the structured verdict or settlement or, if the cost is unknown, on the present money value of the structured verdict or settlement, whichever is less. If the damages and the fee are to be paid out over the long term future schedule, then this limitation does not apply. No attorney may separately negotiate with the defendant for that attorney's fees in a structured verdict or settlement where such separate negotiations would place the attorney in a position of conflict.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1030</span> (c) Before a lawyer enters into a contingent fee contract for representation of a client in a matter set forth in this rule, the lawyer shall provide the client with a copy of the statement of client's rights and shall afford the client with a full and complete opportunity to understand each of the rights as set forth therein. A copy of the statement, signed by both the client and the lawyer, shall be given to the client to retain and the lawyer shall keep a copy in the client's file. The statement shall be retained by the lawyer with the written fee contract and closing statement under the same conditions and requirements as paragraph (D)(5).</p>\n<p>(5) In the event there is a recovery, upon the conclusion of the representation, the lawyer shall prepare a closing statement reflecting an itemization of all costs and expenses, together with the amount of fee received by each participating lawyer or law firm. The closing statement shall be executed by all participating lawyers, as well as the client, and each shall receive a copy. Each participating lawyer shall retain a copy of the written fee contract and closing statement for six (6) years after execution of the closing statement. Any contingent fee contract and closing statement shall be available for inspection at reasonable times by the client, by any other person upon judicial order, or by the appropriate disciplinary agency.</p>\n<p>(E) A division of fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if:</p>\n<p>(1) The division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, by written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation;</p>\n<p>(2) The client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers involved; and</p>\n<p>(3) The total fee is reasonable.</p>\n<p>(F) Charges made by any lawyer or law firm under an approved credit plan shall be only for services actually rendered or cash actually paid on behalf of the client. No higher fee shall be charged and no additional charge shall be imposed by reason of a lawyer's or law firm's participation in an approved credit plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STATEMENT OF CLIENT'S RIGHTS</h2>\n<p>Before you, the prospective client, arrange a contingent fee agreement with a lawyer, you should understand this statement of your rights as a client. This statement is not a part of the actual contract between you and your lawyer, but, as a prospective client, you should be aware of these rights:</p>\n<p>1. There is no legal requirement that a lawyer charge a client a set fee or a percentage of money recovered in a case. You, the client, have the right to talk with your lawyer about the proposed fee and to bargain about the rate or percentage as in any other contract. If you do not reach an agreement with one lawyer you may talk with other lawyers.</p>\n<p>2. Any contingent fee contract must be in writing and you have three (3) business days to reconsider the contract. You may cancel the contract without any reason if you notify your lawyer in writing within three (3) business days of signing the contract. If you withdraw from the contract within the first three (3) business days, you do not owe the lawyer a fee although you may be responsible for the lawyer's actual costs during that time. If your lawyer begins to represent you, your lawyer may not withdraw from the case without giving you notice, delivering necessary papers to you, and allowing you time to employ another lawyer. Often, your lawyer must obtain court approval before withdrawing from a case. If you discharge your lawyer without good cause after the three-day period, you may have to pay a fee for work the lawyer has done.</p>\n<p>3. Before hiring a lawyer, you, the client, have the right to know about the lawyer's education, training, and experience. If you ask, the lawyer should tell you specifically about his or her actual experience dealing with cases similar to yours. If you ask, the lawyer should provide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1031</span> information about special training or knowledge and give you this information in writing if you request it.</p>\n<p>4. Before signing a contingent fee contract with you, a lawyer must advise you whether he or she intends to handle your case alone or whether other lawyers will be helping with the case. If your lawyer intends to refer the case to other lawyers he or she should tell you what kind of fee sharing arrangement will be made with the other lawyers. If lawyers from different law firms will represent you, at least one lawyer from each law firm must sign the contingent fee contract.</p>\n<p>5. If your lawyer intends to refer your case to another lawyer or counsel with other lawyers, your lawyer should tell you about that at the beginning. If your lawyer takes the case and later decides to refer it to another lawyer or to associate with other lawyers, you should sign a new contract which includes the new lawyers. You, the client, also have the right to consult with each lawyer working on your case and each lawyer is legally responsible to represent your interests and is legally responsible for the acts of the other lawyers involved in the case.</p>\n<p>6. You, the client, have the right to know in advance how you will need to pay the expenses and the legal fees at the end of the case. If you pay a deposit in advance for costs, you may ask reasonable questions about how the money will be or has been spent and how much of it remains unspent. Your lawyer should give a reasonable estimate about future necessary costs. If your lawyer agrees to lend or advance you money to prepare or research the case, you have the right to know periodically how much money your lawyer has spent on your behalf. You also have the right to decide, after consulting with your lawyer, how much money is to be spent to prepare a case. If you pay the expenses, you have the right to decide how much to spend. Your lawyer should also inform you whether the fee will be based on the gross amount recovered or on the amount recovered minus the costs.</p>\n<p>7. You, the client, have the right to be told by your lawyer about possible adverse consequences if you lose the case. Those adverse consequences might include money which you might have to pay to your lawyer for costs and liability you might have for attorney's fees to the other side.</p>\n<p>8. You, the client, have the right to receive and approve a closing statement at the end of the case before you pay any money. The statement must list all of the financial details of the entire case, including the amount recovered, all expenses, and a precise statement of your lawyer's fee. Until you approve the closing statement you need not pay any money to anyone, including your lawyer. You also have the right to have every lawyer or law firm working on your case sign this closing statement.</p>\n<p>9. You, the client, have the right to ask your lawyer at reasonable intervals how the case is progressing and to have these questions answered to the best of your lawyer's ability.</p>\n<p>10. You, the client, have the right to make the final decision regarding settlement of a case. Your lawyer must notify you of all offers of settlement before and after the trial. Offers during the trial must be immediately communicated and you should consult with your lawyer regarding whether to accept a settlement. However, you must make the final decision to accept or reject a settlement.</p>\n<p>11. If at any time, you, the client, believe that your lawyer has charged an excessive or illegal fee, you, the client, have the right to report the matter to The Florida Bar, the agency that oversees the practice and behavior of all lawyers in Florida. For information on how to reach The Florida Bar, call XXX-XXX-XXXX, or contact the local bar association. Any disagreement between you and your lawyer about a fee can be taken to court and you may wish to hire another lawyer to help you resolve this disagreement. Usually fee disputes must be handled in a separate lawsuit.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1032</span>\n____________________  ______________________\n  Client Signature      Attorney Signature\n____________________  ______________________\n  Date                  Date\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Basis or rate of fee</i></h2>\n<p>When the lawyer has regularly represented a client, they ordinarily will have evolved an understanding concerning the basis or rate of the fee. In a new client-lawyer relationship, however, an understanding as to the fee should be promptly established. It is not necessary to recite all the factors that underlie the basis of the fee, but only those that are directly involved in its computation. It is sufficient, for example, to state the basic rate is an hourly charge or a fixed amount or an estimated amount, or to identify the factors that may be taken into account in finally fixing the fee. When developments occur during the representation that render an earlier estimate substantially inaccurate, a revised estimate should be provided to the client. A written statement concerning the fee reduces the possibility of misunderstanding. Furnishing the client with a simple memorandum or a copy of the lawyer's customary fee schedule is sufficient if the basis or rate of the fee is set forth.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.8(e) should be consulted regarding a lawyer's providing financial assistance to a client in connection with litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Terms of payment</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer may require advance payment of a fee, but is obliged to return any unearned portion. See rule 4-1.16(d). A lawyer is not, however, required to return retainers which, pursuant to an agreement with a client, are not refundable. A lawyer may accept property in payment for services, such as an ownership interest in an enterprise, providing this does not involve acquisition of a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of the litigation contrary to rule 4-1.8(i). However, a fee paid in property instead of money may be subject to special scrutiny because it involves questions concerning both the value of the services and the lawyer's special knowledge of the value of the property.</p>\n<p>An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest. For example, a lawyer should not enter into an agreement whereby services are to be provided only up to a stated amount when it is foreseeable that more extensive services probably will be required, unless the situation is adequately explained to the client. Otherwise, the client might have to bargain for further assistance in the midst of a proceeding or transaction. However, it is proper to define the extent of services in light of the client's ability to pay. A lawyer should not exploit a fee arrangement based primarily on hourly charges by using wasteful procedures. When there is doubt whether a contingent fee is consistent with the client's best interest, the lawyer should offer the client alternative bases for the fee and explain their implications. Applicable law may impose limitations on contingent fees, such as a ceiling on the percentage.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(3) does not apply to lawyers seeking to obtain or enforce judgments for arrearages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Contingent fee regulation</i></h2>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4) should not be construed to apply to actions or claims seeking property or other damages arising in the commercial litigation context.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) is intended to apply only to contingent aspects of fee agreements. In the situation where a lawyer and client enter a contract for part noncontingent and part contingent attorney's fees, rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) should not be construed to apply to and prohibit or limit the noncontingent portion of the fee agreement. An attorney could properly charge and retain the noncontingent portion of the fee even if the matter was not successfully prosecuted or if the noncontingent portion of the fee exceeded the schedule set forth in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b). Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) should, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1033</span> however, be construed to apply to any additional contingent portion of such a contract when considered together with earned noncontingent fees. Thus, under such a contract a lawyer may demand or collect only such additional contingent fees as would not cause the total fees to exceed the schedule set forth in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b).</p>\n<p>The limitations in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b)1.d. are only to be applied in the case where all the defendants admit liability at the time they file their initial answer and the trial is only on the issue of the amount or extent of the loss or the extent of injury suffered by the client. If the trial involves not only the issue of damages but such questions as proximate cause, affirmative defenses, seat belt defense, or other similar matters, the limitations are not to be applied because of the contingent nature of the case being left for resolution by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b)2. provides the limitations set forth in paragraph (D)(4)(b)1. may be waived by the client upon approval by a circuit court judge. This waiver provision may not be used to authorize a lawyer to charge a client a fee which would exceed rule 4-1.5(A) or (B). It is contemplated that this waiver provision will not be necessary except where the client wants to retain a particular lawyer to represent him or her or the case involves complex, difficult, or novel questions of law or fact which would justify a contingent fee greater than the schedule but not a contingent fee which would exceed rule 4-1.5(B).</p>\n<p>Upon a petition by a client, the trial court reviewing the waiver request must grant that request if the trial court finds the client: (a) understands his or her right to have the limitations in rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b) applied in the specific matter; and (b) understands and approves the terms of the proposed contract. The consideration by the trial court of the waiver petition is not to be used as an opportunity for the court to inquire into the merits or details of the particular action or claim which is the subject of the contract.</p>\n<p>The proceedings before the trial court and the trial court's decision on a waiver request are to be confidential and not subject to discovery by any of the parties to the action or by any other individual or entity except The Florida Bar. However, terms of the contract approved by the trial court may be subject to discovery if the contract (without court approval) was subject to discovery under applicable case law or rules of evidence.</p>\n<p>Rule 4-1.5(D)(4)(b)3. prohibits a lawyer from charging the contingent fee percentage on the total, future value of a recovery being paid on a structured or periodic basis. This prohibition does not apply if the lawyer's fee is being paid over the same length of time as the schedule of payments to the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Division of fee</i></h2>\n<p>A division of fee is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers who are not in the same firm. A division of fee facilitates association of more than one lawyer in a matter in which neither alone could serve the client as well, and most often is used when the fee is contingent and the division is between a referring lawyer and a trial specialist. Paragraph (E) permits the lawyers to divide a fee on either the basis of the proportion of services they render or by agreement between the participating lawyers if all assume responsibility for the representation as a whole and the client is advised and does not object. It does require disclosure to the client of the share that each lawyer is to receive. Joint responsibility for the representation entails the obligations stated in rule 4-5.1 for purposes of the matter involved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disputes over fees</i></h2>\n<p>If a procedure has been established for resolution of fee disputes, such as an arbitration or mediation procedure established by the bar, the lawyer should conscientiously consider submitting to it. Law may prescribe a procedure for determining a lawyer's fee, for example, in representation of an executor or administrator, a class, or a person entitled to a reasonable fee as part of the measure of damages. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1034</span> The lawyer entitled to such a fee and a lawyer representing another party concerned with the fee should comply with the prescribed procedure.</p>\n<p>4-1.6 <i>Confidentiality of information.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client except as stated in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) unless the client consents after disclosure to the client.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall reveal such information to the extent the lawyer believes necessary:</p>\n<p>(1) To prevent a client from committing a crime; or</p>\n<p>(2) To prevent a death or substantial bodily harm to another.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer believes necessary:</p>\n<p>(1) To serve the client's interest unless it is information the client specifically requires not to be disclosed;</p>\n<p>(2) To establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and client;</p>\n<p>(3) To establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved;</p>\n<p>(4) To respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client; or</p>\n<p>(5) To comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p>(d) When required by a tribunal to reveal such information, a lawyer may first exhaust all appellate remedies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The lawyer is part of a judicial system charged with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their rights.</p>\n<p>The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people to seek early legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's confidences must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.</p>\n<p>A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.</p>\n<p>The principle of confidentiality is given effect in two related bodies of law, the attorney-client privilege (which includes the work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The attorney-client privilege applies in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality rule applies not merely to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the Rules of Professional Conduct or by law. However, none of the foregoing limits the requirement of disclosure in paragraph (b). This disclosure is required to prevent a lawyer from becoming an unwitting accomplice in the fraudulent acts of a client. See also Scope.</p>\n<p>The requirement of maintaining confidentiality of information relating to representation applies to government lawyers who may disagree with the policy goals <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1035</span> that their representation is designed to advance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Authorized disclosure</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the representation, except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that authority. In litigation, for example, a lawyer may disclose information by admitting a fact that cannot properly be disputed or in negotiation by making a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion.</p>\n<p>Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm's practice, disclose to each other information relating to a client of the firm, unless the client has instructed that particular information be confined to specified lawyers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disclosure adverse to client</i></h2>\n<p>The confidentiality rule is subject to limited exceptions. In becoming privy to information about a client, a lawyer may foresee that the client intends serious harm to another person. However, to the extent a lawyer is required or permitted to disclose a client's purposes, the client will be inhibited from revealing facts which would enable the lawyer to counsel against a wrongful course of action. While the public may be protected if full and open communication by the client is encouraged, several situations must be distinguished.</p>\n<p>First, the lawyer may not counsel of assist a client in conduct that is criminal or fraudulent. See rule 4-1.2(d). Similarly, a lawyer has a duty under rule 4-3.3(a)(4) not to use false evidence. This duty is essentially a special instance of the duty prescribed in rule 4-1.2(d) to avoid assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p>Second, the lawyer may have been innocently involved in past conduct by the client that was criminal or fraudulent. In such a situation the lawyer has not violated rule 4-1.2(d), because to \"counsel or assist\" criminal or fraudulent conduct requires knowing that the conduct is of that character.</p>\n<p>Third, the lawyer may learn that a client intends prospective conduct that is criminal. As stated in paragraph (b)(1), the lawyer shall reveal information in order to prevent such consequences. It is admittedly difficult for a lawyer to \"know\" when the criminal intent will actually be carried out, for the client may have a change of mind.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b)(2) contemplates past acts on the part of a client which may result in present or future consequences that may be avoided by disclosure of otherwise confidential communications. Rule 4-1.6(b)(2) would now require the attorney to disclose information necessary to prevent the future death or substantial bodily harm to another, even though the act of the client has been completed.</p>\n<p>The lawyer's exercise of discretion requires consideration of such factors as the nature of the lawyer's relationship with the client and with those who might be injured by the client, the lawyer's own involvement in the transaction and factors that may extenuate the conduct in question. Where practical the lawyer should seek to persuade the client to take suitable action. In any case, a disclosure adverse to the client's interest should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to the purpose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>If the lawyer's services will be used by the client in materially furthering a course of criminal or fraudulent conduct, the lawyer must withdraw, as stated in rule 4-1.16(a)(1).</p>\n<p>After withdrawal the lawyer is required to refrain from making disclosure of the client's confidences, except as otherwise provided in rule 4-1.6. Neither this rule nor rule 4-1.8(b) nor rule 4-1.16(d) prevents the lawyer from giving notice of the fact of withdrawal, and the lawyer may also withdraw or disaffirm any opinion, document, affirmation, or the like.</p>\n<p>Where the client is an organization, the lawyer may be in doubt whether contemplated conduct will actually be carried out by the organization. Where necessary to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1036</span> guide conduct in connection with the rule, the lawyer may make inquiry within the organization as indicated in rule 4-1.13(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Dispute concerning lawyer's conduct</i></h2>\n<p>Where a legal claim or disciplinary charge alleges complicity of the lawyer in a client's conduct or other misconduct of the lawyer involving representation of the client, the lawyer may respond to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to establish a defense. The same is true with respect to a claim involving the conduct or representation of a former client. The lawyer's right to respond arises when an assertion of such complicity has been made. Paragraph (c) does not require the lawyer to await the commencement of an action or proceeding that charges such complicity, so that the defense may be established by responding directly to a third party who has made such an assertion. The right to defend, of course, applies where a proceeding has been commenced. Where practicable and not prejudicial to the lawyer's ability to establish the defense, the lawyer should advise the client of the third party's assertion and request that the client respond appropriately. In any event, disclosure should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes is necessary to vindicate innocence, the disclosure should be made in a manner which limits access to the information to the tribunal or other persons having a need to know it, and appropriate protective orders or other arrangements should be sought by the lawyer to the fullest extent practicable.</p>\n<p>If the lawyer is charged with wrongdoing in which the client's conduct is implicated, the rule of confidentiality should not prevent the lawyer from defending against the charge. Such a charge can arise in a civil, criminal or professional disciplinary proceeding and can be based on a wrong allegedly committed by the lawyer against the client or on a wrong alleged by a third person; for example, a person claiming to have been defrauded by the lawyer and client acting together. A lawyer entitled to a fee is permitted by paragraph (c) to prove the services rendered in an action to collect it. This aspect of the rule expresses the principle that the beneficiary of a fiduciary relationship may not exploit it to the detriment of the fiduciary. As stated above, the lawyer must make every effort practicable to avoid unnecessary disclosure of information relating to a representation, to limit disclosure to those having the need to know it, and to obtain protective orders or make other arrangements minimizing the risk of disclosure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disclosures otherwise required or authorized</i></h2>\n<p>The attorney-client privilege is differently defined in various jurisdictions. If a lawyer is called as a witness to give testimony concerning a client, absent waiver by the client, rule 4-1.6(a) requires the lawyer to invoke the privilege when it is applicable. The lawyer must comply with the final orders of a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction requiring the lawyer to give information about the client.</p>\n<p>The Rules of Professional Conduct in various circumstances permit or require a lawyer to disclose information relating to the representation. See rules 4-2.2, 4-2.3, 4-3.3, and 4-4.1. In addition to these provisions, a lawyer may be obligated or permitted by other provisions of law to give information about a client. Whether another provision of law supersedes rule 4-1.6 is a matter of interpretation beyond the scope of these rules, but a presumption should exist against such a supersession.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Former client</i></h2>\n<p>The duty of confidentiality continues after the client-lawyer relationship has terminated.</p>\n<p>4-1.7 <i>Conflict of interest; general rule.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to the interests of another client, unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the lawyer's responsibilities to and relationship with the other client; and</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1037</span> (2) Each client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the lawyer's exercise of independent professional judgment in the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person or by the lawyer's own interest, unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</p>\n<p>(2) The client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(c) When representation of multiple clients in a single matter is undertaken, the consultation shall include explanation of the implications of the common representation and the advantages and risks involved.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer related to another lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse shall not represent a client in a representation directly adverse to a person who the lawyer knows is represented by the other lawyer except upon consent by the client after consultation regarding the relationship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Loyalty to a client</i></h2>\n<p>Loyalty is an essential element in the lawyer's relationship to a client. An impermissible conflict of interest may exist before representation is undertaken, in which event the representation should be declined. If such a conflict arises after representation has been undertaken, the lawyer should withdraw from the representation. See rule 4-1.16. Where more than one client is involved and the lawyer withdraws because a conflict arises after representation, whether the lawyer may continue to represent any of the clients is determined by rule 4-1.9. See also rule 4-2.2(c). As to whether a client-lawyer relationship exists or, having once been established, is continuing, see comment to rule 4-1.3 and scope.</p>\n<p>As a general proposition, loyalty to a client prohibits undertaking representation directly adverse to that client or another client's interests without the affected client's consent. Paragraph (a) expresses that general rule. Thus, a lawyer ordinarily may not act as advocate against a person the lawyer represents in some other matter, even if it is wholly unrelated. On the other hand, simultaneous representation in unrelated matters of clients whose interests are only generally adverse, such as competing economic enterprises, does not require consent of the respective clients. Paragraph (a) applies only when the representation of one client would be directly adverse to the other and where the lawyer's responsibilities of loyalty and confidentiality of the other client might be compromised.</p>\n<p>Loyalty to a client is also impaired when a lawyer cannot consider, recommend, or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of the lawyer's other responsibilities or interests. The conflict in effect forecloses alternatives that would otherwise be available to the client. Paragraph (b) addresses such situations. A possible conflict does not itself preclude the representation. The critical questions are the likelihood that a conflict will eventuate and, if it does, whether it will materially interfere with the lawyer's independent professional judgment in considering alternatives or foreclose courses of action that reasonably should be pursued on behalf of the client. Consideration should be given to whether the client wishes to accommodate the other interest involved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consultation and consent</i></h2>\n<p>A client may consent to representation notwithstanding a conflict. However, as indicated in paragraph (a)(1) with respect to representation directly adverse to a client and paragraph (b)(1) with respect to material limitations on representation of a client, when a disinterested lawyer would conclude that the client should not agree to the representation under the circumstances, the lawyer involved cannot properly ask for such agreement or provide representation on the basis of the client's consent. When more than one client is involved, the question of conflict must be resolved as to each <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1038</span> client. Moreover, there may be circumstances where it is impossible to make the disclosure necessary to obtain consent. For example, when the lawyer represents different clients in related matters and one of the clients refuses to consent to the disclosure necessary to permit the other client to make an informed decision, the lawyer cannot properly ask the latter to consent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Lawyer's interests</i></h2>\n<p>The lawyer's own interests should not be permitted to have adverse effect on representation of a client. For example, a lawyer's need for income should not lead the lawyer to undertake matters that cannot be handled competently and at a reasonable fee. See rules 4-1.1 and 4-1.5. If the probity of a lawyer's own conduct in a transaction is in serious question, it may be difficult or impossible for the lawyer to give a client detached advice. A lawyer may not allow related business interests to affect representation, for example, by referring clients to an enterprise in which the lawyer has an undisclosed interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conflicts in litigation</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (a) prohibits representation of opposing parties in litigation. Simultaneous representation of parties whose interests in litigation may conflict, such as co-plaintiffs or co-defendants, is governed by paragraphs (b) and (c). An impermissible conflict may exist by reason of substantial discrepancy in the parties' testimony, incompatibility in positions in relation to an opposing party or the fact that there are substantially different possibilities of settlement of the claims or liabilities in question. Such conflicts can arise in criminal cases as well as civil. The potential for conflict of interest in representing multiple defendants in a criminal case is so grave that ordinarily a lawyer should decline to represent more than one co-defendant. On the other hand, common representation of persons having similar interests is proper if the risk of adverse effect is minimal and the requirements of paragraph (b) are met. Compare rule 4-2.2 involving intermediation between clients.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, a lawyer may not act as advocate against a client the lawyer represents in some other matter, even if the other matter is wholly unrelated. However, there are circumstances in which a lawyer may act as advocate against a client. For example, a lawyer representing an enterprise with diverse operations may accept employment as an advocate against the enterprise in an unrelated matter if doing so will not adversely affect the lawyer's relationship with the enterprise or conduct of the suit and if both clients consent upon consultation. By the same token, government lawyers in some circumstances may represent government employees in proceedings in which a government agency is the opposing party. The propriety of concurrent representation can depend on the nature of the litigation. For example, a suit charging fraud entails conflict to a degree not involved in a suit for a declaratory judgment concerning statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may represent parties having antagonistic positions on a legal question that has arisen in different cases, unless representation of either client would be adversely affected. Thus, it is ordinarily not improper to assert such positions in cases pending in different trial courts, but it may be improper to do so in cases pending at the same time in an appellate court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Interest of person paying for a lawyer's service</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer may be paid from a source other than the client, if the client is informed of that fact and consents and the arrangement does not compromise the lawyer's duty of loyalty to the client. See rule 4-1.8(f). For example, when an insurer and its insured have conflicting interests in a matter arising from a liability insurance agreement and the insurer is required to provide special counsel for the insured, the arrangement should assure the special counsel's professional independence. So also, when a corporation and its directors or employees are involved in a controversy in which they have conflicting interests, the corporation may provide funds for separate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1039</span> legal representation of the directors of employees, if the clients consent after consultation and the arrangement ensures the lawyer's professional independence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Other conflict situations</i></h2>\n<p>Conflicts of interest in contexts other than litigation sometimes may be difficult to assess. Relevant factors in determining whether there is potential for adverse effect include the duration and intimacy of the lawyer's relationship with the client or clients involved, the functions being performed by the lawyer, the likelihood that actual conflict will arise and the likely prejudice to the client from the conflict if it does arise. The question is often one of proximity and degree.</p>\n<p>For example, a lawyer may not represent multiple parties to a negotiation whose interests are fundamentally antagonistic to each other, but common representation is permissible where the clients are generally aligned in interest even though there is some difference of interest among them.</p>\n<p>Conflict questions may also arise in estate planning and estate administration. A lawyer may be called upon to prepare wills for several family members, such as husband and wife, and, depending upon the circumstances, a conflict of interest may arise. In estate administration the identity of the client may be unclear under the law of some jurisdictions. In Florida, the personal representative is the client rather than the estate or the beneficiaries. The lawyer should make clear the relationship to the parties involved.</p>\n<p>A lawyer for a corporation or other organization who is also a member of its board of directors should determine whether the responsibilities of the two roles may conflict. The lawyer may be called on to advise the corporation in matters involving actions of the directors. Consideration should be given to the frequency with which such situations may arise, the potential intensity of the conflict, the effect of the lawyer's resignation from the board and the possibility of the corporation's obtaining legal advice from another lawyer in such situations. If there is material risk that the dual role will compromise the lawyer's independence of professional judgment, the lawyer should not serve as a director.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conflict charged by an opposing party</i></h2>\n<p>Resolving questions of conflict of interest is primarily the responsibility of the lawyer undertaking the representation. In litigation, a court may raise the question when there is reason to infer that the lawyer has neglected the responsibility. In a criminal case, inquiry by the court is generally required when a lawyer represents multiple defendants. Where the conflict is such as clearly to call in question the fair or efficient administration of justice, opposing counsel may properly raise the question. Such an objection should be viewed with caution, however, for it can be misused as a technique of harassment. See scope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Family relationships between lawyers</i></h2>\n<p>Rule 4-1.7(d) applies to related lawyers who are in different firms. Related lawyers in the same firm are also governed by rules 4-1.9 and 4-1.10. The disqualification stated in rule 4-1.7(d) is personal and is not imputed to members of firms with whom the lawyers are associated.</p>\n<p>4-1.8 <i>Conflict of interest; prohibited transactions.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client, except a lien granted by law to secure a lawyer's fee or expenses, unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client;</p>\n<p>(2) The client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction; and</p>\n<p>(3) The client consents in writing thereto.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not use information relating to representation of a client to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1040</span> disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultation, except as permitted or required by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee.</p>\n<p>(d) Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.</p>\n<p>(e) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:</p>\n<p>(1) A lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter; and</p>\n<p>(2) A lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of the client.</p>\n<p>(f) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The client consents after consultation;</p>\n<p>(2) There is no interference with the lawyer's independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and</p>\n<p>(3) Information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>(g) A lawyer who represents two (2) or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients, or in a criminal case an aggregated agreement as to guilty or nolo contendere pleas, unless each client consents after consultation, including disclosure of the existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.</p>\n<p>(h) A lawyer shall not make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a client for malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in making the agreement. A lawyer shall not settle a claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client without first advising that person in writing that independent representation is appropriate in connection therewith.</p>\n<p>(i) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:</p>\n<p>(1) Acquire a lien granted by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses; and</p>\n<p>(2) Contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Transactions between client and lawyer</i></h2>\n<p>As a general principle, all transactions between client and lawyer should be fair and reasonable to the client. In such transactions a review by independent counsel on behalf of the client is often advisable. Furthermore, a lawyer may not exploit information relating to the representation to the client's disadvantage. For example, a lawyer who has learned that the client is investing in specific real estate may not, without the client's consent, seek to acquire nearby property where doing so would adversely affect the client's plan for investment. Paragraph (a) does not, however, apply to standard commercial transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally markets to others, for example, banking or brokerage services, medical services, products manufactured or distributed by the client, and utilities services. In such transactions the lawyer has no advantage in dealing with the client, and the restrictions in paragraph (a) are unnecessary and impracticable. Likewise, paragraph (a) does not prohibit a lawyer from acquiring or asserting a lien granted by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1041</span> A lawyer may accept a gift from a client, if the transaction meets general standards of fairness. For example, a simple gift such as a present given at a holiday or as a token of appreciation is permitted. If effectuation of a substantial gift requires preparing a legal instrument such as a will or conveyance, however, the client should have the detached advice that another lawyer can provide. Paragraph (c) recognizes an exception where the client is a relative of the donee or the gift is not substantial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Literary rights</i></h2>\n<p>An agreement by which a lawyer acquires literary or media rights concerning the conduct of the representation creates a conflict between the interests of the client and the personal interests of the lawyer. Measures suitable in the representation of the client may detract from the publication value of an account of the representation. Paragraph (d) does not prohibit a lawyer representing a client in a transaction concerning literary property from agreeing that the lawyer's fee shall consist of a share in ownership in the property if the arrangement conforms to rule 4-1.5 and paragraph (i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Person paying for lawyer's services</i></h2>\n<p>Rule 4-1.8(f) requires disclosure of the fact that the lawyer's services are being paid for by a third party. Such an arrangement must also conform to the requirements of rule 4-1.6 concerning confidentiality and rule 4-1.7 concerning conflict of interest. Where the client is a class, consent may be obtained on behalf of the class by court-supervised procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Acquisition of interest in litigation</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (i) states the traditional general rule that lawyers are prohibited from acquiring a proprietary interest in litigation. This general rule, which has its basis in common law champerty and maintenance, is subject to specific exceptions developed in decisional law and continued in these rules, such as the exception for reasonable contingent fees set forth in rule 4-1.5 and the exception for certain advances of the costs of litigation set forth in paragraph (e).</p>\n<p>This rule is not intended to apply to customary qualification and limitations in legal opinions and memoranda.</p>\n<p>4-1.9 <i>Conflict of interest; former client.</i> A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:</p>\n<p>(a) Represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents after consultation; or</p>\n<p>(b) Use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as rule 4-1.6 would permit with respect to a client or when the information has become generally known.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>After termination of a client-lawyer relationship, a lawyer may not represent another client except in conformity with this rule. The principles in rule 4-1.7 determine whether the interests of the present and former client are adverse. Thus, a lawyer could not properly seek to rescind on behalf of a new client a contract drafted on behalf of the former client. So also a lawyer who has prosecuted an accused person could not properly represent the accused in a subsequent civil action against the government concerning the same transaction.</p>\n<p>The scope of a \"matter\" for purposes of rule 4-1.9(a) may depend on the facts of a particular situation or transaction. The lawyer's involvement in a matter can also be a question of degree. When a lawyer has been directly involved in a specific transaction, subsequent representation of other clients with materially adverse interests clearly is prohibited. On the other hand, a lawyer who recurrently handled a type of problem for a former client is not precluded from later representing another client in a wholly distinct problem of that type even though the subsequent representation involves a position adverse to the prior client. Similar considerations can apply to the reassignment of military lawyers between defense and prosecution functions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1042</span> within the same military jurisdiction. The underlying question is whether the lawyer was so involved in the matter that the subsequent representation can be justly regarded as a changing of sides in the matter in question.</p>\n<p>Information acquired by the lawyer in the course of representing a client may not subsequently be used by the lawyer to the disadvantage of the client. However, the fact that a lawyer has once served a client does not preclude the lawyer from using generally known information about that client when later representing another client.</p>\n<p>Disqualification from subsequent representation is for the protection of clients and can be waived by them. A waiver is effective only if there is disclosure of the circumstances, including the lawyer's intended role in behalf of the new client.</p>\n<p>With regard to an opposing party's raising a question of conflict of interest, see comment to rule 4-1.7. With regard to disqualification of a firm with which a lawyer is associated, see rule 4-1.10.</p>\n<p>4-1.10 <i>Imputed disqualification; general rule.</i></p>\n<p>(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by rule 4-1.7, 4-1.8(c), 4-1.9, or 4-2.2.</p>\n<p>(b) When a lawyer becomes associated with a firm, the firm may not knowingly represent a person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that lawyer, or a firm with which the lawyer was associated, had previously represented a client whose interests are materially adverse to that person and about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9(b) that is material to the matter.</p>\n<p>(c) When a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm is not prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests materially adverse to those of a client represented by the formerly associated lawyer unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The matter is the same or substantially related to that in which the formerly associated lawyer represented the client; and</p>\n<p>(2) Any lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9(b) that is material to the matter.</p>\n<p>(d) A disqualification prescribed by this rule may be waived by the affected client under the conditions stated in rule 4-1.7.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Definition of \"firm\"</i></h2>\n<p>For purposes of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the term \"firm\" includes lawyers in a private firm and lawyers employed in the legal department of a corporation or other organization or in a legal services organization. Whether two (2) or more lawyers constitute a firm within this definition can depend on the specific facts. For example, two (2) practitioners who share office space and occasionally consult or assist each other ordinarily would not be regarded as constituting a firm. However, if they present themselves to the public in a way suggesting that they are a firm or conduct themselves as a firm, they should be regarded as a firm for purposes of the rules. The terms of any formal agreement between associated lawyers are relevant in determining whether they are a firm, as is the fact that they have mutual access to confidential information concerning the clients the serve. Furthermore, it is relevant in doubtful cases to consider the underlying purpose of the rule that is involved. A group of lawyers could be regarded as a firm for purposes of the rule that the same lawyer should not represent opposing parties in litigation, while it might not be so regarded for purposes of the rule that information acquired by one lawyer is attributed to another.</p>\n<p>With respect to the law department of an organization, there is ordinarily no question that the members of the department constitute a firm within the meaning of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, there can be uncertainty as to the identity of the client. For example, it may not be clear <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1043</span> whether the law department of a corporation represents a subsidiary or an affiliated corporation, as well as the corporation by which the members of the department are directly employed. A similar question can arise concerning an unincorporated association and its local affiliates.</p>\n<p>Similar questions can also arise with respect to lawyers in legal aid. Lawyers employed in the same unit of a legal service organization constitute a firm, but not necessarily those employed in separate units. As in the case of independent practitioners, whether the lawyers should be treated as associated with each other can depend on the particular rule that is involved and on the specific facts of the situation.</p>\n<p>Where a lawyer has joined a private firm after having represented the government, the situation is governed by rule 4-1.11(a) and (b); where a lawyer represents the government after having served private clients, the situation is governed by rule 4-1.11(c)(1). The individual lawyer involved is bound by the rules generally, including rules 4-1.6, 4-1.7, and 4-1.9.</p>\n<p>Different provisions are thus made for movement of a lawyer from one private firm to another and for movement of a lawyer between a private firm and the government. The government is entitled to protection of its client confidences and, therefore, to the protections provided in rules 4-1.6, 4-1.9, and 4-1.11. However, if the more extensive disqualification in rule 4-1.10 were applied to former government lawyers, the potential effect on the government would be unduly burdensome. The government deals with all private citizens and organizations and thus has a much wider circle of adverse legal interests than does any private law firm. In these circumstances, the government's recruitment of lawyers would be seriously impaired if rule 4-1.10 were applied to the government. On balance, therefore, the government is better served in the long run by the protections stated in rule 4-1.11.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Principles of imputed disqualification</i></h2>\n<p>The rule of imputed disqualification stated in paragraph (a) gives effect to the principle of loyalty to the client as it applies to lawyers who practice in a law firm. Such situations can be considered from the premise that a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer for purposes of the rules governing loyalty to the client or from the premise that each lawyer is vicariously bound by the obligation of loyalty owed by each lawyer with whom the lawyer is associated. Paragraph (a) operates only among the lawyers currently associated in a firm. When a lawyer moves from one firm to another the situation is governed by paragraphs (b) and (c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Lawyers moving between firms</i></h2>\n<p>When lawyers have been associated in a firm but then end their association, however, the problem is more complicated. The fiction that the law firm is the same as a single lawyer is no longer wholly realistic. There are several competing considerations. First, the client previously represented must be reasonably assured that the principle of loyalty to the client is not compromised. Second, the rule of disqualification should not be so broadly cast as to preclude other persons from having reasonable choice of legal counsel. Third, the rule of disqualification should not unreasonably hamper lawyers from forming new associations and taking on new clients after having left a previous association. In this connection, it should be recognized that today many lawyers practice in firms, that many to some degree limit their practice to one field or another, and that many move from one association to another several times in their careers. If the concept of imputed disqualification were defined with unqualified rigor, the result would be radical curtailment of the opportunity of lawyers to move from one practice setting to another and of the opportunity of clients to change counsel.</p>\n<p>Reconciliation of these competing principles in the past has been attempted under two (2) rubrics. One approach has been to seek per se rules of disqualification. For <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1044</span> example, it has been held that a partner in a law firm is conclusively presumed to have access to all confidences concerning all clients of the firm. Under this analysis, if a lawyer has been a partner in one law firm and then becomes a partner in another law firm, there is a presumption that all confidences known by a partner in the first firm are known to all partners in the second firm. This presumption might properly be applied in some circumstances, especially where the client has been extensively represented, but may be unrealistic where the client was represented only for limited purposes. Furthermore, such a rigid rule exaggerates the difference between a partner and an associate in modern law firms.</p>\n<p>The other rubric formerly used for dealing with vicarious disqualification is the appearance of impropriety and was proscribed in former Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. This rubric has a two-fold problem. First, the appearance of impropriety can be taken to include any new client-lawyer relationship that might make a former client feel anxious. If that meaning were adopted, disqualification would become little more than a question of subjective judgment by the former client. Second, since \"impropriety\" is undefined, the term \"appearance of impropriety\" is question-begging. It therefore has to be recognized that the problem of imputed disqualification cannot be properly resolved either by simple analogy to a lawyer practicing alone or by the very general concept of appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p>A rule based on a functional analysis is more appropriate for determining the question of vicarious disqualification. Two (2) functions are involved: preserving confidentiality and avoiding positions adverse to a client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Confidentiality</i></h2>\n<p>Preserving confidentiality is a question of access to information. Access to information, in turn, is essentially a question of fact in particular circumstances, aided by inferences, deductions or working presumptions that reasonably may be made about the way in which lawyers work together. A lawyer may have general access to files of all clients of a law firm and may regularly participate in discussions of their affairs; it should be inferred that such a lawyer in fact is privy to all information about all the firm's clients. In contrast, another lawyer may have access to the files of only a limited number of clients and participate in discussion of the affairs of no other clients; in the absence of information to the contrary, it should be inferred that such a lawyer in fact is privy to information about the clients actually served but not those of other clients.</p>\n<p>Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) depends on a situation's particular facts. In any such inquiry, the burden of proof should rest upon the firm whose disqualification is sought.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs (b) and (c) operate to disqualify the firm only when the lawyer involved has actual knowledge of information protected by rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9(b). Thus, if a lawyer while with one firm acquired no knowledge or information relating to a particular client of the firm and that lawyer later joined another firm, neither the lawyer individually nor the second firm is disqualified from representing another client in the same or a related matter even though the interests of the two (2) clients conflict.</p>\n<p>Independent of the question of disqualification of a firm, a lawyer changing professional association has a continuing duty to preserve confidentiality of information about a client formerly represented. See rules 4-1.6 and 4-1.9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Adverse positions</i></h2>\n<p>The second aspect of loyalty to client is the lawyer's obligation to decline subsequent representations involving positions adverse to a former client arising in substantially related matters. This obligation requires abstention from adverse representation by the individual lawyer involved, but does not properly entail abstention of other lawyers through imputed disqualification. Hence, this aspect of the problem is governed by rule 4-1.9(a). Thus, if a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1045</span> lawyer left one firm for another, the new affiliation would not preclude the firms involved from continuing to represent clients with adverse interests in the same or related matters so long as the conditions of rule 4-1.10(b) and (c) concerning confidentiality have been met.</p>\n<p>4-1.11 <i>Successive government and private employment.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not represent a private client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency consents after consultation. No lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is directly apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>\n<p>(2) Written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having information that the lawyer knows is confidential government information about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the material disadvantage of that person. A firm with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer serving as a public officer or employee shall not:</p>\n<p>(1) Participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice or nongovernmental employment, unless under applicable law no one is, or by lawful delegation may be, authorized to act in the lawyer's stead in the matter; or</p>\n<p>(2) Negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved as a party or as attorney for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially.</p>\n<p>(d) As used in this rule, the term \"matter\" includes:</p>\n<p>(1) Any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, investigation, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter involving a specific party or parties; and</p>\n<p>(2) Any other matter covered by the conflict of interest rules of the appropriate government agency.</p>\n<p>(e) As used in this rule, the term \"confidential government information\" means information which has been obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and which is not otherwise available to the public.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule prevents a lawyer from exploiting public office for the advantage of a private client. It is a counterpart of rule 4-1.10(b), which applies to lawyers moving from one firm to another.</p>\n<p>A lawyer representing a government agency, whether employed or specially retained by the government, is subject to the rules of professional conduct, including the prohibition against representing adverse interests stated in rule 4-1.7 and the protections afforded former clients in rule 4-1.9. In addition, such a lawyer is subject to rule 4-1.11 and to statutes and government regulations regarding conflict of interest. Such statutes and regulations may circumscribe the extent to which the government agency may give consent under this rule.</p>\n<p>Where the successive clients are a public agency and a private client, the risk exists that power or discretion vested in public authority might be used for the special benefit of a private client. A lawyer should not be in a position where benefit to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1046</span> a private client might affect performance of the lawyer's professional functions on behalf of public authority. Also, unfair advantage could accrue to the private client by reason of access to confidential government information about the client's adversary obtainable only through the lawyer's government service. However, the rules governing lawyers presently or formerly employed by a government agency should not be so restrictive as to inhibit transfer of employment to and from the government. The government has a legitimate need to attract qualified lawyers as well as to maintain high ethical standards. The provisions for screening and waiver are necessary to prevent the disqualification rule from imposing too severe a deterrent against entering public service.</p>\n<p>When the client is an agency of one government, the agency should be treated as a private client for purposes of this rule if the lawyer thereafter represents an agency of another government, as when a lawyer represents a city and subsequently is employed by a federal agency.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) do not prohibit a lawyer from receiving a salary or partnership share established by prior independent agreement. They prohibit directly relating the attorney's compensation to the fee in the matter in which the lawyer is disqualified.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (a)(2) does not require that a lawyer give notice to the government agency at a time when premature disclosure would injure the client; a requirement for premature disclosure might preclude engagement of the lawyer. Such notice is, however, required to be given as soon as practicable in order that the government agency or affected person will have a reasonable opportunity to ascertain that the lawyer is complying with rule 4-1.11 and to take appropriate action if they believe the lawyer is not complying.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) operates only when the lawyer in question has knowledge of the information, which means actual knowledge; it does not operate with respect to information that merely could be imputed to the lawyer.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs (a) and (c) do not prohibit a lawyer from jointly representing a private party and a government agency when doing so is permitted by rule 4-1.7 and is not otherwise prohibited by law.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (c) does not disqualify other lawyers in the agency with which the lawyer in question has become associated.</p>\n<p>4-1.12 <i>Former judge or arbitrator.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (d), a lawyer shall not represent anyone in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer, arbitrator, or law clerk to such a person, unless all parties to the proceeding consent after disclosure.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not negotiate for employment with any person who is involved as a party or as attorney for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer or arbitrator. A lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge, other adjudicative officer, or arbitrator may negotiate for employment with a party or attorney involved in a matter in which the clerk is participating personally and substantially, but only after the lawyer has notified the judge, other adjudicative officer, or arbitrator.</p>\n<p>(c) If a lawyer is disqualified by paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in the matter unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is directly apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>\n<p>(2) Written notice is promptly given to the appropriate tribunal to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.</p>\n<p>(d) An arbitrator selected as a partisan of a party in a multimember arbitration panel is not prohibited from subsequently representing that party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1047</span> <i>Comment:</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This rule generally parallels rule 4-1.11. The term \"personally and substantially\" signifies that a judge who was a member of a multimember court, and thereafter left judicial office to practice law, is not prohibited from representing a client in a matter pending in the court, but in which the former judge did not participate. So also the fact that a former judge exercised administrative responsibility in a court does not prevent the former judge from acting as a lawyer in a matter where the judge had previously exercised remote or incidental administrative responsibility that did not affect the merits. Compare the comment to rule 4-1.11. The term \"adjudicative officer\" includes such officials as judges pro tempore, referees, special masters, hearing officers, and other parajudicial officers and also lawyers who serve as part-time judges. Compliance Canons A(2), B(2), and C of Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct provide that a part-time judge, judge pro tempore, or retired judge recalled to active service may not \"act as a lawyer in any proceeding in which he served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto.\" Although phrased differently from this rule, those rules correspond in meaning.</p>\n<p>4-1.13 <i>Organization as client.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.</p>\n<p>(b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee, or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to act, or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the organization or a violation of law which reasonably might be imputed to the organization and is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the organization. In determining how to proceed, the lawyer shall give due consideration to the seriousness of the violation and its consequences, the scope and nature of the lawyer's representation, the responsibility in the organization and the apparent motivation of the person involved, the policies of the organization concerning such matters, and any other relevant considerations. Any measures taken shall be designed to minimize disruption of the organization and the risk of revealing information relating to the representation to persons outside the organization. Such measures may include among others:</p>\n<p>(1) Asking reconsideration of the matter;</p>\n<p>(2) Advising that a separate legal opinion on the matter be sought for presentation to appropriate authority in the organization; and</p>\n<p>(3) Referring the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the seriousness of the matter, referral to the highest authority that can act in behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.</p>\n<p>(c) If, despite the lawyer's efforts in accordance with paragraph (b), the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists upon action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law and is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, the lawyer may resign in accordance with rule 4-1.16.</p>\n<p>(d) In dealing with an organization's directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders, or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the identity of the client when it is apparent that the organization's interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.</p>\n<p>(e) A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders, or other constituents, subject to the provisions of rule 4-1.7. If the organization's consent to the dual representation is required by rule 4-1.7, the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The entity as the client</i></h2>\n<p>An organizational client is a legal entity, but it cannot act except through its officers, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> directors, employees, shareholders, and other constituents. Officers, directors, employees, and shareholders are the constituents of the corporate organizational client. The duties defined in this comment apply equally to unincorporated associations. \"Other constituents\" as used in this comment means the positions equivalent to officers, directors, employees, and shareholders held by persons acting for organizational clients that are not corporations.</p>\n<p>When one of the constituents of an organizational client communicates with the organization's lawyer in that person's organizational capacity, the communication is protected by rule 4-1.6. Thus, by way of example, if an organizational client requests its lawyer to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, interviews made in the course of that investigation between the lawyer and the client's employees or other constituents are covered by rule 4-1.6. This does not mean, however, that constituents of an organizational client are the clients of the lawyer. The lawyer may not disclose to such constituents information relating to the representation except for disclosures explicitly or impliedly authorized by the organizational client in order to carry out the representation or as otherwise permitted by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>When constituents of the organization make decisions for it, the decisions ordinarily must be accepted by the lawyer even if their utility or prudence is doubtful. Decisions concerning policy and operations, including ones entailing serious risk, are not as such in the lawyer's province. However, different considerations arise when the lawyer knows that the organization may be substantially injured by action of a constituent that is in violation of law. In such a circumstance, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to ask the constituent to reconsider the matter. If that fails, or if the matter is of sufficient seriousness and importance to the organization, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to take steps to have the matter reviewed by a higher authority in the organization. Clear justification should exist for seeking review over the head of the constituent normally responsible for it. The stated policy of the organization may define circumstances and prescribe channels for such review, and a lawyer should encourage the formulation of such a policy. Even in the absence of organization policy, however, the lawyer may have an obligation to refer a matter to higher authority, depending on the seriousness of the matter and whether the constituent in question has apparent motives to act at variance with the organization's interest. Review by the chief executive officer or by the board of directors may be required when the matter is of importance commensurate with their authority. At some point it may be useful or essential to obtain an independent legal opinion.</p>\n<p>In an extreme case, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to refer the matter to the organization's highest authority. Ordinarily, that is the board of directors or similar governing body. However, applicable law may prescribe that under certain conditions highest authority reposes elsewhere; for example, in the independent directors of a corporation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Relation to other rules</i></h2>\n<p>The authority and responsibility provided in paragraph (b) are concurrent with the authority and responsibility provided in other rules. In particular, this rule does not limit or expand the lawyer's responsibility under rule 4-1.6, 4-1.8, 4-1.16, 4-3.3, or 4-4.1. If the lawyer's services are being used by an organization to further a crime or fraud by the organization, rule 4-1.2(d) can be applicable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Government agency</i></h2>\n<p>The duty defined in this rule applies to governmental organizations. However, when the client is a governmental organization, a different balance may be appropriate between maintaining confidentiality and assuring that the wrongful official act is prevented or rectified, for public business is involved. In addition, duties of lawyers employed by the government or lawyers in military service may be defined by statutes and regulation. Therefore, defining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> precisely the identity of the client and prescribing the resulting obligations of such lawyers may be more difficult in the government context. Although in some circumstances the client may be a specific agency, it is generally the government as a whole. For example, if the action or failure to act involves the head of a bureau, either the department of which the bureau is a part or the government as a whole may be the client for purposes of this rule. Moreover, in a matter involving the conduct of government officials, a government lawyer may have authority to question such conduct more extensively than that of a lawyer for a private organization in similar circumstances. This rule does not limit that authority. See note on scope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Clarifying the lawyer's role</i></h2>\n<p>There are times when the organization's interest may be or become adverse to those of one or more of its constituents. In such circumstances the lawyer should advise any constituent whose interest the lawyer finds adverse to that of the organization of the conflict or potential conflict of interest that the lawyer cannot represent such constituent and that such person may wish to obtain independent representation. Care must be taken to assure that the constituent understands that, when there is such adversity of interest, the lawyer for the organization cannot provide legal representation for that constituent and that discussions between the lawyer for the organization and the constituent may not be privileged.</p>\n<p>Whether such a warning should be given by the lawyer for the organization to any constituent may turn on the facts of each case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Dual representation</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (e) recognizes that a lawyer for an organization may also represent a principal officer or major shareholder.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Derivative actions</i></h2>\n<p>Under generally prevailing law, the shareholders or members of a corporation may bring suit to compel the directors to perform their legal obligations in the supervision of the organization. Members of unincorporated associations have essentially the same right. Such an action may be brought nominally by the organization, but usually is, in fact, a legal controversy over management of the organization.</p>\n<p>The question can arise whether counsel for the organization may defend such an action. The proposition that the organization is the lawyer's client does not alone resolve the issue. Most derivative actions are a normal incident of an organization's affairs, to be defended by the organization's lawyer like any other suit. However, if the claim involves serious charges of wrongdoing by those in control of the organization, a conflict may arise between the lawyer's duty to the organization and the lawyer's relationship with the board. In those circumstances, rule 4-1.7 governs who should represent the directors and the organization.</p>\n<p>4-1.14 <i>Client under a disability.</i></p>\n<p>(a) When a client's ability to make adequately considered decisions in connection with the representation is impaired, whether because of minority, mental disability, or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer may seek the appointment of a guardian or take other protective action with respect to a client only when the lawyer reasonably believes that the client cannot adequately act in the client's own interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The normal client-lawyer relationship is based on the assumption that the client, when properly advised and assisted, is capable of making decisions about important matters. When the client is a minor or suffers from a mental disorder or disability, however, maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer relationship may not be possible in all respects. In particular, an incapacitated person may have no power to make legally binding decisions. Nevertheless, a client lacking legal competence often has the ability to understand, deliberate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> upon, and reach conclusions about matters affecting the client's own well-being. Furthermore, to an increasing extent the law recognizes intermediate degrees of competence. For example, children as young as five (5) or six (6) years of age, and certainly those of ten (10) or twelve (12), are regarded as having opinions that are entitled to weight in legal proceedings concerning their custody. So also, it is recognized that some persons of advanced age can be quite capable of handling routine financial matters while needing special legal protection concerning major transactions.</p>\n<p>The fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the lawyer's obligation to treat the client with attention and respect. If the person has no guardian or legal representative, the lawyer often must act as de facto guardian. Even if the person does have a legal representative, the lawyer should as far as possible accord the represented person the status of client, particularly in maintaining communication.</p>\n<p>If a legal representative has already been appointed for the client, the lawyer should ordinarily look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client. If a legal representative has not been appointed, the lawyer should see to such an appointment where it would serve the client's best interests. Thus, if a disabled client has substantial property that should be sold for the client's benefit, effective completion of the transaction ordinarily requires appointment of a legal representative. In many circumstances, however, appointment of a legal representative may be expensive or traumatic for the client. Evaluation of these considerations is a matter of professional judgment on the lawyer's part.</p>\n<p>If the lawyer represents the guardian as distinct from the ward and is aware that the guardian is acting adversely to the ward's interest, the lawyer may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian's misconduct. See rule 4-1.2(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disclosure of client's condition</i></h2>\n<p>Rules of procedure in litigation generally provide that minors or persons suffering mental disability shall be represented by a guardian or next friend if they do not have a general guardian. However, disclosure of the client's disability can adversely affect the client's interests. The lawyer may seek guidance from an appropriate diagnostician.</p>\n<p>4-1.15 <i>Safekeeping property.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall hold in trust, separate from the lawyer's own property, funds and property of clients or third persons that are in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation. All funds, including advances for costs and expenses, shall be kept in a separate account maintained in the state where the lawyer's office is situated or elsewhere with the consent of the client or third person, provided that funds may be separately held and maintained other than in a bank account if the lawyer receives written permission from the client to do so and provided that such written permission is received prior to maintaining the funds other than in a separate bank account. In no event may the lawyer commingle the client's funds with those of his or hers or those of his or her law firm. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and other property, including client funds not maintained in a separate bank account, shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of six (6) years after termination of the representation.</p>\n<p>(b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</p>\n<p>(c) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which both the lawyer and another person <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> claim interests, the property shall be treated by the lawyer as trust property, but the portion belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be withdrawn within a reasonable time after it becomes due unless the right of the lawyer or law firm to receive it is disputed, in which event the portion in dispute shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall comply with The Florida Bar Rules Regulating Trust Accounts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary. Securities should be kept in a safe deposit box, except when some other form of safekeeping is warranted by special circumstances. All property which is the property of clients or third persons should be kept separate from the lawyer's business and personal property and, if money, in one or more trust accounts, unless requested otherwise in writing by the client. Separate trust accounts may be warranted when administering estate money or acting in similar fiduciary capacities.</p>\n<p>Lawyers often receive funds from third parties from which the lawyer's fee will be paid. If there is risk that the client may divert the funds without paying the fee, the lawyer is not required to remit the portion from which the fee is to be paid. However, a lawyer may not hold funds to coerce a client into accepting the lawyer's contention. The disputed portion of the funds should be kept in trust and the lawyer should suggest means for prompt resolution of the dispute, such as arbitration. The undisputed portion of the funds shall be promptly distributed.</p>\n<p>Third parties, such as a client's creditors, may have just claims against funds or other property in a lawyer's custody. A lawyer may have a duty under applicable law to protect such third party claims against wrongful interference by the client and, accordingly, may refuse to surrender the property to the client. However, a lawyer should not unilaterally assume to arbitrate a dispute between the client and the third party and where appropriate the lawyer should consider the possibility of depositing the property or funds in dispute into the registry of the applicable court so that the matter may be adjudicated.</p>\n<p>The obligations of a lawyer under this rule are independent of those arising from activity other than rendering legal services. For example, a lawyer who serves as an escrow agent is governed by the applicable law relating to fiduciaries even though the lawyer does not render legal services in the transaction.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (d) of this rule requires each lawyer to be familiar with and comply with Rules Regulating Trust Accounts as adopted by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>Money or other property entrusted to a lawyer for a specific purpose, including advances for costs and expenses, is held in trust and must be applied only to that purpose. Money and other property of clients coming into the hands of a lawyer are not subject to counterclaim or setoff for attorney's fees, and a refusal to account for and deliver over such property upon demand shall be a conversion. This is not to preclude the retention of money or other property upon which a lawyer has a valid lien for services or to preclude the payment of agreed fees from the proceeds of transactions or collections.</p>\n<p>4-1.16 <i>Declining or terminating representation.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if:</p>\n<p>(1) The representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or law;</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client; or</p>\n<p>(3) The lawyer is discharged.</p>\n<p>(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if withdrawal can be accomplished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> without material adverse effect on the interests of the client, or if:</p>\n<p>(1) The client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer's services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;</p>\n<p>(2) The client has used the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;</p>\n<p>(3) A client insists upon pursuing an objective that the lawyer considers repugnant or imprudent;</p>\n<p>(4) The client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer's services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;</p>\n<p>(5) The representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or</p>\n<p>(6) Other good cause for withdrawal exists.</p>\n<p>(c) When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.</p>\n<p>(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interest, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers and other property relating to or belonging to the client to the extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer should not accept representation in a matter unless it can be performed competently, promptly, without improper conflict of interest and to completion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Mandatory withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer ordinarily must decline or withdraw from representation if the client demands that the lawyer engage in conduct that is illegal or violates the Rules of Professional Conduct or law. The lawyer is not obliged to decline or withdraw simply because the client suggests such a course of conduct; a client may make such a suggestion in the hope that a lawyer will not be constrained by a professional obligation.</p>\n<p>When a lawyer has been appointed to represent a client, withdrawal ordinarily requires approval of the appointing authority. See also rule 4-6.2. Difficulty may be encountered if withdrawal is based on the client's demand that the lawyer engage in unprofessional conduct. The court may wish an explanation for the withdrawal, while the lawyer may be bound to keep confidential the facts that would constitute such an explanation. The lawyer's statement that professional considerations require termination of the representation ordinarily should be accepted as sufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Discharge</i></h2>\n<p>A client has a right to discharge a lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to liability for payment for the lawyer's services. Where future dispute about the withdrawal may be anticipated, it may be advisable to prepare a written statement reciting the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Whether a client can discharge appointed counsel may depend on applicable law. A client seeking to do so should be given a full explanation of the consequences. These consequences may include a decision by the appointing authority that appointment of successor counsel is unjustified, thus requiring the client to represent himself.</p>\n<p>If the client is mentally incompetent, the client may lack the legal capacity to discharge the lawyer, and in any event the discharge may be seriously adverse to the client's interests. The lawyer should make special effort to help the client consider the consequences and, in an extreme case, may initiate proceedings for a conservatorship or similar protection of the client. See rule 4-1.14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Optional withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer may withdraw from representation in some circumstances. The lawyer has the option to withdraw if it can be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> accomplished without material adverse effect on the client's interests. Withdrawal is also justified if the client persists in a course of action that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent, for a lawyer is not required to be associated with such conduct even if the lawyer does not further it. Withdrawal is also permitted if the lawyer's services were misused in the past even if that would materially prejudice the client. The lawyer also may withdraw where the client insists on a repugnant or imprudent objective.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may withdraw if the client refuses to abide by the terms of an agreement relating to the representation, such as an agreement concerning fees or court costs or an agreement limiting the objectives of the representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Assisting the client upon withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>Even if the lawyer has been unfairly discharged by the client, a lawyer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences to the client. The lawyer may retain papers and other property as security for a fee only to the extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p>Whether or not a lawyer for an organization may under certain unusual circumstances have a legal obligation to the organization after withdrawing or being discharged by the organization's highest authority is beyond the scope of these rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Refunding advance payment of unearned fee</i></h2>\n<p>Upon termination of representation, a lawyer should refund to the client any advance payment of a fee that has not been earned. This does not preclude a lawyer from retaining any reasonable nonrefundable fee which the client agreed would be deemed earned when the lawyer commenced the client's representation. See also rule 4-1.5.</p>\n<p>4-2 <i>Counselor.</i></p>\n<p>4-2.1 <i>Adviser.</i> In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social, and political factors that may be relevant to the client's situation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Scope of advice</i></h2>\n<p>A client is entitled to straightforward advice expressing the lawyer's honest assessment. Legal advice often involves unpleasant facts and alternatives that a client may be disinclined to confront. In presenting advice, a lawyer endeavors to sustain the client's morale and may put advice in as acceptable a form as honesty permits. However, a lawyer should not be deterred from giving candid advice by the prospect that the advice will be unpalatable to the client.</p>\n<p>Advice couched in narrowly legal terms may be of little value to a client, especially where practical considerations, such as cost or effects on other people, are predominant. Purely technical legal advice, therefore, can sometimes be inadequate. It is proper for a lawyer to refer to relevant moral and ethical considerations in giving advice. Although a lawyer is not a moral adviser as such, moral and ethical considerations impinge upon most legal questions and may decisively influence how the law will be applied.</p>\n<p>A client may expressly or impliedly ask the lawyer for purely technical advice. When such a request is made by a client experienced in legal matters, the lawyer may accept it at face value. When such a request is made by a client inexperienced in legal matters, however, the lawyer's responsibility as adviser may include indicating that more may be involved than strictly legal considerations.</p>\n<p>Matters that go beyond strictly legal questions may also be in the domain of another profession. Family matters can involve problems within the professional competence of psychiatry, clinical psychology, or social work; business matters can involve problems within the competence of the accounting profession or of financial specialists. Where consultation with a professional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> in another field is itself something a competent lawyer would recommend, the lawyer should make such a recommendation. At the same time, a lawyer's advice at its best often consists of recommending a course of action in the face of conflicting recommendations of experts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Offering advice</i></h2>\n<p>In general, a lawyer is not expected to give advice until asked by the client. However, when a lawyer knows that a client proposes a course of action that is likely to result in substantial adverse legal consequences to the client, duty to the client under rule 4-1.4 may require that the lawyer act if the client's course of action is related to the representation. A lawyer ordinarily has no duty to initiate investigation of a client's affairs or to give advice that the client has indicated is unwanted, but a lawyer may initiate advice to a client when doing so appears to be in the client's interest.</p>\n<p>4-2.2 <i>Intermediary.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer may act as intermediary between clients if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer consults with each client concerning the implications of the common representation, including the advantages and risks involved, and the effect on the attorney-client privileges and obtains each client's consent to the common representation;</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer reasonably believes that the matter can be resolved on terms compatible with the clients' best interests, that each client will be able to make adequately informed decisions in the matter, and that there is little risk of material prejudice to the interests of any of the clients if the contemplated resolution is unsuccessful; and</p>\n<p>(3) The lawyer reasonably believes that the common representation can be undertaken impartially and without improper effect on other responsibilities the lawyer has to any of the clients.</p>\n<p>(b) While acting as intermediary, the lawyer shall consult with each client concerning the decisions to be made and the considerations relevant in making them, so that each client can make adequately informed decisions.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall withdraw as intermediary if any of the clients so requests or if any of the conditions stated in paragraph (a) is no longer satisfied. Upon withdrawal, the lawyer shall not continue to represent any of the clients in the matter that was the subject of the intermediation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer acts as intermediary under this rule when the lawyer represents two (2) or more parties with potentially conflicting interests. A key factor in defining the relationship is whether the parties share responsibility for the lawyer's fee, but the common representation may be inferred from other circumstances. Because confusion can arise as to the lawyer's role where each party is not separately represented, it is important that the lawyer make clear the relationship.</p>\n<p>The rule does not apply to a lawyer acting as arbitrator or mediator between or among parties who are not clients of the lawyer, even where the lawyer has been appointed with the concurrence of the parties. In performing such a role the lawyer may be subject to applicable codes of ethics, such as the Code of Ethics for Arbitration in Commercial Disputes prepared by a joint committee of the American Bar Association and the American Arbitration Association.</p>\n<p>A lawyer acts as intermediary in seeking to establish or adjust a relationship between clients on an amicable and mutually advantageous basis; for example, in helping to organize a business in which two (2) or more clients are entrepreneurs, working out the financial reorganization of an enterprise in which two (2) or more clients have an interest, arranging a property distribution in settlement of an estate, or mediating a dispute between clients. The lawyer seeks to resolve potentially conflicting interests by developing the parties' mutual interests. The alternative can be that each <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1055</span> party may have to obtain separate representation, with the possibility in some situations of incurring additional cost, complication, or even litigation. Given these and other relevant factors, all the clients may prefer that the lawyer act as intermediary.</p>\n<p>In considering whether to act as intermediary between clients, a lawyer should be mindful that if the intermediation fails the result can be additional cost, embarrassment and recrimination. In some situations the risk of failure is so great that intermediation is plainly impossible. For example, a lawyer cannot undertake common representation of clients between whom contentious litigation is imminent or who contemplate contentious negotiations. More generally, if the relationship between the parties has already assumed definite antagonism, the possibility that the clients' interests can be adjusted by intermediation ordinarily is not very good.</p>\n<p>The appropriateness of intermediation can depend on its form. Forms of intermediation range from informal arbitration, where each client's case is presented by the respective client and the lawyer decides the outcome, to mediation, to common representation where the clients' interests are substantially though not entirely compatible. One form may be appropriate in circumstances where another would not. Other relevant factors are whether the lawyer subsequently will represent both parties on a continuing basis and whether the situation involves creating a relationship between the parties or terminating one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Confidentiality and privilege</i></h2>\n<p>A particularly important factor in determining the appropriateness of intermediation is the effect on client-lawyer confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege. In a common representation, the lawyer is still required both to keep each client adequately informed and to maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation. See rules 4-1.4 and 4-1.6. Complying with both requirements while acting as intermediary requires a delicate balance. If the balance cannot be maintained, the common representation is improper. With regard to the attorney-client privilege, the prevailing rule is that as between commonly represented clients the privilege does not attach. Hence, it must be assumed that if litigation eventuates between the clients, the privilege will not protect any such communications, and the clients should be so advised.</p>\n<p>Since the lawyer is required to be impartial between commonly represented clients, intermediation is improper when that impartiality cannot be maintained. For example, a lawyer who has represented one of the clients for a long period and in a variety of matters might have difficulty being impartial between that client and one to whom the lawyer has only recently been introduced.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consultation</i></h2>\n<p>In acting as intermediary between clients, the lawyer is required to consult with the clients on the implications of doing so and to proceed only upon consent based on such a consultation. The consultation should make clear that the lawyer's role is not that of partisanship normally expected in other circumstances.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) is an application of the principle expressed in rule 4-1.4. Where the lawyer is intermediary, the clients ordinarily must assume greater responsibility for decisions than when each client is independently represented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Withdrawal</i></h2>\n<p>Common representation does not diminish the rights of each client in the client-lawyer relationship. Each has the right to loyal and diligent representation, the right to discharge the lawyer as stated in rule 4-1.16, and the protection of rule 4-1.9 concerning obligations to a former client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4-2.3 <i>Evaluation for use by third persons.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(a) A lawyer may undertake an evaluation of a matter affecting a client for the use of someone other than the client if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes that making the evaluation is compatible with other aspects of the lawyer's relationship with the client; and</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1056</span> (2) The client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p>(b) In reporting the evaluation, the lawyer shall indicate any material limitations that were imposed on the scope of the inquiry or on the disclosure of information.</p>\n<p>(c) Except as disclosure is required in connection with a report of an evaluation, information relating to the evaluation is otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Definition</i></h2>\n<p>An evaluation may be performed at the client's direction but for the primary purpose of establishing information for the benefit of third parties; for example, an opinion concerning the title of property rendered at the behest of a vendor for the information of a prospective purchaser or at the behest of a borrower for the information of a prospective lender. In some situations, the evaluation may be required by a government agency; for example, an opinion concerning the legality of the securities registered for sale under the securities laws. In other instances, the evaluation may be required by a third person, such as a purchaser of a business.</p>\n<p>Lawyers for the government may be called upon to give a formal opinion on the legality of contemplated government agency action. In making such an evaluation, the government lawyer acts at the behest of the government as the client but for the purpose of establishing the limits of the agency's authorized activity. Such an opinion is to be distinguished from confidential legal advice given agency officials. The critical question is whether the opinion is to be made public.</p>\n<p>A legal evaluation should be distinguished from an investigation of a person with whom the lawyer does not have a client-lawyer relationship. For example, a lawyer retained by a purchaser to analyze a vendor's title to property does not have a client-lawyer relationship with the vendor. So also, an investigation into a person's affairs by a government lawyer, or by special counsel employed by the government, is not an evaluation as that term is used in this rule. The question is whether the lawyer is retained by the person whose affairs are being examined. When the lawyer is retained by that person, the general rules concerning loyalty to client and preservation of confidences apply, which is not the case if the lawyer is retained by someone else. For this reason, it is essential to identify the person by whom the lawyer is retained. This should be made clear not only to the person under examination, but also to others to whom the results are to be made available.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Duty to third person</i></h2>\n<p>When the evaluation is intended for the information or use of a third person, a legal duty to that person may or may not arise. That legal question is beyond the scope of this rule. However, since such an evaluation involves a departure from the normal client-lawyer relationship, careful analysis of the situation is required. The lawyer must be satisfied as a matter of professional judgment that making the evaluation is compatible with other functions undertaken in behalf of the client. For example, if the lawyer is acting as an advocate in defending the client against charges of fraud, it would normally be incompatible with that responsibility for the lawyer to perform an evaluation for others concerning the same or a related transaction. Assuming no such impediment is apparent, however, the lawyer should advise the client of the implications of the evaluation, particularly the lawyer's responsibilities to third persons and the duty to disseminate the findings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Access to and disclosure of information</i></h2>\n<p>The quality of an evaluation depends on the freedom and extent of the investigation upon which it is based. Ordinarily, a lawyer should have whatever latitude of investigation seems necessary as a matter of professional judgment. Under some circumstances, however, the terms of the evaluation may be limited. For example, certain issues or sources may be categorically excluded or the scope of search may be limited by time constraints or the non-cooperation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1057</span> of persons having relevant information. Any such limitations which are material to the evaluation should be described in the report. If, after a lawyer has commenced an evaluation, the client refuses to comply with the terms upon which it was understood the evaluation was to have been made, the lawyer's obligations are determined by law, having reference to the terms of the client's agreement and the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Financial auditors' requests for information</i></h2>\n<p>When a question concerning the legal situation of a client arises at the instance of the client's financial auditor and the question is referred to the lawyer, the lawyer's response may be made in accordance with procedures recognized in the legal profession. Such a procedure is set forth in the American Bar Association Statement of Policy Regarding Lawyer's Responses to Auditors' Requests for Information, adopted in 1975.</p>\n<p>4-3 <i>Advocate.</i></p>\n<p>4-3.1 <i>Meritorious claims and contentions.</i> A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The advocate has a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client's cause, but also a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive, establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. However, the law is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in determining the proper scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law's ambiguities and potential for change.</p>\n<p>The filing of an action or defense or similar action taken for a client is not frivolous merely because the facts have not first been fully substantiated or because the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery. Such action is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes that the client's position ultimately will not prevail. The action is frivolous, however, if the client desires to have the action taken primarily for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring a person or if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.</p>\n<p>4-3.2 <i>Expediting litigation.</i> A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Dilatory practices bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Delay should not be indulged merely for the convenience of the advocates or for the purpose of frustrating an opposing party's attempt to obtain rightful redress or repose. It is not a justification that similar conduct is often tolerated by the bench and bar. The question is whether a competent lawyer acting in good faith would regard the course of action as having some substantial purpose other than delay. Realizing financial or other benefit from otherwise improper delay in litigation is not a legitimate interest of the client.</p>\n<p>4-3.3 <i>Candor toward the tribunal.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>\n<p>(1) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal;</p>\n<p>(2) Fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by the client;</p>\n<p>(3) Fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1058</span> to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or</p>\n<p>(4) Offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.</p>\n<p>(b) The duties stated in paragraph (a) continue beyond the conclusion of the proceeding and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.</p>\n<p>(d) In an ex parte proceeding a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer which will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The advocate's task is to present the client's case with persuasive force. Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client is qualified by the advocate's duty of candor to the tribunal. However, an advocate does not vouch for the evidence submitted in a cause; the tribunal is responsible for assessing its probative value.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Representations by a lawyer</i></h2>\n<p>An advocate is responsible for pleadings and other documents prepared for litigation, but is usually not required to have personal knowledge of matters asserted therein, for litigation documents ordinarily present assertions by the client, or by someone on the client's behalf, and not assertions by the lawyer. Compare rule 4-3.1. However, an assertion purporting to be on the lawyer's own knowledge, as in an affidavit by the lawyer or in a statement in open court, may properly be made only when the lawyer knows the assertion is true or believes it to be true on the basis of a reasonably diligent inquiry. There are circumstances where failure to make a disclosure is the equivalent of an affirmative misrepresentation. The obligation prescribed in rule 4-1.2(d) not to counsel a client to commit or assist the client in committing a fraud applies in litigation. Regarding compliance with rule 4-1.2(d), see the comment to that rule. See also the comment to rule 4-8.4(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Misleading legal argument</i></h2>\n<p>Legal argument based on a knowingly false representation of law constitutes dishonesty toward the tribunal. A lawyer is not required to make a disinterested exposition of the law, but must recognize the existence of pertinent legal authorities. Furthermore, as stated in paragraph (a)(3), an advocate has a duty to disclose directly adverse authority in the controlling jurisdiction which has not been disclosed by the opposing party. The underlying concept is that legal argument is a discussion seeking to determine the legal premises properly applicable to the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>False evidence</i></h2>\n<p>When evidence that a lawyer knows to be false is provided by a person who is not the client, the lawyer must refuse to offer it regardless of the client's wishes.</p>\n<p>When false evidence is offered by the client, however, a conflict may arise between the lawyer's duty to keep the client's revelations confidential and the duty of candor to the court. Upon ascertaining that material evidence is false, the lawyer should seek to persuade the client that the evidence should not be offered or, if it has been offered, that its false character should immediately be disclosed. If the persuasion is ineffective, the lawyer must take reasonable remedial measures.</p>\n<p>Except in the defense of a criminal accused, the rule generally recognized is that, if necessary to rectify the situation, an advocate must disclose the existence of the client's deception to the court or to the other party. Such a disclosure can result in grave consequences to the client, including not only a sense of betrayal but also loss of the case and perhaps a prosecution for perjury. But the alternative is that the lawyer cooperate in deceiving the court, thereby subverting the truth-finding process which the adversary system is designed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1059</span> to implement. See rule 4-1.2(d). Furthermore, unless it is clearly understood that the lawyer will act upon the duty to disclose the existence of false evidence the client can simply reject the lawyer's advice to reveal the false evidence and insist that the lawyer keep silent. Thus, the client could in effect coerce the lawyer into being a party to fraud on the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Perjury by a criminal defendant</i></h2>\n<p>Whether an advocate for a criminally accused has the same duty of disclosure has been intensely debated. While it is agreed that the lawyer should seek to persuade the client to refrain from perjurious testimony, there has been dispute concerning the lawyer's duty when that persuasion fails. If the confrontation with the client occurs before trial, the lawyer ordinarily can withdraw. Withdrawal before trial may not be possible if trial is imminent, if the confrontation with the client does not take place until the trial itself, or if no other counsel is available.</p>\n<p>The most difficult situation, therefore, arises in a criminal case where the accused insists on testifying when the lawyer knows that the testimony is perjurious. The lawyer's effort to rectify the situation can increase the likelihood of the client's being convicted as well as opening the possibility of a prosecution for perjury. On the other hand, if the lawyer does not exercise control over the proof, the lawyer participates, although in a merely passive way, in deception of the court.</p>\n<p>Three (3) resolutions of this dilemma have been proposed. One is to permit the accused to testify by a narrative without guidance through the lawyer's questioning. This compromises both competing principles; it exempts the lawyer from the duty to disclose false evidence but subjects the client to an implicit disclosure of information imparted to counsel. Another suggested resolution, of relatively recent origin, is that the advocate be entirely excused from the duty to reveal perjury if the perjury is that of the client. This is a coherent solution but makes the advocate a knowing instrument of perjury.</p>\n<p>The third resolution of the dilemma is that the lawyer must reveal the client's perjury if necessary to rectify the situation. A criminal accused has a right to the assistance of an advocate, a right to testify and a right of confidential communication with counsel. However, an accused should not have a right to assistance of counsel in committing perjury. Furthermore, an advocate has an obligation, not only in professional ethics but under the law as well, to avoid implication in the commission of perjury or other falsification of evidence. See rule 4-1.2(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Remedial measures</i></h2>\n<p>If perjured testimony or false evidence has been offered, the advocate's proper course ordinarily is to remonstrate with the client confidentially. If that fails, the advocate should seek to withdraw if that will remedy the situation. If withdrawal will not remedy the situation or is impossible, the advocate should make disclosure to the court. It is for the court then to determine what should be done â making a statement about the matter to the trier of fact, ordering a mistrial, or perhaps nothing. If the false testimony was that of the client, the client may controvert the lawyer's version of their communication when the lawyer discloses the situation to the court. If there is an issue whether the client has committed perjury, the lawyer cannot represent the client in resolution of the issue and a mistrial may be unavoidable. An unscrupulous client might in this way attempt to produce a series of mistrials and thus escape prosecution. However, a second such encounter could be construed as a deliberate abuse of the right to counsel and as such a waiver of the right to further representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Constitutional requirements</i></h2>\n<p>The general rule â that an advocate must disclose the existence of perjury with respect to a material fact, even that of a client â applies to defense counsel in criminal cases, as well as in other instances. However, the definition of the lawyer's ethical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1060</span> duty in such a situation may be qualified by constitutional provisions for due process and the right to counsel in criminal cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Refusing to offer proof believed to be false</i></h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, a lawyer has authority to refuse to offer testimony or other proof that the lawyer believes is untrustworthy. Offering such proof may reflect adversely on the lawyer's ability to discriminate in the quality of evidence and thus impair the lawyer's effectiveness as an advocate. In criminal cases, however, a lawyer may, in some jurisdictions, be denied this authority by constitutional requirements governing the right to counsel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Ex parte proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>Ordinarily, an advocate has the limited responsibility of presenting one side of the matters that a tribunal should consider in reaching a decision; the conflicting position is expected to be presented by the opposing party. However, in an ex parte proceeding, such as an application for a temporary restraining order, there is no balance of presentation by opposing advocates. The object of an ex parte proceeding is nevertheless to yield a substantially just result. The judge has an affirmative responsibility to accord the absent party just consideration. The lawyer for the represented party has the correlative duty to make disclosures of material facts known to the lawyer and that the lawyer reasonably believes are necessary to an informed decision.</p>\n<p>4-3.4 <i>Fairness of opposing party and counsel.</i> A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p>(a) Unlawfully obstruct another party's access to evidence; or otherwise unlawfully alter, destroy, or conceal a document or other material that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is relevant to a pending or a reasonably foreseeable proceeding. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act.</p>\n<p>(b) Fabricate evidence, counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely, or offer an inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law.</p>\n<p>(c) Knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists.</p>\n<p>(d) In pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or intentionally fail to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party.</p>\n<p>(e) In trial, allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, assert personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, or state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil litigant, or the guilt or innocence of an accused.</p>\n<p>(f) Request a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information to another party unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The person is a relative or an employee or other agent of a client; and</p>\n<p>(2) It is reasonable to believe that the person's interests will not be adversely affected by refraining from giving such information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The procedure of the adversary system contemplates that the evidence in a case is to be marshalled competitively by the contending parties. Fair competition in the adversary system is secured by prohibitions against destruction or concealment of evidence, improperly influencing witnesses, obstructive tactics in discovery procedure, and the like.</p>\n<p>Documents and other items of evidence are often essential to establish a claim or defense. Subject to evidentiary privileges, the right of an opposing party, including the government, to obtain evidence through discovery or subpoena is an important procedural right. The exercise of that right can be frustrated if relevant material is altered, concealed or destroyed. Applicable law in many jurisdictions makes it an offense to destroy material for the purpose of impairing its availability in a pending proceeding or one whose commencement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1061</span> can be foreseen. Falsifying evidence is also generally a criminal offense. Paragraph (a) applies to evidentiary material generally, including computerized information.</p>\n<p>With regard to paragraph (b), it is not improper to pay a witness's expenses or to compensate an expert witness on terms permitted by law. The common law rule in most jurisdictions is that it is improper to pay an occurrence witness any fee for testifying and that it is improper to pay an expert witness a contingent fee.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (f) permits a lawyer to advise employees of a client to refrain from giving information to another party, for the employees may identify their interests with those of the client. See also rule 4-4.2.</p>\n<p>4-3.5 <i>Impartiality and decorum of the tribunal.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not seek to influence a judge, juror, prospective juror, or other decision maker except as permitted by law or the rules of court.</p>\n<p>(b) In an adversary proceeding a lawyer shall not communicate or cause another to communicate as to the merits of the cause with a judge or an official before whom the proceeding is pending except:</p>\n<p>(1) In the course of the official proceeding in the cause;</p>\n<p>(2) In writing if the lawyer promptly delivers a copy of the writing to the opposing counsel or to the adverse party if not represented by a lawyer;</p>\n<p>(3) Orally upon notice to opposing counsel or to the adverse party if not represented by a lawyer; or</p>\n<p>(4) As otherwise authorized by law.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall not engage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p>(1) Before the trial of a case with which he or she is connected, communicate or cause another to communicate with anyone he or she knows to be a member of the venire from which the jury will be selected.</p>\n<p>(2) During the trial of a case with which he or she is connected, communicate or cause another to communicate with any member of the jury.</p>\n<p>(3) During the trial of a case with which he or she is not connected, communicate or cause another to communicate with a juror concerning the case.</p>\n<p>(4) After dismissal of the jury in a case with which he or she is connected, initiate communication with or cause another to initiate communication with any juror regarding the trial except to determine whether the verdict may be subject to legal challenge. Provided, a lawyer may not interview jurors for this purpose unless he or she has reason to believe that grounds for such challenge may exist. Provided further, before conducting any such interview the lawyer must file in the cause a notice of intention to interview setting forth the name of the juror or jurors to be interviewed. A copy of the notice must be delivered to the trial judge and opposing counsel a reasonable time before such interview. The provisions of this rule do not prohibit a lawyer from communicating with veniremen or jurors in the course of official proceedings or as authorized by court rule or written order of the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Many forms of improper influence upon a tribunal are proscribed by criminal law. Others are specified in Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct, with which an advocate should be familiar. A lawyer is required to avoid contributing to a violation of such provisions.</p>\n<p>The advocate's function is to present evidence and argument so that the cause may be decided according to law. Refraining from abusive or obstreperous conduct is a corollary of the advocate's right to speak on behalf of litigants. A lawyer may stand firm against abuse by a judge but should avoid reciprocation; the judge's default is no justification for similar dereliction by an advocate. An advocate can present the cause, protect the record for subsequent review and preserve professional integrity by patient firmness no less effectively than by belligerence or theatrics.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1062</span> 4-3.6 <i>Trial publicity.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to make such a statement. Prosecutors and defense counsel shall exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, employees, or other persons assisting in or associated with a criminal case from making extrajudicial statements that are prohibited under this rule.</p>\n<p>(b) A statement referred to in paragraph (a) ordinarily is likely to have such an effect when it refers to a civil matter triable to a jury, a criminal matter, or any other proceeding that could result in incarceration, and the statement relates to:</p>\n<p>(1) The character, credibility, reputation, or criminal record of a party, suspect in a criminal investigation, or witness or the identity of a witness or the expected testimony of a party or witness;</p>\n<p>(2) In a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration, the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense, or the existence or contents of any confession, admission, or statement given by a defendant or suspect or that person's refusal or failure to make a statement;</p>\n<p>(3) The performance or results of any examination or test or the refusal or failure of a person to submit to an examination or test or the identity or nature of physical evidence expected to be presented;</p>\n<p>(4) Any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant or suspect in a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration;</p>\n<p>(5) Information the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to be inadmissible as evidence in a trial and would if disclosed create a substantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial; or</p>\n<p>(6) The fact that a defendant has been charged with a crime, unless there is included therein a statement explaining that the charge is merely an accusation and that the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.</p>\n<p>(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) through (5), a lawyer involved in the investigation or litigation of a matter may state without elaboration:</p>\n<p>(1) The general nature of the claim or defense;</p>\n<p>(2) The information contained in a public record;</p>\n<p>(3) That an investigation of the matter is in progress, including the general scope of the investigation, the offense or claim, or defense involved and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the persons involved;</p>\n<p>(4) The scheduling or result of any step in litigation;</p>\n<p>(5) A request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary thereto;</p>\n<p>(6) A warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and</p>\n<p>(7) In a criminal case:</p>\n<p>a. The identity, residence, occupation, and family status of the accused;</p>\n<p>b. If the accused has not been apprehended, information necessary to aid in apprehension of that person;</p>\n<p>c. The fact, time, and place of arrest; and</p>\n<p>d. The identity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>It is difficult to strike a balance between protecting the right to a fair trial and safeguarding the right of free expression. Preserving the right to a fair trial necessarily entails some curtailment of the information that may be disseminated about a party prior to trial, particularly where trial by jury is involved. If there were no such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1063</span> limits, the result would be the practical nullification of the protective effect of the rules of forensic decorum and the exclusionary rules of evidence. On the other hand, there are vital social interests served by the free dissemination of information about events having legal consequences and about legal proceedings themselves. The public has a right to know about threats to its safety and measures aimed at assuring its security. It also has a legitimate interest in the conduct of judicial proceedings, particularly in matters of general public concern. Furthermore, the subject matter of legal proceedings is often of direct significance in debate and deliberation over questions of public policy.</p>\n<p>Special rules of confidentiality may validly govern proceedings in juvenile, domestic relations and mental disability proceedings and perhaps other types of litigation. Rule 4-3.4(c) requires compliance with such rules.</p>\n<p>4-3.7 <i>Lawyer as witness.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness on behalf of his or her client except where:</p>\n<p>(1) The testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</p>\n<p>(2) The testimony will relate solely to a matter of formality and there is no reason to believe that substantial evidence will be offered in opposition to the testimony;</p>\n<p>(3) The testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</p>\n<p>(4) Disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer may act as advocate in a trial in which another lawyer in the lawyer's firm is likely to be called as a witness unless precluded from doing so by rule 4-1.7 or 4-1.9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Combining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the opposing party and can involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client.</p>\n<p>The opposing party has proper objection where the combination of roles may prejudice that party's rights in the litigation. A witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (a)(1) recognizes that if the testimony will be uncontested, the ambiguities in the dual role are purely theoretical. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) recognize that, where the testimony concerns the extent and value of legal services rendered in the action in which the testimony is offered, permitting the lawyers to testify avoids the need for a second trial with new counsel to resolve that issue. Moreover, in such a situation the judge has first-hand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is less dependence on the adversary process to test the credibility of the testimony.</p>\n<p>Apart from these two (2) exceptions, paragraph (a)(4) recognizes that a balancing is required between the interests of the client and those of the opposing party. Whether the opposing party is likely to suffer prejudice depends on the nature of the case, the importance and probable tenor of the lawyer's testimony, and the probability that the lawyer's testimony will conflict with that of other witnesses. Even if there is risk of such prejudice, in determining whether the lawyer should be disqualified due regard must be given to the effect of disqualification on the lawyer's client. It is relevant that one or both parties could reasonably foresee that the lawyer would probably be a witness. The principle of imputed disqualification stated in rule 4-1.10 has no application to this aspect of the problem.</p>\n<p>Whether the combination of roles involves an improper conflict of interest with respect to the client is determined by rule 4-1.7 or 4-1.9. For example, if there is likely to be substantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer or a member of the lawyer's firm, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1064</span> the representation is improper. The problem can arise whether the lawyer is called as a witness on behalf of the client or is called by the opposing party. Determining whether or not such a conflict exists is primarily the responsibility of the lawyer involved. See comment to rule 4-1.7. If a lawyer who is a member of a firm may not act as both advocate and witness by reason of conflict of interest, rule 4-1.10 disqualifies the firm also.</p>\n<p>4-3.8 <i>Special responsibilities of a prosecutor.</i> The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:</p>\n<p>(a) Refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probably cause;</p>\n<p>(b) Not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important pretrial rights such as a right to a preliminary hearing;</p>\n<p>(c) Make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations such as making a reasonable effort to assure that the accused has been advised of the right to, and the procedure for, obtaining counsel and has been given a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel so that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence. Precisely how far the prosecutor is required to go in this direction is a matter of debate. Florida has adopted the American Bar Association Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to Prosecution Function. This is the product of prolonged and careful deliberation by lawyers experienced in criminal prosecution and defense and should be consulted for further guidance. See also rule 4-3.3(d) governing ex parte proceedings, among which grand jury proceedings are included. Applicable law may require other measures by the prosecutor and knowing disregard of these obligations or systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion could constitute a violation of rule 4-8.4.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) does not apply to an accused appearing pro se with the approval of the tribunal, nor does it forbid the lawful questioning of a suspect who has knowingly waived the rights to counsel and silence.</p>\n<p>The exception in paragraph (c) recognizes that a prosecutor may seek an appropriate protective order from the tribunal if disclosure of information to the defense could result in substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.</p>\n<p>4-3.9 <i>Advocate in nonadjudicative proceedings.</i> A lawyer representing a client before a legislative or administrative tribunal in a nonadjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in a representative capacity and shall conform to the provisions of rules 4-3.3(a) through (c), 4-3.4(a) through (c), and 4-3.5(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>In representation before bodies such as legislatures, municipal councils, and executive and administrative agencies acting in a rule-making or policy-making capacity, lawyers present facts, formulate issues, and advance argument in the matters under consideration. The decision-making body, like a court, should be able to rely on the integrity of the submissions made to it. A lawyer appearing before such a body should deal with the tribunal honestly and in conformity with applicable rules of procedure.</p>\n<p>Lawyers have no exclusive right to appear before nonadjudicative bodies, as they do before a court. The requirements of this rule therefore may subject lawyers to regulations inapplicable to advocates who are not lawyers. However, legislatures and administrative agencies have a right to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1065</span> expect lawyers to deal with them as they deal with courts.</p>\n<p>This rule does not apply to representation of a client in a negotiation or other bilateral transaction with a governmental agency; representation in such a transaction is governed by rules 4-4.1 through 4-4.4.</p>\n<p>4-4 <i>Transactions with persons other than clients.</i></p>\n<p>4-4.1 <i>Truthfulness in statements to others.</i> In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>\n<p>(a) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; or</p>\n<p>(b) Fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Misrepresentation</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a client's behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if the lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by failure to act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Statements of fact</i></h2>\n<p>This rule refers to statements of fact. Whether a particular statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances. Under generally accepted conventions in negotiation, certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of material fact. Estimates of price or value placed on the subject of a transaction and a party's intentions as to an acceptable settlement of a claim are in this category and so is the existence of an undisclosed principal except where nondisclosure of the principal would constitute fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Fraud by client</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (b) recognizes that substantive law may require a lawyer to disclose certain information to avoid being deemed to have assisted the client's crime or fraud. The requirement of disclosure created by this paragraph is, however, subject to the obligations created by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p>4-4.2 <i>Communication with person represented by counsel.</i> In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule does not prohibit communication with a party, or an employee or agent of a party, concerning matters outside the representation. For example, the existence of a controversy between a government agency and a private party, or between two (2) organizations, does not prohibit a lawyer for either from communicating with nonlawyer representatives of the other regarding a separate matter. Also, parties to a matter may communicate directly with each other and a lawyer having independent justification for communicating with the other party is permitted to do so. Communications authorized by law include, for example, the right of a party to a controversy with a government agency to speak with government officials about the matter.</p>\n<p>In the case of an organization, this rule prohibits communications by a lawyer for one party concerning the matter in representation with persons having a managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization and with any other person whose act or omission in connection with that matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization. If an agent or employee of the organization is represented in the matter by his or her own counsel, the consent by that counsel to a communication will be sufficient for purposes of this rule. Compare rule 4-3.4(f). This rule also covers any person, whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1066</span> or not a party to a formal proceeding, who is represented by counsel concerning the matter in question.</p>\n<p>4-4.3 <i>Dealing with unrepresented persons.</i> In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer's role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>An unrepresented person, particularly one not experienced in dealing with legal matters, might assume that a lawyer is disinterested in loyalties or is a disinterested authority on the law even when the lawyer represents a client. During the course of a lawyer's representation of a client, the lawyer should not give advice to an unrepresented person other than the advice to obtain counsel.</p>\n<p>4-4.4 <i>Respect for rights of third persons.</i> In representing a client a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person or knowingly use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Responsibility to a client requires a lawyer to subordinate the interests of others to those of the client, but that responsibility does not imply that a lawyer may disregard the rights of third persons. It is impractical to catalogue all such rights, but they include legal restrictions on methods of obtaining evidence from third persons.</p>\n<p>4-5 <i>Law firms and associations.</i></p>\n<p>4-5.1 <i>Responsibilities of a partner or supervisory lawyer.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having direct supervisory authority over another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer's violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, or has direct supervisory authority over the other lawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraphs (a) and (b) refer to lawyers who have supervisory authority over the professional work of a firm or legal department of a government agency. This includes members of a partnership and the shareholders in a law firm organized as a professional corporation; lawyers having supervisory authority in the law department of an enterprise or government agency; and lawyers who have intermediate managerial responsibilities in a firm.</p>\n<p>The measures required to fulfill the responsibility prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) can depend on the firm's structure and the nature of its practice. In a small firm, informal supervision and occasional admonition ordinarily might be sufficient. In a large firm, or in practice situations in which intensely difficult ethical problems frequently arise, more elaborate procedures may be necessary. Some firms, for example, have a procedure whereby junior lawyers can make confidential referral of ethical problems directly to a designated senior partner or special committee. See rule 4-5.2. Firms, whether large or small, may also rely on continuing legal education in professional ethics. In any event the ethical atmosphere of a firm can influence the conduct of all its members and a lawyer having authority over the work of another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1067</span> may not assume that the subordinate lawyer will inevitably conform to the rules.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (c)(1) expresses a general principle of responsibility for acts of another. See also rule 4-8.4(a).</p>\n<p>Paragraph (c)(2) defines the duty of a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over performance of specific legal work by another lawyer. Whether a lawyer has such supervisory authority in particular circumstances is a question of fact. Partners of a private firm have at least indirect responsibility for all work being done by the firm, while a partner in charge of a particular matter ordinarily has direct authority over other firm lawyers engaged in the matter. Appropriate remedial action by a partner would depend on the immediacy of the partner's involvement and the seriousness of the misconduct. The supervisor is required to intervene to prevent avoidable consequences of misconduct if the supervisor knows that the misconduct occurred. Thus, if a supervising lawyer knows that a subordinate misrepresented a matter to an opposing party in negotiation, the supervisor as well as the subordinate has a duty to correct the resulting misapprehension.</p>\n<p>Professional misconduct by a lawyer under supervision could reveal a violation of paragraph (b) on the part of the supervisory lawyer even though it does not entail a violation of paragraph (c) because there was no direction, ratification, or knowledge of the violation.</p>\n<p>Apart from this rule and rule 4-8.4(a), a lawyer does not have disciplinary liability for the conduct of a partner, associate, or subordinate. Whether a lawyer may be liable civilly or criminally for another lawyer's conduct is a question of law beyond the scope of these rules.</p>\n<p>4-5.2 <i>Responsibilities of a subordinate lawyer.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer is bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person.</p>\n<p>(b) A subordinate lawyer does not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if that lawyer acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyer's reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Although a lawyer is not relieved of responsibility for a violation by the fact that the lawyer acted at the direction of a supervisor, that fact may be relevant in determining whether a lawyer had the knowledge required to render conduct a violation of the rules. For example, if a subordinate filed a frivolous pleading at the direction of a supervisor, the subordinate would not be guilty of a professional violation unless the subordinate knew of the document's frivolous character.</p>\n<p>When lawyers in a supervisor-subordinate relationship encounter a matter involving professional judgment as to ethical duty, the supervisor may assume responsibility for making the judgment. Otherwise a consistent course of action or position could not be taken. If the question can reasonably be answered only one way, the duty of both lawyers is clear and they are equally responsible for fulfilling it. However, if the question is reasonably arguable, someone has to decide upon the course of action. That authority ordinarily reposes in the supervisor, and a subordinate may be guided accordingly. For example, if a question arises whether the interests of two (2) clients conflict under rule 4-1.7, the supervisor's reasonable resolution of the question should protect the subordinate professionally if the resolution is subsequently challenged.</p>\n<p>4-5.3 <i>Responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants.</i> With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</p>\n<p>(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1068</span> reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</p>\n<p>(2) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the person is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the person, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Lawyers generally employ assistants in their practice, including secretaries, investigators, law student interns, and paraprofessionals. Such assistants, whether employees or independent contractors, act for the lawyer in rendition of the lawyer's professional services. A lawyer should give such assistants appropriate instruction and supervision concerning the ethical aspects of their employment, particularly regarding the obligation not to disclose information relating to representation of the client, and should be responsible for their work product. The measures employed in supervising nonlawyers should take account of the fact that they do not have legal training and are not subject to professional discipline.</p>\n<p>4-5.4 <i>Professional independence of a lawyer.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer, except that:</p>\n<p>(1) An agreement by a lawyer with the lawyer's firm, partner, or associate may provide for the payment of money, over a reasonable period of time after the lawyer's death, to the lawyer's estate, or to one or more specified persons;</p>\n<p>(2) A lawyer who undertakes to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased lawyer may pay to the estate of the deceased lawyer that proportion of the total compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased lawyer; and</p>\n<p>(3) A lawyer or law firm may include nonlawyer employees in a compensation or retirement plan, even though the plan is based in whole or in part on a profit-sharing arrangement.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of the partnership consist of the practice of law.</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer's professional judgment in rendering such legal services.</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit if:</p>\n<p>(1) A nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of the estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable time during administration;</p>\n<p>(2) A nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof; or</p>\n<p>(3) A nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the professional judgment of a lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The provisions of this rule express traditional limitations on sharing fees. These limitations are to protect the lawyer's professional independence of judgment. Where someone other than the client pays the lawyer's fee or salary, or recommends employment of the lawyer, that arrangement does not modify the lawyer's obligation to the client. As stated in paragraph (c), such arrangements should not interfere with the lawyer's professional judgment.</p>\n<p>4-5.5 <i>Unlicensed practice of law.</i> A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1069</span> (a) Practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; or</p>\n<p>(b) Assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unlicensed practice of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The definition of the practice of law is established by law and varies from one jurisdiction to another. Whatever the definition, limiting the practice of law to members of the bar protects the public against rendition of legal services by unqualified persons. Paragraph (b) does not prohibit a lawyer from employing the services of paraprofessionals and delegating functions to them, so long as the lawyer supervises the delegated work and retains responsibility for their work. See rule 4-5.3. Likewise, it does not prohibit lawyers from providing professional advice and instruction to nonlawyers whose employment requires knowledge of law; for example, claims adjusters, employees of financial or commercial institutions, social workers, accountants, and persons employed in government agencies. In addition, a lawyer may counsel nonlawyers who wish to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p>4-5.6 <i>Restrictions on right to practice.</i> A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:</p>\n<p>(a) A partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; or</p>\n<p>(b) An agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer's right to practice is part of the settlement of a controversy between private parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>An agreement restricting the right of partners or associates to practice after leaving a firm not only limits their professional autonomy, but also limits the freedom of clients to choose a lawyer. Paragraph (a) prohibits such agreements except for restrictions incident to provisions concerning retirement benefits for service with the firm.</p>\n<p>Paragraph (b) prohibits a lawyer from agreeing not to represent other persons in connection with settling a claim on behalf of a client.</p>\n<p>4-6 <i>Public service.</i></p>\n<p>4-6.1 <i>Pro bono publico service.</i> A lawyer should render public interest legal service. A lawyer may discharge this responsibility by:</p>\n<p>(a) Providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to persons of limited means or to public service or charitable groups or organizations;</p>\n<p>(b) Service without compensation in public interest activities that improve the law, the legal system or the legal profession; or</p>\n<p>(c) Financial support for organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Each lawyer engaged in the practice of law has a responsibility to provide public interest legal services without fee, or at a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, charitable organization representation, and the administration of justice. This rule expresses that policy but is not intended to be enforced through disciplinary process.</p>\n<p>The rights and responsibilities of individuals and organizations in the United States are increasingly defined in legal terms. As a consequence, legal assistance in coping with the web of statutes, rules, and regulations is imperative for all persons.</p>\n<p>The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable to pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer. Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of legal services to the disadvantaged. The provision of free legal services to those unable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1070</span> to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer as well as the profession generally, but the efforts of individual lawyers are often not enough to meet the need. Thus, it has been necessary for the profession and government to institute additional programs to provide legal services. Accordingly, legal aid offices, lawyer referral services, and other related programs have been developed, and others will be developed by the profession and government. Every lawyer should support all proper efforts to meet this need for legal services.</p>\n<p>4-6.2 <i>Accepting appointments.</i> A lawyer shall not seek to avoid appointment by a tribunal to represent a person except for good cause, such as:</p>\n<p>(a) Representing the client is likely to result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or law;</p>\n<p>(b) Representing the client is likely to result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer; or</p>\n<p>(c) The client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer's ability to represent the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer ordinarily is not obliged to accept a client whose character or cause the lawyer regards as repugnant. The lawyer's freedom to select clients is, however, qualified. All lawyers have a responsibility to assist in providing pro bono publico service. See rule 4-6.1. An individual lawyer fulfills this responsibility by accepting a fair share of unpopular matters or indigent or unpopular clients. A lawyer may also be subject to appointment by a court to serve unpopular clients or persons unable to afford legal services.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appointed counsel</i></h2>\n<p>For good cause a lawyer may seek to decline an appointment to represent a person who cannot afford to retain counsel or whose cause is unpopular. Good cause exists if the lawyer could not handle the matter competently, see rule 4-1.1, or if undertaking the representation would result in an improper conflict of interest, for example, when the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer's ability to represent the client. A lawyer may also seek to decline an appointment if acceptance would be unreasonably burdensome, for example, when it would impose a financial sacrifice so great as to be unjust.</p>\n<p>An appointed lawyer has the same obligations to the client as retained counsel, including the obligations of loyalty and confidentiality, and is subject to the same limitations on the client-lawyer relationship, such as the obligation to refrain from assisting the client in violation of the rules.</p>\n<p>4-6.3 <i>Membership in legal services organization.</i> A lawyer may serve as a director, officer or member of a legal services organization, apart from the law firm in which the lawyer practices, notwithstanding that the organization serves persons having interests adverse to the client of the lawyer. The lawyer shall not knowingly participate in a decision or action of the organization:</p>\n<p>(a) If participating in the decision would be incompatible with the lawyer's obligations to a client under rule 4-1.7; or</p>\n<p>(b) Where the decision could have a material adverse effect on the representation of a client of the organization whose interests are adverse to a client of the lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Lawyers should be encouraged to support and participate in legal service organizations. A lawyer who is an officer or a member of such an organization does not thereby have a client-lawyer relationship with persons served by the organization. However, there is potential conflict between the interests of such persons and the interests of the lawyer's clients. If the possibility of such conflict disqualified a lawyer from serving on the board of a legal services organization, the profession's involvement in such organizations would be severely curtailed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1071</span> It may be necessary in appropriate cases to reassure a client of the organization that the representation will not be affected by conflicting loyalties of a member of the board. Established, written policies in this respect can enhance the credibility of such assurances.</p>\n<p>4-6.4 <i>Law reform activities affecting client interests.</i> A lawyer may serve as a director, officer, or member of an organization involved in reform of the law or its administration notwithstanding that the reform may affect the interests of a client of the lawyer. When the lawyer knows that the interests of a client may be materially affected by a decision in which the lawyer participates, the lawyer shall disclose that fact but need not identify the client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Lawyers involved in organizations seeking law reform generally do not have a client-lawyer relationship with the organization. Otherwise, it might follow that a lawyer could not be involved in a bar association law reform program that might indirectly affect a client. See also rule 4-1.2(b). For example, a lawyer specializing in antitrust litigation might be regarded as disqualified from participating in drafting revisions of rules governing that subject. In determining the nature and scope of participation in such activities, a lawyer should be mindful of obligations to clients under other rules, particularly rule 4-1.7. A lawyer is professionally obligated to protect the integrity of the program by making an appropriate disclosure within the organization when the lawyer knows a private client might be materially affected.</p>\n<p>4-7 <i>Information about legal services.</i></p>\n<p>4-7.1 <i>Communications concerning a lawyer's services.</i> A lawyer shall not make or permit to be made a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer's services. A communication is false or misleading if it:</p>\n<p>(a) Contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading;</p>\n<p>(b) Is likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve or states or implies that the lawyer can achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; or</p>\n<p>(c) Compares the lawyer's services with other lawyers' services, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule governs all communications about a lawyer's services, including advertising permitted by rule 4-7.2. Whatever means are used to make known a lawyer's services, statements about them should be truthful. This includes any material misrepresentation or misleading omission such as where a lawyer states or implies certification or recognition as a specialist other than in accord with rule 4-7.4 or where a lawyer implies that any court, tribunal or other public body or official can be improperly influenced.</p>\n<p>The prohibition in paragraph (b) of statements that may create \"unjustified expectations\" would ordinarily preclude advertisements about results obtained on behalf of a client, such as the amount of a damage award or the lawyer's record in obtaining favorable verdicts, and advertisements containing client endorsements. Such information may create the unjustified expectation that similar results can be obtained for others without reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances.</p>\n<p>4-7.2 <i>Advertising.</i></p>\n<p>(a) Subject to the requirements of rule 4-7.1, a lawyer may advertise services through public media, such as a telephone directory, legal directory, newspaper or other periodical, outdoor, radio, or television advertising, or through written communication not involving solicitation as defined in rule 4-7.3.</p>\n<p>(b) A copy or recording of an advertisement or written communication shall be kept for three (3) years after its last dissemination along with a record of when and where it was used.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1072</span> (c) A lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer's services, except that a lawyer may pay the reasonable cost of advertising or written communication permitted by these rules and may pay the usual charges of a lawyer referral service or other legal service organization.</p>\n<p>(d) Any communication made pursuant to this rule shall include the name of at least one lawyer or the lawyer referral service responsible for its content.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>To assist the public in obtaining legal services, lawyers should be allowed to make known their services not only through reputation but also through organized information campaigns in the form of advertising. Advertising involves an active quest for clients, contrary to the tradition that a lawyer should not seek clientele. However, the public's need to know about legal services can be fulfilled in part through advertising. This need is particularly acute in the case of persons of moderate means who have not made extensive use of legal services. The interest in expanding public information about legal services ought to prevail over considerations of tradition. Nevertheless, advertising by lawyers entails the risk of practices that are misleading or overreaching.</p>\n<p>This rule permits public dissemination of information concerning a lawyer's name or firm name, address, and telephone number; the kinds of services the lawyer will undertake; the basis on which the lawyer's fees are determined, including prices for specific services and payment and credit arrangements; a lawyer's foreign language ability; names of references and, with their consent, names of clients regularly represented; and other information that might invite the attention of those seeking legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Questions of effectiveness and taste in advertising are matters of speculation and subjective judgment. Television is now one of the most powerful media for getting information to the public, particularly persons of low and moderate income; prohibiting television advertising, therefore, would impede the flow of information about legal services to many sectors of the public. Limiting the information that may be advertised has a similar effect and assumes that the bar can accurately forecast the kind of information that the public would regard as relevant. However, the content and format of a legal advertisement should comport with the dignity of the profession and promote public confidence in our legal system. Advertisements utilizing slogans, gimmicks, or other garish techniques, or the use of large electrical and neon signs, soundtracks, or other extravagant media, fail to meet these standards and diminish public confidence in the legal system.</p>\n<p>Neither this rule nor rule 4-7.3 prohibits communications authorized by law, such as notice to members of a class in class action litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Record of advertising</i></h2>\n<p>Paragraph (b) requires that a record of the content and use of advertising be kept in order to facilitate enforcement of this rule. It does not require that advertising be subject to review prior to dissemination. Such a requirement would be burdensome and expensive relative to its possible benefits, and may be of doubtful constitutionality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Paying others to recommend a lawyer</i></h2>\n<p>A lawyer is allowed to pay for advertising permitted by this rule, but otherwise is not permitted to pay another person for channeling professional work. This restriction does not prevent an organization or person other than the lawyer from advertising or recommending the lawyer's services. Thus, a legal aid agency or prepaid legal services plan may pay to advertise legal services provided under its auspices. Likewise, a lawyer may participate in lawyer referral programs and pay the usual fees charged by such programs, subject, however to the limitations imposed by rule 4-7.6. Paragraph (c) does not prohibit paying regular compensation to an assistant, such as a secretary, to prepare communications permitted by this rule.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1073</span> 4-7.3 <i>Direct contact with prospective clients.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer may not solicit professional employment from a prospective client with whom the lawyer has no family or prior professional relationship, in person or otherwise, when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain. The term \"solicit\" includes contact in person, by telephone or telegraph, or by other communication directed to a specific recipient and includes any written form of communication directed to a specific recipient and not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this rule.</p>\n<p>(b) Written communication.</p>\n<p>(1) Written communications to prospective clients for the purpose of obtaining professional employment are subject to the following requirements:</p>\n<p>a. Such written communications shall be plainly marked \"advertisement\" on the face of the envelope and at the top of each page of the written communication in type one size larger than the largest type used in the written communication.</p>\n<p>b. A copy of each such written communication shall be sent to staff counsel at bar headquarters and another copy shall be retained by the lawyer for three (3) years. If written communications identical in content are sent to two (2) or more prospective clients, the lawyer may comply with this requirement by sending a single copy together with a list of the names and addresses of persons to whom the written communication was sent to staff counsel at bar headquarters as well as retaining the same information.</p>\n<p>(2) A lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit to be sent, on behalf of himself, his firm, his partner, an associate, or any other lawyer affiliated with him or his firm a written communication to a prospective client for the purpose of obtaining professional employment if:</p>\n<p>a. The written communication concerns a specific matter and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person to whom the communication is directed is represented by a lawyer in the matter;</p>\n<p>b. It has been made known to the lawyer that the person does not want to receive such communications from the lawyer;</p>\n<p>c. The communication involves coercion, duress, fraud, overreaching, harassment, intimidation, or undue influence;</p>\n<p>d. The communication contains a false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive statement or claim or is improper under rule 4-7.1; or</p>\n<p>e. The lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the physical, emotional, or mental state of the person makes it unlikely that the person would exercise reasonable judgment in employing a lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>There is a potential for abuse inherent in direct solicitation by a lawyer of prospective clients known to need legal services. It subjects the lay person to the private importuning of a trained advocate, in a direct interpersonal encounter. A prospective client often feels overwhelmed by the situation giving rise to the need for legal services and may have an impaired capacity for reason, judgment, and protective self-interest. Furthermore, the lawyer seeking the retainer is faced with a conflict stemming from the lawyer's own interest, which may color the advice and representation offered the vulnerable prospect.</p>\n<p>The situation is therefore fraught with the possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching. This potential for abuse inherent in direct solicitation of prospective clients justifies its prohibition, particularly since lawyer advertising permitted under rule 4-7.2 offers an alternative means of communicating necessary information to those who may be in need of legal services.</p>\n<p>Advertising makes it possible for a prospective client to be informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available lawyers and law firms, without subjecting the prospective <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1074</span> client to direct personal persuasion that may overwhelm the client's judgment.</p>\n<p>The use of general advertising to transmit information from lawyer to prospective client, rather than direct private contact, will help to assure that the information flows cleanly as well as freely. Advertising is out in public view, thus subject to scrutiny by those who know the lawyer. This informal review is itself likely to help guard against statements and claims that might constitute false or misleading communications in violation of rule 4-7.1. Direct private communications from a lawyer to a prospective client are not subject to such third-party scrutiny and consequently are much more likely to approach (and occasionally cross) the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading.</p>\n<p>Direct written communications seeking employment by specific prospective clients present less potential for abuse or overreaching than in-person solicitation and are therefore not prohibited, but are subject to reasonable restrictions designed to minimize or preclude abuse and overreaching and to ensure lawyer accountability if such should occur. Thus, it is appropriate to limit the circumstances under which such direct contact is permitted; require the identification of such communication by nature; and require the keeping of a record of such direct contact for a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>Similarly, this rule would not prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or groups that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for its members, insureds, beneficiaries, or other third parties for the purpose of informing such entities of the availability of and details concerning the plan or arrangement which the lawyer or his or her firm is willing to offer. This form of communication is not directed to a specific prospective client known to need legal services related to a particular matter. Rather, it is usually addressed to an individual acting in a fiduciary capacity seeking a supplier of legal services for others who may, if they choose, become prospective clients of the lawyer. Under these circumstances, the activity which the lawyer undertakes in communicating with such representatives and the type of information transmitted to the individual are functionally similar to and serve the same purpose as advertising permitted under rule 4-7.2.</p>\n<p>4-7.4 <i>Communication of fields of practice.</i> A lawyer may communicate the fact that the lawyer does or does not practice in particular fields of law. A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is a specialist except as follows:</p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer admitted to engage in patent practice before the United States patent and trademark office may use the designation \"patent attorney\" or a substantially similar designation;</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer engaged in admiralty practice may use the designation \"admiralty,\" \"proctor in admiralty,\" or a substantially similar designation;</p>\n<p>(c) A lawyer who complies with the Florida Certification Plan as set forth in chapter 6, Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, or who is certified by a national group which has standards for certification substantially the same as those set out in chapter 6, may inform the public and other lawyers of his or her certified areas of legal practice; and</p>\n<p>(d) A lawyer who complies with the Florida Designation Plan as set forth in chapter 6, Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, may inform the public and other lawyers of his or her designated areas of legal practice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>This rule permits a lawyer to indicate areas of practice in communications about the lawyer's services; for example, in a telephone directory or other advertising. If a lawyer practices only in certain fields, or will not accept matters except in such fields, the lawyer is permitted so to indicate.</p>\n<p>Recognition of specialization in patent matters is a matter of long-established policy of the patent and trademark office. Designation of admiralty practice has a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1075</span> long historical tradition associated with maritime commerce and the federal courts.</p>\n<p>4-7.5 <i>Firm names and letterheads.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not use a firm name, letterhead, or other professional designation that violates rule 4-7.1. A trade name may be used by a lawyer in private practice if it does not imply a connection with a government agency or with a public or charitable legal services organization and is not otherwise in violation of rule 4-7.1.</p>\n<p>(b) A law firm with offices in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located.</p>\n<p>(c) The name of a lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any substantial period in which the lawyer is not actively and regularly practicing with the firm.</p>\n<p>(d) Lawyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization only when that is the fact.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>A firm may be designated by the names of all or some of its members, by the names of deceased members where there has been a continuing succession in the firm's identity or by a trade name such as the \"ABC Legal Clinic.\" Although the United States Supreme Court has held that legislation may prohibit the use of trade names in professional practice, use of such names in law practice is acceptable so long as it is not misleading. If a private firm uses a trade name that includes a geographical name such as \"Springfield Legal Clinic,\" an express disclaimer that it is a public legal aid agency may be required to avoid a misleading implication. It may be observed that any firm name including the name of a deceased partner is, strictly speaking, a trade name. The use of such names to designate law firms has proven a useful means of identification. However, it is misleading to use the name of a lawyer not associated with the firm or a predecessor of the firm.</p>\n<p>With regard to paragraph (d), lawyers sharing office facilities, but who are not in fact partners, may not denominate themselves as, for example, \"Smith and Jones,\" for that title suggests partnership in the practice of law.</p>\n<p>4-7.6 <i>Lawyer referral services.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not accept referrals from a lawyer referral service unless the service:</p>\n<p>(1) Engages in no communication with the public and in no direct contact with prospective clients in a manner that would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if the communication or contact were made by the lawyer;</p>\n<p>(2) Receives no fee or charge that constitutes a division or sharing of fees, unless the service is a not-for-profit service approved by The Florida Bar pursuant to chapter 8 of these rules;</p>\n<p>(3) Refers clients only to persons lawfully permitted to practice law in Florida when the services to be rendered constitute the practice of law in Florida.</p>\n<p>(4) Requires the lawyer to waive confidentiality for the purpose of enabling The Florida Bar to inform the service of the lawyer's grievance history and the status of each complaint against the lawyer in which there has been a finding of probable cause;</p>\n<p>(5) Carries or requires each lawyer participating in the service to carry professional liability insurance in an amount not less than $100,000 per claim or occurrence;</p>\n<p>(6) Furnishes The Florida Bar with the names of all lawyers participating in the service; and</p>\n<p>(7) Neither represents nor implies to the public that the service is endorsed or approved by The Florida Bar, unless the service is operated by or has been expressly approved by The Florida Bar.</p>\n<p>(b) A \"lawyer referral service\" is any person, group of persons, association, organization, or entity that receives a fee or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1076</span> charge for referring or causing the direct or indirect referral of a potential client to a lawyer drawn from a specific group or panel of lawyers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Every citizen of the state should have ready access to the legal system. A person's access to the legal system is enhanced by the assistance of a lawyer qualified to handle that person's legal needs. Many of the citizens of the state who are potential consumers of legal services encounter difficulty in identifying and locating lawyers who are willing and qualified to consult with them about their legal needs. Lawyer referral services can facilitate the identification and intelligent selection of lawyers qualified to render assistance. However, because a potential for abuse exists, the participation of lawyers in referral services must be regulated to ensure protection of the public.</p>\n<p>It is in the public interest that a person seeking the assistance of counsel receive accurate information to select or be matched with counsel qualified to render the needed services. Therefore, a lawyer should not participate in a lawyer referral service that communicates misleading information to the public or that directly contacts prospective clients about available legal services in a manner that constitutes impermissible solicitation.</p>\n<p>A person who avails himself of legal services is well served only if those services are rendered by a lawyer who exercises independent legal judgment. The division or sharing of a fee risks the creation of an obligation that impairs a lawyer's ability to exercise independent legal judgment. Therefore, the public interest usually compels the ethical prohibition against the division or sharing of fees and that ethical prohibition should likewise apply to the division or sharing of fees with a lawyer referral service. The prohibition does not extend to the lawyer's paying a pre-arranged, fixed-sum participation fee. Furthermore, the prohibition does not apply when the referring agency is a not-for-profit service operated by a bona fide state or local bar association under the supervision of and approved by The Florida Bar in order to ensure that such service fulfills the public-interest purposes of a lawyer referral service and to ensure that the risk of impairment of the lawyer's ability to exercise independent legal judgment is in that circumstance minimal.</p>\n<p>It is in the public interest that a person receive legal services only from someone who is qualified to render them. Lawyers should strive to prevent harm resulting from the rendering of legal services by persons not legally qualified to do so. Therefore, a lawyer should not participate in a lawyer referral service that refers clients to persons not lawfully permitted to practice law in Florida when the services to be rendered constitute the practice of law in Florida.</p>\n<p>A lawyer whose conduct is or has been the subject of disciplinary action by The Florida Bar should not be able to conceal that fact from prospective clients through the initial anonymity provided by a lawyer referral service. Therefore, a lawyer should participate in a lawyer referral service only if that service requires him to waive confidentiality for the purpose of permitting the service to obtain from The Florida Bar information about the lawyer's disciplinary record so that the service can take appropriate action.</p>\n<p>The quasi-institutionalization of legal services by a lawyer referral service implies that the service has screened the qualifications and financial responsibility of its participating lawyers. That implication may be misleading and does not exist when a prospective client directly selects a lawyer at arm's length. Therefore, it is in the public interest that only lawyers who have established a certain amount of financial responsibility for professional liability participate in a lawyer referral service. Accordingly, a lawyer should participate in a lawyer referral service only if the service requires proof of that financial responsibility.</p>\n<p>To enable The Florida Bar to fulfill its obligation to protect the public from unethical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1077</span> or other improper conduct by those who practice law in Florida, The Florida Bar must have available to it the identity of all lawyers participating in a lawyer referral service. Therefore, a lawyer should participate in a lawyer referral service only if the service furnishes The Florida Bar with the names of its participating lawyers.</p>\n<p>4-8 <i>Maintaining the integrity of the profession.</i></p>\n<p>4-8.1 <i>Bar admission and disciplinary matters.</i> An applicant for admission to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</p>\n<p>(a) Knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or</p>\n<p>(b) Fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>The duty imposed by this rule extends to persons seeking admission to the bar as well as to lawyers. Hence, if a person makes a material false statement in connection with an application for admission, it may be the basis for subsequent disciplinary action if the person is admitted and in any event may be relevant in a subsequent admission application. The duty imposed by this rule applies to a lawyer's own admission or discipline as well as that of others. Thus, it is a separate professional offense for a lawyer to knowingly make a misrepresentation or omission in connection with a disciplinary investigation of the lawyer's own conduct. This rule also requires affirmative clarification of any misunderstanding on the part of the admissions or disciplinary authority of which the person involved becomes aware.</p>\n<p>This rule is subject to the provisions of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of Florida's Constitution. A person relying on such a provision in response to a question, however, should do so openly and not use the right of nondisclosure as a justification for failure to comply with this rule.</p>\n<p>A lawyer representing an applicant for admission to the bar, or representing a lawyer who is the subject of a disciplinary inquiry or proceeding, is governed by the rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship.</p>\n<p>4-8.2 <i>Judicial and legal officials.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge, adjudicatory officer, or public legal officer or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial or legal office.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable provisions of Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Assessments by lawyers are relied on in evaluating the professional or personal fitness of persons being considered for election or appointment to judicial office and to public legal offices, such as attorney general, prosecuting attorney and public defender. Expressing honest and candid opinions on such matters contributes to improving the administration of justice. Conversely, false statements by a lawyer can unfairly undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p>When a lawyer seeks judicial office, the lawyer should be bound by applicable limitations on political activity.</p>\n<p>To maintain the fair and independent administration of justice, lawyers are encouraged to continue traditional efforts to defend judges and courts unjustly criticized.</p>\n<p>4-8.3 <i>Reporting professional misconduct.</i></p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer having knowledge that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1078</span> as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the appropriate professional authority.</p>\n<p>(b) A lawyer having knowledge that a judge has committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question as to the judge's fitness for office shall inform the appropriate authority.</p>\n<p>(c) This rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by rule 4-1.6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Self-regulation of the legal profession requires that members of the profession initiate disciplinary investigation when they know of a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Lawyers have a similar obligation with respect to judicial misconduct. An apparently isolated violation may indicate a pattern of misconduct that only a disciplinary investigation can uncover. Reporting a violation is especially important where the victim is unlikely to discover the offense.</p>\n<p>A report about misconduct is not required where it would involve violation of rule 4-1.6. However a lawyer should encourage a client to consent to disclosure where prosecution would not substantially prejudice the client's interests.</p>\n<p>If a lawyer were obliged to report every violation of the rules, the failure to report any violation would itself be a professional offense. Such a requirement existed in many jurisdictions, but proved to be unenforceable. This rule limits the reporting obligation to those offenses that a self-regulating profession must vigorously endeavor to prevent. A measure of judgment is, therefore, required in complying with the provisions of this rule. The term \"substantial\" refers to the seriousness of the possible offense and not the quantum of evidence of which the lawyer is aware.</p>\n<p>The duty to report professional misconduct does not apply to a lawyer retained to represent a lawyer whose professional conduct is in question. Such a situation is governed by the rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship.</p>\n<p>4-8.4 <i>Misconduct.</i> A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p>(a) Violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</p>\n<p>(b) Commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</p>\n<p>(c) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;</p>\n<p>(d) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;</p>\n<p>(e) State or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official; or</p>\n<p>(f) Knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>Many kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on fitness to practice law, such as offenses involving fraud and the offense of willful failure to file an income tax return. However, some kinds of offense carry no such implication. Traditionally, the distinction was drawn in terms of offenses involving \"moral turpitude.\" That concept can be construed to include offenses concerning some matters of personal morality, such as adultery and comparable offenses, that have no specific connection to fitness for the practice of law. Although a lawyer is personally answerable to the entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally answerable only for offenses that indicate lack of those characteristics relevant to law practice. Offenses involving violence, dishonesty, or breach of trust or serious interference with the administration of justice are in that category. A pattern of repeated offenses, even ones of minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to legal obligation.</p>\n<p>A lawyer may refuse to comply with an obligation imposed by law upon a good faith belief that no valid obligation exists. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1079</span> The provisions of rule 4-1.2(d) concerning a good faith challenge to the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law apply to challenges of legal regulation of the practice of law.</p>\n<p>Lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of other citizens. A lawyer's abuse of public office can suggest an inability to fulfill the professional role of attorney. The same is true of abuse of positions of private trust such as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or agent and officer, director, or manager of a corporation or other organization.</p>\n<p>4-8.5 <i>Jurisdiction.</i> A lawyer admitted to practice in this jurisdiction is subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction although engaged in practice elsewhere.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comment:</i></h2>\n<p>In modern practice lawyers frequently act outside the territorial limits of the jurisdiction in which they are licensed to practice, either in another state or outside the United States. In doing so, they remain subject to the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which they are licensed to practice. If their activity in another jurisdiction is substantial and continuous, it may constitute practice of law in that jurisdiction. See rule 4-5.5.</p>\n<p>If the Rules of Professional Conduct in the two (2) jurisdictions differ, principles of conflict of laws may apply. Similar problems can arise when a lawyer is licensed to practice in more than one jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Where the lawyer is licensed to practice law in two (2) jurisdictions which impose conflicting obligations, applicable rules of choice of law may govern the situation. A related problem arises with respect to practice before a federal tribunal where the general authority of the states to regulate the practice of law must be reconciled with such authority as federal tribunals may have to regulate practice before them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chapter 5</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>RULES REGULATING TRUST ACCOUNTS</h2>\n<p>5-1 <i>Generally.</i></p>\n<p>5-1.1 <i>Trust accounts.</i> Money or other property entrusted to an attorney for a specific purpose, including advances for costs and expenses, is held in trust and must be applied only to that purpose. Money and other property of clients coming into the hands of an attorney are not subject to counterclaim or setoff for attorney fees, and a refusal to account for and deliver over such property upon demand shall be deemed a conversion. This is not to preclude the retention of money or other property upon which the lawyer has a valid lien for services or to preclude the payment of agreed fees from the proceeds of transactions or collection. Controversies as to the amount of fees are not grounds for disciplinary proceedings unless the amount demanded is clearly excessive, extortionate, or fraudulent. In a controversy alleging a clearly excessive, extortionate, or fraudulent fee, announced willingness of an attorney to submit a dispute as to the amount of a fee to a competent tribunal for determination may be considered in any determination as to intent or in mitigation of discipline; provided, such willingness shall not preclude admission of any other relevant admissible evidence relating to such controversy, including evidence as to the withholding of funds or property of the client, or to other injury to the client occasioned by such controversy.</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Trust accounts required</i> Any bank or savings and loan association account maintained by a member of The Florida Bar to comply with rule 4-1.5, Rules of Professional Conduct, is and shall be clearly labeled and designated as a trust account. Any safe deposit box used in connection with the practice of law in Florida maintained by a member of The Florida Bar to comply with rule 4-1.15 shall be located in this state unless the client otherwise consents in writing. A member of The Florida Bar shall advise any institution in which such deposit box is located that it may include property of clients.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Trust accounts as official records.</i> A member of The Florida Bar shall preserve or cause to be preserved the records of all bank and savings and loan association <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1080</span> accounts or other records pertaining to the funds or property of a client maintained in compliance with rule 4-1.5 for a period of not less than six (6) years subsequent to the final conclusion of the representation of a client relative to such funds or property, whichever shall last occur. Such records shall include checkbooks, cancelled checks, check stubs, vouchers, ledgers and journals, closing statements, accountings or other statements of disbursements rendered to clients or other parties with regard to trust funds, or similar equivalent records clearly and expressly reflecting the date, amount, source, and reason for all receipts, withdrawals, deliveries, and disbursements of the funds or property of a client. Such records shall be kept pursuant to these rules as a specific prerequisite to the right to receive, deliver and disburse funds or property of a client and to have a public aspect relating to the protection of clients and to fitness of a member of The Florida Bar to practice law. In any instance of an alleged violation by a member of The Florida Bar of this rule or of any of the Rules of Professional Conduct, such records insofar as they may relate in any way to the transaction, occurrence, or client in question shall be produced by the members of The Florida Bar for inspection, audit, and copying by a designated representative of The Florida Bar upon the direction of this Court, a grievance committee, the board of governors if acting pursuant to rule 3-7.4(b), or a referee. Such records or copies thereof shall be admissible in evidence in any proceeding under this rule; provided notice of such intended use shall be given to any client involved, if practicable, unless such client is already aware of such intended use, and upon good cause shown by such client the admission of the same shall be under such conditions as shall be reasonably calculated thereafter to protect the confidences of such client in the event that the proceedings otherwise become public records. Permissible means of protection shall not prejudice the respondent and may include but are not limited to excision, in camera production, retention in sealed envelopes, or similar devices. Failure to maintain such records or to produce them upon such direction shall constitute ground for disciplinary action under this rule without regard to any other matter. The cost of any audit or investigation necessitated by such failure may be taxed against a respondent.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Trust accounting.</i> Minimum trust accounting records shall be maintained and minimum trust accounting procedures must be followed by all attorneys practicing in Florida who receive or disburse trust money or property.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Interest-bearing trust accounts.</i> A member of The Florida Bar who elects to create or maintain an interest-bearing trust account for client's funds which are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time for the benefit of The Florida Bar Foundation shall comply with the following provisions:</p>\n<p>(1) <i>Eligible institutions.</i> An interest-bearing trust account may be established with any bank or savings and loan association authorized by federal or state law to do business in Florida and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Funds in each interest-bearing trust account shall be subject to withdrawal upon request and without delay.</p>\n<p>(2) <i>Interest rates.</i> The rate of interest payable on any interest-bearing trust account shall not be less than the rate paid by the depository institution to regular, nonattorney depositors. Higher rates offered by the institution to customers whose deposits exceed certain time or quantity minima, such as those offered in the form of certificates of deposit, may be obtained by a lawyer or law firm on some or all of deposited funds so long as there is no impairment of the right to withdraw or transfer principal immediately.</p>\n<p>(3) <i>Remittance instructions.</i> Lawyers or law firms electing to deposit client funds in a trust savings account shall direct the depository institution:</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1081</span> a. <i>Quarterly remittance.</i> To remit interest or dividends, as the case may be, on the average monthly balance in the account or as otherwise computed in accordance with an institution's standard accounting practice, at least quarterly, to The Florida Bar Foundation, Inc.;</p>\n<p>b. <i>Remit to bar foundation.</i> To transmit with each remittance to the foundation a statement showing the name of the lawyer or law firm for whom the remittance is sent and the rate of interest applied; and</p>\n<p>c. <i>Report to law firm.</i> To transmit to the depositing lawyer or law firm at the same time a report showing the amount paid to the foundation, the rate of interest applied, and the average account balance of the period for which the report is made.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Unidentifiable trust fund accumulations and trust funds held for missing owners.</i> When an attorney's trust account contains an unidentifiable accumulation of trust funds or property, or trust funds or property held for missing owners, such funds or property shall be so designated. Diligent search and inquiry shall then be made by the attorney to determine the beneficial owner of any unidentifiable accumulation or the address of any missing owner. If the beneficial owner of a unidentified accumulation is determined, the funds shall be properly identified as his or her trust property. If a missing beneficial owner is located, the trust funds or property shall be paid over or delivered to the beneficial owner if he or she is then entitled to receive the same. Trust funds and property which remain unidentifiable and funds or property which are held for missing owners after being designated as such shall, after diligent search and inquiry fails to identify the beneficial owner or owner's address, be disposed of as provided in chapter 717, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>(f) A lawyer generally may not use, endanger, or encumber money held in trust for a client for purposes of carrying out the business of another client without the permission of the owner given after full disclosure of the circumstances. However, certain categories of trust account deposits are considered to carry a limited and acceptable risk of failure so that disbursements of trust account funds may be made in reliance on such deposits without disclosure to and permission of clients owning trust account funds subject to possibly being affected. Except for disbursements based upon any of the six (6) categories of limited-risk uncollected deposits enumerated below, a lawyer may not disburse funds held for a client or on behalf of that client unless the funds held for that client are collected funds. For purposes of this provision, \"collected funds\" means funds deposited, finally settled, and credited to the lawyer's trust account. Notwithstanding that a deposit made by a lawyer to his or her trust account has not been finally settled and credited to the account, the lawyer may disburse funds from his or her trust account in reliance on such deposit under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>(1) When the deposit is made by certified check or cashier's check.</p>\n<p>(2) When the deposit is made by a check or draft representing loan proceeds issued by a federally or state-chartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or other duly licensed or chartered institutional lender.</p>\n<p>(3) When the deposit is made by a bank check, official check, treasurer's check, money order, or other such instrument issued by a bank, savings and loan association, or credit union within the State of Florida when the lawyer has reasonable and prudent grounds to believe the instrument will clear and constitute collected funds in the lawyer's trust account within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>(4) When the deposit is made by a check drawn on the trust account of a lawyer licensed to practice in the State of Florida or on the escrow or trust account of a real estate broker licensed under chapter 475 of the Florida Statutes when the lawyer has a reasonable and prudent belief that the deposit will clear and constitute collected funds in his or her trust account within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1082</span> (5) When the deposit is made by a check issued by the United States government, the State of Florida, or any agency or political subdivision of the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>(6) When the deposit is made by a check or draft issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Florida and the lawyer has a reasonable and prudent belief that the instrument will clear and constitute collected funds in his or her trust account within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>A lawyer's disbursement of funds from his or her trust account in reliance on deposits that are not yet collected funds in any circumstances other than those set forth above, when it results in funds of other clients being used, endangered, or encumbered without authorization, may be grounds for a finding of professional misconduct. In any event, such a disbursement is at the risk of the lawyer making the disbursement. If any of the deposits fail, the lawyer upon obtaining knowledge of the failure must immediately act to protect the property of his or her other clients. However, if the lawyer accepting any such check personally pays the amount of any failed deposit or secures or arranges payment from sources available to him or her other than trust account funds of other clients, the lawyer shall not be considered guilty of professional misconduct.</p>\n<p>5-1.2 <i>Trust accounting records and procedures.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Applicability.</i> The provisions of these rules apply to all trust funds received or disbursed by members of The Florida Bar in the course of their professional practice of law within the State of Florida except special trust funds received or disbursed by attorney as guardian, personal representative, receiver, or in a similar capacity such as trustee under a specific trust document where the trust funds are maintained in a segregated special trust account and not the general trust account and wherein this special trust position has been created, approved, or sanctioned by law or an order of a court which has authority or duty to issue orders pertaining to maintenance of such special trust account.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Minimum trust accounting records.</i> The minimum trust accounting records which shall be maintained are:</p>\n<p>(1) A separate bank account or accounts and, if utilized, a separate savings and loan association account or accounts.

Such voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida shall be on the form prescribed by the board of governors of The Florida Bar. The account or accounts shall be in the name of the lawyer or law firm and clearly labeled and designated as a \"trust account.\"</p>\n<p>(2) Original or duplicate deposit slips and, in the case of currency or coin, an additional cash receipts book, clearly identifying:</p>\n<p>a.

The reason for which all trust funds were received, disbursed, or transferred.</p>\n<p>(7) All bank or savings and loan association statements for all trust accounts.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Minimum trust accounting procedures.</i> The minimum trust accounting procedures which shall be followed by all attorneys practicing in Florida who receive or disburse trust money or property are:</p>\n<p>(1) The lawyer shall cause to be made monthly:</p>\n<p>a. Reconciliations of all trust bank or savings and loan association accounts, disclosing the balance per bank, deposits in transit, outstanding checks identified by date and check number, and any other items necessary to reconcile the balance per bank with the balance per the check-book and the cash receipts and disbursements journal; and</p>\n<p>b. A comparison between the total of the reconciled balances of all trust accounts and the total of the trust ledger cards or pages, together with specific descriptions of any differences between the two (2) totals and reasons therefor.</p>\n<p>(2) At least annually, a detailed listing identifying the balance of the unexpended trust money held for each client or matter.</p>\n<p>(3) The above reconciliations, comparisons, and listing shall be retained for at least six (6) years.</p>\n<p>(4) The lawyer or law firm shall authorize and request any bank or savings and loan association where he or she is a signatory on a trust account to notify Staff Counsel, The Florida Bar, Tallahassee, Florida 32301, in the event any trust check is returned due to insufficient funds or uncollected funds, absent bank error.</p>\n<p>(5) The lawyer shall file with The Florida Bar between June 1 and August 15 of each year a trust accounting certificate showing compliance with these rules on a form approved by the board of governors.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Audits.</i> The following shall be cause for The Florida Bar to order an audit of a trust account:</p>\n<p>(1) Failure to file the trust account certificate required by rule 5-1.2(c)(5);</p>\n<p>(2) A trust account check is returned for insufficient funds or for uncollected funds, absent bank error;</p>\n<p>(3) A petition for creditor relief is filed on behalf of an attorney;</p>\n<p>(4) Felony charges are filed against an attorney;</p>\n<p>(5) An attorney is adjudged insane or mentally incompetent or is hospitalized under the Florida Mental Health Act;</p>\n<p>(6) A claim against the attorney is filed with the Clients' Security Fund;</p>\n<p>(7) When requested by a grievance committee or the board of governors; or</p>\n<p>(8) Upon court order.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Cost of audit.</i> Audits conducted in any of the circumstances enumerated in paragraph (d) above shall be at the cost of the attorney audited only when the audit reveals that the attorney was not in substantial compliance with the trust accounting requirements. It shall be the obligation of any attorney who is being audited to produce all records and papers concerning property and funds held in trust and to provide such explanations as may be required for the audit. Records of general accounts are not required to be produced except to verify that trust money has not been deposited thereto. If it has been determined that trust money has been deposited into a general account, all of the transactions pertaining to any firm account will be subject to audit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1084</span> Chapter 6</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DESIGNATION AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS</h2>\n<p>6-1 <i>Generally.</i></p>\n<p>6-1.1 <i>Composition of board.</i> The board of certification and designation shall be composed of thirteen (13) members of The Florida Bar appointed by the president of The Florida Bar, with the advice and consent of the board of governors.

Provided, however, an applicant may not receive credit for more than one year of practice for any twelve-month period under this section; accordingly, for example, an applicant who, while being engaged in the practice of law, receives an LL.M. degree by attending night classes, would not receive credit for the practice of law requirement by virtue of his or her having received the LL.M. degree.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Substantial involvement.</i> Every applicant must demonstrate substantial involvement in the practice of tax law during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date of application.

During the first three (3) years after the plan's implementation, the required number of hours of continuing legal education shall be sixty (60) hours which shall have been attained during the three-year period preceding the date of application. Thereafter, the required number of hours shall be established by the board of certification and designation but shall in no event be less than ninety (90) hours. Credit for attendance at continuing legal education seminars shall only be given for programs which are directly related to tax law. However, during the first two (2) years of the plan any courses approved for full or partial credit in taxation under The Florida Bar Designation Plan shall be given equal credit for the purposes of the education requirement under this section.

Citizens often encounter difficulty in identifying and locating lawyers who are willing and qualified to consult with them about their legal needs. To this end bona fide not-for-profit state and local bar associations are uniquely qualified to provide lawyer referral services under supervision by The Florida Bar for the benefit of the public. It is the policy of The Florida Bar to support the establishment of local lawyer referral services and to encourage those services to: (a) make legal services readily available to the general public through a referral method which considers the client's financial circumstances, spoken language, geographical convenience, and the type and complexity of the client's legal problem; (b) provide information about lawyers and the availability of legal services that will aid in the selection of a lawyer; (c) inform the public when and where to seek legal services and provide an initial determination of whether those services are necessary or advisable; and (d) provide referral to consumer, government, and other agencies when the individual's best interests so dictate.</p>\n<p>8-2 <i>Requirements.</i></p>\n<p>8-2.1 <i>Requirements for establishing a lawyer referral service sponsored by a local bar association.</i> The board of governors of The Florida Bar may adopt such regulations as it deems desirable governing the establishment, operation and termination of lawyer referral services operated by a local bar association.</p>\n<p>No local bar association shall operate a lawyer referral service except upon application to and approval by the board of governors of The Florida Bar.

Such application shall contain:</p>\n<p>(a) A statement of the benefits to the public to be achieved by the implementation of the lawyer referral service.</p>\n<p>(b) Proof that the referral service is established and operated by a nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), or 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p>(c) The proposed bylaws or rules and regulations which will govern the lawyer referral service. The proposed bylaws shall include the following regulations:</p>\n<p>(1) All members of the proposed referral service shall provide proof of professional liability insurance in the minimum amount of $100,000 unless the proposed lawyer referral service itself carries professional liability insurance in an amount not less than $100,000 per claim or occurrence.</p>\n<p>(2) The proposed lawyer referral service shall accept membership applications only from attorneys who maintain an office in the geographic area served by the proposed lawyer referral service.</p>\n<p>(3) The proposed lawyer referral service shall require a waiver of confidentiality for each member limited to and for the sole purpose of enabling The Florida Bar to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1108</span> inform the service of the lawyer's grievance history and the status of each complaint against the lawyer in which there has been a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>(4) The proposed lawyer referral service shall agree to maintain an alphabetical member list, updated quarterly, with The Florida Bar. In turn, The Florida Bar shall notify the service of any unresolved finding of probable cause against a member.
