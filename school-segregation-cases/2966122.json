(Mother) divorced on October 3, 2000.  The only child of the\r\nmarriage was W.M.R., who was nine years old.  The final divorce decree stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The court finds that\r\n[W.M.R.] suffers from muscular dystrophy and will be incapable of being self\r\nsupporting after the age of eighteen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>IT IS ORDERED AND\r\nDECREED that [Father] is obligated to pay and, shall pay to [Mother] child\r\nsupport of $1500.00 per month for [W.M.R.] in monthly installments . . . until\r\nthe date of the earliest occurrence of one of the following events:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>a. the child dies;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>b. further order\r\nmodifying this child support;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>c. $1,000 monthly\r\npayments are commenced to [W.M.R.] pursuant to New York Life Insurance Company\r\nannuity policy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Upon the commencement\r\nof the $1,000.00 monthly annuity payments set forth in paragraph c above[,] the\r\nsupport obligation of [Father] shall be reduced to $500.00 per month . . . and\r\ncontinuing thereafter until the first of the contingencies set forth in\r\nparagraph a and b above occurs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Father’s\r\nemployer was ordered to withhold child support from Father’s earnings.  “Earnings”\r\nwas defined as “compensation paid or payable to [Father] for personal services,\r\nwhether called wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise.”  Father was\r\nalso required to provide and maintain medical insurance coverage for W.M.R. and\r\nto pay for fifty percent of all health care expenses not covered by insurance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On\r\nAugust 16, 2001, the trial court modified the child support provisions of the\r\ndivorce decree.  The 2001 order states,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The prior Order of\r\nthis Court entitled DECREE OF DIVORCE[,] which was signed by the Court on\r\nOctober 3, 2000[,] is hereby modified as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> . . .

Fam. Code Ann. § 155.001(a) (West 2008).  The\r\ncourt retains its jurisdiction until (1) an order of adoption is rendered;\r\n(2) the parents have remarried each other; or (3) another court\r\nassumes jurisdiction by rendering a final order based on incorrect information\r\nthat there was no court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.  <i>Id</i>. §§ 155.002,\r\n155.004(a) (West 2008).  A court with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction may\r\nmodify its prior order regarding child support.  <i>Id.</i> § 155.003\r\n(West 2008).  A suit for support for a minor or adult disabled child may be\r\nfiled in the court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction as a suit for a\r\nmodification.  <i>Id</i>. § 154.305(c) (West 2008).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In\r\nthis case, the court acquired jurisdiction in 2000 with the rendition of the\r\nfinal divorce decree.  Father argues that his child support obligation ended\r\nwhen W.M.R. turned eighteen for two reasons.  First, he argues that the annuity\r\npayment “zeroed out” his child support obligation, thereby ending it.  The 2001\r\norder states that once the annuity payments commenced, Father’s obligation\r\n“shall be reduced by” the amount of the annuity payments.  Because Father’s\r\nobligation was for less than the amount of the annuity payments, Father argues\r\nhis obligation ended when the annuity payment began.  Father’s argument ignores\r\nthe language of the 2001 order which states that Father’s obligation continues\r\nuntil W.M.R.’s death or further order by the trial court.  The commencement of\r\nthe annuity payments does not extinguish Father’s obligation, it merely reduces\r\nit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Second,\r\nFather argues that the trial court did not make the required findings to\r\ncontinue child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.  Section 154.302 of\r\nthe family code states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(a) The court may\r\norder either or both parents to provide for the support of a child for an\r\nindefinite period and may determine the rights and duties of the parents if the\r\ncourt finds that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(1) the child,\r\nwhether institutionalized or not, requires substantial care and personal\r\nsupervision because of a mental or physical disability and will not be capable\r\nof self-support; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(2) the disability\r\nexists, or the cause of the disability is known to exist, on or before the 18th\r\nbirthday of the child.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 154.302 (West 2008).  Thus, the court cannot order\r\ncontinued child support unless it finds that the child requires substantial\r\ncare and personal supervision and will not be capable of self-support.  <i>See\r\nid</i>.  Father argues first that the 2001 agreed order “completely superseded\r\nall prior orders regarding child support.”  Because the agreed order contains\r\nno findings regarding W.M.R.’s disability, he continues, it is insufficient to\r\nsupport the trial court’s order of support.  Second, he argues that the findings\r\nin the original divorce decree that W.M.R. “suffers from muscular dystrophy and\r\nwill be incapable of being self[-]supporting after the age of eighteen” are\r\ninsufficient under the statute.  Father also argues that we may not imply the\r\nfindings necessary to support the judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In\r\nsupport of Father’s argument that the agreed order “completely superseded” the\r\ndivorce decree, he cites <i>In re Clark</i> for the proposition that “[a]n\r\norder modifying a prior child custody or support order necessarily supersedes\r\nthe prior order . . . .  Thus, an order modifying a prior child support order\r\nmay . . . ‘terminate’ the obligation imposed by the prior order . . . .”  No. 10-03-00037-CV,\r\n2004 WL 1632768, at *5 (Tex. App.—Waco July 21, 2004, no pet.).  Father’s use\r\nof ellipses contorts the original statement.  <i>Clark</i> actually says “An\r\norder modifying a prior child custody or support order necessarily supercedes\r\nthe prior order <i>to the extent a modification is ordered</i>.  Thus, an order\r\nmodifying a prior child support order may <i>or may not</i> ‘terminate’ the\r\nobligation imposed by the prior order, <i>depending on the circumstances</i>.” \r\n<i>Id</i>. (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> <i>Office of Attorney Gen. of Tex.\r\nv. Wilson</i>, 24 S.W.3d 902, 906 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000, no pet.) (holding\r\nthat a modification order that changed the identity of the payee of child\r\nsupport and did not change any other terms of paying child support left those\r\nunaddressed terms “unchanged” and that the two orders read together “specifically\r\nand unambiguously state the terms of Wilson’s child support obligation”). The\r\nonly change to Father’s child support obligations was a reduction of his\r\nmonthly payments from $1,500 to $870.75.  The 2001 agreed order made no\r\nmodification to the findings that W.M.R. suffers from muscular dystrophy and will\r\nbe incapable of supporting himself after the age of eighteen.  Thus, those\r\nfindings remain even after the changes imposed by the agreed order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Turning\r\nto whether the trial court’s findings are sufficient to support an order of\r\nchild support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday, we note that the statute\r\nrequires the trial court to find that W.M.R. (1) requires substantial care\r\nand personal supervision because of a mental or physical disability and (2) will\r\nnot be capable of self-support.  <i>See</i> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.302(a)(1)\r\n(West 2008).  The divorce decree includes the finding that W.M.R. would not be\r\ncapable of self-support but does not explicitly state that W.M.R. requires\r\nsubstantial care and personal supervision.  Father argues that the finding that\r\nW.M.R. requires substantial care and personal supervision must be stated in the\r\norder and that we cannot imply the finding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Father\r\ndid not request findings pursuant to rule 296 or rule 298 of the rules of civil\r\nprocedure, and there were no separately entered findings of fact or conclusions\r\nof law after the divorce decree or any of the modification orders.  <i>See</i>\r\nTex.

R. Civ. P. 299.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Although\r\nwe do not have the record of the original divorce hearing, Father does not\r\ncontend that W.M.R.’s health has improved since that time, and the evidence at\r\nthe last hearing supports the implied finding that W.M.R. continues to require\r\nsubstantial care and personal supervision.  As stated in the final divorce\r\ndecree, W.M.R. has muscular dystrophy.  Mother testified that W.M.R.’s disease\r\nis “incurable, and it is progressive,” and that people with muscular dystrophy\r\n“eventually die because of heart and lung failure.  But before that happens,\r\nthey are essentially paralyzed because their muscles have completely broken\r\ndown.”  W.M.R.’s heart and lungs are impaired and he cannot lift his arms.  Mother\r\ntestified that she goes home every day at lunch to check on W.M.R. and that she\r\nhas to leave work unexpectedly “usually once or twice a week” to help him with\r\nsomething he needs.  She testified that she has to take him to the doctor and\r\npick up his medications.  Mother testified that W.M.R. “is not able to feed or\r\ndress himself or get himself a drink or go to the toilet alone or bathe himself\r\nor any of those things.”  Every morning, Mother dresses W.M.R., washes his\r\nface, brushes his teeth, shaves him, and gets him into his wheelchair.  She\r\ntestified that it takes her about an hour and a half to get him ready for bed,\r\nbecause she has to bathe him, take care of his toiletries, give him his\r\nmedications and breathing therapy, and get him into bed.  Mother wakes up every\r\ntwo hours to roll W.M.R. over.  She testified that W.M.R. can only be alone for\r\nabout four hours before he needs assistance.  Mother has to get someone to stay\r\nwith him when she is away.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Although\r\nW.M.R. does not need constant supervision, the testimony at the hearing was\r\nsufficient to support a finding that he requires substantial care and frequent\r\npersonal supervision.  Thus, because the evidence supports the omitted element\r\nthat W.M.R. requires substantial care and personal supervision, we may supply\r\nthat element under rule 299.  Thus, the trial court’s findings are sufficient\r\nto support an order of child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.  We\r\noverrule Father’s first, second, and third issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span>2.

Co. v. Burns Motors, Inc.</i>, 22 S.W.3d 417, 422 (Tex. 2000).  If\r\nthe modification order is so worded that it can be given a certain or definite\r\nlegal meaning or interpretation, then it is not ambiguous and the court will\r\nconstrue the contract as a matter of law. <i>See Coker v. Coker</i>, 650 S.W.2d\r\n391, 393 (Tex. 1983).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Father\r\ntestified that he was paid bonuses from previous employers, but he has not\r\nreceived any bonuses with his current employer.  At the time of the 2001\r\nmodification, he received bonuses based upon certain criteria such as “[s]ales\r\nvolume, management objectives, [and] strategic objectives.”  He claims that he\r\nmade his salary plus bonuses but did not receive commissions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In\r\n2004, Father accepted his current position.  In his current job, Father\r\nreceives a base salary plus commission which is based “[s]trictly [on] sales\r\nvolume.”  He testified that his “regular pay” is his base salary plus the commissions\r\nhe receives.  He also testified that his understanding of the word bonus as\r\nused in the order is “a recognized achievement of a particular goal.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Mother\r\ntestified that during their marriage, Father received his base salary plus\r\nbonuses that he received “several times throughout the year.”  At the hearing,\r\nshe referred to the commissions that he received in his current job as bonuses\r\nbecause “[t]hat’s how he’s always described it to me.”  Mother argues that her\r\ntestimony regarding the parties’ understanding of the term “bonus” demonstrates\r\nthat they both understood the term in the 2001 modification order to include\r\ncommissions.  However, Father testified that his payment in his current\r\nposition is structured differently than it was in his previous positions.  Mother\r\ndid not testify that after changing jobs to his current position that he\r\ncontinued to refer to “bonuses” that he received.  Mother’s testimony only\r\ndemonstrates her understanding of bonuses in Father’s previous payment\r\nstructures, which were structured as salary plus bonuses “throughout the\r\nyear.”  Father’s current payment structure is salary plus commissions that were\r\nincluded in his regular wage checks.  The 2001 modification order stated that\r\nFather was “ordered to deliver to [Mother] within ten days of his receipt of\r\nany bonus check a copy of such check.”  The order did not state that Father was\r\nto deliver a copy of every paycheck he received each month, implying that the\r\nbonuses that Father was to pay 20% to Mother were <i>occasional</i> payments\r\nmade <i>in addition to</i> his regular wages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Father’s\r\ntestimony explaining his different payment structures as well as the language\r\nof the order itself support the dictionary definition of bonus and commission\r\nand their common, ordinary usage.  Black’s Law Dictionary defines bonus as “a\r\npremium paid in addition to what is due or expected.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 206\r\n(9th ed. 2009).  In the context of employment compensation, a bonus is “paid\r\nfor services or on consideration in addition to or in excess of the\r\ncompensation that would ordinarily be given.”  <i>Id</i>.; <i>see also</i> Webster’s\r\nThird New International Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 2002)  (defining bonus as “something\r\ngiven or received that is over and above what is expected” and “money or an\r\nequivalent given in addition to the usual compensation”).  A commission is “a\r\nfee paid to an agent or employee for a particular transaction, usu[ally] as a\r\npercentage of the money received from the transaction.”  Black’s Law Dictionary\r\n306; <i>see also</i> Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 457 (defining\r\ncommission as “a fee paid to an agent or employee for transacting a piece of\r\nbusiness or performing a service,” especially “a percentage of the money\r\nreceived in a sale or other transaction paid to the agent responsible for the\r\nbusiness”).  That portion of Father’s regular monthly paycheck labeled as a\r\ncommission is not a bonus as the term is used in the 2001 modification order. \r\nThe words commission and bonus are not interchangeable.  The original divorce decree\r\ndistinguished bonuses and commissions, noting that Father’s employer was to\r\nwithhold child support from Father’s “earnings,” which included “wages, salary,\r\ncommission, bonus, or otherwise.”  Had the parties intended Father to pay 20%\r\nof his commissions, they could have used the phrase in their agreed order, like\r\nthey had done in the past, and required him to pay 20% of his commissions or\r\nbonuses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The\r\n2001 modification order did not require Father to give Mother 20% of his\r\ncommissions. Further, because the trial court did not enter a modification\r\norder after the hearing in 2011, any implied substantive change it made to add\r\nthe word commission to the 2001 order is error.  <i>See</i> <i>Escobar v.\r\nEscobar</i>, 711 S.W.2d 230, 231–32 (Tex. 1986) (“The court can only correct\r\nthe entry of a final written judgment that incorrectly states the judgment\r\nactually rendered.  Thus, even if the court renders incorrectly, it cannot\r\nalter a written judgment which precisely reflects the incorrect rendition.”).  The\r\ntrial court therefore erred by calculating Father’s arrearage to include\r\ncommissions he earned.  We sustain Father’s fourth and fifth issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span>3.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, orig. proceeding).  <i>Whitehead</i> is\r\ninapposite.  In <i>Whitehead</i>, a child support order was held to be\r\nunenforceable by contempt for a number of reasons, including that “the divorce\r\ndecree did not order [the father] to pay any amount of money to anybody at\r\nanytime for insurance” but instead just ordered the father “to keep and\r\nmaintain health insurance on the children ‘at all times.’”  <i>Id</i>.  The\r\nappellate court specifically noted that its opinion was “concerned only with\r\nthe legality of the contempt findings” and did not affect the trial court’s\r\nmoney judgment in favor of the mother, which included the unpaid health\r\ninsurance.  <i>Id</i>. at 71 n.3.  Father cites to no other case supporting his\r\nproposition that a child support order is insufficiently definite to support an\r\narrearage because it does not set a start date for periodic payments.  Father\r\nwas paid bonuses only occasionally, and there was no evidence that he or anyone\r\nelse could foresee with any accuracy when those bonuses would be paid to him. \r\nIt is clear from the order that any future bonus payment Father was to receive,\r\nstarting from the date of the order, he was to pay 20% “net after taxes” to\r\nMother.  Further, Father conceded that he understood the order well enough to\r\nknow that the only bonus he received was subject to a 20% payment to Mother.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Father\r\ncites <i>In re T.A.N</i>., No. 07-08-0483-CV, 2010 WL 58334, at *4 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Amarillo, no pet.) (mem. op.), for his argument that a child support\r\nobligation that requires a parent to pay a percentage of his net income is too\r\nindefinite to support a judgment of arrearages.  In <i>T.A.N.</i>, the father\r\nwas ordered to pay 20 percent of his net income, calculated as of his wages on\r\nJuly 1, 2008.  <i>Id</i>.  The parties agreed, however, that the father never\r\nprovided evidence of his wages as of that date, and the calculation had not\r\nbeen done.  <i>Id</i>.  In this case, the calculation was easily accomplished. \r\nFather testified that he received a $500 bonus and that Mother was entitled to\r\n20% of his net income from that bonus after taxes.  Mother offered into\r\nevidence Father’s paystubs from 2003, including the paystub for the $500\r\nbonus.  The paystub noted that $173.25 was deducted for taxes, leaving Father a\r\nnet bonus of $326.75.  20% of $326.75 is $65.35, a calculation Father made in\r\nhis brief on appeal and which he agrees he owes to Mother.  The phrase “net\r\nafter taxes” is not so indefinite or ambiguous that a judgment for an arrearage\r\ncomputed using the phrase cannot stand.  <i>See</i> <i>Dicker v.
