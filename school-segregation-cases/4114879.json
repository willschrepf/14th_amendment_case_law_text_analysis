After a six-\n\nday bench trial, the trial court found that WSH managers issued a staffing directive\n\nthat prevented African-American staff from working with a violent patient making\n\n\n       1\n        WSH is a division of the Department of Social and Health Services. We refer to the\nrespondents collectively as the \"State\" throughout this opinion.\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nthreats over the course of one weekend in 2011. Despite this race-based staffing\n\ndirective, the trial court entered a verdict for the State and dismissed Employees'\n\nemployment discrimination claims. We reverse the trial court and hold that the\n\nState's racially discriminatory staffing directive violates the Washington Law\n\nAgainst Discrimination (WLAD), RCW 49.60.180(3).\n\n                   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.    Facts\n\n      This case involves Employees' challenge to alleged discriminatory acts of\n\ntheir employer WSH. WSH is a psychiatric hospital that cares for individuals with\n\nserious mental illnesses. WSH patients tend to be aggressive, violent, and psychotic,\n\nespecially where Employees were staffed. Employees all worked on the\n\nevening/swing shift on the same ward (ward F-5) of the Center for Forensic Services\n\nat WSH. Employee Patricia Blackburn, a registered nurse (RN), worked as the\n\ncharge nurse on ward F-5. Her race is Caucasian. The other eight Employees identify\n\nas various races and nationalities (African-American, black African, Filipino, and\n\nCaucasian). These eight Employees worked as psychiatric security attendants\n\n(PSAs) on ward F-5, where they helped care for patients.\n\n      Although staff members are generally assigned to work in a particular home\n\nward, they may be reassigned during a shift to work on a different ward based on a\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\n\"'pull list\"' that ensures staff members are \"pulled away from their home wards on\n\nan equal basis.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2710 (Finding of Fact (FOF) 9).\n\n      The trial court's findings focused on a staffing reassignment that involved\n\npatient M.P. In 2004, M.P. was admitted to WSH through an adjudication of not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity. M.P. was a particularly violent and intimidating patient\n\nwho had assaulted both patients and staff. He was often delusional as a result of\n\nfailing to take his medications and had spent significant time in seclusion and\n\nrestraints. M.P. had a history of methamphetamine abuse, and he suffered from\n\nschizoaffective disorder, bipolar, and antisocial personality disorder. M.P. was\n\nhoused on ward F-8.\n\n      M.P.'s violent behaviors and delusions escalated toward the end of March\n\n2011. At that time, M.P. was usually staffed with two attendants during the day and\n\none at night. One of his regular attendants was Marley Mann, an African-American\n\nPSA. 2 Andy Prisco was M.P.'s treatment team coordinator. He had worked\n\nextensively with M.P. On Friday, April1, 2011, Prisco reported to RN4 Lila Rooks\n\nthat M.P. was making credible threats toward Mann. He also quoted M.P.'s\n\ncomments that he planned to \"'fl'** up any [n word] working with him.\"' CP at\n\n2710 (alteration in original) (FOF 6). Prisco, who was familiar with numerous\n\nsimilar threats, believed that M.P.'s only credible threat directly targeted Mann and\n\n\n      2\n          Mann is not a party to this action.\n                                                3\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nno one else. The trial court found that \"the threats were directed specifically to Mr.\n\nMann.\" CP at 2710 (FOF 6).\n\n      Rooks shared Prisco's report with others. A decision was made that M.P.\n\nshould not have access to African-American staff during the weekend to ensure staff\n\nsafety. The trial court found that this decision \"was likely an overreaction to Mr.\n\nPrisco's reported concerns.\" CP at 2710 (FOF 7). Rooks communicated the staffing\n\ndecision to RN3s Barbara Yates and Beth Baltz.\n\n      The next day, Yates called Blackburn to reassign three of Blackburn's PSAs\n\nto work on other wards. Yates specifically·directed Blackburn to send a white staff\n\nperson to ward F-8, where M.P. resided. Seven of the nine Employees were working\n\nthe swing shift on ward F-5 at this time. Blackburn refused to depart from the pull\n\nlist and noted that the next three employees listed were all persons of color.\n\nBlackburn again refused when Yates directed that she send the person \"'with the\n\nlightest skin.\"' CP at 2711 (FOF 10). Yates eventually directed Bonifacio Fornillos\n\nto go to ward F-8. Fornillos obeyed this directive and proceeded to work on ward F-\n\n8 without incident.\n\n       M.P. did not commit any assaults over the weekend of April 2-3, 2011. The\n\ntrial court found that \"the staffing directive ended\" on Monday, April 4, 2011, and\n\nnoted that \"none of the plaintiffs have been on a shift in which a similar staffing\n\nassignment was made\" since that time. CP at 2711 (FOF 12, 14).\n\n                                           4\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nB.     Procedural history\n\n       Employees initially sued the State for employment discrimination in federal\n\ncourt in 2011, asserting both state and federal law claims. After the State asserted\n\nsovereign immunity over the claims under chapter 49.60 RCW, the parties agreed to\n\nvoluntarily dismiss their state law claims and refile them in Pierce County Superior\n\nCourt. 3\n\n       The trial court held a six-day bench trial in 2015. The court entered findings\n\nof fact and conclusions oflaw dismissing all of Employees' WLAD claims, issuing\n\na verdict for the defense. The factual findings focused on the particular staffing\n\nincident involving patient M.P. over the course of one weekend in April 2011. The\n\ncourt found that this staffing directive ended on April4, 2011, and that \"none of the\n\nplaintiffs have been on a shift in which a similar staffing assignment was made\"\n\nsince April 2011. CP at 2711 (FOF 14). The court rejected Employees' disparate\n\ntreatment claim on two grounds, concluding (1) that they failed to prove a tangible\n\nadverse employment action that was severe enough to be actionable and (2) that\n\n\"safety was the overriding factor\" in the staffing directive, rather than race. CP at\n\n2712 (Conclusion of Law (COL) 6). The trial court also dismissed Employees'\n\nhostile work environment claim, noting that the staffing directive was not \"so severe\n\n\n       3\n       The State prevailed on summary judgment in federal court on their federal claims, and the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in an m1published opinion.\nBlackburn v. State of Wash. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs., 611 F. App'x 416 (9th Cir. 2015).\n                                               5\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nor pervasive\" as to constitute a hostile work environment. CP at 2712 (COL 10); see\n\nalso CP at 2712 (COL 9). Employees sought direct review in this court, which we\n\ngranted.\n\n                                   II. ANALYSIS\n\n      Employees challenge multiple factual findings and conclusions of law. We\n\nreview findings of fact for substantial evidence. Hegwine v. Longview Fibre Co.,\n\n162 Wn.2d 340, 352, 172 P.3d 688 (2007). As the party challenging the trial court's\n\nfactual findings, Employees have the burden to prove they are not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. See Fisher Props., Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 115 Wn.2d 364,\n\n369, 798 P.2d 799 (1990). \"Substantial evidence\" means evidence that is sufficient\n\n'\"to persuade a rational, fair-minded person of the truth of the finding.\"' Hegwine,\n\n162 Wn.2d at 353 (quoting In re Estate of Jones, 152 Wn.2d 1, 8, 93 P.3d 147\n\n(2004)). So long as this substantial evidence standard is met, \"a reviewing court will\n\nnot substitute its judgment for that of the trial court even though it might have\n\nresolved a factual dispute differently.\" Sunnyside Valley Irrig. Dist. v. Dickie, 149\n\nWn.2d 873, 879-80, 73 P.3d 369 (2003). We review conclusions of law de novo.\n\nRobel v. Roundup Corp., 148 Wn.2d 35, 42, 59 P.3d 611 (2002); Hegwine, 162\n\nWn.2d at 348, 353.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nA.    Factual challenges\n\n      Employees raise various challenges to the trial court's factual findings that\n\ngenerally relate to the duration and frequency of the State's race-based staffing\n\npractices. Although the trial court found that the race-based staffing directive lasted\n\nonly one weekend and that Employees have not been subjected to similar staffing\n\nincidents, Employees claim the State maintains a policy of racial staffing that it has\n\nused on other occasions.\n\n      We find that substantial evidence supports the trial court's factual findings.\n\nThe trial court weighed the witnesses' testimony and credibility and implicitly\n\ndetermined that other staffing decisions described were not substantially similar to\n\nthe racial staffing directive at issue in April 2011, which involved a clear\n\ncommunication that no staff members of a certain race were to be assigned to a\n\nparticular ward over the course of one weekend. Based on our review of the record,\n\nEmployees' challenges are not sufficient to disturb the trial court's factual findings\n\nunder the substantial evidence standard.\n\nB.    Legal challenges\n\n      Employees claim that the trial court erred in dismissing their disparate\n\ntreatment and hostile work environment claims. We agree with Employees that the\n\nState's explicitly race-based staffing directive constituted facial discrimination in\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nviolation ofRCW 49.60.180(3).\n\n      Since 1949, the WLAD has existed to protect individuals from discrimination\n\non the basis of race, among other protected characteristics. The WLAD \"shall be\n\nconstrued liberally\" to accomplish its antidiscrimination purposes. RCW 49.60.020.\n\nRCW 49.60.180 prohibits racial discrimination in employment. At the federal level,\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2, also contains\n\nantidiscrimination provisions with some similar statutory language. Although this\n\ncase involves claims only under the WLAD, Washington courts often look to federal\n\ncase law on Title VII when interpreting the WLAD. See, e.g., Hill v. BCTI Income\n\nFund-I, 144 Wn.2d 172, 180, 23 P.3d 440 (2001). We view Title VII cases as \"a\n\nsource of guidance,\" but we also recognize that \"they are not binding and that we\n\nare free to adopt those theories and rationale which best further the purposes and\n\nmandates of our state statute.\" Grimwood v. Univ. of Puget Sound, Inc., 110 Wn.2d\n\n355, 361-62, 753 P.2d 517 (1988).\n\n      The WLAD makes it unlawful for an employer \"[t]o discriminate against any\n\nperson in compensation or in other terms or conditions of employment because of .\n\n. . race.\" RCW 49 .60.180(3 ). This case involves claims of disparate treatment under\n\nRCW 49.60.180(3). '\"\"Disparate treatment\" ... is the most easily understood type\n\nof discrimination. The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others\n\nbecause of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"' Shannon v. Pay 'N\n\n                                          8\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nSave Corp., 104 Wn.2d 722, 726, 709 P.2d 799 (1985) (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.IS, 97 S. Ct.\n\n1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977)).\n\n      When an employee makes out a claim of disparate treatment under the\n\nWLAD, like Title VII, the employer's action is unlawful unless the employer has a\n\nvalid justification. See, e.g., Franklin County Sheriff's Office v. Sellers, 97 Wn.2d\n\n317, 328-29, 646 P.2d 113 (1982) (\"The County's decision to achieve a sexual\n\nbalance by providing a male counselor and female counselor resulted in the County\n\nrefusing to hire Sellers because of her sex. As such, the action was prohibited by\n\nstatute unless it was based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.\"); Healey v.\n\nSouthwood Psychiatric Hasp., 78 F.3d 128, 132 (3d. Cir. 1996) (policy of requiring\n\nboth males and females on all shifts: \"When open and explicit use of gender is\n\nemployed, as is the case here, the systematic discrimination is in effect 'admitted'\n\nby the employer, and the case will tum on whether such overt disparate treatment is\n\nfor some reason justified,\" such as through affirmative action or a bona fide\n\noccupational qualification (BFOQ)); Int'l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr.\n\nImplement Workers ofAm. v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199-200, Ill S.\n\nCt. 1196, 113 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1991) (\"Whether an employment practice involves\n\ndisparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination does not depend on why\n\nthe employer discriminates but rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination ...\n\n                                          9\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\n. The beneficence of an employer's purpose does not undermine the conclusion that\n\nan explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination under [Title VII] and thus may\n\nbe defended only as a BFOQ.\").\n\n      The trial court held that Employees' disparate treatment claim failed. We\n\ndisagree. According to the trial court's findings of fact, the State made staffing\n\ndecisions that explicitly prevented certain employees from working on a particular\n\nward over the course of one weekend due to their race. Although the trial court found\n\nthese staffing orders were \"likely an overreaction,\" this does not change the resulting\n\ndiscriminatory nature of the staffing decisions. CP at 2710 (FOF 7). The trial court\n\nfound that \"the decision was made that [M.P.] should not have access to African[-]\n\nAmerican staff' and Yates directed that a \"white staff person needed to go to F-8,\"\n\ninstead of the African-American staff who were next on the pull list. CP at 2710\n\n(FOF 7, 9). These overt race-based directives affected staffing decisions in such a\n\nmanner as to constitute discrimination in \"terms or conditions of employment\n\nbecause of ... race\" in violation ofRCW 49.60.180(3). We hold that the trial court\n\nerred in concluding otherwise.\n\n      We also detennine that the State has no valid legal justification for its\n\ndiscrimination. RCW 49.60.180 allows employers to take protected characteristics\n\ninto account in limited circumstances. See RCW 49.60.180(1) (prohibition against\n\ndiscrimination in hiring does not apply if based on a BFOQ), (3) (permitting\n\n                                          10\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nsegregated washrooms and locker facilities on the basis of sex and allowing the\n\nHuman Rights Commission to issue regulations or rulings \"for the practical\n\nrealization of equality of opportunity between the sexes\"), (4) (prohibition against\n\ndiscrimination in advertising, job applications, and preemployment inquiries does\n\nnot apply if based on a BFOQ). In order to satisfy the BFOQ standard, the employer\n\nmust prove (1) that the protected characteristic is essential to job purposes or (2) that\n\nall or substantially all persons with the disqualifying characteristic would be unable\n\nto efficiently perform the job. Hegwine, 162 Wn.2d at 358.\n\n      None of these statutory exceptions apply. RCW 49.60.180(3) allows limited\n\nexceptions for classifications only based on sex, not race. And even if the BFOQ\n\ndefense from RCW 49.60.180(1) or (4) could apply in this case, which is doubtful,\n\nthe State waived it. CP at 2641; 1 Verbatim Report ofProceedings (Feb. 2, 2015) at\n\n11. The State fails to assert any other defense that our statutes or case law recognize.\n\nTherefore, Employees prevail on their disparate treatment claims.\n\n      Employees also challenge the trial court's dismissal of their hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. RCW 49.60.180(3) prohibits harassment based on a protected\n\ncharacteristic that rises to the level of a hostile work environment. An employee\n\nmust demonstrate four elements for a hostile work environment claim: that the\n\nharassment (1) was unwelcome, (2) was because of a protected characteristic, (3)\n\naffected the terms or conditions of employment, and (4) is imputable to the\n\n                                           11\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nemployer. Glasgow v. Ga.-Pac. Corp., 103 Wn.2d 403, 406-07, 693 P.2d 708\n\n(1985); see also Fisher v. Tacoma Sch. Dist. No. 10, 53 Wn. App. 591, 595-96, 769\n\nP.2d 318 (1989) (extending the hostile work environment standard in Glasgow to\n\nrace-based hostile work environment claims). The trial court held that the employees\n\nfailed to meet the third element, which requires that \"[t]he harassment must be\n\nsufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.\" Glasgow, 103 Wn.2d at 406. Harassing conduct has\n\nalso been described as \"severe and persistent,\" and it must be determined \"with\n\nregard to the totality of the circumstances.\" Id. at 406-07. 4\n\n       Based on the trial court's factual findings, which we find are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence, the trial court did not err in dismissing Employees' hostile\n\nwork environment claim. The trial court applied the correct legal standard and did\n\nnot err in concluding that the staffing decision over the course of a single weekend\n\ndid not rise to the level of severe or pervasive harassment.\n\n       Employees request relief in the form of damages, declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief, interest, attorney fees, and costs. RCW 49.60.030(2) allows successful\n\n\n\n       4\n          The Court of Appeals has adopted criteria \"[t]o determine whether the harassment is such\nthat it affects the conditions of employment ... :the frequency and severity of the discriminatory\nconduct; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and\nwhether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" Washington v.

Despite this race-based staffing\n\ndirective, the trial court entered a verdict for the State and dismissed Employees'\n\nemployment discrimination claims. We reverse the trial court and hold that the\n\nState's racially discriminatory staffing directive violates the Washington Law\n\nAgainst Discrimination (WLAD), RCW 49.60.180(3).\n\n                   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.    Facts\n\n      This case involves Employees' challenge to alleged discriminatory acts of\n\ntheir employer WSH. WSH is a psychiatric hospital that cares for individuals with\n\nserious mental illnesses. WSH patients tend to be aggressive, violent, and psychotic,\n\nespecially where Employees were staffed. Employees all worked on the\n\nevening/swing shift on the same ward (ward F-5) of the Center for Forensic Services\n\nat WSH. Employee Patricia Blackburn, a registered nurse (RN), worked as the\n\ncharge nurse on ward F-5. Her race is Caucasian. The other eight Employees identify\n\nas various races and nationalities (African-American, black African, Filipino, and\n\nCaucasian). These eight Employees worked as psychiatric security attendants\n\n(PSAs) on ward F-5, where they helped care for patients.\n\n      Although staff members are generally assigned to work in a particular home\n\nward, they may be reassigned during a shift to work on a different ward based on a\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\n\"'pull list\"' that ensures staff members are \"pulled away from their home wards on\n\nan equal basis.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2710 (Finding of Fact (FOF) 9).\n\n      The trial court's findings focused on a staffing reassignment that involved\n\npatient M.P. In 2004, M.P. was admitted to WSH through an adjudication of not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity. M.P. was a particularly violent and intimidating patient\n\nwho had assaulted both patients and staff. He was often delusional as a result of\n\nfailing to take his medications and had spent significant time in seclusion and\n\nrestraints. M.P. had a history of methamphetamine abuse, and he suffered from\n\nschizoaffective disorder, bipolar, and antisocial personality disorder. M.P. was\n\nhoused on ward F-8.\n\n      M.P.'s violent behaviors and delusions escalated toward the end of March\n\n2011. At that time, M.P. was usually staffed with two attendants during the day and\n\none at night. One of his regular attendants was Marley Mann, an African-American\n\nPSA. 2 Andy Prisco was M.P.'s treatment team coordinator. He had worked\n\nextensively with M.P. On Friday, April1, 2011, Prisco reported to RN4 Lila Rooks\n\nthat M.P. was making credible threats toward Mann. He also quoted M.P.'s\n\ncomments that he planned to \"'fl'** up any [n word] working with him.\"' CP at\n\n2710 (alteration in original) (FOF 6). Prisco, who was familiar with numerous\n\nsimilar threats, believed that M.P.'s only credible threat directly targeted Mann and\n\n\n      2\n          Mann is not a party to this action.\n                                                3\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nno one else. The trial court found that \"the threats were directed specifically to Mr.\n\nMann.\" CP at 2710 (FOF 6).\n\n      Rooks shared Prisco's report with others. A decision was made that M.P.\n\nshould not have access to African-American staff during the weekend to ensure staff\n\nsafety. The trial court found that this decision \"was likely an overreaction to Mr.\n\nPrisco's reported concerns.\" CP at 2710 (FOF 7). Rooks communicated the staffing\n\ndecision to RN3s Barbara Yates and Beth Baltz.\n\n      The next day, Yates called Blackburn to reassign three of Blackburn's PSAs\n\nto work on other wards. Yates specifically·directed Blackburn to send a white staff\n\nperson to ward F-8, where M.P. resided. Seven of the nine Employees were working\n\nthe swing shift on ward F-5 at this time. Blackburn refused to depart from the pull\n\nlist and noted that the next three employees listed were all persons of color.\n\nBlackburn again refused when Yates directed that she send the person \"'with the\n\nlightest skin.\"' CP at 2711 (FOF 10). Yates eventually directed Bonifacio Fornillos\n\nto go to ward F-8. Fornillos obeyed this directive and proceeded to work on ward F-\n\n8 without incident.\n\n       M.P. did not commit any assaults over the weekend of April 2-3, 2011. The\n\ntrial court found that \"the staffing directive ended\" on Monday, April 4, 2011, and\n\nnoted that \"none of the plaintiffs have been on a shift in which a similar staffing\n\nassignment was made\" since that time. CP at 2711 (FOF 12, 14).\n\n                                           4\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nB.     Procedural history\n\n       Employees initially sued the State for employment discrimination in federal\n\ncourt in 2011, asserting both state and federal law claims. After the State asserted\n\nsovereign immunity over the claims under chapter 49.60 RCW, the parties agreed to\n\nvoluntarily dismiss their state law claims and refile them in Pierce County Superior\n\nCourt. 3\n\n       The trial court held a six-day bench trial in 2015. The court entered findings\n\nof fact and conclusions oflaw dismissing all of Employees' WLAD claims, issuing\n\na verdict for the defense. The factual findings focused on the particular staffing\n\nincident involving patient M.P. over the course of one weekend in April 2011. The\n\ncourt found that this staffing directive ended on April4, 2011, and that \"none of the\n\nplaintiffs have been on a shift in which a similar staffing assignment was made\"\n\nsince April 2011. CP at 2711 (FOF 14). The court rejected Employees' disparate\n\ntreatment claim on two grounds, concluding (1) that they failed to prove a tangible\n\nadverse employment action that was severe enough to be actionable and (2) that\n\n\"safety was the overriding factor\" in the staffing directive, rather than race. CP at\n\n2712 (Conclusion of Law (COL) 6). The trial court also dismissed Employees'\n\nhostile work environment claim, noting that the staffing directive was not \"so severe\n\n\n       3\n       The State prevailed on summary judgment in federal court on their federal claims, and the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in an m1published opinion.\nBlackburn v.

State, No. 91494-0\n\nA.    Factual challenges\n\n      Employees raise various challenges to the trial court's factual findings that\n\ngenerally relate to the duration and frequency of the State's race-based staffing\n\npractices. Although the trial court found that the race-based staffing directive lasted\n\nonly one weekend and that Employees have not been subjected to similar staffing\n\nincidents, Employees claim the State maintains a policy of racial staffing that it has\n\nused on other occasions.\n\n      We find that substantial evidence supports the trial court's factual findings.\n\nThe trial court weighed the witnesses' testimony and credibility and implicitly\n\ndetermined that other staffing decisions described were not substantially similar to\n\nthe racial staffing directive at issue in April 2011, which involved a clear\n\ncommunication that no staff members of a certain race were to be assigned to a\n\nparticular ward over the course of one weekend. Based on our review of the record,\n\nEmployees' challenges are not sufficient to disturb the trial court's factual findings\n\nunder the substantial evidence standard.\n\nB.    Legal challenges\n\n      Employees claim that the trial court erred in dismissing their disparate\n\ntreatment and hostile work environment claims. We agree with Employees that the\n\nState's explicitly race-based staffing directive constituted facial discrimination in\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fBlackburn v. State, No. 91494-0\n\nviolation ofRCW 49.60.180(3).\n\n      Since 1949, the WLAD has existed to protect individuals from discrimination\n\non the basis of race, among other protected characteristics. The WLAD \"shall be\n\nconstrued liberally\" to accomplish its antidiscrimination purposes. RCW 49.60.020.\n\nRCW 49.60.180 prohibits racial discrimination in employment. At the federal level,\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2, also contains\n\nantidiscrimination provisions with some similar statutory language. Although this\n\ncase involves claims only under the WLAD, Washington courts often look to federal\n\ncase law on Title VII when interpreting the WLAD. See, e.g., Hill v. BCTI Income\n\nFund-I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2582577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2582577/hill-v-bcti-income-fund-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).

The beneficence of an employer's purpose does not undermine the conclusion that\n\nan explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination under [Title VII] and thus may\n\nbe defended only as a BFOQ.\").\n\n      The trial court held that Employees' disparate treatment claim failed. We\n\ndisagree. According to the trial court's findings of fact, the State made staffing\n\ndecisions that explicitly prevented certain employees from working on a particular\n\nward over the course of one weekend due to their race. Although the trial court found\n\nthese staffing orders were \"likely an overreaction,\" this does not change the resulting\n\ndiscriminatory nature of the staffing decisions. CP at 2710 (FOF 7). The trial court\n\nfound that \"the decision was made that [M.P.] should not have access to African[-]\n\nAmerican staff' and Yates directed that a \"white staff person needed to go to F-8,\"\n\ninstead of the African-American staff who were next on the pull list. CP at 2710\n\n(FOF 7, 9). These overt race-based directives affected staffing decisions in such a\n\nmanner as to constitute discrimination in \"terms or conditions of employment\n\nbecause of ... race\" in violation ofRCW 49.60.180(3). We hold that the trial court\n\nerred in concluding otherwise.\n\n      We also detennine that the State has no valid legal justification for its\n\ndiscrimination. RCW 49.60.180 allows employers to take protected characteristics\n\ninto account in limited circumstances. See RCW 49.60.180(1) (prohibition against\n\ndiscrimination in hiring does not apply if based on a BFOQ), (3) (permitting\n\n                                          10\n\fBlackburn v.

In order to satisfy the BFOQ standard, the employer\n\nmust prove (1) that the protected characteristic is essential to job purposes or (2) that\n\nall or substantially all persons with the disqualifying characteristic would be unable\n\nto efficiently perform the job. Hegwine, 162 Wn.2d at 358.\n\n      None of these statutory exceptions apply. RCW 49.60.180(3) allows limited\n\nexceptions for classifications only based on sex, not race. And even if the BFOQ\n\ndefense from RCW 49.60.180(1) or (4) could apply in this case, which is doubtful,\n\nthe State waived it. CP at 2641; 1 Verbatim Report ofProceedings (Feb. 2, 2015) at\n\n11. The State fails to assert any other defense that our statutes or case law recognize.\n\nTherefore, Employees prevail on their disparate treatment claims.\n\n      Employees also challenge the trial court's dismissal of their hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. RCW 49.60.180(3) prohibits harassment based on a protected\n\ncharacteristic that rises to the level of a hostile work environment.

The trial court applied the correct legal standard and did\n\nnot err in concluding that the staffing decision over the course of a single weekend\n\ndid not rise to the level of severe or pervasive harassment.\n\n       Employees request relief in the form of damages, declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief, interest, attorney fees, and costs.
