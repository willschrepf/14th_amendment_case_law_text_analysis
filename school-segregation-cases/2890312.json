We are also asked to decide, separately, whether\nthe State of California has unlawfully discriminated by alleg-\nedly paying community-based service providers lower wages\nand benefits than it pays employees in state institutions.\n\n                              I\n\n  In May, 2000, seven named plaintiffs representing a class\nof developmentally disabled individuals, and six organiza-\n\f                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                     8893\ntions that advocate for, or provide community-based services\nto, the developmentally disabled, brought this action against\nCalifornia officials who manage and administer various state\nprograms for the developmentally disabled.\n\n   The class (collectively referred to by reference to the first\nnamed plaintiff as “Sanchez”) consists of those individuals\nwho would be capable of living in the community with prop-\nerly funded support services but who now live in, or are at\nrisk of living in, state institutions because community-based\nservices are inadequately funded. All members of the class are\nentitled to services under Title XIX of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (the “Medicaid Act”), and are\n“qualified individual[s] with a disability” under § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act (“§ 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and under\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12131-12134 (the “ADA”).\n\n   The organizational plaintiffs (the “Providers”) are not part\nof the class, but receive reimbursement from the State of Cali-\nfornia under the Medicaid Act for providing services to the\ndevelopmentally disabled.\n\n   The state officials are, respectively, officials of California’s\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Department of\nHealth Services, Department of Developmental Services\n(“DDS”) and Department of Finance. These departments\nadminister and oversee services funded, in part, through the\nMedicaid Act. Generally, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services ensures that the services of the other depart-\nments are provided in compliance with state and federal law;\nthe Department of Health Services directs, organizes and\nadministers California’s medical assistance programs, includ-\ning Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program; DDS directs,\norganizes and administers California’s developmental disabil-\nities services program; and the Department of Finance over-\nsees all of the State’s financial and business policies,\nincluding health care funding.\n\f8894                         SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\n                                       A\n\n   Under the Medicaid Act, the federal government distributes\nfunds to participating states to help them provide health care\nservices for the poor and needy. Because California accepts\nMedicaid funds, it must administer its state Medicaid pro-\ngram, Medi-Cal, in compliance with a state plan that has been\npre-approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices. The Medicaid Act sets out the requirements for a\nstate plan at 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1)-(65).\n\n   In 1981, in response to the fact that a disproportionate per-\ncentage of Medicaid resources were being used for long-term\ninstitutional care and studies showing that many persons\nresiding in Medicaid-funded institutions would be capable of\nliving at home or in the community if additional support ser-\nvices were available, Congress authorized the Home and\nCommunity Based Services (“HCBS”) waiver program. The\nHCBS program allows a variety of noninstitutional care\noptions for persons who would otherwise be eligible for Med-\nicaid benefits in an institution, but who would prefer to live\nat home or in the community.1 To obtain a HCBS waiver for\na qualified person, the State must certify that the cost of plac-\ning that individual through the waiver program will be less\nthan or equal to the cost of his care in an institution. See gen-\nerally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 601-02 (1999).\n  1\n   The program was established under 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1), which\nprovides, in part, that:\n      The Secretary may by waiver provide that a State plan approved\n      under this title [42 USCS §§ 1396 et seq.] may include as “medi-\n      cal assistance” under such plan payment for part or all of the cost\n      of home or community-based services (other than room and\n      board) approved by the Secretary which are provided pursuant to\n      a written plan of care to individuals with respect to whom there\n      has been a determination that but for the provision of such ser-\n      vices the individuals would require the level of care provided in\n      a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the\n      mentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under\n      the State plan.\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                      8895\n                               B\n\n  Sanchez and the Providers claim that, because California\npays wages to community-based service providers participat-\ning in the HCBS waiver program at a lower rate than it pays\nemployees in state institutions, the State is in violation of the\nprovision of the Medicaid Act that requires that\n\n    A State plan for medical assistance — [must] pro-\n    vide such methods and procedures relating to the uti-\n    lization of, and the payment for, care and services\n    available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to\n    . . . assure that payments are consistent with effi-\n    ciency, economy, and quality of care and are suffi-\n    cient to enlist enough providers so that care and\n    services are available under the plan at least to the\n    extent that such care and services are available to the\n    general population in the geographic area[.]\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) (“§ 30(A)”). They further claim\nthat the lower pay in community-based programs has resulted\nin some developmentally disabled persons remaining unnec-\nessarily institutionalized, which, they allege, constitutes dis-\ncrimination against them in violation of the ADA and § 504.\nSanchez and the Providers seek injunctive relief requiring the\nstate officials to increase wages and benefits for community-\nbased service providers to match substantially the wages and\nbenefits of employees in state institutions.\n\n                               C\n\n   The state officials moved for judgment on the pleadings\nwith respect to the § 30(A) claim, on the ground that § 30(A)\ndoes not provide a private right of action enforceable under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 (“§ 1983”), and for summary judgment with\nrespect to the ADA and § 504 claims, on the ground that San-\nchez and the Providers failed to establish sufficient facts\nestablish a prima facie case for discrimination.\n\f8896                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\n   The district court initially granted the state officials’ sum-\nmary judgment motion, but denied the motion for judgment\non the pleadings with respect to the § 30(A) claim. The state\nofficials subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n§ 30(A) claim in light of the Supreme Court’s intervening\ndecision in Gonzaga v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), which clar-\nified the standard for evaluating whether a statute creates a\nprivate right of action.2 The district court granted the motion\nand, by opinion and order dated January 5, 2004, reversed its\nearlier decision. Applying the Supreme Court’s guidance in\nGonzaga, the district court concluded that neither Sanchez nor\nthe Providers could bring suit under § 1983 for a violation of\n§ 30(A).\n\n  Sanchez and the Providers timely appeal from the district\ncourt’s adverse decisions with respect to both their § 30(A)\nand their ADA and § 504 claims.\n\n                                     II\n\n   Both Sanchez and the Providers claim that § 30(A) creates\nan individual right enforceable by them under § 1983. Their\ninterests, however, though similar, are not congruent. San-\nchez’s claim requires us to decide whether § 30(A) creates a\nprivate right of action for recipients of Medicaid funding; the\nProviders’ claim requires us to decide the same question with\nrespect to providers of Medicaid services. Both claims require\nus to consider the current state of the Supreme Court’s private\nright of action and § 1983 jurisprudence.\n  2\n    Gonzaga involved an alleged violation of the Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, which\nprohibits “the federal funding of educational institutions that have a policy\nor practice of releasing education records to unauthorized persons.” 536\nU.S. at 276. Gonzaga University disclosed a student’s alleged sexual mis-\nconduct to the state agency responsible for teacher certification, where-\nupon the student sued to enforce the privacy provisions of FERPA. The\nCourt held that “such an action [was] foreclosed because the relevant pro-\nvisions of FERPA create no personal rights to enforce under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.” Id.\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                  8897\n                              A\n\n   In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980), the Supreme\nCourt held for the first time that § 1983 permits suits against\nstate officials to enforce statutes enacted pursuant to Con-\ngress’s spending power. Id. at 4-5. The scope of these new\nremedies available under § 1983 was clarified in Pennhurst\nState School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1 (1981),\nin which the Court explained that Thiboutot did not alter the\nfact that “the typical remedy for state noncompliance with\nfederally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action\nfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Govern-\nment to terminate funds to the State.” Id. at 28. Pennhurst\nestablished that the remedy announced in Thiboutot was to be\napplied sparingly and only to statutes in which Congress\n“speak[s] with a clear voice,” and “unambiguously” creates a\n“right[ ] secured by the laws of the United States.” Id. at 17,\n28 (quotation marks omitted). The Court also advised that the\nidentification of a substantive right embodied in a statute was\nonly the first of at least two steps that must be considered\nwhen analyzing whether that right is enforceable under\n§ 1983. Id. at 28 n.21 (“Because we conclude that § 6010 con-\nfers no substantive rights, we need not reach the question\nwhether there is a private cause of action under that section\nor under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce those rights.”) (empha-\nsis added).\n\n   Ten years later, in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass’n, 496\nU.S. 498 (1990), the Court held that 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396a(a)(13)(A) (subsequently repealed) of the Medicaid\nAct could give rise to a private right of action under § 1983.\nId. at 523. This anomalous decision appeared to mark a sud-\nden expansion in the Court’s § 1983 jurisprudence. In hind-\nsight, however, it was merely a rare case in which, as the\nCourt explained in Gonzaga, a statute “explicitly conferred\nspecific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs . . . [and]\n\f8898                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nCongress left no doubt of its intent for private enforcement\n. . . .” Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280.3\n\n   [1] In Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), the\nCourt finally provided an analytical framework for courts to\nuse when evaluating whether or not a statute creates a right\nenforceable under § 1983. Blessing requires a court to con-\nsider three factors: (1) “Congress must have intended that the\nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff,” id. at 340-41; (2)\n“the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly pro-\ntected by the statute is not so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its\nenforcement would strain judicial competence,” id. at 340;\nand (3) “the statute must ambiguously impose a binding obli-\ngation on the states. In other words, the provision giving rise\nto the asserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than\nprecatory terms.” Id. at 341. Somewhat confusingly, the first\nBlessing factor addressed whether or not the plaintiff receives\nan intended “benefit” from the statute, whereas the second\nfactor referred not to a “benefit” but to a “right.” In Gonzaga,\nthe Court resolved this inconsistency.\n\n   [2] The Court first acknowledged that “[s]ome language in\nour opinions might be read to suggest that something less than\nan unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by § 1983.”\nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282 (referring specifically to the Bless-\ning test). Correcting this misperception, the Court announced\nthat\n\n      [w]e now reject the notion that our cases permit any-\n      thing short of an unambiguously conferred right to\n  3\n    Justice Stevens, writing in dissent in Gonzaga, even suggested that the\nreasoning in Wilder is so out of step with the Court’s holding in Gonzaga\nthat it has been effectively overruled. Id. at 300 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning) (“[Imposing the implied right of action framework upon the § 1983\ninquiry] sub silentio overrules cases such as Wright and Wilder. In those\ncases we concluded that the statutes at issue created rights enforceable\nunder § 1983, but the statutes did not ‘clearly and unambiguously,’ . . .\nintend enforceability under § 1983.”)\n\f                           SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                            8899\n      support a cause of action brought under § 1983. Sec-\n      tion 1983 provides a remedy only for the deprivation\n      of “rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\n      Constitution and laws” of the United States. Accord-\n      ingly, it is rights, not the broader or vaguer “bene-\n      fits” or “interests,” that may be enforced under the\n      authority of that section. This being so, we further\n      reject the notion that our implied right of action\n      cases are separate and distinct from our § 1983\n      cases. To the contrary, our implied right of action\n      cases should guide the determination of whether a\n      statute confers rights enforceable under § 1983.\n\nId. at 283. The Court repeatedly stressed that it is Congress’s\nuse of explicit, individually focused, rights-creating language\nthat reveals congressional intent to create an individually\nenforceable right in a spending statute.4 See Gonzaga, 536\n  4\n    The Medicaid Act was promulgated under Congress’s spending power,\nsee Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644, 682-83\n(2003) (Thomas, J., concurring), which is encompassed in Art. I, § 8, cl.\n1, of the United States Constitution. One of the few enumerated grants of\nfederal legislative authority, see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 176 1\nCranch 137, 176, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) (“The powers of the\nlegislature are defined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mis-\ntaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.”), the Spending Clause\nstates that “Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for the . . . general\nWelfare of the United States.” In Pennhurst, the Court advised that, when\nreviewing legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power, courts\nshould be especially reluctant to conclude that Congress intended to create\na new individual right enforceable against the States. Because of the quasi-\ncontractual nature of Congress’s spending power, states accepting funds\nfrom the federal government must be aware of the conditions attached to\nthe receipt of those funds so that they can be said to have “voluntarily and\nknowingly accept[ed] the terms of the ‘contract.’ ” 451 U.S. at 17. (citing\nSteward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 585-598 (1937); Harris v.\nMcRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980)). “Accordingly, if Congress intends to\nimpose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unam-\nbiguously. . . . [and] speak with a clear voice [in order to] enable the States\nto exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their\nparticipation.” Id.\n\f8900                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nU.S. at 283-84 (“[T]he question whether Congress intended to\ncreate a private right of action is definitively answered in the\nnegative where a statute by its terms grants no private rights\nto any identifiable class.”) (quotation marks and alterations\nomitted, emphasis added).5\n\n   [3] As examples of paradigmatic rights-creating language,\nthe Court cited the texts of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Id.\nat 287 (comparing the text of FERPA unfavorably to “the\nindividually focused terminology of Titles VI and IX”). Those\n  5\n   Relying on an opaque item of legislative history, Sanchez and the Pro-\nviders argue that the district court erred by focusing unduly on the explicit\ntext of the statute to the exclusion of legislative intent. They allege that\nclassic “rights-creating” language could not be used in § 30(A), since the\nsection is included as part of the state plan requirements and that, in 1994,\nCongress amended the Medicaid Act to provide that\n      [i]n an action brought to enforce a provision of the Social Secur-\n      ity Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq.], such provision is not to be\n      deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of the\n      Act requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents of\n      a State plan. This section is not intended to limit or expand the\n      grounds for determining the availability of private actions to\n      enforce State plan requirements other than by overturning any\n      such grounds applied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992)\n      but not applied in prior Supreme Court decisions respecting such\n      enforceability; provided, however, that this section is not\n      intended to alter the holding in Suter v. Artist M. that section\n      471(a)(15) of the Act [42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15)] is not enforceable\n      in a private right of action.\n42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2; accord 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-10. Although this text is\nhardly a model of clarity, the caveat that it “is not intended to limit or\nexpand the grounds for determining the availability of private actions to\nenforce State plan requirements” shows that, at the very least, it does not\ndisturb the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Pennhurst, which was decided\nprior to Suter. And as we are bound to follow the Court’s holdings in\nBlessing and Gonzaga, which followed the enactment of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1320a-2, this provision does not disturb the general framework that we\n—and the district court in this case—have used to analyze private rights\nof action under § 1983.\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8901\nstatutes provide, respectively, that “No person in the United\nStates shall . . . be subjected to discrimination,” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000d, and that “No person in the United States shall, on the\nbasis of sex . . . be subjected to discrimination.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1681(a). Although our inquiry should not be limited to look-\ning for those precise phrases, statutory language less direct\nthan the individually-focused “No person shall . . .” must be\nsupported by other indicia so unambiguous that we are left\nwithout any doubt that Congress intended to create an individ-\nual, enforceable right remediable under § 1983.\n\n                               B\n\n  Since Gonzaga, no federal court of appeals of which we are\naware has concluded that § 30(A) provides Medicaid recipi-\nents or providers with a right enforceable under § 1983.\n\n   Before Gonzaga, the Fifth and Eighth Circuits each held\nthat Medicaid recipients had such a private right of action. See\nEvergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v. Hood, 235 F.3d\n908, 927-28 (5th Cir. 2000); Ark. Med. Soc’y, Inc. v. Reynolds\n6 F.3d 519, 528 (8th Cir. 1993); cf. Pa. Pharmacists Ass’n v.\nHoustoun, 283 F.3d 531, 543-44 (3rd Cir. 2002) (en banc)\n(positing, in dicta, a right for recipients while rejecting such\na right for providers); Visiting Nurse Ass’n v. Bullen, 93 F.3d\n997, 1004 n.7 (1st Cir. 1996) (positing, in dicta, a right for\nrecipients while holding that such a right existed for provid-\ners). The First, Seventh and Eighth Circuits held that such a\nright existed for Medicaid providers. See Visiting Nurse\nAss’n, 93 F.3d at 1005 (1st Cir. 1996); Methodist Hosps. v.\nSullivan, 91 F.3d 1026, 1029 (7th Cir. 1996); Ark. Med.\nSoc’y, Inc., 6 F.3d at 528. By contrast, the Third and Fifth\nCircuits explicitly held that § 30(A) did not create a right\nenforceable by Medicaid providers. See Pa. Pharmacists\nAss’n, 283 F.3d at 543; Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries,\nInc., 235 F.3d at 929.\n\n  However, in light of Gonzaga, the First Circuit has since\nreversed itself in a case involving only the rights of providers.\n\f8902                  SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nSee Long Term Care Pharm. Alliance v. Ferguson, 362 F.3d\n50, 59 (1st Cir. 2004) (“If Gonzaga had existed prior to Bul-\nlen, the panel could not have come to the same result. . . . Pro-\nviders such as pharmacies do not have a private right of action\nunder subsection (30)(A).”). With the First Circuit’s example\nin mind, we turn to the language of § 30(A) to determine if\nit unambiguously manifests Congressional intent to create\nindividual rights, whether for Medicaid recipients or provid-\ners, remediable under § 1983.\n\n                               C\n\n   In contrast to the language of Title VI and Title IX, there\nis nothing in the text of § 30(A) that unmistakably focuses on\nrecipients or providers as individuals. Moreover, the flexible,\nadministrative standards embodied in the statute do not reflect\na Congressional intent to provide a private remedy for their\nviolation.\n\n                               1\n\n   [4] In Gonzaga, the Supreme Court instructed that, when a\n“provision focuse[s] on ‘the aggregate services provided by\nthe State,’ rather than ‘the needs of any particular person,’ it\nconfer[s] no individual rights and thus [cannot] be enforced\nby § 1983.” Id. at 282 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340).\nLike the statute under review in Gonzaga, § 30(A) also has an\naggregate focus, rather than an individual focus that would be\nevidence of an intent to confer an individually enforceable\nright. The statute speaks not of any individual’s right but of\nthe State’s obligation to develop “methods and procedures”\nfor providing services generally. Indeed, the only reference in\n§ 30(A) to recipients of Medicaid services is in the aggregate,\nas members of “the general population in the geographic\narea.” A statutory provision that refers to the individual only\nin the context of describing the necessity of developing state-\nwide policies and procedures does not reflect a clear Congres-\nsional intent to create a private right of action.\n\f                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8903\n   The text does at least refer explicitly to Medicaid providers,\nbut as a means to an administrative end rather than as individ-\nual beneficiaries of the statute. The State is directed to “pro-\nvide methods and procedures . . . sufficient to enlist enough\nproviders so that care and services are available under the\nplan at least to the extent that such care and services are avail-\nable to the general population in the geographic area.” Under\n§ 30(A), providers are to be “enlisted” as subordinate partners\nin the administration of Medicaid services. They may cer-\ntainly benefit from their relationship with the State, but they\nare, at best, indirect beneficiaries and it would strain common\nsense to read § 30(A) as creating a “right” enforceable by\nthem. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 (“For a statute to create\nsuch private rights, its text must be phrased in terms of the\npersons benefitted.”).\n\n                                2\n\n   Far from focusing on the rights of a specific class of benefi-\nciaries, § 30(A) is concerned with a number of competing\ninterests. It requires a State to “provide such methods and pro-\ncedures relating to . . . care and services . . . as may be neces-\nsary to . . . assure that payments are consistent with\nefficiency, economy, and quality of care.” The most efficient\nand economical system of providing care may be one that\nbenefits taxpayers to the detriment of medical providers and\nrecipients; likewise, the provision of “quality” care—\nwhatever standard may be implied by such a nebulous term—\nis likely to conflict with the goals of efficiency and economy.\nThe tension between these statutory objectives supports the\nconclusion that § 30(A) is concerned with overall methodol-\nogy rather than conferring individually enforceable rights on\nindividual Medicaid recipients.\n\n  In Gonzaga, Justice Breyer observed that the “broad and\nnonspecific” language of FERPA indicated that “Congress\nmay well have wanted . . . to achieve the expertise, unifor-\nmity, wide-spread consultation, and resulting administrative\n\f8904                  SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nguidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking and to\navoid the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and\nmisincentives that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate\napplication of the statute in a private action for damages.” 536\nU.S. at 292 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). The lan-\nguage of § 30(A) is similarly ill-suited to judicial remedy; the\ninterpretation and balancing of the statute’s indeterminate and\ncompeting goals would involve making policy decisions for\nwhich this court has little expertise and even less authority.\n\n                               3\n\n   [5] The text and structure of § 30(A) simply do not focus\non an individual recipient’s or provider’s right to benefits, nor\nis the “broad and diffuse” language of the statute amenable to\njudicial remedy. We conclude, therefore, that Congress has\nnot spoken with an unambiguous, clear voice that would put\na State on notice that Medicaid recipients or providers are\nable to compel state action under § 1983.\n\n                               D\n\n   This conclusion follows our discussion of the impact of\nGonzaga in Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.\n2004). In that case, former tenants of low-income hotels and\na nonprofit organization involved in assisting the homeless\nsued the City of Stockton, alleging that the closing of residen-\ntial hotels for health and safety reasons violated federal and\nstate laws, including the Housing and Community Develop-\nment Act. We were asked to decide whether the plaintiffs had\na private right of action to enforce the relevant provisions of\nthe act.\n\n  We began by observing that, after Gonzaga, “to create\nenforceable rights [such as would satisfy the first prong of the\nBlessing test] the language of the statute must focus on indi-\nvidual entitlement to benefits rather than the aggregate or sys-\ntemwide policies and practices of a regulated entity.” Price,\n\f                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                     8905\n390 F.3d at 1110. Applying this rule, we noted that “[f]irst\nand foremost, Section 104(k) mandates that ‘each grantee\nshall provide for reasonable benefits to any person involuntar-\nily and permanently displaced as a result of the use of assis-\ntance received under this chapter to acquire or substantially\nrehabilitate property.’ ” Id. (emphasis added). From this lan-\nguage, we concluded that the section “is ‘phrased with an\nunmistakable focus on the benefited class’ [and] does not\nspeak ‘only in terms of institutional policy and practice,’ . . .\nbut rather requires that benefits be provided to particular per-\nsons displaced by federally funded redevelopment activities,”\nand, therefore, it “evinces a clear intent to create a federal\nright.” Id. at 1111 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288) (cita-\ntions omitted).\n\n   We also held that the “ ‘reasonable benefits’ to which dis-\nplaced persons unquestionably are entitled under Section\n104(k),” were not “too vague for judicial enforcement.” Id.\nBecause related statutory provisions and regulations “enumer-\nate[d] the monetary benefits to which displaced persons of\nlow and moderate income are entitled, ‘including reimburse-\nment for actual and reasonable moving expenses, security\ndeposits, credit checks, and other moving-related expenses,\nincluding any interim living costs,’ ” id. at 1112, we con-\ncluded that the terms of the statute anticipated a clear,\nenforceable remedy for violations of the rights enumerated in\nthe statute. Id. at 1112, 1114.\n\n   In contrast, we held that “other provisions of [the statute\nunder consideration] do not share Section 104(k)’s focus on\nindividual benefits,” id. at 1113, and, instead, “are directed to\ngovernmental agencies . . . and are phrased in aggregate\nterms, without reference to individual displaced persons.” Id.\n(emphasis added, quotation marks omitted). We concluded\nthat, “[i]n consideration of this aggregate focus, we hold that\nthe requirements of [these other sections of the statute] do not\n. . . create individual rights directly: . . . the lack of ‘rights-\ncreating’ language and the absence of any focus on individual\n\f8906                  SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nentitlements, would prevent us from holding that [they] create\nindividual rights.” Id. at 1113-14 (quotation marks and cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n  Because § 30(A) also lacks “rights-creating” language and\n“any focus on individual entitlements,” and does not antici-\npate a judicially enforceable remedy, it shares the flaws that\nPrice identified as fatal to the sections of the Housing and\nCommunity Development Act that we held to be unenforce-\nable.\n\n                               E\n\n   Our conclusion also accords with the First Circuit’s analy-\nsis of the text of § 30(A) in Long Term Care. Although that\ncase was concerned only with Medicaid providers, its reason-\ning applies also to recipients. The First Circuit noted that\n§ 30(A) “has . . . broad[ ] coverage, sets forth general objec-\ntives, and mentions no category of entity or person specially\nprotected” and “has no ‘rights creating language’ and identi-\nfies no discrete class of beneficiaries — two touchstones in\nGonzaga’s analysis and of those earlier cases on which Gon-\nzaga chose to build.” Long Term Care, 362 F.3d at 56-57\n(citations omitted). Instead, “[t]he provision focuses . . . upon\nthe state as the person regulated rather than individuals pro-\ntected, suggesting no intent to confer rights on a particular\nclass of persons.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThe court concluded that, “[s]ubsection (30)(A) presents the\nsame concern” that Justice Breyer identified in Gonzaga,\nnamely that “much of the statute’s key [substantive] language\nis broad and non-specific,” id. at 58 (quoting Gonzaga, 536\nU.S. at 292 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment)) (alter-\nation in original), which suggests “that exclusive agency\nenforcement might fit the scheme better than a plethora of pri-\nvate actions threatening disparate outcomes.” Id.\n\n  We do not believe the Third Circuit case, Sabree v. Rich-\nman, 367 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2004), which held that “it [is] dif-\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8907\nficult, if not impossible, as a linguistic matter, to distinguish\nthe import of the relevant Title XIX language—‘A State plan\nmust provide’—from the ‘No person shall’ language of Titles\nVI and IX,” id. at 190, to be applicable to our analysis of\n§ 30(A). Sabree involved two sections of the Medicaid Act\nthat are prefaced by language very different from that which\nintroduces § 30(A). Those provisions specifically focus on\nentitlements available to “all eligible individuals” and “pro-\nvide . . . for making medical assistance available . . . to all\nindividuals” rather than on the “methods and procedures” by\nwhich a State can balance the often incompatible goals of “ef-\nficiency, economy, and quality of care” in the administration\nof Medicaid services. Compare 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and\n(a)(10) (emphases added) with 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).\nThe Third Circuit observed that the phrase “A State plan must\nprovide,” when read together with the individual focus of 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10), has an overall direction\nthat is similar to the individually focused Title VI and IX lan-\nguage approved by the Court in Gonzaga. Such language is\nalso notably absent from § 30(A).\n\n   Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) sets out a comprehensive\nlist of requirements that a state plan must meet, it does not\ndescribe every requirement in the same language. Some\nrequirements, such as those addressed in Sabree, focus on\nindividual recipients, while others are concerned with the pro-\ncedural administration of the Medicaid Act by the States and\nonly refer to recipients, if at all, in the aggregate. Section\n30(A) is one of the latter provisions; it is directly concerned\nwith the State as administrator and only indirectly with recipi-\nents and providers as beneficiaries of the administered ser-\nvices. Gonzaga made it clear that simply being the intended\nbeneficiary of a statute is not enough to demonstrate the inten-\ntional creation of an enforceable right.\n\n                               F\n\n  [6] After Gonzaga, there can be no doubt that, to satisfy the\nBlessing test, a plaintiff seeking redress under § 1983 must\n\f8908                        SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nassert the violation of an individually enforceable right con-\nferred specifically upon him, not merely a violation of federal\nlaw or the denial of a benefit or interest, no matter how unam-\nbiguously conferred. The text and structure of § 30(A) do not\npersuade us that Congress has, with a clear voice, intended to\ncreate an individual right that either Medicaid recipients or\nproviders would be able to enforce under § 1983. Because we\nhold that § 30(A) fails the first prong of the Blessing test, we\ndo not need to consider the second and third prongs.\n\n                                      III\n\n   Sanchez and the Providers also appeal the district court’s\norder granting the state officials’ summary judgment motion\nwith respect to the ADA and § 504 claims. They allege that\nCalifornia has failed to pursue HCBS waiver reimbursements\nunder Medicaid aggressively, which, they further allege,\ncould be used to set payment rates to community-based ser-\nvice providers at a level high enough to provide community-\nbased care for all developmentally disabled persons who\ndesire it. They request an injunction compelling the state offi-\ncials to increase payments to community-based service pro-\nviders to prevent what they characterize as the continuing,\nunnecessary segregation of developmentally disabled persons\nin institutions.\n\n                                      A\n\n   [7] Both the ADA and § 504 prohibit discrimination on the\nbasis of disability in the administration of a public program\nreceiving Federal funding. Because of the nearly identical lan-\nguage of 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct,6 and because the Sanchez appellants are “qualified\n  6\n   42 U.S.C. § 12132 (§ 202 of the ADA) provides, in part, that:\n      [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n      disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the ben-\n\f                          SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                           8909\nindividual[s] with a disability” within the meaning of both\nstatutes, for the purposes of this case we construe the two pro-\nvisions as co-extensive. Cf. Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181,\n184-85 (2002); Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th\nCir. 2002); Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 331-32 (3d Cir.\n1995).\n\n   [8] Regulations enacted pursuant to the ADA and § 504\nboth express a clear policy preference in favor of integrating\ndevelopmentally disabled persons into the community over\ninstitutional care: one § 504 regulation requires programs that\nreceive federal funding to “administer programs and activities\nin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qual-\nified handicapped persons,” 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) (2005); and\none of the ADA’s Title II regulations requires a public entity\nto “administer services, programs, and activities in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (2005).\nAgain, for the purposes of this appeal, we interpret these pro-\nvisions as co-extensive.\n\n                                     B\n\n   In granting the state officials’ motion for summary judg-\nment on Sanchez’s and the Providers’ ADA and § 504 claims,\nthe district court held that, drawing all reasonable inferences\nin favor of Sanchez and the Providers, they had failed to\n\n    efits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\n    be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n   29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) provides, in part,\nthat:\n    No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United\n    States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\n    excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\n    be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\n    receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .\n\f8910                   SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nestablish any material factual dispute with respect to three key\nissues, all of which were necessary elements of a prima facie\ncase for discrimination.\n\n   First, the court held that “[e]ven if unjustified institutional-\nization is occurring, [Sanchez and the Providers] have failed\nto show that an increase in wages and benefits for\ncommunity-based direct care workers would remedy the\nalleged violation.” Second, the court held that the relief pro-\nposed by Sanchez and the Providers is not a “reasonable mod-\nification” of California’s current policies and practices\nbecause the $1.4 billion of extra expenditure they request\nwould represent a forty percent increase in the State’s budget\nfor developmentally disabled services. Third, the court held\nthat California already has in place an acceptable plan for\ndeinstitutionalization, the disruption of which would involve\na fundamental alteration of the State’s current policies and\npractices in contravention of the Supreme Court’s instructions\nin Olmstead. If we uphold any one of these conclusions, then\nthe state officials must prevail.\n\n                                1\n\n   [9] In Olmstead, the Supreme Court interpreted Title II of\nthe ADA as forbidding the arbitrary segregation of the dis-\nabled in large state institutions. “Unjustified isolation,” the\nCourt held, “is properly regarded as discrimination based on\ndisability.” 527 U.S. at 597. However, the Court “recog-\nnize[d], as well, the States’ need to maintain a range of facili-\nties for the care and treatment of persons with divers mental\ndisabilities, and the States’ obligation to administer services\nwith an even hand.” Id. Justice Ginsburg, writing for a plural-\nity of the Court, elaborated on this balancing of integration\nwith competing policy and fiscal considerations, emphasizing\nthat “[t]he State’s responsibility, once it provides community-\nbased treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not\nboundless.” Id. at 603. A State is only required to modify its\ncurrent practices if the modifications necessary to satisfy the\n\f                           SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                           8911\nrequest for increased deinstitutionalization are reasonable and\ndo not fundamentally alter the nature of the State’s services\nor program. Id.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (2005) (“A public\nentity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, prac-\ntices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to\navoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the pub-\nlic entity can demonstrate that making the modifications\nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program,\nor activity.”).\n\n   [10] One state defense under the ADA, which was explic-\nitly approved by the Court,7 is the existence of a state plan for\ndeinstitutionalization (an “Olmstead Plan”). The Court held\nthat,\n\n      [i]f . . . the State were to demonstrate that it had a\n      comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing\n      qualified persons with mental disabilities in less\n      restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at\n      a reasonable pace not controlled by the State’s\n      endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated, the\n      reasonable-modifications standard would be met.\n\nId. at 605-06.\n\n  The district court concluded that California is currently\noperating an acceptable deinstitutionalization plan, which,\nunder Olmstead, should not be set aside or modified by the\ncourts.\n  7\n   We have held that, while “[t]he section of Justice Ginsburg’s opinion\ndiscussing the state’s fundamental alteration defense commanded only\nfour votes . . . [b]ecause it relied on narrower grounds than did Justice Ste-\nvens’ concurrence or Justice Kennedy’s concurrence, both of which\nreached the same result, Justice Ginsburg’s opinion controls.” Townsend\nv. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 519 n.3 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\f8912                  SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\n                               a\n\n  Under California law, all persons with developmental dis-\nabilities are entitled to free health care services. The Lanter-\nman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, Cal. Welf. &\nInst. Code, §§ 4500-4846, (the “Lanterman Act”) requires the\nState to provide “[a]n array of services and supports . . .\nwhich is sufficiently complete to meet the needs and choices\nof each person with developmental disabilities, regardless of\nage or degree of disability, and at each stage of life and to\nsupport their integration into the mainstream life of the com-\nmunity.” Id. § 4501. As described by the California Supreme\nCourt,\n\n    [t]he purpose of the statutory scheme is twofold: to\n    prevent or minimize the institutionalization of\n    developmentally disabled persons and their disloca-\n    tion from family and community, and to enable them\n    to approximate the pattern of everyday living of non-\n    disabled persons of the same age and to lead more\n    independent and productive lives in the community.\n\nAss’n for Retarded Citizens v. Dep’t of Developmental Servs.,\n696 P.2d 150, 152 (Cal. 1985) (“ARC”)(citations omitted).\nThe Lanterman Act gives DDS “jurisdiction over the execu-\ntion of the laws relating to the care, custody, and treatment of\ndevelopmentally disabled persons,” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code\n§ 4416, but DDS’s role “is basically limited to promoting the\ncost-effectiveness of the operations of [21 Regional Centers],\nand does not extend to the control of the manner in which\nthey provide services or in general operate their programs.”\nARC, 696 P.2d at 152. The Lanterman Act also established 21\nRegional Centers, independent, private non-profit community\nagencies under contract with the DDS, which coordinate ser-\nvices to “provide each developmentally disabled person with\nservices that enable him to live . . . in the community.” Id.\n\n   Through the Regional Centers, California provides care ser-\nvices for more than 180,000 developmentally disabled per-\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8913\nsons. Of these, approximately 3,800 live in one of seven large,\ncongregate institutions called Developmental Centers, which\nare located throughout the State and are operated by DDS.\nAlthough they are operated by DDS, it is the Regional Cen-\nters that determine if a consumer needs to be institutionalized\nin a Developmental Center and for how long. Regional Cen-\nters are required to develop an Individual Program Plan for\neach consumer. Once an individual plan is prepared, the\nresponsible Regional Center must review it annually and\nmodify it as necessary. An individual plan must include an\nassessment of the consumer’s capabilities and limitations, a\nstatement of time-limited objectives for improving his situa-\ntion, a schedule of the type and amount of services necessary\nto achieve these objectives, and a schedule of periodic review\nto ensure that the services have been provided and the objec-\ntives met.\n\n   The ninety-eight percent of developmentally disabled per-\nsons who receive care in the community do so either at Inter-\nmediate Care Facilities, which are licensed to provide 24-hour\nnursing care and are scattered throughout the State; Commu-\nnity Care Facilities, which provide 24-hour, non-medical,\ncommunity-based residential care for developmentally dis-\nabled persons in need of personal services, and supervision or\nassistance essential for self-protection; or through a variety of\nnon-residential day programs and residential support services\nfor developmentally disabled persons who live at home or in\nthe community. It is the Regional Centers that select and con-\ntract with these community based service providers, which\ninclude Family Home Agencies, Foster Family Agencies,\nIndependent Living Programs, Supported Living Services,\nand other support programs, such as vocational training, trans-\nportation, health care, respite services, community integration\ntraining, community activities support, adaptive skills train-\ning, behavior management, tutors, special education, recre-\nation therapy, counseling, infant development, and speech\npathology.\n\f8914                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\n   Care of developmentally disabled persons in these\ncommunity-based programs may be eligible for Medicaid\nreimbursement pursuant to the HCBS waiver program. How-\never, in order to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement, the\nrecipient must be a low income person and the services must\nalso be provided at a lower cost than if they were provided in\na state institution. For qualifying recipients using qualifying\nservices, Medicaid provides matching funds equal to approxi-\nmately half of the cost of those services.8\n\n   The number of places in the HCBS waiver program is\ncapped and a State must apply for any increases of the cap\nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nBecause of this, States often apply for, and receive, pre-\napproval for more places than they currently need. In 2002,\nCalifornia had more than 45,000 waiver places approved and\nreceived matching funds for approximately 35,000 registered\npersons. That cap has been approved to increase to approxi-\nmately 70,000 by October, 2005. Because Sanchez and the\nProviders have only identified, at most, 1,125 allegedly unjus-\ntifiably institutionalized persons, there would be no reason for\nCalifornia to increase the number of places in its HCBS\nwaiver program at this time and Sanchez and the Providers do\nnot explicitly request such an increase.\n\n                                    b\n\n  In the 1980s, the DDS and the Regional Centers developed\na program of Regional Resource Development Projects to\nenable the placement of more Developmental Center residents\n  8\n   Under the Lanterman Act, all developmentally disabled persons are\nentitled to services funded out of the State’s general funds. However, only\nseventy percent of these developmentally disabled persons qualify for\nMedicaid funding on the basis of financial need. In addition, many of the\ndevelopmentally disabled persons eligible for services under the Lanter-\nman Act do not have a level of impairment which would qualify them for\nmatching funds from the federal government under California’s HCBS\nwaiver program.\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                   8915\nin the community. The regional development projects assist\nthe Regional Centers in identifying the services that Develop-\nmental Center residents need to live in the community. The\nregional development projects maintain a database that indi-\ncates whether a Developmental Center resident is recom-\nmended by his individual plan (either in the short-term or as\na longer-term goal) to live in the community.\n\n   The DDS also utilizes a system of Community Placement\nPlans (“CPPs”) to move Developmental Center residents to\ncommunity residential settings. Community Placement Plans\nare individualized and reflect a partnership between the\nRegional Center, each individual and his family, the Develop-\nmental Center, and the Regional Resource Development Proj-\nect. Because many recipients require specialized services that\nmay be difficult to locate in some areas of California, part of\na Community Placement Plan often involves the Regional\nCenter enhancing and developing the local resources needed\nto move the consumer from a Developmental Center into the\ncommunity.\n\n   Despite the comprehensive and accommodating nature of\nCalifornia’s deinstitutionalization practices, barriers to indi-\nvidual community placement remain. One common barrier is\nthe opposition of an individual’s family to community place-\nment. Although a family cannot veto a decision by the\nRegional Center to place a family member in the community,\nfamily involvement is often crucial in making a successful\nplacement. Many current Developmental Center residents also\nexhibit complex and difficult behaviors, including self-\ninjurious or aggressive behavior, that make community place-\nment difficult, and many have serious and life-threatening\nmedical conditions requiring 24-hour nursing care. Therefore,\nfor the developmentally disabled that still reside in Develop-\nmental Centers, placement in the community can be a very\nchallenging process.\n\n  Despite these obstacles, California successfully reduced the\npercentage of developmentally disabled persons residing in\n\f8916                   SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nDevelopmental Centers from six percent of the developmen-\ntally disabled population to two percent over the last decade.\nThis success is due in part to the fact that the State’s spending\non community-based care increased significantly over that\nsame period. The 2002/2003 CPP program allocated funding\nas high as $286,000 for the first year that a developmentally\ndisabled person moves into the community. After the first\nyear, the budget provided for an average of $102,000 per per-\nson to maintain the community placement. That budget repre-\nsented an increase in total CPP funding of over sixty percent.\nFinally, and most significantly, § 4669.2 of the Lanterman\nAct authorizes DDS to bypass other restrictions to fund pro-\nposals for special projects. This means that DDS is authorized\nto fund certain services, such as those provided under the lat-\nest iteration of the CPP program, outside the existing rate\nstructure. DDS has used this authority to fund services that\nencourage deinstitutionalization at much higher rates than in\nthe recent past.\n\n   Sanchez and the Providers argue that, although California\nhas achieved significant success moving institutionalized per-\nsons into the community, in recent years the rate of commu-\nnity placement has slowed. Sanchez and the Providers have\nshown that for the three years prior to the district court’s deci-\nsion, the number of admissions to Developmental Centers was\nactually greater than the number of discharges, although the\noverall residential population declined, in part due to the natu-\nral deaths of residents. However, the record supports the dis-\ntrict court’s finding that this recent decline in the rate of\ncommunity placements has been due to the fact that those per-\nsons with the least severe disabilities or with the best pros-\npects for integration into the community were\ndeinstitutionalized first. Those who remain in Developmental\nCenters have, on average, more, and more severe, disabilities\nand face higher barriers to deinstitutionalization, including\nfamily or personal opposition. The 2% of developmentally\ndisabled persons who still reside in Developmental Centers\nare more than four times more likely to have serious medical\n\f                          SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                         8917\nproblems, more than six times more likely to have severe\nbehavior problems, and 69% of current residents are among\nthe top 10% of all persons with the most acute levels of retar-\ndation. In addition, since 1998, the number of persons admit-\nted to Developmental Centers pursuant to court orders finding\nthem incompetent to stand trial (so called “forensic” admit-\ntances) has increased dramatically.9\n\n                                    2\n\n   The district court concluded that California’s commitment\nto the deinstitutionalization of those Developmental Center\nresidents for whom community integration is desirable,\nachievable and unopposed, is genuine, comprehensive and\nreasonable. This conclusion was based on evidence from the\nrecord, which showed that “[o]verall, California’s expendi-\ntures for individuals in community settings increased 196%\n[between 1991 and 2001], while caseload . . . increased fifty-\nfive percent in the same period,” that California has applied\nfor increased places under the HCBS waiver program, and\nthat, “[between 1996 and 2000], California reduced its institu-\ntion population by twenty percent.” DDS has also budgeted to\ndevelop 42 new Community Care Facilities and ten new Inter-\nmediate Care Facilities, and anticipates a reduction in institu-\ntionalization that would allow it to close at least one\nDevelopmental Center by 2007. We are satisfied, therefore,\nthat the district court’s conclusion that California’s “plan is\ncomprehensive, effective, and moving at a reasonable pace,”\nis supported by the record.\n\n                                    3\n\n  In Olmstead, the Court recognized that a State must have\nsufficient leeway “[t]o maintain a range of facilities and to\n  9\n   The district court noted that, “[o]f the 436 people admitted into Devel-\nopmental Centers since January, 1999, almost forty percent were commit-\nted by a court.”\n\f8918                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nadminister services with an even hand,” 527 U.S. at 605, and\nthat courts should be sympathetic to fundamental alteration\ndefenses against proposed modifications to state services and\nprograms for care of the disabled.10 Id.; see also Townsend,\n328 F.3d at 520.\n\n   [11] Concomitant with this leeway is a recognition that,\nwhen there is evidence that a State has in place a comprehen-\nsive deinstitutionalization scheme, which, in light of existing\nbudgetary constraints and the competing demands of other\nservices that the State provides, including the maintenance of\ninstitutional care facilities, see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597, is\n“effectively working,” id. at 605, the courts will not tinker\nwith that scheme. Olmstead does not require the immediate,\nstate-wide deinstutionalization of all eligible developmentally\ndisabled persons, nor that a State’s plan be always and in all\ncases successful. Id. at 606 (“It is reasonable for the State to\nask someone to wait until a community placement is avail-\nable.”) (endorsing position of State of Georgia). The record\nsupports the district court’s finding that California has a suc-\ncessful record of personalized evaluations leading to a reason-\nable rate of deinstutionalization and, moreover, that California\nhas undertaken to continue and to increase its efforts to place\ncurrent residents of Developmental Centers into the commu-\n  10\n     Olmstead also specifically disapproved two methods of analyzing\nwhether a requested modification is financially reasonable, or whether it\namounts to a “fundamental alteration” of a State’s services. First, it held\nthat measuring the cost of placing one or two disabled people in the com-\nmunity against the entirety of the State’s budget for treatment of that dis-\nability is inappropriate because the requested relief will almost always\nappear to be a reasonable modification. 527 U.S. at 603-604. Second, the\nCourt held that it was not appropriate merely to compare the cost of insti-\ntutionalization against the cost of community-based services, because that\ncomparison would not account for the State’s financial obligation to con-\ntinue to operate partially full institutions with fixed overhead costs. Id. at\n604 n.15. Even if a community-based placement would be less costly than\nan institutional placement for a specific individual, the State must still fac-\ntor into its overall budget the fixed cost of maintaining some necessary\nnumber of state institutions.\n\f                     SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                  8919\nnity when such placement is feasible. Sanchez’s and the Pro-\nviders’ requested relief would require us to disrupt this\nworking plan and to restrict impermissibly the leeway that\nCalifornia is permitted in its operation of developmentally\ndisabled services under Olmstead.\n\n                             IV\n\n   Congress did not unambiguously create an individually\nenforceable right in § 30(A) that would be remediable under\n§ 1983 either by recipients or providers of Medicaid services.\nFurthermore, Sanchez’s and the Providers’ requested relief\nunder Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nwould require the “fundamental alteration” of a comprehen-\nsive, working plan for deinstitutionalization in contravention\nof Olmstead.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f",

We are also asked to decide, separately, whether\nthe State of California has unlawfully discriminated by alleg-\nedly paying community-based service providers lower wages\nand benefits than it pays employees in state institutions.\n\n                              I\n\n  In May, 2000, seven named plaintiffs representing a class\nof developmentally disabled individuals, and six organiza-\n\f                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                     8893\ntions that advocate for, or provide community-based services\nto, the developmentally disabled, brought this action against\nCalifornia officials who manage and administer various state\nprograms for the developmentally disabled.\n\n   The class (collectively referred to by reference to the first\nnamed plaintiff as “Sanchez”) consists of those individuals\nwho would be capable of living in the community with prop-\nerly funded support services but who now live in, or are at\nrisk of living in, state institutions because community-based\nservices are inadequately funded. All members of the class are\nentitled to services under Title XIX of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (the “Medicaid Act”), and are\n“qualified individual[s] with a disability” under § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act (“§ 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and under\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12131-12134 (the “ADA”).\n\n   The organizational plaintiffs (the “Providers”) are not part\nof the class, but receive reimbursement from the State of Cali-\nfornia under the Medicaid Act for providing services to the\ndevelopmentally disabled.\n\n   The state officials are, respectively, officials of California’s\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Department of\nHealth Services, Department of Developmental Services\n(“DDS”) and Department of Finance. These departments\nadminister and oversee services funded, in part, through the\nMedicaid Act. Generally, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services ensures that the services of the other depart-\nments are provided in compliance with state and federal law;\nthe Department of Health Services directs, organizes and\nadministers California’s medical assistance programs, includ-\ning Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program; DDS directs,\norganizes and administers California’s developmental disabil-\nities services program; and the Department of Finance over-\nsees all of the State’s financial and business policies,\nincluding health care funding.\n\f8894                         SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\n                                       A\n\n   Under the Medicaid Act, the federal government distributes\nfunds to participating states to help them provide health care\nservices for the poor and needy. Because California accepts\nMedicaid funds, it must administer its state Medicaid pro-\ngram, Medi-Cal, in compliance with a state plan that has been\npre-approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices. The Medicaid Act sets out the requirements for a\nstate plan at 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(1)-(65).\n\n   In 1981, in response to the fact that a disproportionate per-\ncentage of Medicaid resources were being used for long-term\ninstitutional care and studies showing that many persons\nresiding in Medicaid-funded institutions would be capable of\nliving at home or in the community if additional support ser-\nvices were available, Congress authorized the Home and\nCommunity Based Services (“HCBS”) waiver program. The\nHCBS program allows a variety of noninstitutional care\noptions for persons who would otherwise be eligible for Med-\nicaid benefits in an institution, but who would prefer to live\nat home or in the community.1 To obtain a HCBS waiver for\na qualified person, the State must certify that the cost of plac-\ning that individual through the waiver program will be less\nthan or equal to the cost of his care in an institution.

Applying the Supreme Court’s guidance in\nGonzaga, the district court concluded that neither Sanchez nor\nthe Providers could bring suit under § 1983 for a violation of\n§ 30(A).\n\n  Sanchez and the Providers timely appeal from the district\ncourt’s adverse decisions with respect to both their § 30(A)\nand their ADA and § 504 claims.\n\n                                     II\n\n   Both Sanchez and the Providers claim that § 30(A) creates\nan individual right enforceable by them under § 1983. Their\ninterests, however, though similar, are not congruent. San-\nchez’s claim requires us to decide whether § 30(A) creates a\nprivate right of action for recipients of Medicaid funding; the\nProviders’ claim requires us to decide the same question with\nrespect to providers of Medicaid services. Both claims require\nus to consider the current state of the Supreme Court’s private\nright of action and § 1983 jurisprudence.\n  2\n    Gonzaga involved an alleged violation of the Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, which\nprohibits “the federal funding of educational institutions that have a policy\nor practice of releasing education records to unauthorized persons.” 536\nU.S. at 276.

Pennhurst\nestablished that the remedy announced in Thiboutot was to be\napplied sparingly and only to statutes in which Congress\n“speak[s] with a clear voice,” and “unambiguously” creates a\n“right[ ] secured by the laws of the United States.” Id. at 17,\n28 (quotation marks omitted). The Court also advised that the\nidentification of a substantive right embodied in a statute was\nonly the first of at least two steps that must be considered\nwhen analyzing whether that right is enforceable under\n§ 1983. Id. at 28 n.21 (“Because we conclude that § 6010 con-\nfers no substantive rights, we need not reach the question\nwhether there is a private cause of action under that section\nor under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce those rights.”) (empha-\nsis added).\n\n   Ten years later, in Wilder v.

This anomalous decision appeared to mark a sud-\nden expansion in the Court’s § 1983 jurisprudence.

Blessing requires a court to con-\nsider three factors: (1) “Congress must have intended that the\nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff,” id. at 340-41; (2)\n“the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly pro-\ntected by the statute is not so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its\nenforcement would strain judicial competence,” id. at 340;\nand (3) “the statute must ambiguously impose a binding obli-\ngation on the states. In other words, the provision giving rise\nto the asserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than\nprecatory terms.” Id. at 341. Somewhat confusingly, the first\nBlessing factor addressed whether or not the plaintiff receives\nan intended “benefit” from the statute, whereas the second\nfactor referred not to a “benefit” but to a “right.” In Gonzaga,\nthe Court resolved this inconsistency.\n\n   [2] The Court first acknowledged that “[s]ome language in\nour opinions might be read to suggest that something less than\nan unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by § 1983.”\nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282 (referring specifically to the Bless-\ning test). Correcting this misperception, the Court announced\nthat\n\n      [w]e now reject the notion that our cases permit any-\n      thing short of an unambiguously conferred right to\n  3\n    Justice Stevens, writing in dissent in Gonzaga, even suggested that the\nreasoning in Wilder is so out of step with the Court’s holding in Gonzaga\nthat it has been effectively overruled. Id. at 300 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning) (“[Imposing the implied right of action framework upon the § 1983\ninquiry] sub silentio overrules cases such as Wright and Wilder.

And as we are bound to follow the Court’s holdings in\nBlessing and Gonzaga, which followed the enactment of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1320a-2, this provision does not disturb the general framework that we\n—and the district court in this case—have used to analyze private rights\nof action under § 1983.\n\f                      SANCHEZ v.

Pro-\nviders such as pharmacies do not have a private right of action\nunder subsection (30)(A).”). With the First Circuit’s example\nin mind, we turn to the language of § 30(A) to determine if\nit unambiguously manifests Congressional intent to create\nindividual rights, whether for Medicaid recipients or provid-\ners, remediable under § 1983.\n\n                               C\n\n   In contrast to the language of Title VI and Title IX, there\nis nothing in the text of § 30(A) that unmistakably focuses on\nrecipients or providers as individuals. Moreover, the flexible,\nadministrative standards embodied in the statute do not reflect\na Congressional intent to provide a private remedy for their\nviolation.\n\n                               1\n\n   [4] In Gonzaga, the Supreme Court instructed that, when a\n“provision focuse[s] on ‘the aggregate services provided by\nthe State,’ rather than ‘the needs of any particular person,’ it\nconfer[s] no individual rights and thus [cannot] be enforced\nby § 1983.” Id. at 282 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340).\nLike the statute under review in Gonzaga, § 30(A) also has an\naggregate focus, rather than an individual focus that would be\nevidence of an intent to confer an individually enforceable\nright. The statute speaks not of any individual’s right but of\nthe State’s obligation to develop “methods and procedures”\nfor providing services generally. Indeed, the only reference in\n§ 30(A) to recipients of Medicaid services is in the aggregate,\nas members of “the general population in the geographic\narea.” A statutory provision that refers to the individual only\nin the context of describing the necessity of developing state-\nwide policies and procedures does not reflect a clear Congres-\nsional intent to create a private right of action.\n\f                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8903\n   The text does at least refer explicitly to Medicaid providers,\nbut as a means to an administrative end rather than as individ-\nual beneficiaries of the statute. The State is directed to “pro-\nvide methods and procedures . . . sufficient to enlist enough\nproviders so that care and services are available under the\nplan at least to the extent that such care and services are avail-\nable to the general population in the geographic area.” Under\n§ 30(A), providers are to be “enlisted” as subordinate partners\nin the administration of Medicaid services. They may cer-\ntainly benefit from their relationship with the State, but they\nare, at best, indirect beneficiaries and it would strain common\nsense to read § 30(A) as creating a “right” enforceable by\nthem. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 (“For a statute to create\nsuch private rights, its text must be phrased in terms of the\npersons benefitted.”).\n\n                                2\n\n   Far from focusing on the rights of a specific class of benefi-\nciaries, § 30(A) is concerned with a number of competing\ninterests. It requires a State to “provide such methods and pro-\ncedures relating to . . . care and services . . . as may be neces-\nsary to . . . assure that payments are consistent with\nefficiency, economy, and quality of care.” The most efficient\nand economical system of providing care may be one that\nbenefits taxpayers to the detriment of medical providers and\nrecipients; likewise, the provision of “quality” care—\nwhatever standard may be implied by such a nebulous term—\nis likely to conflict with the goals of efficiency and economy.\nThe tension between these statutory objectives supports the\nconclusion that § 30(A) is concerned with overall methodol-\nogy rather than conferring individually enforceable rights on\nindividual Medicaid recipients.\n\n  In Gonzaga, Justice Breyer observed that the “broad and\nnonspecific” language of FERPA indicated that “Congress\nmay well have wanted . . . to achieve the expertise, unifor-\nmity, wide-spread consultation, and resulting administrative\n\f8904                  SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nguidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking and to\navoid the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and\nmisincentives that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate\napplication of the statute in a private action for damages.” 536\nU.S. at 292 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). The lan-\nguage of § 30(A) is similarly ill-suited to judicial remedy; the\ninterpretation and balancing of the statute’s indeterminate and\ncompeting goals would involve making policy decisions for\nwhich this court has little expertise and even less authority.\n\n                               3\n\n   [5] The text and structure of § 30(A) simply do not focus\non an individual recipient’s or provider’s right to benefits, nor\nis the “broad and diffuse” language of the statute amenable to\njudicial remedy. We conclude, therefore, that Congress has\nnot spoken with an unambiguous, clear voice that would put\na State on notice that Medicaid recipients or providers are\nable to compel state action under § 1983.\n\n                               D\n\n   This conclusion follows our discussion of the impact of\nGonzaga in Price v. City of Stockton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788532\"><a href=\"/opinion/788532/richard-price-dwain-henderson-lucinda-watson-george-baker-lance-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n2004). In that case, former tenants of low-income hotels and\na nonprofit organization involved in assisting the homeless\nsued the City of Stockton, alleging that the closing of residen-\ntial hotels for health and safety reasons violated federal and\nstate laws, including the Housing and Community Develop-\nment Act. We were asked to decide whether the plaintiffs had\na private right of action to enforce the relevant provisions of\nthe act.\n\n  We began by observing that, after Gonzaga, “to create\nenforceable rights [such as would satisfy the first prong of the\nBlessing test] the language of the statute must focus on indi-\nvidual entitlement to benefits rather than the aggregate or sys-\ntemwide policies and practices of a regulated entity.” Price,\n\f                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                     8905\n390 F.3d at 1110. Applying this rule, we noted that “[f]irst\nand foremost, Section 104(k) mandates that ‘each grantee\nshall provide for reasonable benefits to any person involuntar-\nily and permanently displaced as a result of the use of assis-\ntance received under this chapter to acquire or substantially\nrehabilitate property.’ ” Id. (emphasis added). From this lan-\nguage, we concluded that the section “is ‘phrased with an\nunmistakable focus on the benefited class’ [and] does not\nspeak ‘only in terms of institutional policy and practice,’ . . .\nbut rather requires that benefits be provided to particular per-\nsons displaced by federally funded redevelopment activities,”\nand, therefore, it “evinces a clear intent to create a federal\nright.” Id. at 1111 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288) (cita-\ntions omitted).\n\n   We also held that the “ ‘reasonable benefits’ to which dis-\nplaced persons unquestionably are entitled under Section\n104(k),” were not “too vague for judicial enforcement.” Id.\nBecause related statutory provisions and regulations “enumer-\nate[d] the monetary benefits to which displaced persons of\nlow and moderate income are entitled, ‘including reimburse-\nment for actual and reasonable moving expenses, security\ndeposits, credit checks, and other moving-related expenses,\nincluding any interim living costs,’ ” id. at 1112, we con-\ncluded that the terms of the statute anticipated a clear,\nenforceable remedy for violations of the rights enumerated in\nthe statute. Id. at 1112, 1114.\n\n   In contrast, we held that “other provisions of [the statute\nunder consideration] do not share Section 104(k)’s focus on\nindividual benefits,” id. at 1113, and, instead, “are directed to\ngovernmental agencies . . . and are phrased in aggregate\nterms, without reference to individual displaced persons.” Id.\n(emphasis added, quotation marks omitted). We concluded\nthat, “[i]n consideration of this aggregate focus, we hold that\nthe requirements of [these other sections of the statute] do not\n. . . create individual rights directly: . . . the lack of ‘rights-\ncreating’ language and the absence of any focus on individual\n\f8906                  SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nentitlements, would prevent us from holding that [they] create\nindividual rights.” Id. at 1113-14 (quotation marks and cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n  Because § 30(A) also lacks “rights-creating” language and\n“any focus on individual entitlements,” and does not antici-\npate a judicially enforceable remedy, it shares the flaws that\nPrice identified as fatal to the sections of the Housing and\nCommunity Development Act that we held to be unenforce-\nable.\n\n                               E\n\n   Our conclusion also accords with the First Circuit’s analy-\nsis of the text of § 30(A) in Long Term Care. Although that\ncase was concerned only with Medicaid providers, its reason-\ning applies also to recipients. The First Circuit noted that\n§ 30(A) “has . . . broad[ ] coverage, sets forth general objec-\ntives, and mentions no category of entity or person specially\nprotected” and “has no ‘rights creating language’ and identi-\nfies no discrete class of beneficiaries — two touchstones in\nGonzaga’s analysis and of those earlier cases on which Gon-\nzaga chose to build.” Long Term Care, 362 F.3d at 56-57\n(citations omitted). Instead, “[t]he provision focuses . . . upon\nthe state as the person regulated rather than individuals pro-\ntected, suggesting no intent to confer rights on a particular\nclass of persons.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThe court concluded that, “[s]ubsection (30)(A) presents the\nsame concern” that Justice Breyer identified in Gonzaga,\nnamely that “much of the statute’s key [substantive] language\nis broad and non-specific,” id. at 58 (quoting Gonzaga, 536\nU.S. at 292 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment)) (alter-\nation in original), which suggests “that exclusive agency\nenforcement might fit the scheme better than a plethora of pri-\nvate actions threatening disparate outcomes.” Id.\n\n  We do not believe the Third Circuit case, Sabree v. Rich-\nman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786074\"><a href=\"/opinion/786074/hassan-sabree-by-his-mother-and-next-friend-hana-sabree-catherine-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2004), which held that “it [is] dif-\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8907\nficult, if not impossible, as a linguistic matter, to distinguish\nthe import of the relevant Title XIX language—‘A State plan\nmust provide’—from the ‘No person shall’ language of Titles\nVI and IX,” id. at 190, to be applicable to our analysis of\n§ 30(A). Sabree involved two sections of the Medicaid Act\nthat are prefaced by language very different from that which\nintroduces § 30(A). Those provisions specifically focus on\nentitlements available to “all eligible individuals” and “pro-\nvide . . . for making medical assistance available . . . to all\nindividuals” rather than on the “methods and procedures” by\nwhich a State can balance the often incompatible goals of “ef-\nficiency, economy, and quality of care” in the administration\nof Medicaid services. Compare 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and\n(a)(10) (emphases added) with 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).\nThe Third Circuit observed that the phrase “A State plan must\nprovide,” when read together with the individual focus of 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10), has an overall direction\nthat is similar to the individually focused Title VI and IX lan-\nguage approved by the Court in Gonzaga. Such language is\nalso notably absent from § 30(A).\n\n   Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a) sets out a comprehensive\nlist of requirements that a state plan must meet, it does not\ndescribe every requirement in the same language. Some\nrequirements, such as those addressed in Sabree, focus on\nindividual recipients, while others are concerned with the pro-\ncedural administration of the Medicaid Act by the States and\nonly refer to recipients, if at all, in the aggregate. Section\n30(A) is one of the latter provisions; it is directly concerned\nwith the State as administrator and only indirectly with recipi-\nents and providers as beneficiaries of the administered ser-\nvices. Gonzaga made it clear that simply being the intended\nbeneficiary of a statute is not enough to demonstrate the inten-\ntional creation of an enforceable right.\n\n                               F\n\n  [6] After Gonzaga, there can be no doubt that, to satisfy the\nBlessing test, a plaintiff seeking redress under § 1983 must\n\f8908                        SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nassert the violation of an individually enforceable right con-\nferred specifically upon him, not merely a violation of federal\nlaw or the denial of a benefit or interest, no matter how unam-\nbiguously conferred. The text and structure of § 30(A) do not\npersuade us that Congress has, with a clear voice, intended to\ncreate an individual right that either Medicaid recipients or\nproviders would be able to enforce under § 1983. Because we\nhold that § 30(A) fails the first prong of the Blessing test, we\ndo not need to consider the second and third prongs.\n\n                                      III\n\n   Sanchez and the Providers also appeal the district court’s\norder granting the state officials’ summary judgment motion\nwith respect to the ADA and § 504 claims. They allege that\nCalifornia has failed to pursue HCBS waiver reimbursements\nunder Medicaid aggressively, which, they further allege,\ncould be used to set payment rates to community-based ser-\nvice providers at a level high enough to provide community-\nbased care for all developmentally disabled persons who\ndesire it. They request an injunction compelling the state offi-\ncials to increase payments to community-based service pro-\nviders to prevent what they characterize as the continuing,\nunnecessary segregation of developmentally disabled persons\nin institutions.\n\n                                      A\n\n   [7] Both the ADA and § 504 prohibit discrimination on the\nbasis of disability in the administration of a public program\nreceiving Federal funding.

JOHNSON\nestablish any material factual dispute with respect to three key\nissues, all of which were necessary elements of a prima facie\ncase for discrimination.\n\n   First, the court held that “[e]ven if unjustified institutional-\nization is occurring, [Sanchez and the Providers] have failed\nto show that an increase in wages and benefits for\ncommunity-based direct care workers would remedy the\nalleged violation.” Second, the court held that the relief pro-\nposed by Sanchez and the Providers is not a “reasonable mod-\nification” of California’s current policies and practices\nbecause the $1.4 billion of extra expenditure they request\nwould represent a forty percent increase in the State’s budget\nfor developmentally disabled services. Third, the court held\nthat California already has in place an acceptable plan for\ndeinstitutionalization, the disruption of which would involve\na fundamental alteration of the State’s current policies and\npractices in contravention of the Supreme Court’s instructions\nin Olmstead. If we uphold any one of these conclusions, then\nthe state officials must prevail.\n\n                                1\n\n   [9] In Olmstead, the Supreme Court interpreted Title II of\nthe ADA as forbidding the arbitrary segregation of the dis-\nabled in large state institutions. “Unjustified isolation,” the\nCourt held, “is properly regarded as discrimination based on\ndisability.” 527 U.S. at 597. However, the Court “recog-\nnize[d], as well, the States’ need to maintain a range of facili-\nties for the care and treatment of persons with divers mental\ndisabilities, and the States’ obligation to administer services\nwith an even hand.” Id. Justice Ginsburg, writing for a plural-\nity of the Court, elaborated on this balancing of integration\nwith competing policy and fiscal considerations, emphasizing\nthat “[t]he State’s responsibility, once it provides community-\nbased treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not\nboundless.” Id. at 603. A State is only required to modify its\ncurrent practices if the modifications necessary to satisfy the\n\f                           SANCHEZ v.

The Court held\nthat,\n\n      [i]f . . . the State were to demonstrate that it had a\n      comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing\n      qualified persons with mental disabilities in less\n      restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at\n      a reasonable pace not controlled by the State’s\n      endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated, the\n      reasonable-modifications standard would be met.\n\nId. at 605-06.\n\n  The district court concluded that California is currently\noperating an acceptable deinstitutionalization plan, which,\nunder Olmstead, should not be set aside or modified by the\ncourts.\n  7\n   We have held that, while “[t]he section of Justice Ginsburg’s opinion\ndiscussing the state’s fundamental alteration defense commanded only\nfour votes . . .

Welf. & Inst. Code\n§ 4416, but DDS’s role “is basically limited to promoting the\ncost-effectiveness of the operations of [21 Regional Centers],\nand does not extend to the control of the manner in which\nthey provide services or in general operate their programs.”\nARC, 696 P.2d at 152. The Lanterman Act also established 21\nRegional Centers, independent, private non-profit community\nagencies under contract with the DDS, which coordinate ser-\nvices to “provide each developmentally disabled person with\nservices that enable him to live . . . in the community.” Id.\n\n   Through the Regional Centers, California provides care ser-\nvices for more than 180,000 developmentally disabled per-\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                    8913\nsons. Of these, approximately 3,800 live in one of seven large,\ncongregate institutions called Developmental Centers, which\nare located throughout the State and are operated by DDS.\nAlthough they are operated by DDS, it is the Regional Cen-\nters that determine if a consumer needs to be institutionalized\nin a Developmental Center and for how long. Regional Cen-\nters are required to develop an Individual Program Plan for\neach consumer. Once an individual plan is prepared, the\nresponsible Regional Center must review it annually and\nmodify it as necessary. An individual plan must include an\nassessment of the consumer’s capabilities and limitations, a\nstatement of time-limited objectives for improving his situa-\ntion, a schedule of the type and amount of services necessary\nto achieve these objectives, and a schedule of periodic review\nto ensure that the services have been provided and the objec-\ntives met.\n\n   The ninety-eight percent of developmentally disabled per-\nsons who receive care in the community do so either at Inter-\nmediate Care Facilities, which are licensed to provide 24-hour\nnursing care and are scattered throughout the State; Commu-\nnity Care Facilities, which provide 24-hour, non-medical,\ncommunity-based residential care for developmentally dis-\nabled persons in need of personal services, and supervision or\nassistance essential for self-protection; or through a variety of\nnon-residential day programs and residential support services\nfor developmentally disabled persons who live at home or in\nthe community. It is the Regional Centers that select and con-\ntract with these community based service providers, which\ninclude Family Home Agencies, Foster Family Agencies,\nIndependent Living Programs, Supported Living Services,\nand other support programs, such as vocational training, trans-\nportation, health care, respite services, community integration\ntraining, community activities support, adaptive skills train-\ning, behavior management, tutors, special education, recre-\nation therapy, counseling, infant development, and speech\npathology.\n\f8914                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\n   Care of developmentally disabled persons in these\ncommunity-based programs may be eligible for Medicaid\nreimbursement pursuant to the HCBS waiver program. How-\never, in order to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement, the\nrecipient must be a low income person and the services must\nalso be provided at a lower cost than if they were provided in\na state institution. For qualifying recipients using qualifying\nservices, Medicaid provides matching funds equal to approxi-\nmately half of the cost of those services.8\n\n   The number of places in the HCBS waiver program is\ncapped and a State must apply for any increases of the cap\nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nBecause of this, States often apply for, and receive, pre-\napproval for more places than they currently need. In 2002,\nCalifornia had more than 45,000 waiver places approved and\nreceived matching funds for approximately 35,000 registered\npersons. That cap has been approved to increase to approxi-\nmately 70,000 by October, 2005. Because Sanchez and the\nProviders have only identified, at most, 1,125 allegedly unjus-\ntifiably institutionalized persons, there would be no reason for\nCalifornia to increase the number of places in its HCBS\nwaiver program at this time and Sanchez and the Providers do\nnot explicitly request such an increase.\n\n                                    b\n\n  In the 1980s, the DDS and the Regional Centers developed\na program of Regional Resource Development Projects to\nenable the placement of more Developmental Center residents\n  8\n   Under the Lanterman Act, all developmentally disabled persons are\nentitled to services funded out of the State’s general funds. However, only\nseventy percent of these developmentally disabled persons qualify for\nMedicaid funding on the basis of financial need. In addition, many of the\ndevelopmentally disabled persons eligible for services under the Lanter-\nman Act do not have a level of impairment which would qualify them for\nmatching funds from the federal government under California’s HCBS\nwaiver program.\n\f                      SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                   8915\nin the community. The regional development projects assist\nthe Regional Centers in identifying the services that Develop-\nmental Center residents need to live in the community. The\nregional development projects maintain a database that indi-\ncates whether a Developmental Center resident is recom-\nmended by his individual plan (either in the short-term or as\na longer-term goal) to live in the community.\n\n   The DDS also utilizes a system of Community Placement\nPlans (“CPPs”) to move Developmental Center residents to\ncommunity residential settings. Community Placement Plans\nare individualized and reflect a partnership between the\nRegional Center, each individual and his family, the Develop-\nmental Center, and the Regional Resource Development Proj-\nect. Because many recipients require specialized services that\nmay be difficult to locate in some areas of California, part of\na Community Placement Plan often involves the Regional\nCenter enhancing and developing the local resources needed\nto move the consumer from a Developmental Center into the\ncommunity.\n\n   Despite the comprehensive and accommodating nature of\nCalifornia’s deinstitutionalization practices, barriers to indi-\nvidual community placement remain. One common barrier is\nthe opposition of an individual’s family to community place-\nment. Although a family cannot veto a decision by the\nRegional Center to place a family member in the community,\nfamily involvement is often crucial in making a successful\nplacement. Many current Developmental Center residents also\nexhibit complex and difficult behaviors, including self-\ninjurious or aggressive behavior, that make community place-\nment difficult, and many have serious and life-threatening\nmedical conditions requiring 24-hour nursing care. Therefore,\nfor the developmentally disabled that still reside in Develop-\nmental Centers, placement in the community can be a very\nchallenging process.\n\n  Despite these obstacles, California successfully reduced the\npercentage of developmentally disabled persons residing in\n\f8916                   SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nDevelopmental Centers from six percent of the developmen-\ntally disabled population to two percent over the last decade.\nThis success is due in part to the fact that the State’s spending\non community-based care increased significantly over that\nsame period. The 2002/2003 CPP program allocated funding\nas high as $286,000 for the first year that a developmentally\ndisabled person moves into the community. After the first\nyear, the budget provided for an average of $102,000 per per-\nson to maintain the community placement. That budget repre-\nsented an increase in total CPP funding of over sixty percent.\nFinally, and most significantly, § 4669.2 of the Lanterman\nAct authorizes DDS to bypass other restrictions to fund pro-\nposals for special projects. This means that DDS is authorized\nto fund certain services, such as those provided under the lat-\nest iteration of the CPP program, outside the existing rate\nstructure. DDS has used this authority to fund services that\nencourage deinstitutionalization at much higher rates than in\nthe recent past.\n\n   Sanchez and the Providers argue that, although California\nhas achieved significant success moving institutionalized per-\nsons into the community, in recent years the rate of commu-\nnity placement has slowed. Sanchez and the Providers have\nshown that for the three years prior to the district court’s deci-\nsion, the number of admissions to Developmental Centers was\nactually greater than the number of discharges, although the\noverall residential population declined, in part due to the natu-\nral deaths of residents. However, the record supports the dis-\ntrict court’s finding that this recent decline in the rate of\ncommunity placements has been due to the fact that those per-\nsons with the least severe disabilities or with the best pros-\npects for integration into the community were\ndeinstitutionalized first. Those who remain in Developmental\nCenters have, on average, more, and more severe, disabilities\nand face higher barriers to deinstitutionalization, including\nfamily or personal opposition. The 2% of developmentally\ndisabled persons who still reside in Developmental Centers\nare more than four times more likely to have serious medical\n\f                          SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                         8917\nproblems, more than six times more likely to have severe\nbehavior problems, and 69% of current residents are among\nthe top 10% of all persons with the most acute levels of retar-\ndation. In addition, since 1998, the number of persons admit-\nted to Developmental Centers pursuant to court orders finding\nthem incompetent to stand trial (so called “forensic” admit-\ntances) has increased dramatically.9\n\n                                    2\n\n   The district court concluded that California’s commitment\nto the deinstitutionalization of those Developmental Center\nresidents for whom community integration is desirable,\nachievable and unopposed, is genuine, comprehensive and\nreasonable. This conclusion was based on evidence from the\nrecord, which showed that “[o]verall, California’s expendi-\ntures for individuals in community settings increased 196%\n[between 1991 and 2001], while caseload . . . increased fifty-\nfive percent in the same period,” that California has applied\nfor increased places under the HCBS waiver program, and\nthat, “[between 1996 and 2000], California reduced its institu-\ntion population by twenty percent.” DDS has also budgeted to\ndevelop 42 new Community Care Facilities and ten new Inter-\nmediate Care Facilities, and anticipates a reduction in institu-\ntionalization that would allow it to close at least one\nDevelopmental Center by 2007. We are satisfied, therefore,\nthat the district court’s conclusion that California’s “plan is\ncomprehensive, effective, and moving at a reasonable pace,”\nis supported by the record.\n\n                                    3\n\n  In Olmstead, the Court recognized that a State must have\nsufficient leeway “[t]o maintain a range of facilities and to\n  9\n   The district court noted that, “[o]f the 436 people admitted into Devel-\nopmental Centers since January, 1999, almost forty percent were commit-\nted by a court.”\n\f8918                       SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON\nadminister services with an even hand,” 527 U.S. at 605, and\nthat courts should be sympathetic to fundamental alteration\ndefenses against proposed modifications to state services and\nprograms for care of the disabled.10 Id.; see also Townsend,\n328 F.3d at 520.\n\n   [11] Concomitant with this leeway is a recognition that,\nwhen there is evidence that a State has in place a comprehen-\nsive deinstitutionalization scheme, which, in light of existing\nbudgetary constraints and the competing demands of other\nservices that the State provides, including the maintenance of\ninstitutional care facilities, see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597, is\n“effectively working,” id. at 605, the courts will not tinker\nwith that scheme. Olmstead does not require the immediate,\nstate-wide deinstutionalization of all eligible developmentally\ndisabled persons, nor that a State’s plan be always and in all\ncases successful. Id. at 606 (“It is reasonable for the State to\nask someone to wait until a community placement is avail-\nable.”) (endorsing position of State of Georgia). The record\nsupports the district court’s finding that California has a suc-\ncessful record of personalized evaluations leading to a reason-\nable rate of deinstutionalization and, moreover, that California\nhas undertaken to continue and to increase its efforts to place\ncurrent residents of Developmental Centers into the commu-\n  10\n     Olmstead also specifically disapproved two methods of analyzing\nwhether a requested modification is financially reasonable, or whether it\namounts to a “fundamental alteration” of a State’s services. First, it held\nthat measuring the cost of placing one or two disabled people in the com-\nmunity against the entirety of the State’s budget for treatment of that dis-\nability is inappropriate because the requested relief will almost always\nappear to be a reasonable modification. 527 U.S. at 603-604. Second, the\nCourt held that it was not appropriate merely to compare the cost of insti-\ntutionalization against the cost of community-based services, because that\ncomparison would not account for the State’s financial obligation to con-\ntinue to operate partially full institutions with fixed overhead costs. Id. at\n604 n.15. Even if a community-based placement would be less costly than\nan institutional placement for a specific individual, the State must still fac-\ntor into its overall budget the fixed cost of maintaining some necessary\nnumber of state institutions.\n\f                     SANCHEZ v. JOHNSON                  8919\nnity when such placement is feasible. Sanchez’s and the Pro-\nviders’ requested relief would require us to disrupt this\nworking plan and to restrict impermissibly the leeway that\nCalifornia is permitted in its operation of developmentally\ndisabled services under Olmstead.\n\n                             IV\n\n   Congress did not unambiguously create an individually\nenforceable right in § 30(A) that would be remediable under\n§ 1983 either by recipients or providers of Medicaid services.\nFurthermore, Sanchez’s and the Providers’ requested relief\nunder Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nwould require the “fundamental alteration” of a comprehen-\nsive, working plan for deinstitutionalization in contravention\nof Olmstead.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
