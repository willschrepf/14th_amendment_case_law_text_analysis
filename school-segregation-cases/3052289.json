The Providence Journal Company and Amanda\n\nMilkovits (collectively, the Journal or plaintiffs), seek review of an order granting summary\n\njudgment entered against them and in favor of the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, the\n\nRhode Island State Police, and Steven G. O’Donnell, in his capacity as the Commissioner of the\n\nRhode Island Department of Public Safety and Superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police\n\n(collectively, defendants). The Journal filed suit in Providence County Superior Court alleging\n\nviolations of Rhode Island’s Access to Public Records Act (APRA), G.L. 1956 chapter 2 of title\n\n38, after they unsuccessfully requested records from the Rhode Island State Police concerning an\n\ninvestigation of an underage drinking incident at property owned by the then-Governor, Lincoln\n\nChafee. On appeal, the Journal takes issue with the Superior Court’s determination that the\n\nrequested documents are not subject to public disclosure pursuant to the APRA. After careful\n\nconsideration of the submitted memoranda and oral arguments, we affirm the judgment of the\n\nSuperior Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -1-\n\f                                                  I\n\n                                         Facts and Travel\n\n       The travel of the case is easily sketched. On May 28, 2012, Caleb Chafee (Caleb), the\n\nson of then-Governor Lincoln Chafee, hosted a party on property owned by the then-Governor,\n\nduring which some underage attendees consumed alcohol. At some point, an underage female\n\nleft the party and, shortly thereafter, she was taken to a local hospital for alcohol-related illness.\n\nAs a result, the Rhode Island State Police went to the property 1 to conduct an investigation. This\n\ninvestigation resulted in the compilation of 186 pages of investigative documents, including\n\nwitness lists, witness statements, land evidence records, and narrative reports written by various\n\nofficers (collectively, the requested records). At the conclusion of the investigation, Caleb was\n\ncharged with the furnishing or procurement of alcoholic beverages for underage persons in\n\nviolation of G.L. 1956 § 3-8-11.1, to which he pled nolo contendere in Rhode Island District\n\nCourt on August 22, 2012, and received a $500 civil penalty. On March 13, 2013, a judge of the\n\nDistrict Court granted Caleb’s motion to expunge his record.\n\n       However, Caleb’s liability was not the only product of the police investigation. In an\n\neffort to gather further information about the incident, on June 21, 2012, Amanda Milkovits\n\n(Milkovits), a reporter for the Providence Journal Company, sent an email to Colonel Steven G.\n\nO’Donnell (Col. O’Donnell), in which she “request[ed] copies of state police reports regarding\n\nthe May 28 incident involving Caleb Chafee.” This email further stated: “This is a public\n\nreport, regarding the responses and actions of public employees. It’s in the public interest to\n\nknow how the situation was handled regarding the governor’s son—especially since the state\n\n\n\n1\n  The property at which the party occurred is located in Exeter, Rhode Island. It is notable that\nthe Rhode Island State Police responded because the Town of Exeter does not maintain its own\npolice force.\n                                                -2-\n\fpolice answer directly to the governor. This is a matter of transparency.” In a letter dated June\n\n25, 2012, the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety (the department) denied Milkovits’\n\nrequest for access to the documents. The purported reason for the denial was two-fold: (i) “the\n\nrequested records [were] exempt from disclosure at [that] time, due to an ongoing criminal\n\ninvestigation and/or prosecution”; and (ii) the records “could reasonably be expected to be an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy * * *.”\n\n          At some point, a state trooper revealed redacted copies of at least three of the requested\n\nrecords to a WPRO radio talk show host. 2 Apparently, this information suggested that Caleb\n\ndemanded that the underage female who was treated for alcohol-related illness be removed from\n\nthe premises and requested that no one call 911 until she was well away from the property.\n\n          On August 21, 2012, Milkovits sent another email to Col. O’Donnell in which she stated\n\nthat she was “following up on the charging of Caleb Chafee in the Memorial Day party.”\n\nMilkovits further indicated that “now that he’s being charged, I’d like a copy of the report.” In a\n\nletter dated August 29, 2012, the department again denied her request. As a reason for its denial,\n\nthe department provided that the requested records “are not considered public records under\n\nRhode Island law [because] * * * Rhode Island General Law § 38-2-2 excludes records\n\nidentifiable to an individual in any files and law enforcement records, the disclosure of which\n\ncould reasonably be expected to be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” This letter\n\nalso contained the following language: “[E]nclosed please find a copy of the summons issued in\n\nthis matter, as well as the violation complaint as filed with the Rhode Island District Court.\n\nThese records have been entered into the District Court file and are therefore publicly available.”\n\n\n\n\n2\n    This state trooper was charged administratively for revealing the material.\n                                                 -3-\n\f       By letter dated September 5, 2012, the Journal requested that the department reconsider\n\nits denial of the records request. 3 On September 10, 2012, the department stated that it had\n\nreconsidered its initial denial as requested, but its position had not changed; thus, it denied the\n\nJournal’s request for the same reasons as provided in its letter dated August 29, 2012. On\n\nSeptember 24, 2012, the Journal filed an appeal with Col. O’Donnell pursuant to § 38-2-8, which\n\nwas also denied.\n\n       Finding no relief through this preliminary out-of-court skirmishing, on October 22, 2012,\n\nthe Journal filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court, alleging violations of, inter\n\nalia, the APRA, the United States Constitution, and the Rhode Island Constitution. On March 5,\n\n2013, pursuant to the Journal’s request, defendants provided the Journal with a Vaughn index 4 of\n\neach item withheld by the government.\n\n       In due course, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In the Journal’s\n\nmotion, it argued that summary judgment should be granted because it was entitled to the\n\nrequested records pursuant to the APRA. In response, defendants argued that public disclosure\n\nof the requested records would be inconsistent with the District Court’s expungement order in\n\nCaleb’s case. The defendants also argued that the records were exempt from public disclosure\n\npursuant to the APRA, which deems not to be public “[a]ll records maintained by law\n\nenforcement agencies for criminal law enforcement and all records relating to the detection and\n\n3\n  In addition, this letter provided that it was to serve as “a new request, this time under the\nrecently amended [APRA] * * *, which became effective September 1, 2012, for all records\nrelating to Caleb Chafee * * * and the investigation which arose from occurrences at his home on\nMay 28, 2012 * * *.” Before us, both parties in their arguments rely on the APRA as amended\nin 2012.\n4\n  A “Vaughn index” is “[a] comprehensive list of all documents that the government wants to\nshield from disclosure in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation, each document being\naccompanied by a statement of justification for nondisclosure.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1788\n(10th ed. 2014). In the case at hand, the index contained a description of each withheld record\nand the number of pages contained in each item.\n                                               -4-\n\finvestigation of crime, * * * [where] the disclosure of the records or information * * * could\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]” Section 38-\n\n2-2(4)(D), as amended by P.L. 2012, ch. 482, § 1.\n\n       After conducting an in camera review of the documents, analyzing memoranda submitted\n\nby the parties, and hearing oral arguments, the hearing justice determined that the order of\n\nexpungement in Caleb’s case did not prevent the Journal from accessing the records if allowable\n\nunder the APRA.      However, the hearing justice determined that the Journal had failed to\n\n“demonstrate[] a belief by a reasonable person that alleged government impropriety might have\n\noccurred.” In addition, he determined that “disclosure would not advance the public interest”\n\nand “that the records are not reasonably segregable” because the documents make plain, even if\n\nredacted, that it was Caleb’s event that was being investigated.          Accordingly, he granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants and denied that of the Journal. The Journal timely\n\nappealed.\n\n                                                 II\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       Our standard of review in this case is multifaceted. This Court’s review of the grant of a\n\nmotion for summary judgment is familiar and well-settled: We review such a grant de novo,\n\n“apply[ing] the same standards and rules as did the motion justice.” Symonds ex rel. Symonds v.\n\nCity of Pawtucket, 126 A.3d 421, 424 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State, 81\n\nA.3d 1106, 1109 (R.I. 2014)). In so doing, “[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the nonmoving party.” Id. (quoting Narragansett Indian Tribe, 81 A.3d at 1109). “Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fand the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.”\n\nBeacon Mutual Insurance Co. v. Spino Brothers Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 648 (R.I. 2011) (quoting\n\nNational Refrigeration, Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co. of America, 947 A.2d 906, 909 (R.I.\n\n2008)).\n\n          Additionally, this Court conducts a de novo review of a trial justice’s ruling concerning\n\nthe interpretation of a statute. Twenty Eleven, LLC v. Botelho, 127 A.3d 897, 900 (R.I. 2015).\n\n“In matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act\n\nas intended by the Legislature.” Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I. 2001). “[W]hen the\n\nlanguage of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and\n\nmust give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Swain v. Estate of Tyre\n\nex rel. Reilly, 57 A.3d 283, 288 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844\n\n(R.I. 2009)). In so doing, however, “[we] will not construe a statute to reach an absurd result.”\n\nId. at 289 (quoting Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074, 1081 (R.I. 2009)). “Further, ‘[a] statute *\n\n* * may not be construed in a way that would * * * defeat the underlying purpose of the\n\nenactment.’” Id. (quoting Brennan v. Kirby, 529 A.2d 633, 637 (R.I. 1987)).\n\n          However, a trial justice’s determination in balancing the public interest in disclosure\n\nagainst the privacy interests at stake presents a mixed question of law and fact, and we accord\n\nsuch questions the same amount of deference that we provide to a trial justice’s findings of fact.\n\nSee Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 819 A.2d 651, 662 (R.I. 2003). “[W]e will\n\nnot overturn a trial justice’s findings of fact absent a showing that the trial justice overlooked or\n\nmisconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                 III\n\n                                             Discussion\n\n       In 1979, the General Assembly enacted the APRA in recognition that “[t]he public’s right\n\nto access to public records and the individual’s right to dignity and privacy are both * * *\n\nprinciples of the utmost importance in a free society.” Section 38-2-1, as enacted by P.L. 1979,\n\nch. 202, § 1. Thus, the General Assembly provided a two-fold function of the APRA: “The\n\npurpose of this chapter is to facilitate public access to public records. It is also the intent of this\n\nchapter to protect from disclosure information about particular individuals maintained in the files\n\nof public bodies when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\nId. In addition, “this Court has ‘long recognized that the underlying policy of the APRA favors\n\nthe free flow and disclosure of information to the public.’” In re New England Gas Co., 842\n\nA.2d 545, 551 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Sundlun, 616 A.2d 1131, 1134\n\n(R.I. 1992)).\n\n       In recognition of these competing purposes, the General Assembly carefully defined, on\n\nthe one hand, what is subject to public disclosure and, on the other, what is protected. See § 38-\n\n2-2. Specifically, to perform its purpose of “facilitat[ing] public access to public records[,]” the\n\nAPRA pronounces a general rule of disclosure, providing:\n\n              “Except as provided in § 38-2-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file\n       by any public body, whether or not those records are required by any law or by\n       any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person or entity shall\n       have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at such reasonable time as may\n       be determined by the custodian thereof.” Section 38-2-3(a).\n\nHowever, the exception provided in § 38-2-2(4) serves to curtail this general rule of disclosure\n\nby defining “public records” to include only certain records. These limitations illustrate the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fGeneral Assembly’s desire to “protect from disclosure information * * * when disclosure would\n\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Section 38-2-1.\n\n       Section 38-2-2(4) defines “public records,” in pertinent part, as, “all documents, papers,\n\nletters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, magnetic or other tapes,\n\nelectronic data processing records, computer stored data * * * or other material * * * made or\n\nreceived pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business\n\nby any agency.” However, the provision continues by providing that certain records “shall not\n\nbe deemed public.” Id. Among those records deemed to not be public, are:\n\n              “All records maintained by law enforcement agencies for criminal law\n       enforcement and all records relating to the detection and investigation of crime,\n       including those maintained on any individual or compiled in the course of a\n       criminal investigation by any law enforcement agency. Provided, however, such\n       records shall not be deemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the\n       records or information * * * could reasonably be expected to constitute an\n       unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]” G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(D)(c).\n\nIt is this provision—exempting from disclosure records that “could reasonably be expected to\n\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” id.—that forms the basis of this appeal. 5\n\n       Because the APRA mirrors the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, we\n\nlook to federal case law interpreting FOIA to assist in our interpretation of the APRA. See, e.g.,\n\nIn re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d at 551. Like the APRA, the FOIA provides for public\n\n5\n  In an effort to avoid the interpretation of the APRA entirely, the state contends that the fact\nCaleb’s records were expunged precludes their disclosure under the APRA. Specifically, the\nstate cites to G.L. 1956 chapter 1.3 of title 12, the general “Expungement of Criminal Records”\nstatute, which provides that, “[w]henever the records of any conviction and/or probation of an\nindividual for the commission of a crime have been expunged under the provisions of this\nchapter, any custodian of the records of conviction relating to that crime shall not disclose the\nexistence of the records upon inquiry from any source * * *,” subject to certain exceptions not\napplicable here. Section 12-1.3-4(c). However, it is unclear whether Caleb’s expungement was\ngranted under chapter 1.3 of title 12, or, rather, pursuant to another statute. Because we conclude\nthat the records should not be disclosed in accordance with the APRA and that Caleb’s privacy\ninterest is sufficient to preclude disclosure without consideration of the expungement, we need\nnot determine the effect of the expungement on the records at issue.\n                                               -8-\n\fdisclosure of records unless those records fall within one or more of the several exemptions. See\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 160 (2004). One such\n\nexemption, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C), “excuses from disclosure ‘records or information compiled\n\nfor law enforcement purposes’ if their production ‘could reasonably be expected to constitute an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.’” Favish, 541 U.S. at 160 (quoting 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(7)(C)).\n\n       In Favish, 541 U.S. at 171-75, the United States Supreme Court considered the\n\napplicability of this exemption to certain photographs depicting the condition of a decedent’s\n\nbody at the scene of death. In so doing, the Court stated that “[t]he term ‘unwarranted’ requires\n\nus to balance the * * * privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure.” Id. at 171. To\n\neffectuate this balance, the Court provided a two-step process by which a citizen must prove that\n\nit is entitled to disclosure of the records. Specifically, it provided that: “First, the citizen must\n\nshow that the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific\n\nthan having the information for its own sake. Second, the citizen must show the information is\n\nlikely to advance that interest. Otherwise, the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.” Id. at 172.\n\nIn our opinion, the framework that the Supreme Court sets forth in Favish is sound; thus, we\n\nfollow this example and adopt this scheme in our interpretation of the APRA.\n\n       As a threshold matter, we address the Journal’s contention that this Court’s adoption of\n\nthe interpretation of the FOIA in Favish would displace the burden that the APRA places upon\n\nthe public body to demonstrate that “the record in dispute can be properly withheld from public\n\ninspection.” Section 38-2-10. What the Journal fails to recognize in making this argument is\n\nthat the FOIA contains a nearly identical statutory provision. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)\n\n(granting the district court “jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fand to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant * *\n\n* and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action”). In Favish, 541 U.S. at 172, the Supreme\n\nCourt observed that “[t]o effect [the balance of privacy interest against the public interest in\n\ndisclosure] and to give practical meaning to the exemption, the usual rule that the citizen need\n\nnot offer a reason for requesting the information must be inapplicable.” We agree, and so we\n\nplace the same gloss upon the APRA.\n\n       We now proceed to the thrust of the Journal’s appeal. Here, the Journal seeks the\n\ninvestigatory files related to the facts underlying the charge of a private individual in hopes of\n\npotentially uncovering some hint of impropriety.          Like Favish, where the Court dealt with\n\n“photographic images and other data pertaining to an individual who died under mysterious\n\ncircumstances,” the justification most likely to satisfy the APRA’s public interest requirement “is\n\nthat the information is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials\n\nacted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.” Favish, 541 U.S.\n\nat 173. Of course, this standard would be toothless if disclosure were required based upon mere\n\nspeculation, without the need to provide some evidence of negligence or impropriety. See id. at\n\n174. Thus, we hold, in line with Favish, that:\n\n       “[W]here there is a privacy interest protected by [G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(D)(c)]\n       and the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted\n       negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties, the\n       requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure.\n       Rather, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a\n       reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.”\n       Favish, 541 U.S. at 174.\n\n       Before assessing whether the Journal presented any such evidence in this case, we pause\n\nto address the Journal’s contention that the standard presented in Favish, 541 U.S. at 174, is\n\ninapplicable to the case at hand. Specifically, it contends that this “governmental impropriety”\n\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\fstandard should apply only when the sole alleged public interest is government impropriety. See\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice, 746\n\nF.3d 1082, 1095 & n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (declining to apply the standard announced in Favish\n\nwhere no impropriety was alleged on the part of the FBI or the DOJ). It then asserts that it\n\nalleged two public interests in the case at hand:          (i) discovering potential government\n\nimpropriety; and (ii) disclosing to the public how the State Police investigated the Governor\n\nunder the circumstances. For our purposes, however, this is a distinction without a difference:\n\nthe Journal’s second alleged public interest amounts to nothing more than another way of\n\ndescribing the first. Put another way, the information that the Journal hopes to uncover under its\n\nsecond asserted public interest is, in fact, government impropriety. Thus, to accept the Journal’s\n\nargument that there are two public interests in the case at hand would allow parties to avoid the\n\nFavish standard merely by exercising creative semantics. We decline this invitation. We do not,\n\nhowever, foreclose the possibility that the Favish standard may be inapplicable where a party\n\nasserts an authentic secondary public interest. 6\n\n\n\n6\n  The Journal also contends that the public interest was increased by (i) “the fact that the State\nPolice were investigating a possible violation of such an important law [(the Social Host Law)]”;\nand (ii) “the close relationship under Rhode Island law between the State Police, the Governor,\nand his family * * *.” With regard to the public interest in viewing the implementation of the\nSocial Host Law, the Journal’s argument is unavailing. Any information provided by the\ninvestigatory documents in this isolated incident would provide facts in relation to just that—a\nsingle incident. The documents would not provide the public with any indication of how this law\nis enforced generally. See Hunt v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 972 F.2d 286, 288-89 (9th\nCir. 1992) (contrasting a FOIA request for a single investigatory file with requests for numerous\ndisciplinary files and concluding that “[t]he single file * * * will not shed any light on whether\nall such FBI investigations are comprehensive”). With regard to the close relationship between\nthe Governor and the State Police, we note that this appears to be yet another circuitous way of\ndescribing the “government impropriety” public interest. That is, the public interest in the\ncontents of the investigatory documents would flow from whether the State Police adequately\ninvestigated the then-Governor, or whether corners were cut. Further, such a relationship\nbetween the Governor and the State Police will be present in any investigation or interaction\ninvolving the two. Thus, if we were to allow this relationship to rise to the level of a significant\n                                                - 11 -\n\f       We now turn our analysis to whether the Journal has presented evidence that “the\n\ninformation is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted\n\nnegligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.” Favish, 541 U.S. at 173.\n\nIn conducting our review, we remain mindful that “there is a presumption of legitimacy accorded\n\nto the Government’s official conduct * * * [and] where the presumption is applicable, clear\n\nevidence is usually required to displace it.” Id. at 174. Even without the disclosure of the\n\ncontents of the sought after records, it is clear that the State Police performed a comprehensive\n\ninvestigation of Caleb’s violation of the Social Host Law.      Indeed, the volume of records\n\nrequested under the APRA illustrates that a thorough investigation was performed. The Vaughn\n\nindex (which was provided to the Journal) indicates that the investigation resulted in the\n\ncompilation of 186 pages of documents, including at least eighteen witness statements, seven\n\nnarrative documents from members of the State Police, incident reports, and land evidence\n\nrecords. In addition, the investigation resulted in charging Caleb under the Social Host Law.\n\nThe Journal has not pointed to a shred of evidence to suggest that “the investigative agency or\n\nother responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly,” id. at 173, other than to\n\nspeculate as to the mere possibility that some venality or irregularity may have occurred in the\n\ninvestigation due to the then-Governor’s position.     When the release of sensitive personal\n\ninformation is at stake and the alleged public interest is rooted in government wrongdoing, we do\n\nnot deal in potentialities—rather, the seeker of information must provide some evidence that\n\ngovernment negligence or impropriety was afoot. Because the Journal failed to provide any such\n\nevidence, the public interest can, at best, be characterized merely as an uncorroborated\n\n\n\npublic interest without proof of some impropriety, then nearly every investigation by the State\nPolice involving the Governor would be subject to disclosure as a matter of course. We decline\nto give the mere presence of a relationship such a pervasive effect.\n                                             - 12 -\n\fpossibility of governmental negligence or impropriety. Such a tenuous “public interest” is\n\ninsufficient to mandate disclosure under the Favish standard that we today adopt and thereby\n\nimbue upon the APRA.\n\n       While we conclude that the Journal failed to satisfy the Favish standard, we nonetheless\n\ncontinue our analysis (for the sake of completeness and to provide future guidance) to weigh the\n\nseemingly negligible public interests asserted by the Journal against the privacy interests at stake.\n\nThe parties vigorously dispute the proper valuation of the privacy interests in this case. The\n\nJournal contends that (i) Caleb’s privacy interest was substantially diminished because of the\n\npublicity that the incident received in the media and because he pled nolo contendere to violating\n\nthe Social Host Law; (ii) the then-Governor’s privacy interest was de minimis because his “status\n\nas a public official operates to reduce his cognizable interest in privacy” (quoting Citizens for\n\nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice, 846 F. Supp. 2d\n\n63, 71 (D.D.C. 2012)); and (iii) the identities of third-persons who provided witness statements\n\nwere “reasonably segregable” and, thus, could be redacted to prevent any invasion of privacy. 7\n\n       Turning first to Caleb, we place little stock in the Journal’s contention that his privacy\n\ninterest was significantly diminished because of the publicity that his charge for violating the\n\nSocial Host Law received. Notably, a copy of the summons and complaint were produced to the\n\nJournal, which confirmed the existence of a charge against him. While the media coverage may\n\nhave made known to the public the existence of the charge, it certainly did not reveal the intimate\n\ndetails underlying the charge. The privacy interest at stake flows not from the widespread\n\nknowledge of the fact that Caleb was charged, but, instead, from the information and personal\n\n\n\n7\n  Both parties agree that the third-party identities could be redacted and, thus, none of their\nprivacy interests are implicated by disclosure of the records. Accordingly, we do not consider\nthe third-party privacy interests for purposes of our analysis.\n                                               - 13 -\n\fdetails that may have been discovered in the police investigation. Moreover, while the charge\n\nwas, in fact, public, “the fact that ‘an event is not wholly private does not mean that an individual\n\nhas no interest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of the information.’” United States\n\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Commission For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 770 (1989)\n\n(quoting Rehnquist, Is an Expanded Right of Privacy Consistent with Fair and Effective Law\n\nEnforcement?, Nelson Timothy Stephens Lectures, University of Kansas Law School, pt. 1, p. 13\n\n(Sept. 26-27, 1974)). Therefore, we find the Journal’s argument in this regard unconvincing.\n\n       Similarly, we see no merit with regard to the Journal’s contention that Caleb is entitled to\n\nlesser privacy because he pled nolo contendere to violating the Social Host Law. While the plea\n\nmight lessen the privacy extended to the conviction, it does not do so with respect to the facts\n\nunderlying it. Indeed, in American Civil Liberties Union v. United States Department of Justice,\n\n655 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011), on which the Journal relies, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nprovided “that the disclosure of convictions and public pleas is at the lower end of the privacy\n\nspectrum.” However, the court in that case was dealing with only the disclosure of the fact of\n\nconviction, not the facts underlying the conviction or information provided in the investigation of\n\nthe crime. See id. at 8 (“It would disclose only information concerning a conviction or plea; it\n\nwould not disclose mere charges or arrests. It would disclose only information that has already\n\nbeen the subject of a public proceeding (either a trial or public guilty plea), rather than actions\n\n(like arrests) that may not have taken place in public.”). Thus, the Journal’s argument that\n\nCaleb’s privacy interest in the police investigative documents was diminished because he pled\n\nnolo contendere also lacks force. 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n  In addition, we note that the distinction between the existence of a plea and the facts underlying\nthe charges that gave rise to such a plea is further supported by practicality: it is a common\n                                               - 14 -\n\f        In the case of the documents developed by law enforcement in the investigation of a\n\nprivate individual, the privacy interest is considerable and should not be easily displaced absent a\n\nparticularly noteworthy public interest. See Reporters Commission for Freedom of Press, 489\n\nU.S. at 769, 771 (“We have * * * recognized the privacy interest in keeping personal facts away\n\nfrom the public eye. * * * The privacy interest in a rap sheet is substantial.”). As such, we are\n\nsatisfied that Caleb’s privacy interest is significant, 9 and, consequently, we cannot allow the\n\nJournal’s unsubstantiated assertion—pointing to the mere possibility that government\n\nimpropriety occurred in the investigation due to the then-Governor’s position—to mandate\n\ndisclosure of sensitive information. 10 Accordingly, we cannot conclude “that the trial justice\n\noverlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong,” Direct Action\n\nfor Rights and Equality, 819 A.2d at 662, in his balancing of Caleb’s privacy interest against the\n\npublic interests at issue.\n\n        At oral argument, the Journal posed the following question: “[I]s there a good reason the\n\npeople shouldn’t see what the state police did?” We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\nPursuant to the APRA, records need not be disclosed where such disclosure could create an\n\nunwarranted invasion of privacy—here, Caleb’s privacy interest created a barrier that the public\n\ninterests in disclosure as asserted by the Journal could not overcome.\n\n\n\n\ntactical move for a defendant to plead guilty or nolo contendere rather than take his chances in\ncourt, to avoid the exposure of unfavorable facts during a public trial.\n9\n  In view of Caleb’s considerable privacy interest that would be compromised if the investigative\ndocuments were released, we need not pin down the exact valuation of the privacy interest of the\nthen-Governor. That is, a disclosure of the records would constitute an unwarranted invasion of\nCaleb’s privacy; thus, the records may be withheld under the APRA regardless of the privacy\ninterests of the then-Governor.\n10\n   We note that redaction would be ineffective to reduce Caleb’s privacy interest in this case.\nGiven the media attention that the investigation of Caleb has received from its onset, the subject\nof any records would be abundantly clear, even if redacted.\n                                               - 15 -\n\f                                                IV\n\n                                          Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The Providence Journal Company and Amanda\n\nMilkovits (collectively, the Journal or plaintiffs), seek review of an order granting summary\n\njudgment entered against them and in favor of the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, the\n\nRhode Island State Police, and Steven G. O’Donnell, in his capacity as the Commissioner of the\n\nRhode Island Department of Public Safety and Superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police\n\n(collectively, defendants). The Journal filed suit in Providence County Superior Court alleging\n\nviolations of Rhode Island’s Access to Public Records Act (APRA), G.L. 1956 chapter 2 of title\n\n38, after they unsuccessfully requested records from the Rhode Island State Police concerning an\n\ninvestigation of an underage drinking incident at property owned by the then-Governor, Lincoln\n\nChafee. On appeal, the Journal takes issue with the Superior Court’s determination that the\n\nrequested documents are not subject to public disclosure pursuant to the APRA. After careful\n\nconsideration of the submitted memoranda and oral arguments, we affirm the judgment of the\n\nSuperior Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -1-\n\f                                                  I\n\n                                         Facts and Travel\n\n       The travel of the case is easily sketched. On May 28, 2012, Caleb Chafee (Caleb), the\n\nson of then-Governor Lincoln Chafee, hosted a party on property owned by the then-Governor,\n\nduring which some underage attendees consumed alcohol. At some point, an underage female\n\nleft the party and, shortly thereafter, she was taken to a local hospital for alcohol-related illness.\n\nAs a result, the Rhode Island State Police went to the property 1 to conduct an investigation. This\n\ninvestigation resulted in the compilation of 186 pages of investigative documents, including\n\nwitness lists, witness statements, land evidence records, and narrative reports written by various\n\nofficers (collectively, the requested records). At the conclusion of the investigation, Caleb was\n\ncharged with the furnishing or procurement of alcoholic beverages for underage persons in\n\nviolation of G.L. 1956 § 3-8-11.1, to which he pled nolo contendere in Rhode Island District\n\nCourt on August 22, 2012, and received a $500 civil penalty. On March 13, 2013, a judge of the\n\nDistrict Court granted Caleb’s motion to expunge his record.\n\n       However, Caleb’s liability was not the only product of the police investigation. In an\n\neffort to gather further information about the incident, on June 21, 2012, Amanda Milkovits\n\n(Milkovits), a reporter for the Providence Journal Company, sent an email to Colonel Steven G.\n\nO’Donnell (Col. O’Donnell), in which she “request[ed] copies of state police reports regarding\n\nthe May 28 incident involving Caleb Chafee.” This email further stated: “This is a public\n\nreport, regarding the responses and actions of public employees. It’s in the public interest to\n\nknow how the situation was handled regarding the governor’s son—especially since the state\n\n\n\n1\n  The property at which the party occurred is located in Exeter, Rhode Island. It is notable that\nthe Rhode Island State Police responded because the Town of Exeter does not maintain its own\npolice force.\n                                                -2-\n\fpolice answer directly to the governor. This is a matter of transparency.” In a letter dated June\n\n25, 2012, the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety (the department) denied Milkovits’\n\nrequest for access to the documents. The purported reason for the denial was two-fold: (i) “the\n\nrequested records [were] exempt from disclosure at [that] time, due to an ongoing criminal\n\ninvestigation and/or prosecution”; and (ii) the records “could reasonably be expected to be an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy * * *.”\n\n          At some point, a state trooper revealed redacted copies of at least three of the requested\n\nrecords to a WPRO radio talk show host. 2 Apparently, this information suggested that Caleb\n\ndemanded that the underage female who was treated for alcohol-related illness be removed from\n\nthe premises and requested that no one call 911 until she was well away from the property.\n\n          On August 21, 2012, Milkovits sent another email to Col. O’Donnell in which she stated\n\nthat she was “following up on the charging of Caleb Chafee in the Memorial Day party.”\n\nMilkovits further indicated that “now that he’s being charged, I’d like a copy of the report.” In a\n\nletter dated August 29, 2012, the department again denied her request. As a reason for its denial,\n\nthe department provided that the requested records “are not considered public records under\n\nRhode Island law [because] * * * Rhode Island General Law § 38-2-2 excludes records\n\nidentifiable to an individual in any files and law enforcement records, the disclosure of which\n\ncould reasonably be expected to be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” This letter\n\nalso contained the following language: “[E]nclosed please find a copy of the summons issued in\n\nthis matter, as well as the violation complaint as filed with the Rhode Island District Court.\n\nThese records have been entered into the District Court file and are therefore publicly available.”\n\n\n\n\n2\n    This state trooper was charged administratively for revealing the material.\n                                                 -3-\n\f       By letter dated September 5, 2012, the Journal requested that the department reconsider\n\nits denial of the records request. 3 On September 10, 2012, the department stated that it had\n\nreconsidered its initial denial as requested, but its position had not changed; thus, it denied the\n\nJournal’s request for the same reasons as provided in its letter dated August 29, 2012. On\n\nSeptember 24, 2012, the Journal filed an appeal with Col. O’Donnell pursuant to § 38-2-8, which\n\nwas also denied.\n\n       Finding no relief through this preliminary out-of-court skirmishing, on October 22, 2012,\n\nthe Journal filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court, alleging violations of, inter\n\nalia, the APRA, the United States Constitution, and the Rhode Island Constitution. On March 5,\n\n2013, pursuant to the Journal’s request, defendants provided the Journal with a Vaughn index 4 of\n\neach item withheld by the government.\n\n       In due course, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In the Journal’s\n\nmotion, it argued that summary judgment should be granted because it was entitled to the\n\nrequested records pursuant to the APRA. In response, defendants argued that public disclosure\n\nof the requested records would be inconsistent with the District Court’s expungement order in\n\nCaleb’s case. The defendants also argued that the records were exempt from public disclosure\n\npursuant to the APRA, which deems not to be public “[a]ll records maintained by law\n\nenforcement agencies for criminal law enforcement and all records relating to the detection and\n\n3\n  In addition, this letter provided that it was to serve as “a new request, this time under the\nrecently amended [APRA] * * *, which became effective September 1, 2012, for all records\nrelating to Caleb Chafee * * * and the investigation which arose from occurrences at his home on\nMay 28, 2012 * * *.” Before us, both parties in their arguments rely on the APRA as amended\nin 2012.\n4\n  A “Vaughn index” is “[a] comprehensive list of all documents that the government wants to\nshield from disclosure in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation, each document being\naccompanied by a statement of justification for nondisclosure.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1788\n(10th ed. 2014).

However, the hearing justice determined that the Journal had failed to\n\n“demonstrate[] a belief by a reasonable person that alleged government impropriety might have\n\noccurred.” In addition, he determined that “disclosure would not advance the public interest”\n\nand “that the records are not reasonably segregable” because the documents make plain, even if\n\nredacted, that it was Caleb’s event that was being investigated.          Accordingly, he granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants and denied that of the Journal.

See § 38-\n\n2-2. Specifically, to perform its purpose of “facilitat[ing] public access to public records[,]” the\n\nAPRA pronounces a general rule of disclosure, providing:\n\n              “Except as provided in § 38-2-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file\n       by any public body, whether or not those records are required by any law or by\n       any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person or entity shall\n       have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at such reasonable time as may\n       be determined by the custodian thereof.” Section 38-2-3(a).\n\nHowever, the exception provided in § 38-2-2(4) serves to curtail this general rule of disclosure\n\nby defining “public records” to include only certain records. These limitations illustrate the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fGeneral Assembly’s desire to “protect from disclosure information * * * when disclosure would\n\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Section 38-2-1.\n\n       Section 38-2-2(4) defines “public records,” in pertinent part, as, “all documents, papers,\n\nletters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, magnetic or other tapes,\n\nelectronic data processing records, computer stored data * * * or other material * * * made or\n\nreceived pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business\n\nby any agency.” However, the provision continues by providing that certain records “shall not\n\nbe deemed public.” Id. Among those records deemed to not be public, are:\n\n              “All records maintained by law enforcement agencies for criminal law\n       enforcement and all records relating to the detection and investigation of crime,\n       including those maintained on any individual or compiled in the course of a\n       criminal investigation by any law enforcement agency. Provided, however, such\n       records shall not be deemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the\n       records or information * * * could reasonably be expected to constitute an\n       unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]” G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(D)(c).\n\nIt is this provision—exempting from disclosure records that “could reasonably be expected to\n\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” id.—that forms the basis of this appeal. 5\n\n       Because the APRA mirrors the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, we\n\nlook to federal case law interpreting FOIA to assist in our interpretation of the APRA. See, e.g.,\n\nIn re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d at 551. Like the APRA, the FOIA provides for public\n\n5\n  In an effort to avoid the interpretation of the APRA entirely, the state contends that the fact\nCaleb’s records were expunged precludes their disclosure under the APRA. Specifically, the\nstate cites to G.L. 1956 chapter 1.3 of title 12, the general “Expungement of Criminal Records”\nstatute, which provides that, “[w]henever the records of any conviction and/or probation of an\nindividual for the commission of a crime have been expunged under the provisions of this\nchapter, any custodian of the records of conviction relating to that crime shall not disclose the\nexistence of the records upon inquiry from any source * * *,” subject to certain exceptions not\napplicable here. Section 12-1.3-4(c). However, it is unclear whether Caleb’s expungement was\ngranted under chapter 1.3 of title 12, or, rather, pursuant to another statute. Because we conclude\nthat the records should not be disclosed in accordance with the APRA and that Caleb’s privacy\ninterest is sufficient to preclude disclosure without consideration of the expungement, we need\nnot determine the effect of the expungement on the records at issue.\n                                               -8-\n\fdisclosure of records unless those records fall within one or more of the several exemptions. See\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134730\"><a href=\"/opinion/134730/national-archives-and-records-admin-v-favish/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (2004). One such\n\nexemption, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C), “excuses from disclosure ‘records or information compiled\n\nfor law enforcement purposes’ if their production ‘could reasonably be expected to constitute an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.’” Favish, 541 U.S. at 160 (quoting 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(7)(C)).\n\n       In Favish, 541 U.S. at 171-75, the United States Supreme Court considered the\n\napplicability of this exemption to certain photographs depicting the condition of a decedent’s\n\nbody at the scene of death. In so doing, the Court stated that “[t]he term ‘unwarranted’ requires\n\nus to balance the * * * privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure.” Id. at 171. To\n\neffectuate this balance, the Court provided a two-step process by which a citizen must prove that\n\nit is entitled to disclosure of the records. Specifically, it provided that: “First, the citizen must\n\nshow that the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific\n\nthan having the information for its own sake. Second, the citizen must show the information is\n\nlikely to advance that interest. Otherwise, the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.” Id. at 172.\n\nIn our opinion, the framework that the Supreme Court sets forth in Favish is sound; thus, we\n\nfollow this example and adopt this scheme in our interpretation of the APRA.\n\n       As a threshold matter, we address the Journal’s contention that this Court’s adoption of\n\nthe interpretation of the FOIA in Favish would displace the burden that the APRA places upon\n\nthe public body to demonstrate that “the record in dispute can be properly withheld from public\n\ninspection.” Section 38-2-10. What the Journal fails to recognize in making this argument is\n\nthat the FOIA contains a nearly identical statutory provision. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)\n\n(granting the district court “jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fand to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant * *\n\n* and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action”). In Favish, 541 U.S. at 172, the Supreme\n\nCourt observed that “[t]o effect [the balance of privacy interest against the public interest in\n\ndisclosure] and to give practical meaning to the exemption, the usual rule that the citizen need\n\nnot offer a reason for requesting the information must be inapplicable.” We agree, and so we\n\nplace the same gloss upon the APRA.\n\n       We now proceed to the thrust of the Journal’s appeal. Here, the Journal seeks the\n\ninvestigatory files related to the facts underlying the charge of a private individual in hopes of\n\npotentially uncovering some hint of impropriety.          Like Favish, where the Court dealt with\n\n“photographic images and other data pertaining to an individual who died under mysterious\n\ncircumstances,” the justification most likely to satisfy the APRA’s public interest requirement “is\n\nthat the information is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials\n\nacted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.” Favish, 541 U.S.\n\nat 173. Of course, this standard would be toothless if disclosure were required based upon mere\n\nspeculation, without the need to provide some evidence of negligence or impropriety. See id. at\n\n174. Thus, we hold, in line with Favish, that:\n\n       “[W]here there is a privacy interest protected by [G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(D)(c)]\n       and the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted\n       negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties, the\n       requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure.\n       Rather, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a\n       reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.”\n       Favish, 541 U.S. at 174.\n\n       Before assessing whether the Journal presented any such evidence in this case, we pause\n\nto address the Journal’s contention that the standard presented in Favish, 541 U.S. at 174, is\n\ninapplicable to the case at hand. Specifically, it contends that this “governmental impropriety”\n\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\fstandard should apply only when the sole alleged public interest is government impropriety. See\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1095 & n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (declining to apply the standard announced in Favish\n\nwhere no impropriety was alleged on the part of the FBI or the DOJ). It then asserts that it\n\nalleged two public interests in the case at hand:          (i) discovering potential government\n\nimpropriety; and (ii) disclosing to the public how the State Police investigated the Governor\n\nunder the circumstances. For our purposes, however, this is a distinction without a difference:\n\nthe Journal’s second alleged public interest amounts to nothing more than another way of\n\ndescribing the first. Put another way, the information that the Journal hopes to uncover under its\n\nsecond asserted public interest is, in fact, government impropriety. Thus, to accept the Journal’s\n\nargument that there are two public interests in the case at hand would allow parties to avoid the\n\nFavish standard merely by exercising creative semantics. We decline this invitation. We do not,\n\nhowever, foreclose the possibility that the Favish standard may be inapplicable where a party\n\nasserts an authentic secondary public interest. 6\n\n\n\n6\n  The Journal also contends that the public interest was increased by (i) “the fact that the State\nPolice were investigating a possible violation of such an important law [(the Social Host Law)]”;\nand (ii) “the close relationship under Rhode Island law between the State Police, the Governor,\nand his family * * *.” With regard to the public interest in viewing the implementation of the\nSocial Host Law, the Journal’s argument is unavailing. Any information provided by the\ninvestigatory documents in this isolated incident would provide facts in relation to just that—a\nsingle incident. The documents would not provide the public with any indication of how this law\nis enforced generally. See Hunt v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588235\"><a href=\"/opinion/588235/christopher-shelton-hunt-v-federal-bureau-of-investigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288-89 (9th\nCir. 1992) (contrasting a FOIA request for a single investigatory file with requests for numerous\ndisciplinary files and concluding that “[t]he single file * * * will not shed any light on whether\nall such FBI investigations are comprehensive”). With regard to the close relationship between\nthe Governor and the State Police, we note that this appears to be yet another circuitous way of\ndescribing the “government impropriety” public interest. That is, the public interest in the\ncontents of the investigatory documents would flow from whether the State Police adequately\ninvestigated the then-Governor, or whether corners were cut. Further, such a relationship\nbetween the Governor and the State Police will be present in any investigation or interaction\ninvolving the two. Thus, if we were to allow this relationship to rise to the level of a significant\n                                                - 11 -\n\f       We now turn our analysis to whether the Journal has presented evidence that “the\n\ninformation is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted\n\nnegligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.” Favish, 541 U.S. at 173.\n\nIn conducting our review, we remain mindful that “there is a presumption of legitimacy accorded\n\nto the Government’s official conduct * * * [and] where the presumption is applicable, clear\n\nevidence is usually required to displace it.” Id. at 174. Even without the disclosure of the\n\ncontents of the sought after records, it is clear that the State Police performed a comprehensive\n\ninvestigation of Caleb’s violation of the Social Host Law.      Indeed, the volume of records\n\nrequested under the APRA illustrates that a thorough investigation was performed. The Vaughn\n\nindex (which was provided to the Journal) indicates that the investigation resulted in the\n\ncompilation of 186 pages of documents, including at least eighteen witness statements, seven\n\nnarrative documents from members of the State Police, incident reports, and land evidence\n\nrecords. In addition, the investigation resulted in charging Caleb under the Social Host Law.\n\nThe Journal has not pointed to a shred of evidence to suggest that “the investigative agency or\n\nother responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly,” id. at 173, other than to\n\nspeculate as to the mere possibility that some venality or irregularity may have occurred in the\n\ninvestigation due to the then-Governor’s position.     When the release of sensitive personal\n\ninformation is at stake and the alleged public interest is rooted in government wrongdoing, we do\n\nnot deal in potentialities—rather, the seeker of information must provide some evidence that\n\ngovernment negligence or impropriety was afoot. Because the Journal failed to provide any such\n\nevidence, the public interest can, at best, be characterized merely as an uncorroborated\n\n\n\npublic interest without proof of some impropriety, then nearly every investigation by the State\nPolice involving the Governor would be subject to disclosure as a matter of course. We decline\nto give the mere presence of a relationship such a pervasive effect.\n                                             - 12 -\n\fpossibility of governmental negligence or impropriety. Such a tenuous “public interest” is\n\ninsufficient to mandate disclosure under the Favish standard that we today adopt and thereby\n\nimbue upon the APRA.\n\n       While we conclude that the Journal failed to satisfy the Favish standard, we nonetheless\n\ncontinue our analysis (for the sake of completeness and to provide future guidance) to weigh the\n\nseemingly negligible public interests asserted by the Journal against the privacy interests at stake.\n\nThe parties vigorously dispute the proper valuation of the privacy interests in this case. The\n\nJournal contends that (i) Caleb’s privacy interest was substantially diminished because of the\n\npublicity that the incident received in the media and because he pled nolo contendere to violating\n\nthe Social Host Law; (ii) the then-Governor’s privacy interest was de minimis because his “status\n\nas a public official operates to reduce his cognizable interest in privacy” (quoting Citizens for\n\nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (D.D.C. 2012)); and (iii) the identities of third-persons who provided witness statements\n\nwere “reasonably segregable” and, thus, could be redacted to prevent any invasion of privacy. 7\n\n       Turning first to Caleb, we place little stock in the Journal’s contention that his privacy\n\ninterest was significantly diminished because of the publicity that his charge for violating the\n\nSocial Host Law received. Notably, a copy of the summons and complaint were produced to the\n\nJournal, which confirmed the existence of a charge against him. While the media coverage may\n\nhave made known to the public the existence of the charge, it certainly did not reveal the intimate\n\ndetails underlying the charge. The privacy interest at stake flows not from the widespread\n\nknowledge of the fact that Caleb was charged, but, instead, from the information and personal\n\n\n\n7\n  Both parties agree that the third-party identities could be redacted and, thus, none of their\nprivacy interests are implicated by disclosure of the records. Accordingly, we do not consider\nthe third-party privacy interests for purposes of our analysis.\n                                               - 13 -\n\fdetails that may have been discovered in the police investigation. Moreover, while the charge\n\nwas, in fact, public, “the fact that ‘an event is not wholly private does not mean that an individual\n\nhas no interest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of the information.’” United States\n\nDepartment of Justice v.

Therefore, we find the Journal’s argument in this regard unconvincing.\n\n       Similarly, we see no merit with regard to the Journal’s contention that Caleb is entitled to\n\nlesser privacy because he pled nolo contendere to violating the Social Host Law. While the plea\n\nmight lessen the privacy extended to the conviction, it does not do so with respect to the facts\n\nunderlying it. Indeed, in American Civil Liberties Union v. United States Department of Justice,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613160\"><a href=\"/opinion/613160/american-civil-liberties-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011), on which the Journal relies, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nprovided “that the disclosure of convictions and public pleas is at the lower end of the privacy\n\nspectrum.” However, the court in that case was dealing with only the disclosure of the fact of\n\nconviction, not the facts underlying the conviction or information provided in the investigation of\n\nthe crime. See id. at 8 (“It would disclose only information concerning a conviction or plea; it\n\nwould not disclose mere charges or arrests. It would disclose only information that has already\n\nbeen the subject of a public proceeding (either a trial or public guilty plea), rather than actions\n\n(like arrests) that may not have taken place in public.”). Thus, the Journal’s argument that\n\nCaleb’s privacy interest in the police investigative documents was diminished because he pled\n\nnolo contendere also lacks force. 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n  In addition, we note that the distinction between the existence of a plea and the facts underlying\nthe charges that gave rise to such a plea is further supported by practicality: it is a common\n                                               - 14 -\n\f        In the case of the documents developed by law enforcement in the investigation of a\n\nprivate individual, the privacy interest is considerable and should not be easily displaced absent a\n\nparticularly noteworthy public interest. See Reporters Commission for Freedom of Press, 489\n\nU.S. at 769, 771 (“We have * * * recognized the privacy interest in keeping personal facts away\n\nfrom the public eye. * * * The privacy interest in a rap sheet is substantial.”). As such, we are\n\nsatisfied that Caleb’s privacy interest is significant, 9 and, consequently, we cannot allow the\n\nJournal’s unsubstantiated assertion—pointing to the mere possibility that government\n\nimpropriety occurred in the investigation due to the then-Governor’s position—to mandate\n\ndisclosure of sensitive information. 10 Accordingly, we cannot conclude “that the trial justice\n\noverlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong,” Direct Action\n\nfor Rights and Equality, 819 A.2d at 662, in his balancing of Caleb’s privacy interest against the\n\npublic interests at issue.\n\n        At oral argument, the Journal posed the following question: “[I]s there a good reason the\n\npeople shouldn’t see what the state police did?” We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\nPursuant to the APRA, records need not be disclosed where such disclosure could create an\n\nunwarranted invasion of privacy—here, Caleb’s privacy interest created a barrier that the public\n\ninterests in disclosure as asserted by the Journal could not overcome.\n\n\n\n\ntactical move for a defendant to plead guilty or nolo contendere rather than take his chances in\ncourt, to avoid the exposure of unfavorable facts during a public trial.\n9\n  In view of Caleb’s considerable privacy interest that would be compromised if the investigative\ndocuments were released, we need not pin down the exact valuation of the privacy interest of the\nthen-Governor. That is, a disclosure of the records would constitute an unwarranted invasion of\nCaleb’s privacy; thus, the records may be withheld under the APRA regardless of the privacy\ninterests of the then-Governor.\n10\n   We note that redaction would be ineffective to reduce Caleb’s privacy interest in this case.\nGiven the media attention that the investigation of Caleb has received from its onset, the subject\nof any records would be abundantly clear, even if redacted.\n                                               - 15 -\n\f                                                IV\n\n                                          Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.
