Within a few weeks of the transfer, Jupiter received a notice from\n\na court, directing him to file a response by a date certain. On September 5, 2005, after\n\nreviewing the legal material that the Lewisburg prison gave him, Jupiter noticed that\n\nsome of his legal materials, including affidavits, transcripts, statements, petitions, and\n\nother pleadings, were missing. He complained, requesting that the prison return the legal\n\nmaterials to him and advise the court about the loss. According to Jupiter, he needed the\n\nlegal materials, some of which were irreplaceable, in order to comply with the court\n\nnotice. He claims that the Lewisburg prison deprived him of access to the courts because\n\nit intentionally or negligently failed to provide his legal materials to him and thereby\n\nprevented him from proceeding with the case. He seeks release from incarceration.\n\n       The Warden of the Lewisburg prison contended that Jupiter’s claims were not\n\ncognizable under § 2241 because he did not challenge the fact or duration of his\n\nconfinement. The Magistrate Judge agreed, recommending that the petition be dismissed.\n\nThe District Court overruled Jupiter’s objections, adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Report\n\nand dismissed the petition without prejudice to his filing a Bivens action.2 Jupiter filed a\n\nmotion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied. Jupiter timely appealed.\n\n       1\n           Jupiter does not identify the nature of the action.\n       2\n           Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).\n\n                                                2\n\f      We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court’s legal conclusions as no evidentiary hearing was conducted by\n\nthe District Court. See Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002).3\n\n          The District Court properly held that Jupiter’s access to the courts claim does not\n\nlie at the core of habeas and, thus, is not cognizable under § 2241. In Leamer v. Fauver,\n\n288 F.3d 532 (3d Cir. 2002), we held that Leamer’s challenge to the conditions of his\n\nconfinement was properly brought in a civil rights action rather than a habeas petition.\n\n“When examining whether Preiser and its progeny require a claim to be brought under\n\nhabeas, unless the claim would fall within the ‘core of habeas’ and require sooner release\n\nif resolved in the plaintiff’s favor, a prison confinement action such as this is properly\n\nbrought under § 1983. Leamer’s claim not only does not fall within the core of habeas;\n\nit would not be properly brought under habeas at all.” Leamer, 288 F.3d at 544.\n\n          Jupiter claims that he should be released because the Lewisburg prison deprived\n\nhim of meaningful access to the courts, which caused his incarceration to be unlawful.\n\nWe disagree. The access to the courts claim has no bearing on the lawfulness of his\n\nincarceration. Nor would Jupiter’s ultimate success on the merits of the claim result in a\n\nspeedier release from prison. We agree with the District Court that Jupiter cannot bring\n\nthe claim in a habeas petition.\n\n          Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, the District Court’s\n\n\n      3\n          We do not review the District Court’s order denying reconsideration as Jupiter\ndid not file an amended notice of appeal.\n\n                                                3\n\fjudgment will be summarily affirmed. See Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
