Fox and James Rubenstein. Generally stated, the question presented by these motions is whether West Virginia Department of Corrections Policy Directive 503.00,<sup>[1]</sup> on its face and as applied, is unconstitutional. The Court finds that Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P), in particular, is not reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives insofar as it prohibits reading materials with any written depictions of sexual conduct but permits commercial pornography. Therefore, the Court concludes that Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is invalid, on its face and as applied, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the plaintiff's motion and DENIES the defendants' motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff Roger Cline, an inmate with the West Virginia Division of Corrections (\"DOC\"), has been incarcerated at the St. Mary's Correctional Center (\"St.Mary's\") since December 1998. At St. Mary's, Cline ordered and received several \"Paper Wings\" adult-fiction books. On March 17, 2000, however, prison officials intercepted Cline's most recent shipment of Paper Wings books because the sender's name did not appear on St. Mary's \"Approved Vendors List.\" In response, Cline petitioned the defendant, Warden William M. Fox, to amend the Approved Vendors List to include Komar Publishing, which publishes Paper Wings.</p>\n<p>Warden Fox referred the petition to Deputy Warden Tony LeMasters, who determined that the Paper Wings books contained \"obscene material\" as defined by DOC Policy Directive 503.00(III). According to Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P), inmates cannot receive or possess obscene material; therefore, Deputy Warden LeMasters recommended denial of Cline's petition. Warden Fox adopted this recommendation and refused to add Komar Publishing to the Approved Vendors List. After unsuccessfully grieving this decision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*689</span> within the DOC, Cline filed a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1983 on October 16, 2000. He alleged that prohibiting his receipt of the Paper Wings books violated his constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>During discovery of the original § 1983 claim,<sup>[2]</sup> Cline gave an answer to an interrogatory indicating that books similar to Paper Wings were shelved in St. Mary's Reading Library. Warden Fox responded to this disclosure by closing the library and instructing Deputy Warden Sandy Tanczyn to review its contents and remove any material that violated the obscenity ban in DOC Policy Directive 503.00. Tanczyn formed an ad hoc staff of unit managers, counselors, case managers, and office assistants to individually read every book in the library. She distributed copies of Policy Directive 503.00 to the staff members, and instructed them to purge anything containing language that \"could be derived as a sexual turn-on, according to the policy directive.\" (Tanczyn Depo. at 16.) When a staff member inquired about how to make this judgment, Tanczyn simply told them to \"[j]ust go by the policy directive.\" (<i>Id.</i> at 18.) Tanczyn admits that her specific direction to eliminate any book that contained language that might arouse the reader was her own interpretation of the Policy Directive, and not that of Warden Fox.</p>\n<p>The entire Reading Library review was completed in approximately two months. At its conclusion, the staff had purged 259 of the 1226 volumes, or nearly 21% of the library's total inventory. Among the books removed were William Styron's <i>Sophie's Choice,</i> Gore Vidal's <i>Myra Breckinridge,</i> and a number of works by John Updike.</p>\n<p>Cline immediately amended his complaint on October 31, 2001 to allege that the library purge was a violation of his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. On March 19, 2003, this Court dismissed the new claim without prejudice because Cline had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d 489, 501 (N.D.W.Va.2003). Nonetheless, in its Order, the Court upheld the constitutionality of DOC Policy Directive 503.00 as applied to his possession of Paper Wings books. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On March 26, 2003, Cline moved the Court to reconsider its March 19, 2003 Order to the extent it dismissed the library purge claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The Court granted the motion and retained jurisdiction over this case to consider the constitutionality of DOC Policy Directive 503.00 on its face and, specifically, as applied to the removal of books from the prison library.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>At issue is the constitutionality of a prison regulation that prohibits inmate access to all reading materials containing a \"sexually explicit\" passage, but allows inmates to possess commercial pornography.<sup>[3]</sup> Cline asserts that DOC Policy Directive 503.00, on its face and as applied, is unreasonably overbroad and fails to consider \"a work's dominant themes and content or its value.\" Conversely, Warden Fox argues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*690</span> that the regulation does not implicate Cline's constitutional rights and is otherwise reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute any material facts on the cross-motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the Court need only determine which party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Asserted Right</h2>\n<p>Warden Fox first contends that the prison's removal of any library books pursuant to Policy Directive 503.00 is not constitutionally suspect because inmates have no constitutional right to a reading library. <i>See </i><i>Counts v. Newhart,</i> 951 F.Supp. 579, 587 (E.D.Va.1996) (\"The Constitution contains no right of access to a general-literary library ....\"); <i>May v. Baldwin,</i> 895 F.Supp. 1398, 1405 (D.Or.1995) (finding no constitutional right to general prison library privileges). He further maintains that, to the extent there could be a constitutional violation, Cline cannot advance a claim because he has not suffered actual harm.</p>\n<p>The Court agrees  and Cline also concedes  that the Constitution does not require prisons to provide a reading library for their inmates. Even so, it does not necessarily follow that, once a prison offers access to a library, it has unfettered discretion to regulate the library's contents. <i>See </i><i>Bd. of Edu., Island Trees Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico,</i> 457 U.S. 853, 870-72, 102 S.Ct. 2799, 73 L.Ed.2d 435 (1982) (plurality) (prohibiting the improperly motivated removal of certain books from a school library); <i>cf. also </i><i>Neinast v. Bd. of Trs. of the Columbus Metro. Library,</i> 346 F.3d 585, 591 (6th Cir.2003) (holding that a public library is a limited public forum); <i>Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for the Town of Morristown,</i> 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir.1992) (same). In <i>Pico,</i> the plurality held that, notwithstanding a school board's \"broad discretion in the management of school affairs,\" <i>id.</i> at 863, 102 S.Ct. 2799, the First Amendment limits this discretion to <i>remove</i> books from a school library. <i>Id.</i> at 869-72, 102 S.Ct. 2799. Like prisoners, public school students have no constitutional right to a school library and otherwise must bear certain restrictions on their rights generally. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 861-64, 102 S.Ct. 2799; <i>see </i><i>Counts,</i> 951 F.Supp. at 587. Thus, the defendants fail to persuade the Court that the First Amendment cannot impose <i>any</i> limitations on the discretion of prison officials in removing books from prison library shelves simply because a prisoner has no right to be provided a library.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case at bar, Cline has standing to assert a claim with respect to the library purge. As this Court held in <i>Cline I,</i> inmates have a First Amendment right to receive information. 266 F.Supp.2d at 499. Inmates exercise that constitutional right when they read books from the prison library. <i>See </i><i>Kreimer,</i> 958 F.2d at 1256 (observing that a public library is the \"`quintessential' locus for the exercise of the right to receive information and ideas'\"). Thus, a prison's selective <span class=\"star-pagination\">*691</span> removal of library books restricts an inmate's right to receive information. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pico,</i> 457 U.S. at 866, 102 S.Ct. 2799 (\"[T]he First Amendment rights of students may be directly and sharply implicated by the removal of books from the shelves of a school library.\"). Since DOC Policy Directive 503.00 operates to deny Cline access to numerous books, he has a cognizable claim for violation of his constitutional rights. <i>See </i><i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 373-74, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (\"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\") (citing <i>New York Times Co. v. United States,</i> 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Standard of Law</h2>\n<p>Ordinarily, courts determine the validity of an allegedly overbroad regulation by considering whether it \"reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\" <i>City of Houston v. Hill,</i> 482 U.S. 451, 458, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (quoting <i>Village of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982)). In the prison context, however, a court must \"uphold [the] regulation, even one circumscribing constitutionally protected interests, so long as it `is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.'\" <i>Amatel v. Reno,</i> 156 F.3d 192, 196 (D.C.Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Turner v. Safley,</i> 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). \"This standard reflects a basic reality of conviction and confinement: Although prisoners are not completely without the Constitution's protection, `[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.'\" <i>In re Long Term Admin. Segregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters,</i> 174 F.3d 464, 469 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting <i>O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz,</i> 482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Turner v. Safley</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court identified four factors that are \"relevant in determining the reasonableness of the regulation at issue\":</p>\n<blockquote>First, there must be a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A second factor ... is whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A third consideration is the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates and on the allocation of prison resources generally ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Finally, the absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation. By the same token, the existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not reasonable, but is an exaggerated response to prison concerns.</blockquote>\n<p>482 U.S. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (citations omitted); <i>see </i><i>Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. at 414, 109 S.Ct. 1874.</p>\n<p>The <i>Turner</i> framework accords prison officials \"`wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.' \"<i>In re Long Term,</i> 174 F.3d at 469 (quoting <i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> 441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)). Thus, \"[i]n the volatile prison environment, it is essential that prison officials be given broad discretion to prevent ... disorder\" that could be caused by certain reading materials accessible to prisoners. <i>Thornburgh,</i> 490 U.S. at 413, 109 S.Ct. 1874. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*692</span> Moreover, \"[w]hen a state correctional institution is involved, the deference of a federal court is even more appropriate.\" <i>In re Long Term,</i> 174 F.3d at 469.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Application of the <i>Turner</i> Factors</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Legitimate Penological Interest and Rational Relationship</i></h2>\n<p>The underlying objective of Policy Directive 503.00 must be legitimate and content-neutral. <i>Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. at 414-15, 109 S.Ct. 1874; <i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 495. According to Warden Fox, the DOC promulgated the policy to preserve security generally and prevent sexual assaults specifically. He also states that the policy furthers inmate rehabilitation. These objectives are legitimate and content neutral. <i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 495-96.</p>\n<p>After finding a legitimate objective, the Court must approve of the library regulation if Warden Fox establishes \"some minimally rational relationship between that objective and the means chosen to achieve that objective.\" <i>Hines v. S.C. Dep't of Corrections,</i> 148 F.3d 353, 358 (4th Cir.1998). \"Thus, a regulation cannot be sustained where the logical connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\" <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. \"The question is not whether [the warden's] conclusion was indisputably correct, but whether his conclusion was rational and therefore entitled to deference.\" <i>In re Long Term,</i> 174 F.3d at 470.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) prohibits inmates from \"receiving/possessing obscene material, private pornography or pornographic paraphernalia.\" Material is \"obscene\" if it depicts \"explicit sexual activity,\" defined as \"sexual intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, bestiality, bondage/Sadism and Masochism or material of an explicit nature involving minors.\" Private pornography is any graphic representation of nudity that \"has not been published for widespread commercial viewing,\" which generally includes \"nude or semi-nude photographs\" of an inmate's acquaintance, spouse, or family member. W. Va. DOC Pol'y Dir. 503.00(III). Pornographic paraphernalia is \"[a]ny object or device, which is to be used to stimulate sexual organs or which[ ] is attached to or inserted into genitalia or the anus.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In forbidding \"obscene material,\" Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is extraordinarily far-reaching. Reasonably interpreted, the policy prohibits all books, magazines, paintings, and photographs that contain even one depiction of sexual intercourse. <i>See</i> Pol'y Dir. 503.00(III). The prohibition also applies regardless of the context of the depiction or the content of the work as a whole. Therefore, literary classics like George Orwell's <i>1984</i> and religious texts like the Bible<sup>[6]</sup> technically violate this regulation. It is difficult to understand how denying inmates access to such books promotes security, prevents sexual assaults, or furthers rehabilitation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*693</span> The rationality of Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) becomes more questionable in light of the prison's allowance of commercial pornography. Pol'y Dir. 503.00(III). Consequently, the policy permits magazines such as <i>Playboy</i> or <i>Maxim,</i> which objectify women in order to sexually arouse or gratify men. (LeMasters Depo. at 38.) But the policy would certainly forbid James Joyce's <i>Ulysses,</i><sup>[7]</sup> ostensibly because such books \"create an intolerable risk of disorder.\" (Def. Supp. Memo. at 12, quoting <i>Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. at 417, 109 S.Ct. 1874.)</p>\n<p>In view of the library regulation's substantial overbreadth and incongruities, the Court cannot find any logical connection between Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) and its intended goals. To curtail sexual assaults, the regulation presumptively prohibits <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> but welcomes <i>Playboy.</i> To further rehabilitation, the policy bans works from Pulitzer Prize winning novelists<sup>[8]</sup> but allows \"soft porn.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>Aiello v. Litscher,</i> 104 F.Supp.2d 1068, 1081 (W.D.Wis.2000) (\"Numerous courts of appeal have recognized the state's legitimate concern that the presence of pornography among offenders may hamper rehabilitation, particularly sex offenders, threaten security and lead to increased incidence of sexual harassment of female officers.\"). Such regulation smacks of irrationality, particularly considering that over a third of the inmate population are sex offenders  a statistic emphasized by Warden Fox. (Def. Supp. Memo. at 1.)</p>\n<p>As applied, Policy Directive 503.00 proscribes an even broader range of materials. Deputy Warden Tanczyn directed prison staff to expunge books with any sexually arousing content. Tanczyn's instruction, however, fails to comport with the plain language of Policy Directive 503.00(III), which does not define \"explicit sexual activity\" in terms of capacity to sexually arouse. Moreover, any prohibition on \"sexually arousing\" books would necessarily encompass allowable commercial pornography, \"whose <i>primary purpose</i> is to cause sexual arousal.\" Dictionary.com, http://dictionary.reference.com (defining \"pornography\") (last visited Apr. 19, 2004) (emphasis added). This self-contradictory application of Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is also clearly irrational.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Alternative Means of Exercising the Right</i></h2>\n<p>\"Where `other avenues' remain available for the exercise of the asserted right, courts should be particularly conscious of the `measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials ... in gauging the validity of the regulation.\" <i>Turner,</i> 482 at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (quoting <i>Pell v. Procunier,</i> 417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974)) (citation omitted). \"`[T]he right' in question must be viewed sensibly and expansively.\" <i>Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. at 417, 109 S.Ct. 1874.</p>\n<p>As previously discussed, Cline has a constitutional right to receive information. The parties' respective interpretations of this right, however, predictably diverge. Cline asserts that he has the right to receive books and magazines that have redeeming social value despite containing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*694</span> at least one depiction of a sexual act. Warden Fox views the right more globally, essentially arguing that Cline has no right to any particular genre of reading materials.</p>\n<p>Generally, the \"right to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth, is fundamental to our free society.\" <i>Stanley v. Georgia,</i> 394 U.S. 557, 564, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969) (citing <i>Winters v. New York,</i> 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948)). Therefore, if this right holds any meaning for inmates, it at least includes the right to receive books of some literary value. <i>See </i><i>Pell,</i> 417 U.S. at 822, 94 S.Ct. 2800 (\"[A] prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.\"). Nevertheless, not all such books contain \"sexually explicit\" passages, as literally defined by Policy Directive 503.00 or as interpreted by prison officials. Accordingly, because the policy allows inmates access to an otherwise broad range of \"good books,\" the Court must conclude that the alternative means factor is \"clearly satisfied.\" <i>Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. at 418, 109 S.Ct. 1874.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. Impact of Accommodating the Asserted Right</i></h2>\n<p>Warden Fox contends that \"accommodating plaintiff's <i>request</i>\" for the return of purged library books will jeopardize prison security and inmate rehabilitation. (Def. Supp. Memo. at 13.) For purposes of the <i>Turner</i> analysis, however, only Cline's <i>rights</i> are at issue. Thus, the Court must consider how accommodating Cline's right to receive certain types of literature  not his desire for the replacement of all purged library books  will affect prison officials and inmates.</p>\n<p>Although Warden Fox misapprehends the extent of possible relief,<sup>[9]</sup> his arguments remain conclusory and unpersuasive. He fails to explain how allowing inmates to read books that have some literary value but describe sexual conduct will \"create an intolerable risk of disorder,\" even if the sexual references are <i>de minimus.</i> Likewise, he does not offer any evidence indicating that such books will \"detrimentally impact the rehabilitative programs and counseling\" of inmates who have committed sexual offenses. (Def. Supp. Memo. at 13.) Therefore, the Court finds that accommodating Cline's right is unlikely to have any significant negative impact on either prison officials or inmates. To the contrary, some of the otherwise prohibited literature may benefit inmates. <i>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,</i> 413 U.S. 49, 63, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973) (\"[G]ood books, plays, and the arts lift the spirit, improve the mind, enrich the human personality, and develop character.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>4. Absence of Ready Alternatives</i></h2>\n<p>\"[I]f an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner's rights at <i>de minimus</i> cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.\" <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 91, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Cline maintains that a more narrowly drawn publications policy that considers the independent value of reading materials is a reasonable alternative. He also observes that several courts have upheld narrower regulations that sufficiently restrict access to sexually explicit materials. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Thornburgh v. Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. 401, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*695</span> 459 (1989); <i>Amatel v. Reno,</i> 156 F.3d 192, 194, 202 (D.C.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The <i>Abbott</i> case, in particular, vindicates Cline's assertion that ready alternatives to Policy Directive 503.00 exist. In <i>Abbott,</i> the Supreme Court upheld the facial validity of a federal prison regulation that permitted wardens to reject \"sexually explicit\" material involving (1) homosexuality, (2) sadomasochism, (3) bestiality, or (4) children. 490 U.S. at 405 n. 6, 419, 109 S.Ct. 1874. The first three categories of sexually explicit material could be admitted, however, if the warden determined that they did not \"pose a threat at the local institution\" or had \"scholarly, or general social or literary, value.\" <i>Id.</i> at 405 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 1874.</p>\n<p>The regulation in <i>Abbott</i> demonstrates that a warden can censor materials that jeopardize security and rehabilitation while also accommodating inmates' right to receive information. Although the regulation may not be suitable for St. Mary's (and thus need not be adopted verbatim), it offers one of many ready alternatives to Policy Directive 503.00, on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p>In sum, despite its legitimate objectives, DOC Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is irrational insofar as it bans \"sexually explicit\" reading material but allows commercial pornography. Nonetheless, Cline has alternative means to exercise his right to receive publications with some literary value. Accommodating his right to receive such books that also contain sexual references, however, is generally unlikely to endanger security or inmate rehabilitation.<sup>[10]</sup> Moreover, effective alternative regulations are readily available for the prison to implement and could alleviate the defendants' concerns.</p>\n<p>After weighing all of the <i>Turner</i> factors, the Court concludes that, to the extent that Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) prohibits all depictions of sexual conduct while permitting commercial pornography, it is not reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Thus, on its face and as applied, the policy impermissibly infringes Cline's constitutional right to receive information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Extent of Prospective Relief</h2>\n<p>Having found a constitutional violation, the Court must consider the appropriate remedy in the unique prison context. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A),</p>\n<blockquote>[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, the defendants must amend Policy Directive 503.00 in a manner consistent with this Court's orders and other governing federal law. Cline further demands replacement of all books removed from the prison library. (Compl. at 5.) This remedy, however, is not \"narrowly drawn.\" Indeed, if any of the purged books are similar to the Paper Wings series, as Cline has asserted, Warden Fox has no obligation to return them. <i>See </i><i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 501. Moreover, Cline has not indicated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*696</span> whether he wished to read all or just some of the 259 purged books.</p>\n<p>The proper relief in the case at bar must remedy the constitutional violation without usurping the discretion of the defendants. Because Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is facially invalid, the library purge as conducted was unauthorized. <i>See </i><i>Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason,</i> 303 F.3d 507, 512 (4th Cir.2002). As discussed above, however, it is unlikely that Cline and the other St. Mary's inmates are entitled to every book removed by the prison staff. Therefore, the Court ORDERS defendants to amend their publications policy in a manner consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and Order and to screen the purged books under that amended policy before replacing the books on the prison library shelves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Based on the foregoing analysis,</p>\n<blockquote>1) The Court GRANTS the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to the library purge (dkt. no. 49) and DENIES the defendant's motion for summary judgment on this issue (dkt. nos. 47, 70).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2) The Court DECLARES that West Virginia Department of Corrections Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P), on its face and as applied, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments insofar as it prohibits books with any written depictions of sexual conduct but permits commercial pornography.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3) The Court ENJOINS the enforcement of Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) to the extent it contravenes this Memorandum Opinion and Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4) The Court ORDERS the defendants to amend the policy in a manner consistent with this Court's orders and other governing federal law.</blockquote>\n<p>It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<p>The Clerk is directed to transmit copies of this Order to counsel of record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Appendix A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA DIVISION OF CORRECTIONS POLICY DIRECTIVE</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>NUMBER: 503.00</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DATE: 01 April 2000</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>SUBJECT: Mail Privileges for Inmates</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AUTHORITY: WV Code 25-1-5 25-1-18 and 62-13-4; ACA Standards 3-4429 through 3-4438</h2>\n<p>I.

Fox,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d 489 (N.D.W.Va.2003), hereinafter referred to as \"<i>Cline I.</i>\"</p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Cline I,</i> the Court held that DOC Policy Directive 503.00, \"as applied to prohibit the plaintiff's possession of his Paper Wings [adult fiction] books, is constitutional.\" 266 F.Supp.2d at 501. At that stage in the litigation, however, Cline did not pursue a facial challenge to the policy, which is now squarely before the Court. The factual context of the as applied challenge in the case at bar is also readily distinguishable from that in <i>Cline I,</i> requiring a different legal analysis.</p>\n<p>[4]  Even if the removal of library books did not implicate Cline's constitutional rights, he could still assert his facial challenge to Policy Directive 503.00, which applies to inmates' personal possession of certain reading materials. <i>See </i><i>Newsom v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd.,</i> 354 F.3d 249, 257 (4th Cir.2003) (noting that, under the overbreadth doctrine, \"an individual may `challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not before the court  those who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid'\") (quoting <i>Bd. of Airport Comm'rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.,</i> 482 U.S. 569, 574, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 96 L.Ed.2d 500 (1987)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Notwithstanding <i>Turner</i>'s guidance to engage in a multiple factor inquiry in cases involving prisoners' constitutional rights, the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit precedent cited here indicate that the legitimate objective/rational relationship test may be outcome determinative.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court observes, however, that prison officials did not remove the Bible from the library shelves. <i>But see, e.g.,</i> 2 Sam. 11:1-5 (The New Living Translation) (\"Late one afternoon David got out of bed after taking a nap and went for a stroll on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath.... Then David sent for her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her.\").</p>\n<p>[7]  The Modern Library named <i>Ulysses</i> the best novel of the twentieth century  despite its \"sexually explicit\" content. <i>See</i> The Modern Library, \"100 Best Novels,\" <i>at</i> http:// www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100best.html (last visited Apr. 8, 2004).</p>\n<p>[8]  Cline identified at least three such individuals: John Updike, Jane Smiley, and William Styron. (Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. at 8.) He also noted that prison officials removed books from several other best selling authors, including John Grisham, Scott Turow, Gore Vidal, Robert Ludlum, Sidney Sheldon, Judith Krantz, and Danielle Steele. (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>[9]  Indeed, as this Court has already ruled, the DOC's prohibition of certain sexually explicit adult fiction books is constitutionally permissible. <i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 501.</p>\n<p>[10]  Of course, prison officials may still forbid such books if they pose a threat to security, inhibit rehabilitation or otherwise promote disorder.</p>\n\n</div>",

Fox and James Rubenstein. Generally stated, the question presented by these motions is whether West Virginia Department of Corrections Policy Directive 503.00,<sup>[1]</sup> on its face and as applied, is unconstitutional. The Court finds that Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P), in particular, is not reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives insofar as it prohibits reading materials with any written depictions of sexual conduct but permits commercial pornography. Therefore, the Court concludes that Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is invalid, on its face and as applied, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the plaintiff's motion and DENIES the defendants' motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff Roger Cline, an inmate with the West Virginia Division of Corrections (\"DOC\"), has been incarcerated at the St. Mary's Correctional Center (\"St.Mary's\") since December 1998. At St. Mary's, Cline ordered and received several \"Paper Wings\" adult-fiction books. On March 17, 2000, however, prison officials intercepted Cline's most recent shipment of Paper Wings books because the sender's name did not appear on St. Mary's \"Approved Vendors List.\" In response, Cline petitioned the defendant, Warden William M. Fox, to amend the Approved Vendors List to include Komar Publishing, which publishes Paper Wings.</p>\n<p>Warden Fox referred the petition to Deputy Warden Tony LeMasters, who determined that the Paper Wings books contained \"obscene material\" as defined by DOC Policy Directive 503.00(III). According to Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P), inmates cannot receive or possess obscene material; therefore, Deputy Warden LeMasters recommended denial of Cline's petition. Warden Fox adopted this recommendation and refused to add Komar Publishing to the Approved Vendors List. After unsuccessfully grieving this decision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*689</span> within the DOC, Cline filed a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1983 on October 16, 2000. He alleged that prohibiting his receipt of the Paper Wings books violated his constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>During discovery of the original § 1983 claim,<sup>[2]</sup> Cline gave an answer to an interrogatory indicating that books similar to Paper Wings were shelved in St. Mary's Reading Library. Warden Fox responded to this disclosure by closing the library and instructing Deputy Warden Sandy Tanczyn to review its contents and remove any material that violated the obscenity ban in DOC Policy Directive 503.00. Tanczyn formed an ad hoc staff of unit managers, counselors, case managers, and office assistants to individually read every book in the library. She distributed copies of Policy Directive 503.00 to the staff members, and instructed them to purge anything containing language that \"could be derived as a sexual turn-on, according to the policy directive.\" (Tanczyn Depo. at 16.) When a staff member inquired about how to make this judgment, Tanczyn simply told them to \"[j]ust go by the policy directive.\" (<i>Id.</i> at 18.) Tanczyn admits that her specific direction to eliminate any book that contained language that might arouse the reader was her own interpretation of the Policy Directive, and not that of Warden Fox.</p>\n<p>The entire Reading Library review was completed in approximately two months. At its conclusion, the staff had purged 259 of the 1226 volumes, or nearly 21% of the library's total inventory. Among the books removed were William Styron's <i>Sophie's Choice,</i> Gore Vidal's <i>Myra Breckinridge,</i> and a number of works by John Updike.</p>\n<p>Cline immediately amended his complaint on October 31, 2001 to allege that the library purge was a violation of his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. On March 19, 2003, this Court dismissed the new claim without prejudice because Cline had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <i>Cline I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2516706/cline-v-fox/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 501 (N.D.W.Va.2003). Nonetheless, in its Order, the Court upheld the constitutionality of DOC Policy Directive 503.00 as applied to his possession of Paper Wings books. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On March 26, 2003, Cline moved the Court to reconsider its March 19, 2003 Order to the extent it dismissed the library purge claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The Court granted the motion and retained jurisdiction over this case to consider the constitutionality of DOC Policy Directive 503.00 on its face and, specifically, as applied to the removal of books from the prison library.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>At issue is the constitutionality of a prison regulation that prohibits inmate access to all reading materials containing a \"sexually explicit\" passage, but allows inmates to possess commercial pornography.<sup>[3]</sup> Cline asserts that DOC Policy Directive 503.00, on its face and as applied, is unreasonably overbroad and fails to consider \"a work's dominant themes and content or its value.\" Conversely, Warden Fox argues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*690</span> that the regulation does not implicate Cline's constitutional rights and is otherwise reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute any material facts on the cross-motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the Court need only determine which party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Asserted Right</h2>\n<p>Warden Fox first contends that the prison's removal of any library books pursuant to Policy Directive 503.00 is not constitutionally suspect because inmates have no constitutional right to a reading library. <i>See </i><i>Counts v. Newhart,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span>, 587 (E.D.Va.1996) (\"The Constitution contains no right of access to a general-literary library ....\"); <i>May v. Baldwin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1398</span></span>, 1405 (D.Or.1995) (finding no constitutional right to general prison library privileges). He further maintains that, to the extent there could be a constitutional violation, Cline cannot advance a claim because he has not suffered actual harm.</p>\n<p>The Court agrees  and Cline also concedes  that the Constitution does not require prisons to provide a reading library for their inmates. Even so, it does not necessarily follow that, once a prison offers access to a library, it has unfettered discretion to regulate the library's contents. <i>See </i><i>Bd. of Edu., Island Trees Union Free Sch.

Thus, the defendants fail to persuade the Court that the First Amendment cannot impose <i>any</i> limitations on the discretion of prison officials in removing books from prison library shelves simply because a prisoner has no right to be provided a library.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case at bar, Cline has standing to assert a claim with respect to the library purge.

Thus, a prison's selective <span class=\"star-pagination\">*691</span> removal of library books restricts an inmate's right to receive information. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pico,</i> 457 U.S. at 866, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110765\"><a href=\"/opinion/110765/board-of-ed-island-trees-union-free-school-dist-no-26-v-pico/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Reasonably interpreted, the policy prohibits all books, magazines, paintings, and photographs that contain even one depiction of sexual intercourse. <i>See</i> Pol'y Dir. 503.00(III). The prohibition also applies regardless of the context of the depiction or the content of the work as a whole. Therefore, literary classics like George Orwell's <i>1984</i> and religious texts like the Bible<sup>[6]</sup> technically violate this regulation. It is difficult to understand how denying inmates access to such books promotes security, prevents sexual assaults, or furthers rehabilitation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*693</span> The rationality of Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) becomes more questionable in light of the prison's allowance of commercial pornography. Pol'y Dir. 503.00(III). Consequently, the policy permits magazines such as <i>Playboy</i> or <i>Maxim,</i> which objectify women in order to sexually arouse or gratify men. (LeMasters Depo. at 38.) But the policy would certainly forbid James Joyce's <i>Ulysses,</i><sup>[7]</sup> ostensibly because such books \"create an intolerable risk of disorder.\" (Def.

To curtail sexual assaults, the regulation presumptively prohibits <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> but welcomes <i>Playboy.</i> To further rehabilitation, the policy bans works from Pulitzer Prize winning novelists<sup>[8]</sup> but allows \"soft porn.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>Aiello v.

Such regulation smacks of irrationality, particularly considering that over a third of the inmate population are sex offenders  a statistic emphasized by Warden Fox. (Def. Supp. Memo. at 1.)</p>\n<p>As applied, Policy Directive 503.00 proscribes an even broader range of materials. Deputy Warden Tanczyn directed prison staff to expunge books with any sexually arousing content. Tanczyn's instruction, however, fails to comport with the plain language of Policy Directive 503.00(III), which does not define \"explicit sexual activity\" in terms of capacity to sexually arouse. Moreover, any prohibition on \"sexually arousing\" books would necessarily encompass allowable commercial pornography, \"whose <i>primary purpose</i> is to cause sexual arousal.\" Dictionary.com, http://dictionary.reference.com (defining \"pornography\") (last visited Apr. 19, 2004) (emphasis added).

Accordingly, because the policy allows inmates access to an otherwise broad range of \"good books,\" the Court must conclude that the alternative means factor is \"clearly satisfied.\" <i>Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. at 418, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Impact of Accommodating the Asserted Right</i></h2>\n<p>Warden Fox contends that \"accommodating plaintiff's <i>request</i>\" for the return of purged library books will jeopardize prison security and inmate rehabilitation. (Def. Supp. Memo. at 13.) For purposes of the <i>Turner</i> analysis, however, only Cline's <i>rights</i> are at issue. Thus, the Court must consider how accommodating Cline's right to receive certain types of literature  not his desire for the replacement of all purged library books  will affect prison officials and inmates.</p>\n<p>Although Warden Fox misapprehends the extent of possible relief,<sup>[9]</sup> his arguments remain conclusory and unpersuasive. He fails to explain how allowing inmates to read books that have some literary value but describe sexual conduct will \"create an intolerable risk of disorder,\" even if the sexual references are <i>de minimus.</i> Likewise, he does not offer any evidence indicating that such books will \"detrimentally impact the rehabilitative programs and counseling\" of inmates who have committed sexual offenses. (Def. Supp. Memo. at 13.) Therefore, the Court finds that accommodating Cline's right is unlikely to have any significant negative impact on either prison officials or inmates. To the contrary, some of the otherwise prohibited literature may benefit inmates. <i>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108839\"><a href=\"/opinion/108839/paris-adult-theatre-i-v-slaton/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108839\"><a href=\"/opinion/108839/paris-adult-theatre-i-v-slaton/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Absence of Ready Alternatives</i></h2>\n<p>\"[I]f an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner's rights at <i>de minimus</i> cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.\" <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2254</span></a></span>. Cline maintains that a more narrowly drawn publications policy that considers the independent value of reading materials is a reasonable alternative. He also observes that several courts have upheld narrower regulations that sufficiently restrict access to sexually explicit materials. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Thornburgh v. Abbott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1874</span></a></span>, 104 L.Ed.2d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*695</span> 459 (1989); <i>Amatel v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758013\"><a href=\"/opinion/758013/joseph-amatel-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 194, 202 (D.C.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The <i>Abbott</i> case, in particular, vindicates Cline's assertion that ready alternatives to Policy Directive 503.00 exist. In <i>Abbott,</i> the Supreme Court upheld the facial validity of a federal prison regulation that permitted wardens to reject \"sexually explicit\" material involving (1) homosexuality, (2) sadomasochism, (3) bestiality, or (4) children. 490 U.S. at 405 n. 6, 419, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1874</span></a></span>. The first three categories of sexually explicit material could be admitted, however, if the warden determined that they did not \"pose a threat at the local institution\" or had \"scholarly, or general social or literary, value.\" <i>Id.</i> at 405 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1874</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The regulation in <i>Abbott</i> demonstrates that a warden can censor materials that jeopardize security and rehabilitation while also accommodating inmates' right to receive information. Although the regulation may not be suitable for St. Mary's (and thus need not be adopted verbatim), it offers one of many ready alternatives to Policy Directive 503.00, on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p>In sum, despite its legitimate objectives, DOC Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is irrational insofar as it bans \"sexually explicit\" reading material but allows commercial pornography. Nonetheless, Cline has alternative means to exercise his right to receive publications with some literary value. Accommodating his right to receive such books that also contain sexual references, however, is generally unlikely to endanger security or inmate rehabilitation.<sup>[10]</sup> Moreover, effective alternative regulations are readily available for the prison to implement and could alleviate the defendants' concerns.</p>\n<p>After weighing all of the <i>Turner</i> factors, the Court concludes that, to the extent that Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) prohibits all depictions of sexual conduct while permitting commercial pornography, it is not reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Thus, on its face and as applied, the policy impermissibly infringes Cline's constitutional right to receive information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Extent of Prospective Relief</h2>\n<p>Having found a constitutional violation, the Court must consider the appropriate remedy in the unique prison context. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A),</p>\n<blockquote>[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, the defendants must amend Policy Directive 503.00 in a manner consistent with this Court's orders and other governing federal law. Cline further demands replacement of all books removed from the prison library. (Compl. at 5.) This remedy, however, is not \"narrowly drawn.\" Indeed, if any of the purged books are similar to the Paper Wings series, as Cline has asserted, Warden Fox has no obligation to return them. <i>See </i><i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 501. Moreover, Cline has not indicated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*696</span> whether he wished to read all or just some of the 259 purged books.</p>\n<p>The proper relief in the case at bar must remedy the constitutional violation without usurping the discretion of the defendants. Because Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) is facially invalid, the library purge as conducted was unauthorized. <i>See </i><i>Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779114\"><a href=\"/opinion/779114/giovani-carandola-limited-a-north-carolina-corporation-janel-d-ralph-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 512 (4th Cir.2002). As discussed above, however, it is unlikely that Cline and the other St. Mary's inmates are entitled to every book removed by the prison staff. Therefore, the Court ORDERS defendants to amend their publications policy in a manner consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and Order and to screen the purged books under that amended policy before replacing the books on the prison library shelves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Based on the foregoing analysis,</p>\n<blockquote>1) The Court GRANTS the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to the library purge (dkt. no. 49) and DENIES the defendant's motion for summary judgment on this issue (dkt. nos. 47, 70).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2) The Court DECLARES that West Virginia Department of Corrections Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P), on its face and as applied, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments insofar as it prohibits books with any written depictions of sexual conduct but permits commercial pornography.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3) The Court ENJOINS the enforcement of Policy Directive 503.00(V)(P) to the extent it contravenes this Memorandum Opinion and Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4) The Court ORDERS the defendants to amend the policy in a manner consistent with this Court's orders and other governing federal law.</blockquote>\n<p>It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<p>The Clerk is directed to transmit copies of this Order to counsel of record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Appendix A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA DIVISION OF CORRECTIONS POLICY DIRECTIVE</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>NUMBER: 503.00</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DATE: 01 April 2000</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>SUBJECT: Mail Privileges for Inmates</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AUTHORITY: WV Code 25-1-5 25-1-18 and 62-13-4; ACA Standards 3-4429 through 3-4438</h2>\n<p>I.

Fox,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2516706/cline-v-fox/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span> (N.D.W.Va.2003), hereinafter referred to as \"<i>Cline I.</i>\"</p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Cline I,</i> the Court held that DOC Policy Directive 503.00, \"as applied to prohibit the plaintiff's possession of his Paper Wings [adult fiction] books, is constitutional.\" 266 F.Supp.2d at 501. At that stage in the litigation, however, Cline did not pursue a facial challenge to the policy, which is now squarely before the Court. The factual context of the as applied challenge in the case at bar is also readily distinguishable from that in <i>Cline I,</i> requiring a different legal analysis.</p>\n<p>[4]  Even if the removal of library books did not implicate Cline's constitutional rights, he could still assert his facial challenge to Policy Directive 503.00, which applies to inmates' personal possession of certain reading materials. <i>See </i><i>Newsom v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784644\"><a href=\"/opinion/784644/alan-newsom-a-minor-by-and-through-fred-newsom-his-parent-and-next-friend/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 257 (4th Cir.2003) (noting that, under the overbreadth doctrine, \"an individual may `challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not before the court  those who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid'\") (quoting <i>Bd. of Airport Comm'rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111923\"><a href=\"/opinion/111923/board-of-airport-commrs-of-los-angeles-v-jews-for-jesus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 574, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111923\"><a href=\"/opinion/111923/board-of-airport-commrs-of-los-angeles-v-jews-for-jesus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2568</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111923\"><a href=\"/opinion/111923/board-of-airport-commrs-of-los-angeles-v-jews-for-jesus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span> (1987)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Notwithstanding <i>Turner</i>'s guidance to engage in a multiple factor inquiry in cases involving prisoners' constitutional rights, the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit precedent cited here indicate that the legitimate objective/rational relationship test may be outcome determinative.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court observes, however, that prison officials did not remove the Bible from the library shelves. <i>But see, e.g.,</i> 2 Sam. 11:1-5 (The New Living Translation) (\"Late one afternoon David got out of bed after taking a nap and went for a stroll on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath.... Then David sent for her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her.\").</p>\n<p>[7]  The Modern Library named <i>Ulysses</i> the best novel of the twentieth century  despite its \"sexually explicit\" content. <i>See</i> The Modern Library, \"100 Best Novels,\" <i>at</i> http:// www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100best.html (last visited Apr. 8, 2004).</p>\n<p>[8]  Cline identified at least three such individuals: John Updike, Jane Smiley, and William Styron. (Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. at 8.) He also noted that prison officials removed books from several other best selling authors, including John Grisham, Scott Turow, Gore Vidal, Robert Ludlum, Sidney Sheldon, Judith Krantz, and Danielle Steele. (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>[9]  Indeed, as this Court has already ruled, the DOC's prohibition of certain sexually explicit adult fiction books is constitutionally permissible. <i>Cline I,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 501.</p>\n<p>[10]  Of course, prison officials may still forbid such books if they pose a threat to security, inhibit rehabilitation or otherwise promote disorder.</p>\n\n</div>",
