Boucher appeals from an order of the district court affirming\n\nthe Commissioner’s decision denying her application for Social Security benefits.\n\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) and we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n*\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to grant the parties’ request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and\ncollateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent\nwith Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                   I. Background\n\n      Ms. Boucher filed an application for Disability Insurance Benefits on\n\nOctober 10, 2005, alleging that she became disabled on May 10, 2003. The\n\nagency denied her application initially and on reconsideration. At her request,\n\nMs. Boucher received a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ). The ALJ determined that Ms. Boucher was severely impaired due to\n\nchronic pain syndrome, osteoarthritis, right shoulder impingement, hypertension,\n\nirritable bowel syndrome, and hypothyroidism. He also found that she had a\n\nnon-severe knee disorder and a non-severe depressive disorder. The ALJ\n\nconcluded, however, that Ms. Boucher did not have any impairment or\n\ncombination of impairments that equaled any impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part\n\n404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 and that she had the residual functional capacity to\n\nperform sedentary work. Although the ALJ found that Ms. Boucher could not\n\nreturn to her past work, he determined that she could perform a significant\n\nnumber of jobs in the national economy. As a result, the ALJ denied\n\nMs. Boucher’s application for benefits, concluding that she was not disabled at\n\nstep five of the analysis. See Williams v. Bowen, 844 F.2d 748, 75052 (10th Cir.\n\n1988) (explaining five-step process for evaluating claims for disability benefits).\n\nThe Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ’s decision the\n\nCommissioner’s final decision. Ms. Boucher appealed the ALJ’s decision to the\n\ndistrict court and that court affirmed the ALJ’s decision. This appeal followed.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                   II. Discussion\n\n      “We review the Commissioner’s decision to determine whether the factual\n\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the\n\ncorrect legal standards were applied.” Doyal v. Barnhart, 331 F.3d 758, 760\n\n(10th Cir. 2003). On appeal, Ms. Boucher argues that the ALJ erred in assessing\n\nher residual functional capacity (RFC), and in determining that she could perform\n\nother work at step five.\n\n      A. The RFC Determination\n\n      After considering all of the record evidence, the ALJ made the following\n\nRFC determination:\n\n      [T]he claimant is restricted by arthritis in the hands and spine and by\n      her shoulder impairment to sedentary work, or work which requires\n      lifting up to 10 pounds on an occasional basis, but lifting no more\n      than nominal weight on a frequent basis, sitting up to 6 hours of an\n      8-hour day, and standing and/or walking up to 2 hours of an 8-hour\n      day. The claimaint has nonexertional limitations precluding more\n      than occasional reaching, handling, or fingering with the right upper\n      extremity due to her shoulder impingement and cervicalgia. The\n      claimant must avoid exposure to temperature and humidity extremes.\n      She must also avoid exposure to vibration and to work hazards such\n      as unprotected heights or being around dangerous moving machinery\n      due to medication side effects.\n\nAdmin. R. at 20.\n\n      Ms. Boucher asserts that the ALJ erred in making her RFC determination\n\nbecause he erroneously evaluated (1) her mental impairment; (2) her\n\nhypothyroidism; (3) her pain and credibility; and (4) the opinion of her treating\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fphysician. In making the RFC assessment, an ALJ considers how an impairment,\n\nand any related symptoms, may cause physical and mental limitations that affect\n\nwhat a claimant can do in a work setting. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545(a)(1). The RFC\n\nrepresents “the most [a claimant] can still do despite [her] limitations.” Id. For\n\nthe following reasons, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in assessing\n\nMs. Boucher’s RFC.\n\n         1. Mental Impairment\n\n         Ms. Boucher argues that the ALJ erroneously evaluated her mental\n\nimpairment. Although she includes this argument in the section of her brief\n\nchallenging the ALJ’s step four RFC determination, she does not articulate how\n\nthis alleged error affected that determination. Instead, she appears to be\n\nchallenging the ALJ’s step two determination that her mental impairment is not\n\nsevere. See Aplt. Br. at 11-16. An impairment is “not severe if it does not\n\nsignificantly limit your physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.”\n\n20 C.F.R. 404.1521(a).\n\n         The ALJ explained that “[m]ental disorders are evaluated by their effects\n\non an individual’s daily activities, social functioning, and concentration,\n\npersistence, and pace, and any resulting episodes of decompensation.” Admin. R.\n\nat 17.    He then considered Ms. Boucher’s testimony and her medical records in\n\nevaluating each of these areas. For example, the ALJ noted that Ms. Boucher was\n\n“independent in living arrangements, travel, and shopping,” and “[s]he maintains\n\n                                          -4-\n\fa household for her family, which includes teenaged stepchildren, and does not\n\nrequire reminders for self care or medication.” Id. at 18. The ALJ therefore\n\nconcluded that Ms. Boucher “exhibits no more than mild restriction in activities\n\nof daily living.” Id. The ALJ further determined that Ms. Boucher did not\n\nexhibit more than mild difficulty maintaining social functioning or maintaining\n\nconcentration, persistence, or pace and that there was no evidence of repeated\n\nepisodes of extended decompensation. See id. at 19. Although the ALJ noted that\n\nMs. Boucher had seen a psychologist, Dr. Hertzler, who had assigned her a Global\n\nAssessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 55, 1 the ALJ discounted that score\n\nbecause it did not correspond to the essentially normal findings in the narrative\n\nportion of Dr. Hertzler’s evaluation. Because the evidence showed only mild\n\nlimitations in mental functioning, the ALJ found that Ms. Boucher did not have a\n\nsevere mental disorder. Ms. Boucher challenges this finding, focusing on the\n\nALJ’s consideration of Dr. Hertzler’s report.\n\n      Dr. Hertzler performed a one-hour consultative psychological evaluation on\n\nJune 20, 2006. In his report, he stated that Ms. Boucher was on-time for the\n\nmeeting, and that she was verbal and appropriate throughout the session. He also\n\ndescribed her as gregarious and friendly, although he did note that she explained\n\n\n1\n       A GAF score of 51-60 indicates “[m]oderate symptoms,” or “moderate\ndifficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning.” American Psychiatric\nAssociation, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Text\nRevision 4th ed. 2000) at 34.\n\n                                        -5-\n\flater in the session that she acted that way to cover up her feelings and issues. He\n\nindicated that she appeared of average intelligence, her mood was good, her\n\ninsight was “quite good” and she showed no signs of psychosis. Admin. R. at\n\n275. He noted that Ms. Boucher had described a troubled childhood, including\n\nsexual abuse. He reported that Ms. Boucher was responding well to medication,\n\nbut she wanted assistance in dealing with how her past abuse affected her recent\n\nremarriage. Dr. Hertzler’s initial diagnostic impression was that Ms. Boucher had\n\na moderate major depressive disorder, a posttraumatic stress disorder, a history of\n\nabuse, and a current and past year GAF score of 55.\n\n      Ms. Boucher did not return to see Dr. Hertzler after her initial appointment\n\nbecause she testified she did not want to “face those [painful] issues,” and it was\n\n“easier to keep it all locked in than to let it out.” Id. at 325. Other than this one\n\nvisit, there is no evidence that Ms. Boucher sought treatment for her allegedly\n\nsevere mental impairment. As the ALJ correctly noted, Dr. Hertzler’s GAF score\n\nappeared inconsistent with Dr. Hertzler’s essentially normal description of\n\nMs. Boucher from the appointment. The ALJ’s conclusion that Ms. Boucher’s\n\nmental impairment was not severe is supported by substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord, including Ms. Boucher’s testimony about her daily activities and level of\n\nfunctioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f      2. Hypothyroidism\n\n      Ms. Boucher next argues that the ALJ erred in evaluating her\n\nhypothyroidism because he did not include any limitations consistent with that\n\ncondition in her RFC. Although the ALJ concluded that Ms. Boucher’s\n\nhypothyroidism was a severe impairment, he noted that it had been under\n\nadequate control with medication. This conclusion is supported by the record\n\nevidence.\n\n      Ms. Boucher was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in June 2005 and she\n\nbegan taking Synthroid at that time to regulate her thyroid levels. She had some\n\nproblems with edema related to her hypothyroidism in the first few weeks after\n\nher initial diagnosis, but her doctor increased her Synthroid dose and there were\n\nno reported problems with edema after that time. She had a follow-up\n\nappointment with her endocrinologist, Dr. Youssef Hassan, in January 2006. He\n\nnoted that her last visit had been in July 2005 and he had to adjust her medication\n\nin between visits. Her labs were essentially normal in January 2006, although\n\nwith a slightly elevated TSH so Dr. Hassan modified her Synthroid dose again.\n\nThere are no further visits with Dr. Hassan in the record and no apparent changes\n\nin her medication.\n\n      At a June 2006 appointment with Dr. Joseph Luinstra, he noted that her\n\nhypothyroidism had been stable. Id. at 288. At an August 2006 visit with\n\nDr. Luinstra, he noted that her TSH was normal from May 31. Id. at 285.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fMs. Boucher confirmed that her thyroid had been doing well at an October 4,\n\n2006 appointment, although she complained of fatigue and wanted to have her\n\nlevels checked at that time. Id. at 284. At two subsequent visits on October 10,\n\n2006 and November 14, 2006 she denied excessive fatigue. See id. at 278, 282. 2\n\n      Although Ms. Boucher’s Synthroid dose had to be periodically adjusted\n\nafter her hypothyroidism was diagnosed in June 2005, that fact does not refute the\n\nALJ’s conclusion that her condition was adequately controlled by medication,\n\nwhich is supported by the record evidence. 3 Because Ms. Boucher’s\n\nhypothyroidism was generally under control with medication, the ALJ was not\n\nrequired to include any limitations from that condition in her RFC.\n\n\n2\n       Ms. Boucher argues that the October 16, 2006 comment where she denied\nexcessive fatigue was made when she was visiting the clinic to have her knee\nevaluated and therefore her comment more likely pertained to her fatigue level in\nrelation to her knee injury as opposed to her overall fatigue level. We disagree.\nAs the district correctly court noted in its order:\n\n      Dr. Luinstra’s notes segregate specific findings as to Boucher’s knee\n      in one section of his report. The statement as to the lack of fatigue\n      appears in a separate, general section of the report which is titled\n      “Constitutional” and also includes observations that Boucher denied\n      “change in appetite, weight loss, or diet change.”\n\nR. Vol. 1 at 180 (quoting Admin. R. at 282).\n3\n       Ms. Boucher now argues that the ALJ also erred by failing to address any\nlimitations in her RFC for the extended period of time when her hypothyroidism\nwas undiagnosed. See Aplt. Br. at 19-20. Because Ms. Boucher did not make this\nargument in the district court, see R. Vol. 1 at 22-24, we will not consider it for\nthe first time on appeal. See Crow v. Shalala, 40 F.3d 323, 324 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f      3. Pain and Credibility\n\n      Although the ALJ determined that Ms. Boucher’s impairments could\n\nreasonably be expected to produce her alleged symptoms, the ALJ concluded that\n\nher statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of her\n\nsymptoms were not entirely credible. Ms. Boucher asserts that the ALJ\n\nerroneously evaluated her credibility and symptoms of pain. “Credibility\n\ndeterminations are peculiarly the province of the finder of fact, and we will not\n\nupset such determinations when supported by substantial evidence.” Kepler v.\n\nChater, 68 F.3d 387, 391 (10th Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted).\n\n      The ALJ properly considered objective and subjective factors and gave\n\nsupporting reasons for his credibility determination. See id; see also 20 C.F.R.\n\n§ 404.1529 (discussing how ALJ evaluates symptoms such as pain). The ALJ\n\nnoted that the examination findings by Ms. Boucher’s physicians have been\n\nessentially negative since December 2005; that Ms. Boucher was able to\n\naccomplish most daily activities, including driving, household chores, cooking,\n\nshopping, and visiting; and that Ms. Boucher’s impairments were successfully\n\ntreated with medication. Despite Ms. Boucher’s argument to the contrary, the\n\nALJ did acknowledge and consider the fact that Ms. Boucher was diagnosed with\n\na pain syndrome. Admin. R. at 21. But the ALJ also indicated that the evidence,\n\nincluding Ms. Boucher’s reports to her doctors, showed that her pain was fairly\n\nwell controlled with medication. See id.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      The ALJ next discussed Ms. Boucher’s functional capacity evaluation\n\n(FCE) in which the physical therapist described Ms. Boucher’s behavior as\n\ninconsistent and self-limiting. The ALJ noted that the objective findings from the\n\nFCE did not correlate with Ms. Boucher’s performance during functional testing.\n\nThe ALJ further referenced medical evidence documenting visits from 2002,\n\n2003, 2005 and 2006 in which no swelling was reported, which contradicted\n\nMs. Boucher’s report of severe shoulder swelling with even the most minimal\n\nactivity. The ALJ also discussed contradictions between Ms. Boucher’s testimony\n\nat the hearing in regards to her pain and functional limitations with information\n\nshe reported to the physical therapist during her FCE. After considering all the\n\nevidence, the ALJ ultimately concluded that the claimant was only partially\n\ncredible because of the “totality of inconsistencies regarding objective findings\n\nand [Ms. Boucher’s] testimony” as well as the “contradictions between\n\n[Ms. Boucher’s] testimony and her reports to medical sources.” Id. at 23. We\n\nconclude that the ALJ’s credibility determination is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n      4. Treating Physician\n\n      Finally, Ms. Boucher argues that the ALJ erred in evaluating the opinion of\n\nher treating physician, Dr. Vello Kass. The ALJ gave controlling weight to\n\nDr. Kass’s recommendation that Ms. Boucher should be limited to sedentary work\n\nand should avoid repetitive use of her right upper extremity. But the ALJ did not\n\n                                        -10-\n\fgive controlling weight to Dr. Kass’s recommendation that Ms. Boucher would do\n\nbest with part-time work. The ALJ determined that Dr. Kass’s recommendation\n\nfor part-time work was based on Ms. Boucher’s self-report, which the ALJ found\n\nnot reliable. Ms. Boucher argues that it was error for the ALJ not to give\n\ncontrolling weight to all of Dr. Kass’s opinion.\n\n      Ms. Boucher’s initial argument is that the ALJ’s characterization of\n\nDr. Kass’s opinion is factually erroneous. She contends the record does not\n\nsupport the conclusion that Dr. Kass’s opinion about part-time work was based on\n\nher self-report. But the medical records from Dr. Kass do support the ALJ’s\n\ncharacterization. For example, in his examination report from September 9, 2003,\n\nDr. Kass notes that Ms. Boucher “feels she cannot work a 12 hour shift,” see id.\n\nat 172-73, and then on September 18, 2003, Dr. Kass limits Ms. Boucher to\n\nworking four to six hours a day, see id. at 171. Similarly, in his examination\n\nreport from June 14, 2004, he notes that Ms. Boucher “said she is not able to do\n\nher regular work,” see id. at 165, and he concludes his report by stating “[s]he\n\nwould probably do best with just part-time work,” id. at 164. There are no\n\nindependent observations by Dr. Kass that would support a conclusion that\n\nMs. Boucher could only work part-time.\n\n       Relying on McGoffin v. Barnhart, 288 F.3d 1248, 1252 (10th Cir. 2002),\n\nMs. Boucher next argues that it was error for the ALJ to reject a treating source\n\nopinion on the basis of the ALJ’s evaluation of the claimant’s credibility. First,\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwe note that the ALJ did not “reject” Dr. Kass’s opinion. Rather, the ALJ\n\nconducted the Watkins analysis 4 to determine what weight should be given to the\n\nopinion and ultimately concluded that the part of Dr. Kass’s opinion\n\nrecommending part-time work should not be given “substantial weight.” Admin.\n\nR. at 23-24. As the district court correctly noted,\n\n      [this] case is therefore unlike McGoffin, where an ALJ had refused to\n      consider the report of a treating physician based on the ALJ’s\n      subjective, “expressed doubt” that the physician had actually signed\n      the report, even though—as the Court of Appeals pointed out— there\n      was additional testimony from other witnesses, that the physician\n      agreed with the report . . . . Thus, the court in McGoffin was\n      addressing a case of outright rejection of a medical report, based\n      only [on] rank speculation as to its authorship. Here, the ALJ\n      conducted a proper credibility analysis and reached a permissible\n      conclusion that the claimant was less than fully credible. It was not\n      error for the ALJ to then use this conclusion as one factor among\n      several in reaching a secondary finding that Dr. Kass’s opinion\n      should be given less than controlling weight.\n\nR. Vol. 1 at 182-83.\n\n      Ms. Boucher argues also that the other reasons the ALJ gave for giving less\n\nweight to Dr. Kass’s opinion were erroneous. We again refer to the sound\n\nreasoning of the district court:\n\n      The ALJ correctly noted that the opinion by Dr. Kass restricting her\n      to part-time work is not otherwise corroborated by other medical\n      sources, was grounded on the subjective statements of a claimant\n      who has otherwise been found to be less than fully credible, and was\n\n\n4\n       See Watkins v. Barnhart, 350 F.3d 1297, 1300-1301 (10th Cir. 2003)\n(explaining factors for ALJ to consider when determining the appropriate weight\nto give to a treating physician’s opinion).\n\n                                        -12-\n\f       premised on an observation—that full-time work “seems to stress her\n       too much,” [Admin. R. at 162], which was a psychological\n       conclusion outside the orthopedic surgeon’s expertise. Boucher\n       suggests that the stress reference in Dr. Kass’s letter was physical\n       stress, and thus within his area of expertise. Read in context, the\n       stress in the report appears to be psychological in nature, with Dr.\n       Kass deferring to conclusions offered by the pain specialist,\n       Dr. Goel.\n\nId. at 182. We therefore agree with the district court’s conclusion that the ALJ\n\ndid not err in declining to give controlling weight to all facets of Dr. Kass’s\n\nopinion. 5\n\n       B. The Step Five Determination\n\n       Ms. Boucher asserts the ALJ erroneously found that she could perform\n\nother work at step five of the sequential evaluation process. She argues the\n\nagency did not provide evidence of a “significant” number of jobs that she could\n\nperform. But Ms. Boucher focuses her argument on the jobs that are available in\n\nher local region when the proper inquiry is whether a significant number of jobs\n\nexist in the national economy. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(c), 404.1566(a).\n\n\n\n\n5\n       Ms. Boucher also contends that the ALJ had a duty to recontact her treating\nphysician. We disagree. The ALJ properly recognized that the duty to recontact\na treating physician occurs when the evidence submitted is inadequate. See\nAdmin. R. at 24. The ALJ concluded, however, that the records submitted by\nDr. Kass were adequate for consideration but that they were not persuasive in\nshowing that Ms. Boucher could not engage in full-time employment. See id.\nThis reasoning is consistent with our decision in White v. Barnhart, 287 F.3d 903,\n908 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                         -13-\n\f      When the ALJ concludes that a claimant cannot perform her past work, he\n\nmust then decide whether a claimant can adjust to other work considering her\n\nRFC and other vocational factors. “Any other work (jobs) that [a claimant] can\n\nadjust to must exist in significant numbers in the national economy (either in the\n\nregion where [the claimant lives] or in several regions in the country).” Id.\n\n§ 404.1560(c)(1). The regulations expressly provide that: “It does not matter\n\nwhether-- (1) Work exists in the immediate area in which [the claimant lives];\n\n(2) A specific job vacancy exists for [the claimant]; or (3) [The claimant] would\n\nbe hired if [she] applied for work.” Id. § 404.1566(a). Based on the testimony of\n\nthe Vocational Expert, the ALJ found that Ms. Boucher could work as either a\n\ncharge account clerk, with 190,390 jobs in the national economy, 2,000 in\n\nKansas, and 190 in the local region; or a call out operator with 79,400 jobs in the\n\nnational economy, 550 in Kansas, and 30 in the local region. Ms. Boucher has\n\nnot demonstrated that the ALJ erred in concluding that there were a significant\n\nnumber of jobs she could perform in the national economy.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                                    Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                    Bobby R.

This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and\ncollateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent\nwith Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                   I. Background\n\n      Ms. Boucher filed an application for Disability Insurance Benefits on\n\nOctober 10, 2005, alleging that she became disabled on May 10, 2003. The\n\nagency denied her application initially and on reconsideration. At her request,\n\nMs. Boucher received a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ). The ALJ determined that Ms. Boucher was severely impaired due to\n\nchronic pain syndrome, osteoarthritis, right shoulder impingement, hypertension,\n\nirritable bowel syndrome, and hypothyroidism. He also found that she had a\n\nnon-severe knee disorder and a non-severe depressive disorder. The ALJ\n\nconcluded, however, that Ms. Boucher did not have any impairment or\n\ncombination of impairments that equaled any impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part\n\n404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 and that she had the residual functional capacity to\n\nperform sedentary work. Although the ALJ found that Ms. Boucher could not\n\nreturn to her past work, he determined that she could perform a significant\n\nnumber of jobs in the national economy. As a result, the ALJ denied\n\nMs. Boucher’s application for benefits, concluding that she was not disabled at\n\nstep five of the analysis. See Williams v. Bowen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504496\"><a href=\"/opinion/504496/21-socsecrepser-337-unemplinsrep-cch-179747-glen-w-williams-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75052 (10th Cir.\n\n1988) (explaining five-step process for evaluating claims for disability benefits).\n\nThe Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ’s decision the\n\nCommissioner’s final decision. Ms. Boucher appealed the ALJ’s decision to the\n\ndistrict court and that court affirmed the ALJ’s decision. This appeal followed.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                   II.

Barnhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163548\"><a href=\"/opinion/163548/doyal-v-barnhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760\n\n(10th Cir. 2003). On appeal, Ms. Boucher argues that the ALJ erred in assessing\n\nher residual functional capacity (RFC), and in determining that she could perform\n\nother work at step five.\n\n      A. The RFC Determination\n\n      After considering all of the record evidence, the ALJ made the following\n\nRFC determination:\n\n      [T]he claimant is restricted by arthritis in the hands and spine and by\n      her shoulder impairment to sedentary work, or work which requires\n      lifting up to 10 pounds on an occasional basis, but lifting no more\n      than nominal weight on a frequent basis, sitting up to 6 hours of an\n      8-hour day, and standing and/or walking up to 2 hours of an 8-hour\n      day. The claimaint has nonexertional limitations precluding more\n      than occasional reaching, handling, or fingering with the right upper\n      extremity due to her shoulder impingement and cervicalgia. The\n      claimant must avoid exposure to temperature and humidity extremes.\n      She must also avoid exposure to vibration and to work hazards such\n      as unprotected heights or being around dangerous moving machinery\n      due to medication side effects.\n\nAdmin. R. at 20.\n\n      Ms. Boucher asserts that the ALJ erred in making her RFC determination\n\nbecause he erroneously evaluated (1) her mental impairment; (2) her\n\nhypothyroidism; (3) her pain and credibility; and (4) the opinion of her treating\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fphysician. In making the RFC assessment, an ALJ considers how an impairment,\n\nand any related symptoms, may cause physical and mental limitations that affect\n\nwhat a claimant can do in a work setting. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545(a)(1). The RFC\n\nrepresents “the most [a claimant] can still do despite [her] limitations.” Id. For\n\nthe following reasons, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in assessing\n\nMs. Boucher’s RFC.\n\n         1. Mental Impairment\n\n         Ms. Boucher argues that the ALJ erroneously evaluated her mental\n\nimpairment. Although she includes this argument in the section of her brief\n\nchallenging the ALJ’s step four RFC determination, she does not articulate how\n\nthis alleged error affected that determination. Instead, she appears to be\n\nchallenging the ALJ’s step two determination that her mental impairment is not\n\nsevere. See Aplt. Br. at 11-16. An impairment is “not severe if it does not\n\nsignificantly limit your physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.”\n\n20 C.F.R. 404.1521(a).\n\n         The ALJ explained that “[m]ental disorders are evaluated by their effects\n\non an individual’s daily activities, social functioning, and concentration,\n\npersistence, and pace, and any resulting episodes of decompensation.” Admin. R.\n\nat 17.    He then considered Ms. Boucher’s testimony and her medical records in\n\nevaluating each of these areas. For example, the ALJ noted that Ms. Boucher was\n\n“independent in living arrangements, travel, and shopping,” and “[s]he maintains\n\n                                          -4-\n\fa household for her family, which includes teenaged stepchildren, and does not\n\nrequire reminders for self care or medication.” Id. at 18. The ALJ therefore\n\nconcluded that Ms. Boucher “exhibits no more than mild restriction in activities\n\nof daily living.” Id. The ALJ further determined that Ms. Boucher did not\n\nexhibit more than mild difficulty maintaining social functioning or maintaining\n\nconcentration, persistence, or pace and that there was no evidence of repeated\n\nepisodes of extended decompensation. See id. at 19. Although the ALJ noted that\n\nMs. Boucher had seen a psychologist, Dr. Hertzler, who had assigned her a Global\n\nAssessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 55, 1 the ALJ discounted that score\n\nbecause it did not correspond to the essentially normal findings in the narrative\n\nportion of Dr. Hertzler’s evaluation. Because the evidence showed only mild\n\nlimitations in mental functioning, the ALJ found that Ms. Boucher did not have a\n\nsevere mental disorder. Ms. Boucher challenges this finding, focusing on the\n\nALJ’s consideration of Dr. Hertzler’s report.\n\n      Dr. Hertzler performed a one-hour consultative psychological evaluation on\n\nJune 20, 2006. In his report, he stated that Ms. Boucher was on-time for the\n\nmeeting, and that she was verbal and appropriate throughout the session. He also\n\ndescribed her as gregarious and friendly, although he did note that she explained\n\n\n1\n       A GAF score of 51-60 indicates “[m]oderate symptoms,” or “moderate\ndifficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning.” American Psychiatric\nAssociation, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Text\nRevision 4th ed. 2000) at 34.\n\n                                        -5-\n\flater in the session that she acted that way to cover up her feelings and issues. He\n\nindicated that she appeared of average intelligence, her mood was good, her\n\ninsight was “quite good” and she showed no signs of psychosis. Admin. R. at\n\n275. He noted that Ms. Boucher had described a troubled childhood, including\n\nsexual abuse. He reported that Ms. Boucher was responding well to medication,\n\nbut she wanted assistance in dealing with how her past abuse affected her recent\n\nremarriage. Dr. Hertzler’s initial diagnostic impression was that Ms. Boucher had\n\na moderate major depressive disorder, a posttraumatic stress disorder, a history of\n\nabuse, and a current and past year GAF score of 55.\n\n      Ms. Boucher did not return to see Dr. Hertzler after her initial appointment\n\nbecause she testified she did not want to “face those [painful] issues,” and it was\n\n“easier to keep it all locked in than to let it out.” Id. at 325. Other than this one\n\nvisit, there is no evidence that Ms. Boucher sought treatment for her allegedly\n\nsevere mental impairment. As the ALJ correctly noted, Dr. Hertzler’s GAF score\n\nappeared inconsistent with Dr. Hertzler’s essentially normal description of\n\nMs. Boucher from the appointment. The ALJ’s conclusion that Ms. Boucher’s\n\nmental impairment was not severe is supported by substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord, including Ms. Boucher’s testimony about her daily activities and level of\n\nfunctioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f      2. Hypothyroidism\n\n      Ms. Boucher next argues that the ALJ erred in evaluating her\n\nhypothyroidism because he did not include any limitations consistent with that\n\ncondition in her RFC. Although the ALJ concluded that Ms. Boucher’s\n\nhypothyroidism was a severe impairment, he noted that it had been under\n\nadequate control with medication. This conclusion is supported by the record\n\nevidence.\n\n      Ms. Boucher was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in June 2005 and she\n\nbegan taking Synthroid at that time to regulate her thyroid levels. She had some\n\nproblems with edema related to her hypothyroidism in the first few weeks after\n\nher initial diagnosis, but her doctor increased her Synthroid dose and there were\n\nno reported problems with edema after that time. She had a follow-up\n\nappointment with her endocrinologist, Dr. Youssef Hassan, in January 2006. He\n\nnoted that her last visit had been in July 2005 and he had to adjust her medication\n\nin between visits. Her labs were essentially normal in January 2006, although\n\nwith a slightly elevated TSH so Dr. Hassan modified her Synthroid dose again.\n\nThere are no further visits with Dr. Hassan in the record and no apparent changes\n\nin her medication.\n\n      At a June 2006 appointment with Dr. Joseph Luinstra, he noted that her\n\nhypothyroidism had been stable. Id. at 288. At an August 2006 visit with\n\nDr. Luinstra, he noted that her TSH was normal from May 31. Id. at 285.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fMs. Boucher confirmed that her thyroid had been doing well at an October 4,\n\n2006 appointment, although she complained of fatigue and wanted to have her\n\nlevels checked at that time. Id. at 284. At two subsequent visits on October 10,\n\n2006 and November 14, 2006 she denied excessive fatigue. See id. at 278, 282. 2\n\n      Although Ms. Boucher’s Synthroid dose had to be periodically adjusted\n\nafter her hypothyroidism was diagnosed in June 2005, that fact does not refute the\n\nALJ’s conclusion that her condition was adequately controlled by medication,\n\nwhich is supported by the record evidence. 3 Because Ms. Boucher’s\n\nhypothyroidism was generally under control with medication, the ALJ was not\n\nrequired to include any limitations from that condition in her RFC.\n\n\n2\n       Ms. Boucher argues that the October 16, 2006 comment where she denied\nexcessive fatigue was made when she was visiting the clinic to have her knee\nevaluated and therefore her comment more likely pertained to her fatigue level in\nrelation to her knee injury as opposed to her overall fatigue level. We disagree.\nAs the district correctly court noted in its order:\n\n      Dr. Luinstra’s notes segregate specific findings as to Boucher’s knee\n      in one section of his report. The statement as to the lack of fatigue\n      appears in a separate, general section of the report which is titled\n      “Constitutional” and also includes observations that Boucher denied\n      “change in appetite, weight loss, or diet change.”\n\nR. Vol. 1 at 180 (quoting Admin. R. at 282).\n3\n       Ms. Boucher now argues that the ALJ also erred by failing to address any\nlimitations in her RFC for the extended period of time when her hypothyroidism\nwas undiagnosed. See Aplt. Br. at 19-20. Because Ms. Boucher did not make this\nargument in the district court, see R. Vol. 1 at 22-24, we will not consider it for\nthe first time on appeal. See Crow v. Shalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682498\"><a href=\"/opinion/682498/46-socsecrepser-148-unemplinsrep-cch-p-14180b-larry-crow-v-donna/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f      3. Pain and Credibility\n\n      Although the ALJ determined that Ms. Boucher’s impairments could\n\nreasonably be expected to produce her alleged symptoms, the ALJ concluded that\n\nher statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of her\n\nsymptoms were not entirely credible. Ms. Boucher asserts that the ALJ\n\nerroneously evaluated her credibility and symptoms of pain. “Credibility\n\ndeterminations are peculiarly the province of the finder of fact, and we will not\n\nupset such determinations when supported by substantial evidence.” Kepler v.\n\nChater, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706113\"><a href=\"/opinion/706113/49-socsecrepser-246-unemplinsrep-cch-p-14823b-ramona-kepler-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (10th Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted).\n\n      The ALJ properly considered objective and subjective factors and gave\n\nsupporting reasons for his credibility determination. See id; see also 20 C.F.R.\n\n§ 404.1529 (discussing how ALJ evaluates symptoms such as pain). The ALJ\n\nnoted that the examination findings by Ms. Boucher’s physicians have been\n\nessentially negative since December 2005; that Ms. Boucher was able to\n\naccomplish most daily activities, including driving, household chores, cooking,\n\nshopping, and visiting; and that Ms. Boucher’s impairments were successfully\n\ntreated with medication. Despite Ms. Boucher’s argument to the contrary, the\n\nALJ did acknowledge and consider the fact that Ms. Boucher was diagnosed with\n\na pain syndrome. Admin. R. at 21. But the ALJ also indicated that the evidence,\n\nincluding Ms. Boucher’s reports to her doctors, showed that her pain was fairly\n\nwell controlled with medication. See id.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      The ALJ next discussed Ms. Boucher’s functional capacity evaluation\n\n(FCE) in which the physical therapist described Ms. Boucher’s behavior as\n\ninconsistent and self-limiting. The ALJ noted that the objective findings from the\n\nFCE did not correlate with Ms. Boucher’s performance during functional testing.\n\nThe ALJ further referenced medical evidence documenting visits from 2002,\n\n2003, 2005 and 2006 in which no swelling was reported, which contradicted\n\nMs. Boucher’s report of severe shoulder swelling with even the most minimal\n\nactivity. The ALJ also discussed contradictions between Ms. Boucher’s testimony\n\nat the hearing in regards to her pain and functional limitations with information\n\nshe reported to the physical therapist during her FCE. After considering all the\n\nevidence, the ALJ ultimately concluded that the claimant was only partially\n\ncredible because of the “totality of inconsistencies regarding objective findings\n\nand [Ms. Boucher’s] testimony” as well as the “contradictions between\n\n[Ms. Boucher’s] testimony and her reports to medical sources.” Id. at 23. We\n\nconclude that the ALJ’s credibility determination is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n      4. Treating Physician\n\n      Finally, Ms. Boucher argues that the ALJ erred in evaluating the opinion of\n\nher treating physician, Dr. Vello Kass. The ALJ gave controlling weight to\n\nDr. Kass’s recommendation that Ms. Boucher should be limited to sedentary work\n\nand should avoid repetitive use of her right upper extremity. But the ALJ did not\n\n                                        -10-\n\fgive controlling weight to Dr. Kass’s recommendation that Ms. Boucher would do\n\nbest with part-time work. The ALJ determined that Dr. Kass’s recommendation\n\nfor part-time work was based on Ms. Boucher’s self-report, which the ALJ found\n\nnot reliable. Ms. Boucher argues that it was error for the ALJ not to give\n\ncontrolling weight to all of Dr. Kass’s opinion.\n\n      Ms. Boucher’s initial argument is that the ALJ’s characterization of\n\nDr. Kass’s opinion is factually erroneous. She contends the record does not\n\nsupport the conclusion that Dr. Kass’s opinion about part-time work was based on\n\nher self-report. But the medical records from Dr. Kass do support the ALJ’s\n\ncharacterization. For example, in his examination report from September 9, 2003,\n\nDr. Kass notes that Ms. Boucher “feels she cannot work a 12 hour shift,” see id.\n\nat 172-73, and then on September 18, 2003, Dr. Kass limits Ms. Boucher to\n\nworking four to six hours a day, see id. at 171. Similarly, in his examination\n\nreport from June 14, 2004, he notes that Ms. Boucher “said she is not able to do\n\nher regular work,” see id. at 165, and he concludes his report by stating “[s]he\n\nwould probably do best with just part-time work,” id. at 164. There are no\n\nindependent observations by Dr. Kass that would support a conclusion that\n\nMs. Boucher could only work part-time.\n\n       Relying on McGoffin v. Barnhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777528\"><a href=\"/opinion/777528/shelley-a-mcgoffin-v-jo-anne-b-barnhart-commissioner-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1252 (10th Cir. 2002),\n\nMs. Boucher next argues that it was error for the ALJ to reject a treating source\n\nopinion on the basis of the ALJ’s evaluation of the claimant’s credibility. First,\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwe note that the ALJ did not “reject” Dr. Kass’s opinion. Rather, the ALJ\n\nconducted the Watkins analysis 4 to determine what weight should be given to the\n\nopinion and ultimately concluded that the part of Dr. Kass’s opinion\n\nrecommending part-time work should not be given “substantial weight.” Admin.\n\nR. at 23-24. As the district court correctly noted,\n\n      [this] case is therefore unlike McGoffin, where an ALJ had refused to\n      consider the report of a treating physician based on the ALJ’s\n      subjective, “expressed doubt” that the physician had actually signed\n      the report, even though—as the Court of Appeals pointed out— there\n      was additional testimony from other witnesses, that the physician\n      agreed with the report . . . . Thus, the court in McGoffin was\n      addressing a case of outright rejection of a medical report, based\n      only [on] rank speculation as to its authorship. Here, the ALJ\n      conducted a proper credibility analysis and reached a permissible\n      conclusion that the claimant was less than fully credible. It was not\n      error for the ALJ to then use this conclusion as one factor among\n      several in reaching a secondary finding that Dr. Kass’s opinion\n      should be given less than controlling weight.\n\nR. Vol. 1 at 182-83.\n\n      Ms. Boucher argues also that the other reasons the ALJ gave for giving less\n\nweight to Dr. Kass’s opinion were erroneous. We again refer to the sound\n\nreasoning of the district court:\n\n      The ALJ correctly noted that the opinion by Dr. Kass restricting her\n      to part-time work is not otherwise corroborated by other medical\n      sources, was grounded on the subjective statements of a claimant\n      who has otherwise been found to be less than fully credible, and was\n\n\n4\n       See Watkins v.

R. at 162], which was a psychological\n       conclusion outside the orthopedic surgeon’s expertise. Boucher\n       suggests that the stress reference in Dr. Kass’s letter was physical\n       stress, and thus within his area of expertise. Read in context, the\n       stress in the report appears to be psychological in nature, with Dr.\n       Kass deferring to conclusions offered by the pain specialist,\n       Dr. Goel.\n\nId. at 182. We therefore agree with the district court’s conclusion that the ALJ\n\ndid not err in declining to give controlling weight to all facets of Dr. Kass’s\n\nopinion. 5\n\n       B. The Step Five Determination\n\n       Ms. Boucher asserts the ALJ erroneously found that she could perform\n\nother work at step five of the sequential evaluation process. She argues the\n\nagency did not provide evidence of a “significant” number of jobs that she could\n\nperform. But Ms. Boucher focuses her argument on the jobs that are available in\n\nher local region when the proper inquiry is whether a significant number of jobs\n\nexist in the national economy. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(c), 404.1566(a).\n\n\n\n\n5\n       Ms. Boucher also contends that the ALJ had a duty to recontact her treating\nphysician. We disagree. The ALJ properly recognized that the duty to recontact\na treating physician occurs when the evidence submitted is inadequate. See\nAdmin. R. at 24. The ALJ concluded, however, that the records submitted by\nDr. Kass were adequate for consideration but that they were not persuasive in\nshowing that Ms. Boucher could not engage in full-time employment. See id.\nThis reasoning is consistent with our decision in White v. Barnhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777394\"><a href=\"/opinion/777394/barbara-j-white-v-joanne-b-barnhart-commissioner-of-the-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n908 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                         -13-\n\f      When the ALJ concludes that a claimant cannot perform her past work, he\n\nmust then decide whether a claimant can adjust to other work considering her\n\nRFC and other vocational factors. “Any other work (jobs) that [a claimant] can\n\nadjust to must exist in significant numbers in the national economy (either in the\n\nregion where [the claimant lives] or in several regions in the country).” Id.\n\n§ 404.1560(c)(1). The regulations expressly provide that: “It does not matter\n\nwhether-- (1) Work exists in the immediate area in which [the claimant lives];\n\n(2) A specific job vacancy exists for [the claimant]; or (3) [The claimant] would\n\nbe hired if [she] applied for work.” Id. § 404.1566(a). Based on the testimony of\n\nthe Vocational Expert, the ALJ found that Ms. Boucher could work as either a\n\ncharge account clerk, with 190,390 jobs in the national economy, 2,000 in\n\nKansas, and 190 in the local region; or a call out operator with 79,400 jobs in the\n\nnational economy, 550 in Kansas, and 30 in the local region. Ms. Boucher has\n\nnot demonstrated that the ALJ erred in concluding that there were a significant\n\nnumber of jobs she could perform in the national economy.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                                    Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                    Bobby R.
