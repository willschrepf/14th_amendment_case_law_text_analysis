Degen, CATAWBA\nVALLEY LEGAL SERVICES, INC., Morganton, North Carolina, for\nAppellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge:\n\nThe district court refused to terminate a consent order, which the\nparties entered into in 1992, which became fully effective in 1994,\nand which provided that the court would retain jurisdiction over its\nsubject matter until 1998. We affirm.\n\nI.\n\nThis case is a class action by applicants for Aid to Families with\nDependent Children (AFDC) and Medical Assistance (Medicaid)\nagainst state officials responsible for the administration of these pro-\ngrams in North Carolina and their agents, the administrators of the\none hundred North Carolina county departments of social services.\nSince the inception of this case in 1974, the applicants have alleged,\nand the district court has repeatedly found, that the administrators\nhave failed to comply with federal regulations concerning the pro-\ncessing of aid applications.\n\nThe administrators have been subject to numerous court orders and\nsettlement agreements, all designed to encourage them to comply with\nfederal law. The present conflict relates solely to a 1992 consent\norder, the terms of which the parties negotiated for many months. The\nstated purpose of the consent order was to bring all local social ser-\nvice departments \"into compliance with the requirement in federal\nlaw to timely process AFDC and Medicaid applications without\nimproper discouragement, denial or withdrawal of those applica-\ntions.\" Pursuant to that purpose, the administrators agreed, inter alia,\nto meet the deadlines federal regulations mandate for processing\n\n                     2\n\fapplications, see 42 C.F.R. ยง 435.911; 45 C.F.R. ยง 206.10, and to\nmonitor local departments' compliance. To calculate compliance, the\nparties agreed to substitute \"hard\" numbers where federal regulations\nwere less quantifiable.1 The requirements of the consent order were\nphased in beginning August, 1992 and took full effect on January 1,\n1994. The consent order also included a \"sunset provision,\" in which\nthe parties agreed that the district court would retain jurisdiction \"for\na period of six years from entry of this order,\" i.e., from August 1,\n1992 until August 1, 1998.\n\nIn August, 1994, the administrators filed a motion to modify the\nconsent order pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. The administrators asserted that \"unforeseen factual condi-\ntions resulting in unanticipated consequences have made implementa-\ntion and compliance with the . . . consent order substantially more\nonerous and unworkable . . . .\" The administrators maintained that the\nstandard the Supreme Court employed in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail, 502 U.S. 367 (1992), applied to their motion and entitled\nthem to a modification of the consent order. In the administrators'\nview, the Rufo standard was the \"proper standard for modification or\ntermination of consent decrees under Rule 60(b).\" (emphasis added).\nThe applicants opposed the motion, maintaining that the administra-\ntors could not meet the Rufo standard.\n\nIn March, 1995, without replying to the applicants' opposition or\nobtaining a ruling on the modification motion, the administrators filed\na second Rule 60(b) motion, this time requesting that the district court\nterminate the consent order. Seven months after asserting that compli-\nance with the consent order was impossible because its terms were\n\"onerous\" and \"unworkable,\" the administrators now claimed that\nthey had \"complied in good faith\" with the consent order. Rather than\nthe Rufo standard they had previously urged on the court, the adminis-\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 For example, if the regulations required completion of processing in\nforty-five days except in \"unusual circumstances,\" the consent order\nwould require local departments to process ninety percent of the applica-\ntions within forty-five days but permits ten percent of the applications to\nexceed the forty-five day requirement (i.e., the ten percent \"hard\" number\ntakes the place of the less quantifiable \"unusual circumstances\" excep-\ntion).\n\n                     3\n\ftrators asserted that the proper standard for evaluating their termina-\ntion motion was set forth in Board of Education of Oklahoma City\nPublic Schools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237 (1991). Under the Dowell\nstandard, the administrators maintained that their good faith compli-\nance with the consent order warranted its termination. They further\ninformed the court that they had devised a plan to\"ensure timely and\nefficient service to AFDC and Medicaid applicants,\" and represented\nthat they would implement the plan if the court terminated the consent\norder.\n\nThe district court denied the administrators' motion to terminate.\nThe court noted the parties' specific agreement in the 1992 consent\norder that the court would retain jurisdiction over the parties and \"the\nsubject matter of this action for a period of six years.\" Citing Rufo,\nthe court found that the administrators were not entitled to relief from\nthe order because they had failed to establish the existence of a \"sig-\nnificant change in factual conditions or in the law\" or to demonstrate\nthat their proposed alternative plan was \"suitably tailored\" to any\nchanged circumstance.\n\nOn appeal, the administrators argue that the district court erred in\napplying what they characterize as the \"more stringent\" Rufo stan-\ndard, rather than the Dowell standard; they maintain that had the court\nproperly applied the Dowell standard, they would have been entitled\nto termination of the consent order. These arguments exhibit both a\nfundamental misunderstanding of Dowell and Rufo and an effort to\ndisregard the undisputed facts of the case at hand.\n\nII.\n\nThe standards employed in Dowell and Rufo are but variations on\na single theme. Both are grounded in the established general equity\npowers of the federal courts. Those powers, now formalized in Rule\n60(b), which provided the basis for the motions made in Dowell,\nRufo, and the case at hand, permit courts to grant parties relief from\nfinal judgments that have prospective effect. Rule 60(b) states, in per-\ntinent part, that on \"such terms as are just\" a court may \"relieve a\nparty\" from a judgment or order \"where it is no longer equitable\" that\nthe judgment have \"prospective application.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5),\n(6). Accordingly, when confronted with any motion invoking this\n\n                    4\n\frule, a district court's task is to determine whether it remains equita-\nble for the judgment at issue to apply prospectively and, if not, to\nrelieve the parties of some or all of the burdens of that judgment on\n\"such terms as are just.\"\n\nThe administrators seek to place Dowell and Rufo in separate com-\npartments, with Dowell setting forth the standard to be applied when\nconsidering any and every motion to terminate a decree, and Rufo set-\nting forth a \"more stringent\" standard for any and every motion to\nmodify. However, a holding that motions to modify always require\nsatisfaction of a more stringent standard than motions to terminate\nwould be illogical. To adopt the administrators' argument would\nmean that the Supreme Court has mandated that the standard a party\nmust meet to obtain the less serious remedy -- modification of a per-\nmanent injunction -- in every case is more rigorous than that needed\nto obtain the more drastic remedy -- termination of such an injunction.2\nIn fact, examination of Dowell and Rufo makes clear that while the\nRufo standard differs from the Dowell standard, it is hardly \"more\nstringent.\" Analysis of these cases demonstrates that the Court articu-\nlated different standards not, as the administrators suggest, in\nresponse to the differences in the remedies requested (termination\nversus modification) but in recognition of the differences in the char-\nacter and purposes of the injunctions at issue in the two cases. The\nadministrators' myopic focus on the remedy requested ignores the\ngenesis of Dowell and Rufo and the flexibility that they teach.\n\nPrior to Dowell and Rufo, federal courts generally looked to United\nStates v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106 (1932), for the standard to apply\nwhen reviewing motions to terminate or modify permanent injunc-\ntions. Swift involved an antitrust consent decree, in which meatpack-\ning companies agreed to an injunction against certain monopolistic\npractices. Ten years later, the companies sought a modification of the\ndecree, which the district court granted in part. The Supreme Court\nreversed, explaining: \"Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous\nwrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 Indisputably, modification is a less drastic remedy than termination of\na consent decree. See, e.g., Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rufo, 12\nF.3d 286, 294 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"lesser remedy of decree modification\");\nJordan v. School Dist., 548 F.2d 117, 122 (3d Cir. 1977).\n\n                     5\n\fchange what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of\nall concerned.\" Id. at 119. Some courts, including this one, recognized\nthat Swift permitted a more flexible approach when a party sought\nrelief from decrees \"directed to events to come\" rather than at \"fully\naccrued\" rights. See Nelson v. Collins, 659 F.2d 420, 424 (4th Cir.\n1981) (en banc) (quoting Swift, 286 U.S. at 114). However, for the\nmost part, federal courts applied the Swift\"grievous wrong\" standard\nrigidly, leading them almost invariably to deny motions to terminate\nor modify permanent injunctions.\n\nIn its 1991 Dowell decision, the Supreme Court held that the Swift\n\"grievous wrong\" standard was not \"the proper standard to apply to\ninjunctions entered in school desegregation cases.\" Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 248.3 The Court reasoned that because school desegregation\ndecrees were intended as \"temporary measure[s] to remedy past dis-\ncrimination\" and were \"not intended to operate in perpetuity,\" a more\nflexible approach was warranted. Id. at 247. The Court distinguished\nSwift as a case involving a \"continuing danger\" that the party asking\nfor the modification would revert to its prior illegal conduct. Id. (cit-\ning United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 248\n(1968)). Because the court-imposed decree in Dowell was aimed pri-\nmarily at remedying past unconstitutional conduct, and no evidence\nindicated that the local authority would revert to its former illegal\nbehavior, the Court held that to obtain relief the local authority need\nnot demonstrate the existence of a \"grievous wrong\" caused by \"new\nand unforeseen conditions.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247. In the context\nof deciding whether to \"modify or dissolve a desegregation decree,\"\nthe Supreme Court directed that Rule 60(b) relief should be granted\nif the local authority could establish that (1) it had \"complied in good\nfaith with the desegregation decree\" (2) its compliance had lasted for\n\"a reasonable period of time\" and (3) \"the vestiges of past discrimina-\ntion had been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Id. at 249-50.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 Dowell was foreshadowed by similar holdings of this and other\ncourts. See, e.g., Riddick v. School Bd., 784 F.2d 521, 538-39 (4th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 479 U.S. 938 (1986); Vaughns v. Board of Educ., 758 F.2d\n983, 988 (4th Cir. 1985); Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ., 611\nF.2d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\n                    6\n\fThe very next term, the Supreme Court, noting that it was sounding\n\"the same theme\" as in Dowell, again rejected the Swift \"grievous\nwrong\" test in favor of a more \"flexible\" approach. Rufo, 502 U.S. at\n380. Rufo involved a consent decree between prisoners and local\nprison authorities. The authorities moved to modify the decree\nbecause they believed a change in the factual circumstances had made\ncompliance much more difficult. The lower courts refused to modify\nthe decree; the Supreme Court reversed. The Court noted initially that\nthe \"ability of a district court to modify a decree in response to\nchanged circumstances\" was particularly important in \"institutional\nreform litigation.\" Id. The Court emphasized, however, that \"a party\nmay obtain relief from a court order when `it is no longer equitable\nthat the judgment should have prospective application,' not when it\nis no longer convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.\"\nId. at 383 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. 60 (b)(5)). Thus, even though a more\nflexible approach than Swift was warranted, in order to obtain the\nmodification a party must demonstrate that (1) a\"significant change\"\nin the law or facts \"warrants revision of the decree\" and (2) the pro-\nposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.\nId.\n\nAlthough in Dowell and Rufo the Court set forth different stan-\ndards, its approach was the same. In both cases, the Court eschewed\nSwift's rigid \"grievous wrong\" standard in favor of a more flexible\napproach appropriate to the situation. In both, the Court analyzed a\nnumber of factors to determine whether the movants were entitled to\nRule 60(b) relief. In both, the Court focused not on the remedy\nrequested but on the changed equities of the situation and the nature\nof the injunctions involved.\n\nDowell involved a somewhat unusual situation: the district court\nhad imposed an injunction not to ensure current compliance with fed-\neral law but primarily to remedy the effects of past wrong-doing\n(state-sponsored segregation). It was in this context that the Court\nheld that Rule 60(b) relief would be justified if a party could establish\nthat it had complied with the injunction for a reasonable period of\ntime, so the effects of past wrong-doing were eliminated to the extent\npracticable, and therefore the injunction had accomplished its pur-\npose. Rufo, on the other hand, involved not a judicially imposed\ninjunction but a consent decree concerning the parties' agreement to\n\n                     7\n\fcease current wrong-doing (prison over-crowding). In seeking Rule\n60(b) relief, the prison officials in Rufo did not claim that they had\ncomplied with the consent decree or that it had accomplished its pur-\npose. Rather, they maintained, and the Court held, that a significant\nchange in circumstances would justify equitable relief. Thus, in\nDowell and Rufo the Court fashioned standards triggered not by the\nprecise remedy requested, but by the equitable showing made by the\nparties.\n\nNothing in Dowell or Rufo indicates that the Supreme Court\nintended the Rufo standard to apply to all modification motions and\nthe Dowell standard to all termination motions. But see United States\nv. City of Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1503-05, 1508-09 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(directing district court to apply Rufo standard to modification motion\nand Dowell standard to termination motion); Heath v. DeCourcy, 992\nF.2d 630, 633-35 (6th Cir. 1993) (same). Indeed, Dowell itself makes\nclear that a party can invoke the standard it sets forth to terminate or\nmodify a decree. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248 (rejecting lower court's\nposition that compliance alone \"cannot become the basis for\nmodifying or dissolving an injunction\") (emphasis added); see also id.\nat 249 (\"in deciding whether to modify or dissolve a desegregation\ndecree, . . . compliance with previous court orders is obviously rele-\nvant\") (emphasis added). Similarly, if a party can demonstrate a sig-\nnificant, unforeseen change in the facts or law, it may invoke Rufo to\nmove for modification and even, if the unforeseen change in circum-\nstances is particularly dramatic, termination. See, e.g., Sweeton v.\nBrown, 27 F.3d 1162, 1166 (6th Cir. 1994) (en banc), cert. denied,\n115 S. Ct. 1118 (1995); Evans v. City of Chicago , 10 F.3d 474, 483\n(7th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (Ripple, J., concurring), cert. denied, 114 S.\nCt. 1831 (1994).\n\nThus, it is clear that Dowell and Rufo are entirely consistent; they\ndo, indeed, sound the \"same theme.\" Rufo , 502 U.S. at 380.\n\nIII.\n\nWhat is unclear is whether the Dowell standard can be invoked\nwhen a party seeks to terminate or modify a consent decree, like that\nat issue here, which contains a specific sunset provision and was\n\n                    8\n\fdesigned to remedy ongoing wrong-doing and to ensure present and\nfuture compliance with federal law.\n\nA critical factor in the 1992 consent order, duly emphasized by the\ndistrict court, is the administrators' agreement to abide by the terms\nof the order for six years. Unlike the injunction in Dowell, the order\nin this case was not court-imposed but resulted from extended negoti-\nations between the parties. Of course, such an order is \"enforceable\nas a judicial decree\" and is therefore subject to Rule 60(b) like other\njudgments and decrees. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378. However, \"a consent\ndecree embodies an agreement of the parties and thus in some\nrespects is contractual in nature.\" Id.; see also United States v. ITT\nCont. Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 236-37 (1975). By consenting to the\nterms of a decree, parties forego litigation and compromise their\nrespective positions. For example, in this case, if the administrators\nhad refused to enter into the consent decree, they might have avoided\na judgment in which the district court required them to comply with\nthe terms of the decree for six years; however, by agreeing to the con-\nsent decree with the six-year provision, the administrators avoided the\npossibility of receiving a court-imposed injunction that could have\nbeen more onerous in this or other respects.\n\nThus, defendants have somewhat different obligations under con-\nsent decrees than they do under court-imposed injunctions. In the lat-\nter, defendants can only be required to address ongoing illegal activity\nor the past effects of illegal activity -- i.e., violations of substantive\nfederal law. But, in a consent decree, defendants may agree, within\nlimits, to do more than a judicially imposed injunction could have\nrequired. See Plyler v. Evatt, 924 F.2d 1321, 1327 (4th Cir. 1991).\nThe consent decree must, of course, still relate to an alleged violation\nof federal law, see Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389, but if it does, the parties\nshould be held to their bargain. See id. at 391-92 (A \"court should not\n`turn aside to inquire whether some of [the provisions of the decree]\nupon separate as distinguished from joint action could have been\nopposed with success if the defendants had offered opposition.'\")\n(quoting Swift, 286 U.S. at 116-17). It would seem that the six-year\nterm makes it impossible for the administrators to have complied with\nthe 1992 consent order, or for the order to have fulfilled its purpose,\nin less than six years.\n\n                     9\n\fFurthermore, like the consent decree in Rufo, see 502 U.S. at 373,\nthe consent order at issue here was designed to remedy ongoing\nwrongdoing and to ensure present and future compliance with federal\nlaw. In contrast, as noted previously, the injunction in Dowell was\nfashioned primarily to remedy the effects of past illegal conduct. See\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 240 (busing ordered to remedy past segregation).\nWhen a decree's purpose is to ensure ongoing and future compliance\nwith federal law, it is obviously much more difficult to establish that\nthe decree has fulfilled that purpose (especially after the decree has\nbeen in effect a relatively short time) than when its principal purpose\nis to remedy the effects of past illegal activity.\n\nOther circuits have recognized that the Dowell standard does not\nappear suitable for decrees aimed at ensuring ongoing compliance\nwith the law. Thus, the Dowell standard has been applied primarily\nin cases, like Dowell itself, involving decrees that may generally\nenjoin ongoing illegal activity, but are directed principally at remedy-\ning the effects of past illegal activity. See, e.g., Youngblood v. Dalzell,\n925 F.2d 954, 955-56 (6th Cir. 1991). No court has employed Dowell\nto terminate or modify a decree aimed exclusively, or even princi-\npally, at ongoing illegal activity. In those instances it is to Rufo, rather\nthan Dowell, that our sister circuits have turned not only to determine\nwhether such decrees should be modified but also whether they\nshould be terminated. See, e.g., United States v. Eastman Kodak Co.,\n63 F.3d 95, 102 (2d Cir. 1995) (relying on Rufo and United Shoe);\nSweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162, 1163-64 (6th Cir. 1994) (en banc),\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1118 (1995); Protectoseal Co. v. Barancik, 23\nF.3d 1184, 1187 (7th Cir. 1994); Evans v. City of Chicago, 10 F.3d\n474, 476 (7th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\n\nAccordingly, the Dowell standard may well be inapplicable to con-\nsent decrees, like the 1992 consent order, in which the parties agree\nto cease ongoing illegal activity under specified terms and conditions.\nWe note that the First Circuit has voiced similar uncertainty as to the\napplicability of Dowell in this context. See Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286, 292-93 (1st Cir. 1993) (after remand from\nthe Supreme Court). The uncertainty would appear to be exacerbated\nhere where the consent decree specifically provides for court supervi-\nsion for a defined, and relatively short, period of time. We need not\ndefinitively resolve the question in this case because in any event,\n\n                     10\n\feven if the Dowell standard applied to the 1992 consent order, the\nadministrators did not and could not satisfy that standard.\n\nIV.\n\nAs discussed above, to meet the Dowell standard, the administra-\ntors must demonstrate: (1) that for a reasonable period of time (2)\nthey have complied in good faith with the consent decree (3) to the\npoint that the \"vestiges\" of past unlawful behavior have been elimi-\nnated \"to the extent practicable,\" and thus the purpose of the decree\nhas been satisfied. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50.\n\nThe administrators studiously ignore the first of these factors. The\nreason seems clear: the record unequivocally demonstrates that the\nadministrators have not complied with the consent decree for a rea-\nsonable period of time. The 1992 consent decree was issued less than\nfour years ago and has only been fully effective since January, 1994.\nThus, in March, 1995, when the administrators moved to terminate\nthe order, it had been in full effect for little more than a year. No court\nhas held that compliance for such a short period constitutes compli-\nance for a \"reasonable period\" of time.\n\nOnly compliance for substantially longer periods has been regarded\nas significant evidence of good faith compliance. See Dowell, 498\nU.S. at 249 (the \"passage of time [twelve years] enables the District\nCourt to observe the good faith of the school board in complying with\nthe decree\"); see also Patterson v. Newspaper & Mail Deliverers'\nUnion, 13 F.3d 33, 34-35 (2d Cir. 1993) (motion to terminate, denied\neleven years after a decree's entry, was properly granted after eigh-\nteen years), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 58 (1994); City of Miami, 2 F.3d\nat 1508 (after consent decree had been in effect for fifteen years, dis-\ntrict court should examine whether termination warranted); Consumer\nAdvisory Bd. v. Glover, 989 F.2d 65, 68 (1st Cir. 1993) (after fifteen\nyears, district court held to have \"considerable discretion\" to conclude\nthe decree should be dissolved). Cf. Youngblood , 925 F.2d at 955\n(although seventeen years had passed, district court should reconsider\nits decision to terminate the decree).\n\nMoreover, even if the parties' agreement to the six-year sunset pro-\nvision does not mandate that the consent order remain effective for\n\n                     11\n\fthat entire period, see Collins v. Thompson, 8 F.3d 657, 659 (9th Cir.\n1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 2133 (1994); In re Pearson, 990 F.2d\n653, 658 (1st Cir. 1993); Glover, 989 F.2d at 67,4 it does obviously\nmerit significant weight in a court's consideration of whether the\norder has been in effect for a \"reasonable period.\" This is because the\nparties themselves typically will be the most knowledgeable as to the\nreasonable length of time necessary to determine whether the decree\nhas had its desired effect. Furthermore, ignoring the parties' agree-\nment in a consent order as to the appropriate time period would\nreduce (if not destroy) the incentive for parties to enter into consent\ndecrees in the first place. See Patterson, 13 F.3d at 38 (although flexi-\nble standard applies to modification and termination motions, \"it is\nalso important to provide all concerned with an incentive to enter into\nconstructive settlements so that protracted litigation can be avoided\nand useful remedies developed by agreement, rather than by judicial\ncommand\"); see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389-90 (noting importance of\nfinality as an incentive for parties to negotiate settlements).\n\nMedicaid and AFDC applicants have been forced to litigate for\nmore than twenty years in an effort to make the administrators com-\nply with federal law. The administrators themselves concede that they\nhave had significant difficulty in adhering to federal regulations. They\nacknowledge that \"[c]ertainly [judicial] supervision may have been\njustified throughout part of the 1970's, the 1980's and even into the\n1990's.\" Brief of Appellants at 3. Thus, in this case, a party that has\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 All three of the cases the applicants rely on for the opposite position\nwere decided prior to Dowell and Rufo , in which the Supreme Court\nreminded federal courts to be wary of interfering in state institutional\nmatters and adopted more flexible standards for reviewing decrees.\nMoreover, in two of them, United States v. Overton, 834 F.2d 1171, 1174\n(5th Cir. 1987), and South v. Rowe, 759 F.2d 610, 613 (7th Cir. 1985),\nthe courts held only that a sunset provision could effectively restrict fed-\neral jurisdiction, not that such a provision required a court to retain juris-\ndiction. The third case, Halderman v. Pennhurst State School &\nHospital, 901 F.2d 311, 317-20 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 850\n(1990), did not involve a motion to terminate, but a motion to enforce,\nwhich the defendants tried to avoid by claiming lack of jurisdiction. The\nissue of whether the court may enforce agreements as written, after the\nfact, differs from the issue of whether the court must enforce time provi-\nsions in the face of a motion to terminate.\n\n                     12\n\fhad difficulty complying with federal law for an extended period con-\nsented in writing to abide for six years with the terms of a decree\naimed at ensuring ongoing compliance. Under such circumstances, it\nis not possible for such a party to establish at the conclusion of less\nthan two years that it has complied with the decree for a \"reasonable\nperiod of time\" sufficient to establish that the decree has served its\npurpose.\n\nThis brings us to a second factor the Supreme Court emphasized\nin Dowell -- a party's good faith compliance with the decree.\nAlthough we express no opinion as to whether the administrators have\nacted in good faith, the evidence is uncontroverted that the adminis-\ntrators have never been able to comply with the consent order. Indeed,\nthe administrators' own statistics document their failure to achieve\ncompliance. The central purpose and requirement of the consent order\nwas for \"all applications [to] be processed timely in compliance with\nfederal law.\" To that end, the consent order requires each county\ndepartment to meet both an \"average processing time\" and a \"percent\nprocessed timely\" threshold each month. As the administrators' statis-\ntics reveal, since the inception of the order there has never been a\nmonth in which all one hundred county departments complied with\nthe thresholds agreed to in the order. On average, since the time the\norder became fully effective in January, 1994, one-fifth of the local\ndepartments have failed to comply with these thresholds. In the two\nmost recent months for which the administrators submitted data, Janu-\nary, 1995 and February, 1995, thirty-six counties and twenty counties,\nrespectively, failed to comply with the thresholds.\n\nThe administrators respond that the statistics must be analyzed in\ncontext, arguing that \"most of the departments out of compliance\nwere in small, less populated counties,\" and so it is unfair to focus on\nthem. Brief of Appellants at 4-5. Whatever the merits of this claim,\nthe fact that the administrators need to make it at all reveals, in the\nadministrators' own words, that they have been continually \"out of\ncompliance\" with the consent order.\n\nThe administrators seem to believe that the Dowell standard per-\nmits good intentions to substitute for compliance. Thus, before us\nthey claim, not that they have \"complied with the consent order,\" but\nthat they have \"complied in good faith with the basic purpose of the\n\n                     13\n\flitigation as embodied in the 1992 Consent Order.\" Brief of Appel-\nlants at 17. The administrators misread Dowell to hold that when a\nparty complies with a consent order \"to the extent practicable,\" the\nparty is entitled to Rule 60(b) relief. Dowell requires more. A party\nseeking to terminate a decree must demonstrate \"compliance with it.\"\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 248-51. See also Heath , 992 F.2d at 634 (\"full\ncompliance\" must be ensured by the district court prior to terminating\nan injunction).5 Good faith is not a substitute for compliance; rather,\ncompliance demonstrates good faith. See Dowell , 498 U.S. at 249 (the\ndistrict court can \"observe the good faith of the school board in com-\nplying with the decree.\"). Without proof of a reasonable period of\ncompliance, regardless of a party's subjective good faith or good\nintentions, equitable considerations weigh strongly against terminat-\ning a consent order.\n\nThe last factor in the Dowell standard is whether the administrators\nhave removed the vestiges of past wrong-doing to the extent that the\npurpose of the consent order has been fulfilled. For the same reasons\nthat it is unclear whether the Dowell standard applies at all to the\n1992 consent order, the administrators cannot make this showing. The\nprimary purpose of the order in this case was not to redress past\nwrong-doing but to ensure current and future compliance with federal\nregulations for the period between 1992-1998. Due to the inherent\ndifficulty in proving that the purpose of a decree ensuring ongoing\ncompliance for six years has been fulfilled prior to the end of the six\nyear period, especially when the administrators cannot establish that\nthey have ever fully complied with the consent order, the administra-\ntors cannot satisfy this element either.\n\nV.\n\nIn view of the fact that the administrators can establish none of the\nDowell factors, the Dowell standard, even if applicable here, is of no\nuse to them. Because the administrators could not meet the Dowell\nstandard, the district court correctly analyzed their termination motion\nunder the Rufo standard. Indeed, under the circumstances of this case,\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 It is worth noting that the 1992 consent order does not require one\nhundred percent compliance with the target times in the federal regula-\ntions. See supra note 1.\n\n                    14\n\fthe application of Rufo provides the flexible approach to Rule 60(b)\nthat the Supreme Court has urged. Particularly, in view of the litiga-\ntion history of this case, there was no error in applying Rufo.\n\nIt will be remembered that only seven months prior to moving to\nterminate the decree, the administrators had filed a motion to modify,\nwhich remained pending when the court resolved the termination\nmotion. In the modification motion, the administrators acknowledged\nthat Rufo set forth the standard for modification or termination of\nconsent decrees.\" Moreover, attached to the termination motion was\na new plan, devised by the administrators, for processing aid applica-\ntions. Although the administrators did not expressly urge the court to\nmodify the consent order by substituting in its place the voluntary\nplan, they certainly did assert that the voluntary plan would effec-\ntively substitute for the consent order.\n\nThe administrators thus have been less than clear both as to\nwhether they were invoking Dowell or Rufo and whether they were\npursuing elimination of all court-approved plans or substitution of a\nnew plan. In view of this and the total lack of any support in the\nrecord that the Dowell standard (even if applicable) had been met, the\ndistrict court's examination of the administrators' motion under the\nRufo standard can hardly be considered error. Rather, this appears to\nbe precisely the sort of flexibility appropriate to an equitable analysis\nof a Rule 60(b) motion.\n\nApplying Rufo, the district court found that the administrators had\nfailed to establish a significant change in the law or facts that war-\nranted relief from the 1992 consent order. The administrators have not\nchallenged the court's finding under Rufo and, therefore, that issue is\nnot before us. Nevertheless, we reiterate the district court's observa-\ntion that should Congress pass legislation relating to the programs at\nissue in this case, the administrators are free, of course, to re-file\nmotions for relief under Rule 60(b). Likewise, should the administra-\ntors be able to establish a significant change in the factual circum-\nstances, relief under Rule 60(b) could be reassessed.\n\n                     15\n\fVI.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the district court's order denying the\nmotion to terminate is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n                     16\n\f",

Degen, CATAWBA\nVALLEY LEGAL SERVICES, INC., Morganton, North Carolina, for\nAppellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge:\n\nThe district court refused to terminate a consent order, which the\nparties entered into in 1992, which became fully effective in 1994,\nand which provided that the court would retain jurisdiction over its\nsubject matter until 1998. We affirm.\n\nI.\n\nThis case is a class action by applicants for Aid to Families with\nDependent Children (AFDC) and Medical Assistance (Medicaid)\nagainst state officials responsible for the administration of these pro-\ngrams in North Carolina and their agents, the administrators of the\none hundred North Carolina county departments of social services.\nSince the inception of this case in 1974, the applicants have alleged,\nand the district court has repeatedly found, that the administrators\nhave failed to comply with federal regulations concerning the pro-\ncessing of aid applications.\n\nThe administrators have been subject to numerous court orders and\nsettlement agreements, all designed to encourage them to comply with\nfederal law. The present conflict relates solely to a 1992 consent\norder, the terms of which the parties negotiated for many months. The\nstated purpose of the consent order was to bring all local social ser-\nvice departments \"into compliance with the requirement in federal\nlaw to timely process AFDC and Medicaid applications without\nimproper discouragement, denial or withdrawal of those applica-\ntions.\" Pursuant to that purpose, the administrators agreed, inter alia,\nto meet the deadlines federal regulations mandate for processing\n\n                     2\n\fapplications, see 42 C.F.R. ยง 435.911; 45 C.F.R. ยง 206.10, and to\nmonitor local departments' compliance. To calculate compliance, the\nparties agreed to substitute \"hard\" numbers where federal regulations\nwere less quantifiable.1 The requirements of the consent order were\nphased in beginning August, 1992 and took full effect on January 1,\n1994. The consent order also included a \"sunset provision,\" in which\nthe parties agreed that the district court would retain jurisdiction \"for\na period of six years from entry of this order,\" i.e., from August 1,\n1992 until August 1, 1998.\n\nIn August, 1994, the administrators filed a motion to modify the\nconsent order pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. The administrators asserted that \"unforeseen factual condi-\ntions resulting in unanticipated consequences have made implementa-\ntion and compliance with the . . . consent order substantially more\nonerous and unworkable . . . .\" The administrators maintained that the\nstandard the Supreme Court employed in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), applied to their motion and entitled\nthem to a modification of the consent order. In the administrators'\nview, the Rufo standard was the \"proper standard for modification or\ntermination of consent decrees under Rule 60(b).\" (emphasis added).\nThe applicants opposed the motion, maintaining that the administra-\ntors could not meet the Rufo standard.\n\nIn March, 1995, without replying to the applicants' opposition or\nobtaining a ruling on the modification motion, the administrators filed\na second Rule 60(b) motion, this time requesting that the district court\nterminate the consent order. Seven months after asserting that compli-\nance with the consent order was impossible because its terms were\n\"onerous\" and \"unworkable,\" the administrators now claimed that\nthey had \"complied in good faith\" with the consent order. Rather than\nthe Rufo standard they had previously urged on the court, the adminis-\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 For example, if the regulations required completion of processing in\nforty-five days except in \"unusual circumstances,\" the consent order\nwould require local departments to process ninety percent of the applica-\ntions within forty-five days but permits ten percent of the applications to\nexceed the forty-five day requirement (i.e., the ten percent \"hard\" number\ntakes the place of the less quantifiable \"unusual circumstances\" excep-\ntion).\n\n                     3\n\ftrators asserted that the proper standard for evaluating their termina-\ntion motion was set forth in Board of Education of Oklahoma City\nPublic Schools v. Dowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991). Under the Dowell\nstandard, the administrators maintained that their good faith compli-\nance with the consent order warranted its termination. They further\ninformed the court that they had devised a plan to\"ensure timely and\nefficient service to AFDC and Medicaid applicants,\" and represented\nthat they would implement the plan if the court terminated the consent\norder.\n\nThe district court denied the administrators' motion to terminate.\nThe court noted the parties' specific agreement in the 1992 consent\norder that the court would retain jurisdiction over the parties and \"the\nsubject matter of this action for a period of six years.\" Citing Rufo,\nthe court found that the administrators were not entitled to relief from\nthe order because they had failed to establish the existence of a \"sig-\nnificant change in factual conditions or in the law\" or to demonstrate\nthat their proposed alternative plan was \"suitably tailored\" to any\nchanged circumstance.\n\nOn appeal, the administrators argue that the district court erred in\napplying what they characterize as the \"more stringent\" Rufo stan-\ndard, rather than the Dowell standard; they maintain that had the court\nproperly applied the Dowell standard, they would have been entitled\nto termination of the consent order. These arguments exhibit both a\nfundamental misunderstanding of Dowell and Rufo and an effort to\ndisregard the undisputed facts of the case at hand.\n\nII.\n\nThe standards employed in Dowell and Rufo are but variations on\na single theme. Both are grounded in the established general equity\npowers of the federal courts. Those powers, now formalized in Rule\n60(b), which provided the basis for the motions made in Dowell,\nRufo, and the case at hand, permit courts to grant parties relief from\nfinal judgments that have prospective effect. Rule 60(b) states, in per-\ntinent part, that on \"such terms as are just\" a court may \"relieve a\nparty\" from a judgment or order \"where it is no longer equitable\" that\nthe judgment have \"prospective application.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5),\n(6). Accordingly, when confronted with any motion invoking this\n\n                    4\n\frule, a district court's task is to determine whether it remains equita-\nble for the judgment at issue to apply prospectively and, if not, to\nrelieve the parties of some or all of the burdens of that judgment on\n\"such terms as are just.\"\n\nThe administrators seek to place Dowell and Rufo in separate com-\npartments, with Dowell setting forth the standard to be applied when\nconsidering any and every motion to terminate a decree, and Rufo set-\nting forth a \"more stringent\" standard for any and every motion to\nmodify. However, a holding that motions to modify always require\nsatisfaction of a more stringent standard than motions to terminate\nwould be illogical. To adopt the administrators' argument would\nmean that the Supreme Court has mandated that the standard a party\nmust meet to obtain the less serious remedy -- modification of a per-\nmanent injunction -- in every case is more rigorous than that needed\nto obtain the more drastic remedy -- termination of such an injunction.2\nIn fact, examination of Dowell and Rufo makes clear that while the\nRufo standard differs from the Dowell standard, it is hardly \"more\nstringent.\" Analysis of these cases demonstrates that the Court articu-\nlated different standards not, as the administrators suggest, in\nresponse to the differences in the remedies requested (termination\nversus modification) but in recognition of the differences in the char-\nacter and purposes of the injunctions at issue in the two cases. The\nadministrators' myopic focus on the remedy requested ignores the\ngenesis of Dowell and Rufo and the flexibility that they teach.\n\nPrior to Dowell and Rufo, federal courts generally looked to United\nStates v. Swift & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1932), for the standard to apply\nwhen reviewing motions to terminate or modify permanent injunc-\ntions. Swift involved an antitrust consent decree, in which meatpack-\ning companies agreed to an injunction against certain monopolistic\npractices. Ten years later, the companies sought a modification of the\ndecree, which the district court granted in part. The Supreme Court\nreversed, explaining: \"Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous\nwrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 Indisputably, modification is a less drastic remedy than termination of\na consent decree.

Some courts, including this one, recognized\nthat Swift permitted a more flexible approach when a party sought\nrelief from decrees \"directed to events to come\" rather than at \"fully\naccrued\" rights. See Nelson v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"394095\"><a href=\"/opinion/394095/warren-c-nelson-v-george-collins-john-h-x-washington-v-gerald-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (4th Cir.\n1981) (en banc) (quoting Swift, 286 U.S. at 114). However, for the\nmost part, federal courts applied the Swift\"grievous wrong\" standard\nrigidly, leading them almost invariably to deny motions to terminate\nor modify permanent injunctions.\n\nIn its 1991 Dowell decision, the Supreme Court held that the Swift\n\"grievous wrong\" standard was not \"the proper standard to apply to\ninjunctions entered in school desegregation cases.\" Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 248.3 The Court reasoned that because school desegregation\ndecrees were intended as \"temporary measure[s] to remedy past dis-\ncrimination\" and were \"not intended to operate in perpetuity,\" a more\nflexible approach was warranted. Id. at 247. The Court distinguished\nSwift as a case involving a \"continuing danger\" that the party asking\nfor the modification would revert to its prior illegal conduct. Id. (cit-\ning United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107690\"><a href=\"/opinion/107690/united-states-v-united-shoe-machinery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248\n(1968)). Because the court-imposed decree in Dowell was aimed pri-\nmarily at remedying past unconstitutional conduct, and no evidence\nindicated that the local authority would revert to its former illegal\nbehavior, the Court held that to obtain relief the local authority need\nnot demonstrate the existence of a \"grievous wrong\" caused by \"new\nand unforeseen conditions.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247. In the context\nof deciding whether to \"modify or dissolve a desegregation decree,\"\nthe Supreme Court directed that Rule 60(b) relief should be granted\nif the local authority could establish that (1) it had \"complied in good\nfaith with the desegregation decree\" (2) its compliance had lasted for\n\"a reasonable period of time\" and (3) \"the vestiges of past discrimina-\ntion had been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Id. at 249-50.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 Dowell was foreshadowed by similar holdings of this and other\ncourts.

Rufo, 502 U.S. at\n380. Rufo involved a consent decree between prisoners and local\nprison authorities. The authorities moved to modify the decree\nbecause they believed a change in the factual circumstances had made\ncompliance much more difficult. The lower courts refused to modify\nthe decree; the Supreme Court reversed. The Court noted initially that\nthe \"ability of a district court to modify a decree in response to\nchanged circumstances\" was particularly important in \"institutional\nreform litigation.\" Id. The Court emphasized, however, that \"a party\nmay obtain relief from a court order when `it is no longer equitable\nthat the judgment should have prospective application,' not when it\nis no longer convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.\"\nId. at 383 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. 60 (b)(5)). Thus, even though a more\nflexible approach than Swift was warranted, in order to obtain the\nmodification a party must demonstrate that (1) a\"significant change\"\nin the law or facts \"warrants revision of the decree\" and (2) the pro-\nposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.\nId.\n\nAlthough in Dowell and Rufo the Court set forth different stan-\ndards, its approach was the same. In both cases, the Court eschewed\nSwift's rigid \"grievous wrong\" standard in favor of a more flexible\napproach appropriate to the situation. In both, the Court analyzed a\nnumber of factors to determine whether the movants were entitled to\nRule 60(b) relief. In both, the Court focused not on the remedy\nrequested but on the changed equities of the situation and the nature\nof the injunctions involved.\n\nDowell involved a somewhat unusual situation: the district court\nhad imposed an injunction not to ensure current compliance with fed-\neral law but primarily to remedy the effects of past wrong-doing\n(state-sponsored segregation). It was in this context that the Court\nheld that Rule 60(b) relief would be justified if a party could establish\nthat it had complied with the injunction for a reasonable period of\ntime, so the effects of past wrong-doing were eliminated to the extent\npracticable, and therefore the injunction had accomplished its pur-\npose. Rufo, on the other hand, involved not a judicially imposed\ninjunction but a consent decree concerning the parties' agreement to\n\n                     7\n\fcease current wrong-doing (prison over-crowding). In seeking Rule\n60(b) relief, the prison officials in Rufo did not claim that they had\ncomplied with the consent decree or that it had accomplished its pur-\npose. Rather, they maintained, and the Court held, that a significant\nchange in circumstances would justify equitable relief. Thus, in\nDowell and Rufo the Court fashioned standards triggered not by the\nprecise remedy requested, but by the equitable showing made by the\nparties.\n\nNothing in Dowell or Rufo indicates that the Supreme Court\nintended the Rufo standard to apply to all modification motions and\nthe Dowell standard to all termination motions.

Unlike the injunction in Dowell, the order\nin this case was not court-imposed but resulted from extended negoti-\nations between the parties. Of course, such an order is \"enforceable\nas a judicial decree\" and is therefore subject to Rule 60(b) like other\njudgments and decrees. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378. However, \"a consent\ndecree embodies an agreement of the parties and thus in some\nrespects is contractual in nature.\" Id.; see also United States v. ITT\nCont. Baking Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682020/united-states-v-itt-continental-baking-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236-37 (1975). By consenting to the\nterms of a decree, parties forego litigation and compromise their\nrespective positions. For example, in this case, if the administrators\nhad refused to enter into the consent decree, they might have avoided\na judgment in which the district court required them to comply with\nthe terms of the decree for six years; however, by agreeing to the con-\nsent decree with the six-year provision, the administrators avoided the\npossibility of receiving a court-imposed injunction that could have\nbeen more onerous in this or other respects.\n\nThus, defendants have somewhat different obligations under con-\nsent decrees than they do under court-imposed injunctions. In the lat-\nter, defendants can only be required to address ongoing illegal activity\nor the past effects of illegal activity -- i.e., violations of substantive\nfederal law. But, in a consent decree, defendants may agree, within\nlimits, to do more than a judicially imposed injunction could have\nrequired. See Plyler v. Evatt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555445\"><a href=\"/opinion/555445/harry-plyler-formerly-gary-wayne-nelson-v-parker-evatt-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1327 (4th Cir. 1991).\nThe consent decree must, of course, still relate to an alleged violation\nof federal law, see Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389, but if it does, the parties\nshould be held to their bargain. See id. at 391-92 (A \"court should not\n`turn aside to inquire whether some of [the provisions of the decree]\nupon separate as distinguished from joint action could have been\nopposed with success if the defendants had offered opposition.'\")\n(quoting Swift, 286 U.S. at 116-17). It would seem that the six-year\nterm makes it impossible for the administrators to have complied with\nthe 1992 consent order, or for the order to have fulfilled its purpose,\nin less than six years.\n\n                     9\n\fFurthermore, like the consent decree in Rufo, see 502 U.S. at 373,\nthe consent order at issue here was designed to remedy ongoing\nwrongdoing and to ensure present and future compliance with federal\nlaw. In contrast, as noted previously, the injunction in Dowell was\nfashioned primarily to remedy the effects of past illegal conduct. See\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 240 (busing ordered to remedy past segregation).\nWhen a decree's purpose is to ensure ongoing and future compliance\nwith federal law, it is obviously much more difficult to establish that\nthe decree has fulfilled that purpose (especially after the decree has\nbeen in effect a relatively short time) than when its principal purpose\nis to remedy the effects of past illegal activity.\n\nOther circuits have recognized that the Dowell standard does not\nappear suitable for decrees aimed at ensuring ongoing compliance\nwith the law. Thus, the Dowell standard has been applied primarily\nin cases, like Dowell itself, involving decrees that may generally\nenjoin ongoing illegal activity, but are directed principally at remedy-\ning the effects of past illegal activity. See, e.g., Youngblood v. Dalzell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555827\"><a href=\"/opinion/555827/tilford-youngblood-ralph-nichols-individually-and-on-behalf-of-the-class/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 955-56 (6th Cir. 1991). No court has employed Dowell\nto terminate or modify a decree aimed exclusively, or even princi-\npally, at ongoing illegal activity. In those instances it is to Rufo, rather\nthan Dowell, that our sister circuits have turned not only to determine\nwhether such decrees should be modified but also whether they\nshould be terminated.

See Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail v. Rufo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195100\"><a href=\"/opinion/195100/suffolk-county-jail-v-commonwealth-of-ma/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292-93 (1st Cir. 1993) (after remand from\nthe Supreme Court). The uncertainty would appear to be exacerbated\nhere where the consent decree specifically provides for court supervi-\nsion for a defined, and relatively short, period of time. We need not\ndefinitively resolve the question in this case because in any event,\n\n                     10\n\feven if the Dowell standard applied to the 1992 consent order, the\nadministrators did not and could not satisfy that standard.\n\nIV.\n\nAs discussed above, to meet the Dowell standard, the administra-\ntors must demonstrate: (1) that for a reasonable period of time (2)\nthey have complied in good faith with the consent decree (3) to the\npoint that the \"vestiges\" of past unlawful behavior have been elimi-\nnated \"to the extent practicable,\" and thus the purpose of the decree\nhas been satisfied. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50.\n\nThe administrators studiously ignore the first of these factors. The\nreason seems clear: the record unequivocally demonstrates that the\nadministrators have not complied with the consent decree for a rea-\nsonable period of time. The 1992 consent decree was issued less than\nfour years ago and has only been fully effective since January, 1994.\nThus, in March, 1995, when the administrators moved to terminate\nthe order, it had been in full effect for little more than a year. No court\nhas held that compliance for such a short period constitutes compli-\nance for a \"reasonable period\" of time.\n\nOnly compliance for substantially longer periods has been regarded\nas significant evidence of good faith compliance. See Dowell, 498\nU.S. at 249 (the \"passage of time [twelve years] enables the District\nCourt to observe the good faith of the school board in complying with\nthe decree\"); see also Patterson v.

Furthermore, ignoring the parties' agree-\nment in a consent order as to the appropriate time period would\nreduce (if not destroy) the incentive for parties to enter into consent\ndecrees in the first place.

The administrators themselves concede that they\nhave had significant difficulty in adhering to federal regulations.

The\nissue of whether the court may enforce agreements as written, after the\nfact, differs from the issue of whether the court must enforce time provi-\nsions in the face of a motion to terminate.\n\n                     12\n\fhad difficulty complying with federal law for an extended period con-\nsented in writing to abide for six years with the terms of a decree\naimed at ensuring ongoing compliance. Under such circumstances, it\nis not possible for such a party to establish at the conclusion of less\nthan two years that it has complied with the decree for a \"reasonable\nperiod of time\" sufficient to establish that the decree has served its\npurpose.\n\nThis brings us to a second factor the Supreme Court emphasized\nin Dowell -- a party's good faith compliance with the decree.\nAlthough we express no opinion as to whether the administrators have\nacted in good faith, the evidence is uncontroverted that the adminis-\ntrators have never been able to comply with the consent order. Indeed,\nthe administrators' own statistics document their failure to achieve\ncompliance. The central purpose and requirement of the consent order\nwas for \"all applications [to] be processed timely in compliance with\nfederal law.\" To that end, the consent order requires each county\ndepartment to meet both an \"average processing time\" and a \"percent\nprocessed timely\" threshold each month. As the administrators' statis-\ntics reveal, since the inception of the order there has never been a\nmonth in which all one hundred county departments complied with\nthe thresholds agreed to in the order. On average, since the time the\norder became fully effective in January, 1994, one-fifth of the local\ndepartments have failed to comply with these thresholds. In the two\nmost recent months for which the administrators submitted data, Janu-\nary, 1995 and February, 1995, thirty-six counties and twenty counties,\nrespectively, failed to comply with the thresholds.\n\nThe administrators respond that the statistics must be analyzed in\ncontext, arguing that \"most of the departments out of compliance\nwere in small, less populated counties,\" and so it is unfair to focus on\nthem. Brief of Appellants at 4-5. Whatever the merits of this claim,\nthe fact that the administrators need to make it at all reveals, in the\nadministrators' own words, that they have been continually \"out of\ncompliance\" with the consent order.\n\nThe administrators seem to believe that the Dowell standard per-\nmits good intentions to substitute for compliance. Thus, before us\nthey claim, not that they have \"complied with the consent order,\" but\nthat they have \"complied in good faith with the basic purpose of the\n\n                     13\n\flitigation as embodied in the 1992 Consent Order.\" Brief of Appel-\nlants at 17. The administrators misread Dowell to hold that when a\nparty complies with a consent order \"to the extent practicable,\" the\nparty is entitled to Rule 60(b) relief. Dowell requires more. A party\nseeking to terminate a decree must demonstrate \"compliance with it.\"\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 248-51. See also Heath , 992 F.2d at 634 (\"full\ncompliance\" must be ensured by the district court prior to terminating\nan injunction).5 Good faith is not a substitute for compliance; rather,\ncompliance demonstrates good faith. See Dowell , 498 U.S. at 249 (the\ndistrict court can \"observe the good faith of the school board in com-\nplying with the decree.\"). Without proof of a reasonable period of\ncompliance, regardless of a party's subjective good faith or good\nintentions, equitable considerations weigh strongly against terminat-\ning a consent order.\n\nThe last factor in the Dowell standard is whether the administrators\nhave removed the vestiges of past wrong-doing to the extent that the\npurpose of the consent order has been fulfilled. For the same reasons\nthat it is unclear whether the Dowell standard applies at all to the\n1992 consent order, the administrators cannot make this showing. The\nprimary purpose of the order in this case was not to redress past\nwrong-doing but to ensure current and future compliance with federal\nregulations for the period between 1992-1998. Due to the inherent\ndifficulty in proving that the purpose of a decree ensuring ongoing\ncompliance for six years has been fulfilled prior to the end of the six\nyear period, especially when the administrators cannot establish that\nthey have ever fully complied with the consent order, the administra-\ntors cannot satisfy this element either.\n\nV.\n\nIn view of the fact that the administrators can establish none of the\nDowell factors, the Dowell standard, even if applicable here, is of no\nuse to them. Because the administrators could not meet the Dowell\nstandard, the district court correctly analyzed their termination motion\nunder the Rufo standard. Indeed, under the circumstances of this case,\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 It is worth noting that the 1992 consent order does not require one\nhundred percent compliance with the target times in the federal regula-\ntions. See supra note 1.\n\n                    14\n\fthe application of Rufo provides the flexible approach to Rule 60(b)\nthat the Supreme Court has urged. Particularly, in view of the litiga-\ntion history of this case, there was no error in applying Rufo.\n\nIt will be remembered that only seven months prior to moving to\nterminate the decree, the administrators had filed a motion to modify,\nwhich remained pending when the court resolved the termination\nmotion. In the modification motion, the administrators acknowledged\nthat Rufo set forth the standard for modification or termination of\nconsent decrees.\" Moreover, attached to the termination motion was\na new plan, devised by the administrators, for processing aid applica-\ntions. Although the administrators did not expressly urge the court to\nmodify the consent order by substituting in its place the voluntary\nplan, they certainly did assert that the voluntary plan would effec-\ntively substitute for the consent order.\n\nThe administrators thus have been less than clear both as to\nwhether they were invoking Dowell or Rufo and whether they were\npursuing elimination of all court-approved plans or substitution of a\nnew plan. In view of this and the total lack of any support in the\nrecord that the Dowell standard (even if applicable) had been met, the\ndistrict court's examination of the administrators' motion under the\nRufo standard can hardly be considered error. Rather, this appears to\nbe precisely the sort of flexibility appropriate to an equitable analysis\nof a Rule 60(b) motion.\n\nApplying Rufo, the district court found that the administrators had\nfailed to establish a significant change in the law or facts that war-\nranted relief from the 1992 consent order. The administrators have not\nchallenged the court's finding under Rufo and, therefore, that issue is\nnot before us. Nevertheless, we reiterate the district court's observa-\ntion that should Congress pass legislation relating to the programs at\nissue in this case, the administrators are free, of course, to re-file\nmotions for relief under Rule 60(b). Likewise, should the administra-\ntors be able to establish a significant change in the factual circum-\nstances, relief under Rule 60(b) could be reassessed.\n\n                     15\n\fVI.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the district court's order denying the\nmotion to terminate is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n                     16\n\f</pre>",
