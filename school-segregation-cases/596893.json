This motion denied, the case was submitted to the court without a jury on a stipulation of facts, the substance of which, as material here, is set out below,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and on the testimony of one of the plaintiffs, the substance of which is also set out below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge did not treat the case, as it was, as a suit for the redress of the deprivation, for reasons of color, of the individual and personal right of the plaintiffs to play golf on facilities furnished at municipal expense to whites, while denied to negroes. He treated it, as it was not, as in short a more or less general complaint that park facilities provided for negroes were unequal to those provided for whites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the opinion that the parks, as parks, furnished to whites and negroes were substantially equal in their overall facilities, he concluded,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> \"I do not think the failure to provide golf courses in parks used by negroes is, either as matter of law or fact, a discrimination against negroes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In thus holding, the district judge erred in fact and in law. He erred in fact because, if an individual negro citizen desires to play golf on a municipal course and is prevented from doing so only because he is a negro citizen, while an individual white citizen, because he is not a negro, is permitted to do so, the fact that he is being discriminated against in the assertion of a personal and individual right, because of his color, stands out like a sore thumb, or like a large blob on the end of a small nose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He erred in law because his conclusion is contrary to the general principles established by the authorities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"It is the individual who is entitled to the equal protection of the laws, and if he is denied * * * a facility or convenience * * * which, under substantially the same circumstances, is furnished to another * * * he may properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been invaded.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What was accomplished here under the purported sanction of state law is the very thing the Constitution was written to make impossible, and the civil rights statutes forbid. This is denying to a negro, because he is a negro, his individual, his personal, right as a citizen to use and enjoy a facility furnished at the public expense while permitting a white man, because he is white, to use and enjoy it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the general principles thus laid down, the precise question as to the equal right of a negro to play golf on municipal golf courses has been before the courts many times,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and each time the decision has been in favor of the claimed right. Because these decisions, particularly that of Judge Chestnut, in Law v. Mayor and City Council, D.C., 78 F.Supp. 346, fully and adequately discuss the question here presented, as it relates precisely to playing golf, we will not further labor it. We shall content ourselves with saying that we find ourselves in full accord with the reasons given and the results reached in the cited decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains only to briefly consider, and as briefly dispose of, adversely to defendants, their contention put forward in their brief, that the case is one for three judges. That it is not such a case, the literature on the subject and all the controlling decisions make crystal clear. In Phillips v. U. S., 312 U.S. 246, at page 250, 61 S.Ct. 480, at page 483, 85 L.Ed. 800, the court said: \"The history of &#167; 266 (see Pogue State Determination of State Law, 41 Harv.L.Rev. 623, and Hutcheson, A Case for Three Judges, 47 Harv.L.Rev. 795), the narrowness of its original scope, the piecemeal explicit amendments which were made to it (see Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1013, and Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, amending &#167; 238 of the Judicial Code), the close construction given the section in obedience to Congressional policy (see, for instance, Moore v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., [272 U.S. 317, 47 S.Ct. 105, 71 L.Ed. 273] supra; Smith v. Wilson, 273 U.S. 388, 47 S.Ct. 385, 71 L.Ed. 699; Ex parte Collins, [277 U.S. 565, 48 S.Ct. 585, 72 L.Ed. 990], supra; Oklahoma Gas [&amp; Electric] Co. v. [Oklahoma] Packing Co., 292 U.S. 386, 54 S.Ct. 732, 78 L.Ed. 1318; Ex parte Williams, 277 U.S. 267, 48 S.Ct. 523, 72 L.Ed. 877; Ex parte Public National Bank, 278 U.S. 101, 49 S.Ct. 43, 73 L.Ed. 202; Rorick v. Board of Com'rs, 307 U.S. 208, 59 S.Ct. 808, 83 L.Ed. 1242; Ex parte Bransford, 310 U.S. 354, 60 S.Ct. 947, 84 L.Ed. 1249), combine to reveal &#167; 266 not as a measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but as an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to enter a judgment: declaring that refusing to allow plaintiffs and others similarly situated, because they are negroes, to make use, on a substantially equal basis with white citizens, of municipal facilities for playing golf, is to practice a forbidden discrimination which must be remedied; and enjoining defendants from continuing such practice. The decree, however, shall afford defendants a reasonable opportunity to promptly prepare and put into effect regulations for the use of the municipal golf facilities, which, while preserving segregation, will be in full and fair accord with its principle. This principle is that \"The admissibility of laws separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the equality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups within the State.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In applying this principle, that equality of treatment of white and colored citizens must be afforded which will secure to both, complete and full recognition, that, under the Constitution and laws, there are not two classes of citizens, a first and a second, but one class, with all of equal rank in respect of their rights and privileges to use and enjoy facilities provided at public expense for public use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The caption of this act was \"An Act providing for the segregation * * * of the white and negro races and providing for the conferring of power and authority upon cities to pass suitable ordinance controlling the same and providing for fixing the penalty and declaring an emergency.\" Acts 1927, c. 103. As set out in the Civil Statutes, it is Art. 1015b \"Ordinances for segregation of races Sec. 1. That the power and authority is hereby conferred upon the Cities of Texas to provide by suitable ordinance for the segregation of negroes and whites in any such city\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> (1) That the city of Houston operates under the Home Rule Amendment to the Constitution of the State of Texas, Vernon's Ann.St.Const. art. 11, &#167; 5, is an agency of the state, and has been delegated the right to exercise the general police power of the state subject to the provisions of its charter and the constitution and laws of the state</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) That the plaintiffs are residents and taxpayers, members of the Negro race; each contributes to the support and maintenance of the golf courses described in their petition through the payment of taxes;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(3) That the City of Houston maintains three public golf courses, known as Memorial Park, Glenbrook Park, and Herman Park;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(4) That the City of Houston, by ordinance, established a Municipal Golf Course Department, and that department operates the golf course.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(5) That, on the 31st day of Dec., 1942, the City Council adopted a code of civil and criminal ordinances, including Sec. 1434, which sets aside Emancipation Park for the exclusive use of colored people and provides that all other parks in the city, not set aside exclusively for the use of the colored people, shall be used exclusively by white people. In addition to Emancipation Park, Finnigan Park has been designated for colored use. There is no golf course located in any of the parks set apart for negroes. The City has recently completed the purchase of lands for a park known as Independent Heights Park, and has annexed, and is now drawing plans to equip it for exclusive use by negro citizens, another park, Clinton Park. There are 19 parks in the city, 17 of which are for white uses and 2 for negro uses.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(6) Negro citizens are not permitted to use the municipal golf courses in Herman, Memorial and Glenbrook Parks, and the agent and employees of the city exclude them therefrom by authority of Section 1434 of the City Code. The stipulation sets out in some detail the facilities provided for each of the parks. It also shows that the negro population of Houston is from 20 to 22 percent of the total population.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(7) The plaintiffs are suffering from no physical or mental defects and are qualified persons, except for their race, to be admitted to the golf courses. They and others of the negro race have sought admission to the facilities of said golf course and qualified themselves in every way to play except as to color, and were excluded solely on account thereof. They and all other persons of African descent and members of the negro race are, because they are Negroes, denied the use and enjoyment of the golf courses notwithstanding all other persons, not of the negro race, are allowed their use.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(8) The Municipal Golf Course Department, which operates the golf courses is separated both in administration and in budget from the other park and recreation facilities of Houston.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This witness testified that he is a citizen of Houston, president of a golf club, the Clinton Park Golf Club, of approximately 300 members; and that there are perhaps 500 negro citizens who are qualified and desire to play golf. The Clinton Park Country Club is a private club, organized and maintained by negro golf players</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> \"The stipulation shows that the four Parks used and to be used exclusively by the negroes have substantially the same facilities and equipment as the seventeen parks used exclusively by the white people, except that three of the parks used exclusively by the white people have golf courses. Plaintiffs say that this renders them substantially unequal. It is contended that even though the parks used by the negroes contain such outdoor advantages as tennis courts, baseball diamonds, softball diamonds, play grounds and apparatus, picnic grounds with tables and other equipment, they are not substantially equal to those used by the white people, solely because they have no golf courses. The contention is not meritorious. While it does not affirmatively appear that the out-of-door facilities provided by the city in the parks include many worthy games and activities of other and former days, such as town ball, mumble peg, tournaments, ring base, bush ranger, etc., it does appear that the city with wholesome care has provided for present day activities of both races. I do not think the failure to provide golf courses in parks used by the negroes is either as a matter of law or fact a discrimination against the negroes.\" Conclusion of Law No. 4</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> McCabe v.

He treated it, as it was not, as in short a more or less general complaint that park facilities provided for negroes were unequal to those provided for whites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the opinion that the parks, as parks, furnished to whites and negroes were substantially equal in their overall facilities, he concluded,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> \"I do not think the failure to provide golf courses in parks used by negroes is, either as matter of law or fact, a discrimination against negroes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In thus holding, the district judge erred in fact and in law. He erred in fact because, if an individual negro citizen desires to play golf on a municipal course and is prevented from doing so only because he is a negro citizen, while an individual white citizen, because he is not a negro, is permitted to do so, the fact that he is being discriminated against in the assertion of a personal and individual right, because of his color, stands out like a sore thumb, or like a large blob on the end of a small nose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He erred in law because his conclusion is contrary to the general principles established by the authorities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"It is the individual who is entitled to the equal protection of the laws, and if he is denied * * * a facility or convenience * * * which, under substantially the same circumstances, is furnished to another * * * he may properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been invaded.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What was accomplished here under the purported sanction of state law is the very thing the Constitution was written to make impossible, and the civil rights statutes forbid. This is denying to a negro, because he is a negro, his individual, his personal, right as a citizen to use and enjoy a facility furnished at the public expense while permitting a white man, because he is white, to use and enjoy it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the general principles thus laid down, the precise question as to the equal right of a negro to play golf on municipal golf courses has been before the courts many times,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and each time the decision has been in favor of the claimed right. Because these decisions, particularly that of Judge Chestnut, in Law v. Mayor and City Council, D.C., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1880563\"><a href=\"/opinion/1880563/law-v-mayor-and-city-council-of-baltimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, fully and adequately discuss the question here presented, as it relates precisely to playing golf, we will not further labor it. We shall content ourselves with saying that we find ourselves in full accord with the reasons given and the results reached in the cited decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains only to briefly consider, and as briefly dispose of, adversely to defendants, their contention put forward in their brief, that the case is one for three judges. That it is not such a case, the literature on the subject and all the controlling decisions make crystal clear. In Phillips v. U.

The decree, however, shall afford defendants a reasonable opportunity to promptly prepare and put into effect regulations for the use of the municipal golf facilities, which, while preserving segregation, will be in full and fair accord with its principle. This principle is that \"The admissibility of laws separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the equality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups within the State.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In applying this principle, that equality of treatment of white and colored citizens must be afforded which will secure to both, complete and full recognition, that, under the Constitution and laws, there are not two classes of citizens, a first and a second, but one class, with all of equal rank in respect of their rights and privileges to use and enjoy facilities provided at public expense for public use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The caption of this act was \"An Act providing for the segregation * * * of the white and negro races and providing for the conferring of power and authority upon cities to pass suitable ordinance controlling the same and providing for fixing the penalty and declaring an emergency.\" Acts 1927, c. 103.

In addition to Emancipation Park, Finnigan Park has been designated for colored use. There is no golf course located in any of the parks set apart for negroes. The City has recently completed the purchase of lands for a park known as Independent Heights Park, and has annexed, and is now drawing plans to equip it for exclusive use by negro citizens, another park, Clinton Park. There are 19 parks in the city, 17 of which are for white uses and 2 for negro uses.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(6) Negro citizens are not permitted to use the municipal golf courses in Herman, Memorial and Glenbrook Parks, and the agent and employees of the city exclude them therefrom by authority of Section 1434 of the City Code. The stipulation sets out in some detail the facilities provided for each of the parks. It also shows that the negro population of Houston is from 20 to 22 percent of the total population.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(7) The plaintiffs are suffering from no physical or mental defects and are qualified persons, except for their race, to be admitted to the golf courses. They and others of the negro race have sought admission to the facilities of said golf course and qualified themselves in every way to play except as to color, and were excluded solely on account thereof. They and all other persons of African descent and members of the negro race are, because they are Negroes, denied the use and enjoyment of the golf courses notwithstanding all other persons, not of the negro race, are allowed their use.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(8) The Municipal Golf Course Department, which operates the golf courses is separated both in administration and in budget from the other park and recreation facilities of Houston.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This witness testified that he is a citizen of Houston, president of a golf club, the Clinton Park Golf Club, of approximately 300 members; and that there are perhaps 500 negro citizens who are qualified and desire to play golf.

Plaintiffs say that this renders them substantially unequal. It is contended that even though the parks used by the negroes contain such outdoor advantages as tennis courts, baseball diamonds, softball diamonds, play grounds and apparatus, picnic grounds with tables and other equipment, they are not substantially equal to those used by the white people, solely because they have no golf courses. The contention is not meritorious. While it does not affirmatively appear that the out-of-door facilities provided by the city in the parks include many worthy games and activities of other and former days, such as town ball, mumble peg, tournaments, ring base, bush ranger, etc., it does appear that the city with wholesome care has provided for present day activities of both races.
