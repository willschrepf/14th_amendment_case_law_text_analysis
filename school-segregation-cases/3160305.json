APWU                          3\n\n                          OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Rosemary Garity, a clerk at the United States Postal\nService office in Pahrump, Nevada, suffers from a litany of\nphysical and emotional disabilities. Despite her willingness\nto perform her job duties, Garity repeatedly complained to her\nrepresentatives at the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-\nCIO (“APWU”) that postal service management refused to\naccommodate her disabilities. Garity alleges that APWU,\nrather than filing and processing her grievances, sided with\nmanagement, discriminating and retaliating against her\nbecause of her disabilities.\n\n    Garity brought two complaints against APWU in federal\ncourt, alleging a contractual breach of APWU’s duty of fair\nrepresentation in the first, and alleging a series of violations\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”),\n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Nevada state tort laws in the\nsecond. After two different district court judges determined\nthat Garity’s complaints should proceed as independent\nactions, one district court judge (Dawson, J.) dismissed\nGarity’s first complaint, finding that, though APWU’s\nbehavior towards Garity may have been negligent, APWU’s\nactions were not a breach of its duty of fair representation. In\nlight of this judgment, a second district court judge (Pro, J.)\ntossed Garity’s second complaint, ruling that, because a prima\nfacie claim of disability discrimination against a union\nnecessarily required a showing of a breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation, Garity’s ADA claims were barred by the issue\npreclusion doctrine. Garity had failed to prove a required\nelement in her first complaint, the district court explained,\n\f4                         GARITY V. APWU\n\nand there was no need to re-litigate that element in her second\ncomplaint.\n\n     The question before us is whether a prima facie claim for\ndisability discrimination against a union necessarily requires\na showing that the union breached its duty of fair\nrepresentation. If so, the district court’s application of the\nissue preclusion bar was proper and Garity’s ADA claims\nfail; if not, Garity’s ADA claims survive. We endorse the\nSeventh Circuit’s reasoning in Green v. American Federation\nof Teachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 604,\n740 F.3d 1104 (7th Cir. 2014), and hold that a prima facie\ndisability discrimination claim against a union does not\nrequire that a plaintiff demonstrate that the union breached its\nduty of fair representation. Accordingly, Garity’s ADA\nclaims are not barred by issue preclusion, and we reverse and\nremand to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n                                     I\n\nA. Facts\n\n    Garity began working as a clerk at the United States\nPostal Service office in Pahrump, Nevada in 2008, and served\nas the “shop steward” of Local #7156—the Pahrump affiliate\nof the APWU—from 2009 to 2011.1 Garity describes herself\nas “a disabled individual” suffering from a range of “physical\nand mental impairments” that include “heel spurs, chest pain,\nchronic fatigue, sleep disturbance, osteoporosis[,] myalgia,\n\n\n    1\n   Our description of the facts is largely derived from Garity’s complaint.\nWe are to take these facts as true for the purposes of analyzing APWU’s\nmotion to dismiss. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556\n(2007).\n\f                     GARITY V. APWU                          5\n\nmuscle spasms and . . . cancer,” as well as “anxiety disorder,\nmajor depressive disorder, [and] panic attacks.” Despite her\nconditions, Garity asserts that she can “perform the essential\nfunctions of many of the duties available” as long as Postal\nService management provides her with proper\naccommodations.\n\n    In 2010, Debra Blankenship was appointed postmaster of\nthe Pahrump office. In response to perceived instances of\nfavoritism and disparate treatment observed under the new\nleadership, Garity and other postal employees filed a hostile\nwork environment grievance. At around the same time, Kathi\nPoulos was elected president of Local #7156, and Garity\nalleges that, though Poulos acknowledged Garity’s grievance\nas “valid,” she refused to process it. After Garity was unable\nto attend a grievance meeting in Las Vegas in early 2011 due\nto her disabilities, Poulos removed Garity from her shop\nsteward position and appointed herself to the position the next\nday. As part of Poulos’s new duties as shop steward, she was\nresponsible for filing employment grievances raised by Garity\nand other Local #7156 members with Postal Service\nmanagement.\n\n    In the months that followed, Garity forwarded a litany of\ngrievances to Poulos, alleging that management improperly\ndelayed the mail, sent her home early without pay, and\ncommitted various acts of retaliation and harassment against\nher. Garity informed Poulos that “the contract had been\nviolated” and reminded Poulos that it was her “job to\nrepresent employees,” but alleged that Poulos “did not\ninvestigate or file any of [her] grievances.” Because Poulos\n“either wo[uld]n’t [file] or ha[d] agreed with management to\nnot file grievances,” Garity alleges in her complaint,\n\f6                    GARITY V. APWU\n\n“[m]anagement [was] well aware that they c[ould] do\nanything they want[ed] to [her] with no repercussions.”\n\n    According to Garity, conditions in the Pahrump post\noffice continued to deteriorate throughout 2011. In January,\nGarity asked Poulos to file a series of grievances stemming\nfrom an adverse disciplinary action taken against her by\nmanagement, but Poulos refused, stating that she “already had\ntoo many grievances” to process and choosing instead to\nwithdraw roughly a dozen of Garity’s previously filed\ngrievances. In February, the Pahrump office’s management\nconvened a meeting to discuss work assignments that\naccommodated Garity’s disability, but rather than finding her\nappropriate tasks, post office management simply cut\nGarity’s work hours. Stonewalled by Poulos, Garity\napproached an alternate APWU shop steward to see if he\nwould file her grievances, but fared no better. And after\nPoulos refused to file additional grievances, withdrew others,\nand failed to represent her in the proceedings on still others,\nGarity filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(“EEOC”) and National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”)\ncomplaints against her union for discrimination in February\nand March.\n\n    In April of 2011, Garity alleges that she was suspended\nfor thirty days after an incident in which Garity refused to go\ninto a room alone with a male employee against whom she\nhad pending sexual harassment charges. An altercation with\nBlankenship ensued, and Poulos was called to the office.\nGarity alleges that Poulos did not sufficiently defend her in a\nthree-page letter Poulos later wrote describing the incident,\nand that the letter was in fact used to justify Garity’s\nsuspension. Garity complained about Local #7156’s actions\nto the national APWU to no avail, and, after repeatedly\n\f                       GARITY V. APWU                            7\n\nrequesting additional disability accommodations, Garity was\nfired from her position on June 11, 2011.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n    In July 2011, Garity filed two separate complaints against\nAPWU in federal court.2 Her first complaint (“Complaint\nOne”) alleged that APWU breached its duty of fair\nrepresentation by violating provisions of its collective\nbargaining agreement. Garity, acting pro se, styled these\nclaims as “breach of contract” claims. This complaint was\nassigned to the Honorable Kent Dawson of the District of\nNevada.\n\n    Garity’s second complaint—the one at issue here—was\nassigned to the Honorable Philip Pro of the District of Nevada\n(“Complaint Two”). In this complaint, Garity pleaded claims\nfor disability discrimination under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 and the ADA, Nevada state tort claims for\nnegligent retention and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, and claims for conspiracy to deprive her of rights\nunder 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986.\n\n    In August 2011, Garity filed a “Motion to Keep Cases\nSeparated as Originally Filed,” explaining that her “claims of\ndiscrimination and the tort claims clearly involve different\nquestions of law from breach of contract/failure to represent,\nbreach of the APWU Constitution, . . . etc.” Five days later,\nthe APWU moved to consolidate Garity’s two complaints\ninto a single case, arguing that though “the legal claims\ndiffer, the facts alleged [in the two complaints] are virtually\n\n  2\n    Garity’s complaints were originally filed against both APWU and\nLocal #7156. The latter is no longer a party to this litigation.\n\f8                    GARITY V. APWU\n\nidentical.” In October 2011, in an unexplained order, Judge\nPro granted Garity’s motion and denied APWU’s motion.\nThree months later, Judge Dawson also denied APWU’s\nmotion, finding that the “Defendants have failed to show that\nboth complaints contain common questions of law or fact\nsufficient to justify consolidating them.” Accordingly, both\nclaims proceeded independently.\n\n    1. Complaint One\n\n    After giving Garity a chance to amend her complaint,\nJudge Dawson granted APWU’s motion to dismiss Complaint\nOne with prejudice on July 18, 2012. The court found that\nGarity’s “claims [were] an amalgam of legal conclusions”\nthat did not support the proposition that “Defendants\nbreached their duty of fair representation.” The court\nrecognized that the union is afforded wide latitude to attend\nto its internal business and found that Garity’s “factual\nallegations” suggested “at worst negligence.” Garity\nappealed the court’s decision in Complaint One to this court,\nand we affirmed Judge Dawson’s dismissal order in a\nunanimous memorandum disposition. Garity v. APWU-AFL-\nCIO, 585 F. App’x 383 (9th Cir. 2014) (mem.). The Supreme\nCourt denied Garity’s petition for a writ of certiorari. Garity\nv. APWU-AFL-CIO, 136 S. Ct. 71 (2015) (mem.).\n\n    2. Complaint Two\n\n   After Garity filed an amended complaint including\nadditional factual details, Judge Pro granted in part and\ndenied in part APWU’s motion to dismiss. Beginning with\n\f                          GARITY V. APWU                                   9\n\nGarity’s ADA claims,3 the district court found that Garity had\nstated a claim for disability discrimination. The court\nexplained that Garity had adequately alleged that\nAPWU—“motivated, at least in part, by animus towards\n[Garity]’s disabilities or requests for accommodation”—\n“refused to file grievances and joined in [the Postal Service’s]\ndiscriminatory practices,” triggering a series of adverse\nemployment actions. The district court also determined that\nGarity had “pled sufficient facts” to support her retaliation\nclaim, noting that she had raised the inference of a “causal\nlink” between protected activity, like filing union grievances,\nand her suspension and termination. The district court,\nhowever, granted APWU’s motion to dismiss as to Garity’s\nhostile work environment claim, noting that, though Garity\nhad demonstrated that “she subjectively found her work\nenvironment hostile and abusive,” she had not shown that a\n“reasonable person” would agree or that any “mental abuse,\nharassment, or bullying” was “based on her disability.”\n\n\n\n 3\n   Garity’s amended complaint pleads her disability discrimination claims\nas Title VII violations, but disability is not a protected class under that\nstatute. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (prohibiting discrimination by unions\nbased on “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”). However, Garity\nalso references violations of the “ADA of 1990,” in her amended\ncomplaint. “Because [Garity] appeared pro se in the district court, we [are\nto] liberally construe [her] pleadings.” Hearns v. Terhune, 413 F.3d 1036,\n1040 (9th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, as the district court did below, we will\ntreat Garity’s self-styled “Title VII” claims as discrimination claims under\nthe ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2) (listing “labor organization[s]” as\ncovered entities under the ADA); see also § 12112(b) (outlining disability\ndiscrimination claims under the ADA).\n\n    For clarity, we note that Garity alleged four theories of liability under\nthe ADA: disparate treatment (disability discrimination), failure to\naccommodate, retaliation, and hostile work environment.\n\f10                      GARITY V. APWU\n\n    A few months later, APWU took another crack at Garity’s\ncomplaint in a new motion to dismiss. Pointing to our\ndecision in Beck v. United Food and Commercial Workers\nUnion, Local 99, 506 F.3d 874 (9th Cir. 2007), APWU\nargued that an element of a prima facie ADA claim against a\nunion is a “breach” of the “duty of fair representation,” and\nbecause Judge Dawson previously dismissed Garity’s\ncontractual claims in Complaint One for failing to allege\nprecisely that element, Complaint Two was necessarily barred\nby the doctrine of issue preclusion.\n\n     Despite its earlier ruling, the district court reversed course\nin a brief order dismissing Complaint Two in full. The court\nfound that Garity’s ADA claims “must be dismissed because\neach requires [Garity] to prove the . . . breach of the duty of\nfair representation,” a showing that Judge Dawson, analyzing\nthe same “nucleus of operative facts,” had previously\ndetermined that Garity had not made. The court did not cite\nany case law to support its formulation of the elements of a\nprima facie ADA claim against a union, nor did it explain\nwhy it had not discussed the breach element in its earlier\nruling sustaining Garity’s ADA claims.4\n\n    Garity timely appealed to this court. After one round of\nbriefing, the Appellate Commissioner appointed Garity pro\nbono counsel, authorized replacement briefing, and\nspecifically noted that “[i]n addition to any other issues the\nparties address in their briefs, they shall address the elements\nof a Title VII claim against a union in light of subsequent\n\n\n  4\n    The district court also dismissed Garity’s tort claims under Nevada\nlaw, as well as her federal claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986. We\naddress those claims in an unpublished memorandum disposition filed\nwith this opinion.\n\f                       GARITY V. APWU                             11\n\nclarification in the law.” Order at 2, Garity v. APWU Nat’l\nLabor Org., No. 13-15195 (9th Cir. Sept. 10, 2014), ECF No.\n24. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                 II\n\n     “We review the district court’s grant of a motion to\ndismiss de novo.” Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th\nCir. 2005). “When ruling on a motion to dismiss, we accept\nall factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe\nthe pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty.” Id. “Unless it is absolutely clear that no amendment\ncan cure the defect, . . . a pro se litigant is entitled to notice of\nthe complaint’s deficiencies and an opportunity to amend\nprior to dismissal of the action.” Lucas v. Dep’t of Corr.,\n66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995) (per curiam).\n\n    We also review the district court’s ruling on issue\npreclusion de novo. United States v. Smith-Baltiher, 424 F.3d\n913, 919 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n                                 III\n\n    Garity’s primary contention on appeal is that the district\ncourt erred by dismissing her ADA claims against APWU on\nissue preclusion grounds, or collateral estoppel. She asserts\nthat, because a disability discrimination claim against a union\ndoes not require that a plaintiff demonstrate a breach of the\nduty of fair representation by the union, her inability to make\nsuch a showing on the contract claims in her first complaint\nis not necessarily fatal to the ADA claims in her second\ncomplaint. Before addressing Garity’s issue preclusion\nargument, however, we begin by answering APWU’s\n\f12                       GARITY V. APWU\n\nassertion that Garity’s entire second complaint should be\nbarred by the doctrine of claim preclusion.\n\nA. Garity’s Second Complaint Is Not Barred by Claim\n   Preclusion\n\n    As a threshold matter, APWU argues that Garity’s second\ncomplaint—the complaint at issue here—should have been\nbarred in its entirety by the doctrine of claim preclusion, or\nres judicata. Because both of Garity’s complaints were\n“predicated on discrimination and a general failure of the\nAPWU to represent [her],” APWU notes, “all of the grounds\nin Garity’s Complaint [Two] could have been asserted in her\nComplaint [One].” Appellee’s Br. 32. Put more simply,\nAPWU argues that because all of Garity’s causes of action\nderive from the same factual foundation, she should not have\nsplit them into two discrete complaints and should have\nbrought them in one consolidated action.5 We disagree.\n\n    “Claim preclusion ‘applies when there is (1) an identity\nof claims; (2) a final judgment on the merits; and (3) identity\nor privity between the parties.’” Cell Therapeutics, Inc. v.\nLash Grp. Inc., 586 F.3d 1204, 1212 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting\nStewart v. U.S. Bancorp, 297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir. 2002)).\n\n\n  5\n      The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit a party to “join, as\nindependent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an\nopposing party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a). Garity could have brought all of\nher claims in a single complaint. But Rule 18 is “permissive”; it is the\ndoctrine of claim preclusion that “focuses on what a party ought to have\nlitigated in the first action.” Larry L. Teply & Ralph U. Whitten, Civil\nProcedure 622, 962–63 (3d ed. 2004). The question, then, is whether\nGarity was obligated to bring her claims in a single complaint because a\ndecision in one suit would preclude the assertions of her claims in the\nsecond suit.\n\f                     GARITY V. APWU                        13\n\nHere, there is no dispute that the district court’s order\ndismissing Complaint One on 12(b)(6) grounds was a final\njudgment on the merits, see Stewart, 297 F.3d at 957, or that\nthe parties to each suit are identical. The application of the\nclaim preclusion doctrine, then, hinges on an analysis of\nwhether there is an identity—or equivalency—of claims\nbetween Garity’s two complaints.\n\n    To determine if there is an “identity of claims,” we look\nto four factors, “which we do not apply mechanistically”:\n\n           (1) whether the two suits arise out of the\n       same transactional nucleus of facts;\n       (2) whether rights or interests established in\n       the prior judgment would be destroyed or\n       impaired by prosecution of the second action;\n       (3) whether the two suits involve infringement\n       of the same right; and (4) whether\n       substantially the same evidence is presented\n       in the two actions.\n\nMpoyo v. Litton Electro-Optical Sys., 430 F.3d 985, 987 (9th\nCir. 2005). Though all four factors are considered,\n“[r]eliance on the transactional nucleus element is especially\nappropriate because the element is ‘outcome determinative.’”\nProShipLine Inc. v. Aspen Infrastructures LTD, 609 F.3d 960,\n968 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Mpoyo, 430 F.3d at 988). The\nparty asserting a claim preclusion argument “must carry the\nburden of establishing all necessary elements.” Taylor v.\nSturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 907 (2008) (quoting 18 Wright &\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4405, at 83 (2d ed.\n2002)). Here, that party is APWU.\n\f14                       GARITY V. APWU\n\n    Though APWU can quickly check-off the “same\nevidence” factor,6 the other elements are not quite so clear-\ncut. Turning to the first element, “[w]hether two suits arise\nout of the ‘same transactional nucleus’ depends upon whether\nthey are related to the same set of facts and whether they\ncould conveniently be tried together.” ProShipLine, 609 F.3d\nat 968 (emphasis in original) (second set of internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, two different district court judges\ndecided that Garity’s two complaints could not be\nconveniently tried together. Indeed, as Judge Dawson\nexplained in denying APWU’s motion to consolidate, APWU\n“failed to show that both complaints contain common\nquestions of law or fact sufficient to justify consolidating\nthem.” That said, district courts have “broad discretion” to\nconsolidate complaints, Inv’rs Research Co. v. U.S. Dist.\nCourt for Cent. Dist. of Cal., 877 F.2d 777, 777 (9th Cir.\n1989); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a) (noting that a court\n“may,” but is not required to, consolidate actions if they\n“involve a common question of law or fact” (emphasis\nadded)), and a decision to refuse consolidation does not\nnecessarily bear on the applicability of the claim preclusion\ndoctrine. Additionally, there is no serious dispute that the\nsame nucleus of facts gave rise to both complaints—Garity\nadmitted as much by cutting and pasting her factual\nallegations into both complaints. This element leans in favor\nof APWU.\n\n     The “rights and interests” element strongly favors Garity.\nAPWU has an obvious interest in avoiding successive\nlitigation over claims arising from the same set of facts, and\n\n\n  6\n   Garity lifted substantial portions of her factual claims from her first\ncomplaint and inserted them directly into her second complaint. The\nevidence presented is not just “substantially the same”—it is identical.\n\f                      GARITY V. APWU                         15\n\nthe public has an interest in “avoiding inconsistent results and\npreserving judicial economy.” Clements v. Airport Auth.,\n69 F.3d 321, 330 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, however, the district\ncourts—both of them—found that judicial economy would be\nserved by keeping the cases separated and litigating them\nindependently. The question of whether Garity should be\nforced to join her claims in a single suit was litigated and\ndecided against APWU. Two district courts independently\ndetermined that Garity’s claims—her “rights and interests”—\nin Complaint One were distinct from her “rights and\ninterests” in Complaint Two.\n\n    The “infringement of the same rights” element also favors\nGarity. While our precedents do not offer a great deal of\nclarification as to how this element should be analyzed, we\ngenerally perform a basic matching exercise. See, e.g., Sidhu\nv. Fletco Co., 279 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining\nthat “rights asserted in the two actions [we]re different”\nbecause they involved infringement of different provisions of\na contract). Garity’s first complaint alleges infringement of\nher rights under the contract APWU members have with their\nunion, while her second complaint alleges infringement of her\nright to be free from unlawful discrimination based on her\ndisability. Put simply, the claims here do not match. One\ncomplaint sounds in contract, the other in federal anti-\ndiscrimination laws and tort.\n\n    This four-factor test leaves us with something of a split\ndecision, but, on balance, the test leans hard in Garity’s\ndirection. The purpose of the claim preclusion doctrine is to\navoid successive litigation when all of a plaintiff’s claims\nderive from a common factual core and can be efficiently and\neffectively tried together. But implicit in the doctrine is the\nassumption that the plaintiff actually had the chance to be\n\f16                        GARITY V. APWU\n\nheard on all of her claims in the first proceeding. Indeed, as\nthe Supreme Court has explained, “invocation of res judicata\nor claim preclusion” requires that “the first adjudication\noffer[ed] a full and fair opportunity to litigate.” Kremer v.\nChem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481 & n.22 (1982).\n\n    Here, Garity was not offered a full and fair opportunity in\nthe proceedings concerning Complaint One to litigate the\nclaims she included in Complaint Two because Judges\nDawson and Pro kept the claims separate. It would be an\nodd outcome indeed that by (twice) beating back APWU’s\nmotion to consolidate her complaints, Garity unwittingly\nstepped on a claim preclusion landmine by litigating\nComplaint One independently. After reading two district\ncourt orders explicitly stating that her two complaints were\nsufficiently distinct as to warrant keeping them separated, we\ncannot reasonably expect that Garity, acting pro se, would\nhave the wherewithal to request that the court reverse its\norder and consolidate her complaints in order to fend off the\nclaim preclusion bar. As the Second Restatement of\nJudgments point out, there is a general exception to the claim\npreclusion doctrine when the court “has expressly reserved\nthe plaintiff’s right to maintain the second action.”7\n\n\n\n\n    7\n      APWU references our unpublished decision in Ramos v. Apfel,\n205 F.3d 1352 (9th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision), for the\nproposition that claim preclusion can still apply when district court judges\nrefuse to consolidate cases. First, this citation to pre-2007 unpublished\nauthority violates our rules, and we need not consider it. See 9th Cir. R.\n36-3(c). Second, that case involved a litigant’s efforts to have precisely\nthe same ALJ ruling reviewed by two different district judges after a third\ndistrict judge did not catch that the litigant was seeking “duplicate\nreview.” That situation is in no way analogous to the instant case.\n\f                           GARITY V. APWU                                 17\n\nRestatement (Second) Judgments § 26(1)(b).                         That is\nprecisely what happened here.\n\n     The “full and fair opportunity to litigate” requirement\noperates as a safety valve to give courts some leeway in the\napplication of the claim preclusion doctrine. That leeway is\nwarranted here: Garity should not be faulted for relying on\nthe decisions of two district court judges mandating that her\ncomplaints be kept separate. Garity is not attempting to take\na second bite at her first apple; she is requesting a first bite at\nher second apple—an apple two district court judges told her\nto keep in a separate basket. We reject APWU’s claim\npreclusion argument, and hold that Garity’s second complaint\nis not barred by the adverse judgment she received as to her\nfirst complaint.\n\nB. Garity’s Second Complaint Is Not Barred by Issue\n   Preclusion Because a Claim of Disability Discrimination\n   Against a Union Does Not Require a Showing of a Breach\n   of the Duty of Fair Representation\n\n    Even though we find that Garity’s second complaint\nsurvives APWU’s claim preclusion challenge, before her\nADA causes of action in that complaint can be considered on\ntheir merits, those claims must also survive APWU’s issue\npreclusion challenge.\n\n\n      APWU also cites Yapp v. Excel Corp., 186 F.3d 1222 (10th Cir.\n1999). Yapp is also quite different from the case at bar. There, the\nplaintiff (assisted by counsel) signed a settlement agreement with the\ndefendant to resolve his first complaint, aware that he might trigger a\nclaim preclusion issue as to his second complaint. Id. at 1229. As the\nTenth Circuit explained, “Yapp chose to forego a full and fair opportunity\nto litigate [his second claim] in order to satisfy his immediate appetite” for\na settlement. Id. at 1230. Garity made no such choice here.\n\f18                        GARITY V. APWU\n\n    APWU argues that a prima facie disability discrimination\nclaim against a union requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that\nthe union breached its duty of fair representation; because\nJudge Dawson ruled that Garity had failed to make that\nshowing as to her breach of contract claims in Complaint\nOne, APWU asserts—and the district court held—that she is\nbarred by the doctrine of issue preclusion from relitigating\nthat precise issue in Complaint Two. In support of this\nproposition, APWU directs us to our decision in Beck v.\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 99,\n506 F.3d 874 (9th Cir. 2007), and argues that we have already\naddressed the elements of a discrimination claim against a\nunion and have come down in its favor.\n\n    For her part, Garity argues that Beck leaves this question\nopen, and asks us to side with the Seventh Circuit’s recent\ndecision in Green v. American Federation of\nTeachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 604, 740 F.3d\n1104 (7th Cir. 2014), where that circuit held that a breach of\nthe duty of fair representation was not part of a prima facie\nTitle VII discrimination claim against a union. Because,\nGarity argues, the breach element litigated adversely to\nGarity in Complaint One has no bearing on her ADA claims\nin Complaint Two, issue preclusion does not apply.8\n\n\n  8\n    There is no dispute that if Garity’s ADA claims require her to show\nthat APWU breached its duty of fair representation, she loses on issue\npreclusion grounds. Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, “bars\nsuccessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and\nresolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\neven if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.” Taylor,\n553 U.S. at 892 (internal quotation marks omitted). To determine if the\nissue preclusion doctrine applies, we apply a three-prong test, asking if\n“(1) the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical\nto the one which is sought to be relitigated; (2) the first proceeding ended\n\f                          GARITY V. APWU                                19\n\n    Garity gets the better of the argument. We agree that\nBeck does not control our decision here, as it did not add a\n“breach of the duty of fair representation” element to prima\nfacie claims under anti-discrimination statutes like Title VII\nor the ADA. Nor do we think that such an element should be\nincluded. As the Seventh Circuit’s persuasive decision in\nGreen explains, nothing in Title VII suggests that union\nmembers must demonstrate a breach of the union’s\ncontractual duty to provide fair representation before stating\na claim for racial, religious, or gender discrimination under\nTitle VII. Green, 740 F.3d at 1105 (analyzing a prima facie\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c)). And because we have\nlong analyzed anti-discrimination statutes like Title VII and\nthe ADA in parallel fashion, we hold that the Green court’s\nanalysis applies with equal force to union members with\ndisabilities seeking to challenge their union’s discriminatory\nactions under the ADA.9 Accordingly, Garity’s ADA claims\n\n\nwith a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom [issue\npreclusion] is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the first\nproceeding.” Paulo v. Holder, 669 F.3d 911, 917 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\n\n     Here, Judge Dawson specifically determined that Garity’s allegations\nin Complaint One did “not support claims that [APWU] breached [its]\nduty of fair representation,” and we affirmed that ruling, Garity, 585 F.\nApp’x 383. If a breach of the duty of fair representation is a necessary\nelement for Garity’s ADA claims in Complaint Two, Judge Dawson’s\nearlier ruling on that element would have preclusive effect and Garity’s\nADA claims would fail.\n 9\n    We recognize that both Beck and Green addressed claims for Title VII\nviolations against unions rather than claims under the ADA as we have\nhere. See Beck, 506 F.3d at 876; Green, 740 F.3d at 1105. However, due\nto the similarities in language and purpose between the two statutes, courts\naround the country—unless they find a good reason to do otherwise—\ngenerally use Title VII precedent to interpret ADA claims. See, e.g., T.B.\n\f20                        GARITY V. APWU\n\nin her second complaint are not barred by issue preclusion\nbecause she need not prove a breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation to make out a prima facie case of disability\ndiscrimination.\n\n\n\nex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., 806 F.3d 451, 472–73\n(9th Cir. 2015) (“We apply the Title VII burden-shifting framework, as\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973),\nto retaliation claims under the ADA.”); Walsh v. Nev. Dep’t of Human\nRes., 471 F.3d 1033, 1038 (9th Cir. 2006) (“The statutory scheme and\nlanguage of the ADA and Title VII are identical in many respects. . . .\nTitle I of the ADA invokes the same powers, remedies and procedures as\nthose set forth in Title VII.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Flowers\nv. S. Reg’l Physician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 233 (5th Cir. 2001) (“We\nconclude that the language of Title VII and the ADA dictates a consistent\nreading of the two statutes.”); Miranda v. Wis. Power & Light Co., 91\nF.3d 1011, 1017 (7th Cir. 1996) (“[I]n analyzing claims under the ADA,\nit is appropriate to borrow from our approach to the respective analog\nunder Title VII.”); cf. EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 285–97\n(2002) (outlining the similarities in the EEOC’s enforcement powers\nunder Title VII and the ADA, and using Title VII precedent to analyze\nADA claims). But see Brown v.City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181,\n1188–91(9th Cir. 2003) (declining to apply “Title VII’s burden-shifting or\nhostile environment frameworks” to plaintiff’s claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12203(b) because the Fair Housing Act served as a better textual\nanalog).\n\n     In light of this weight of authority, we do not believe that whether\ndiscrimination by a union is based on the plaintiff’s race or gender or\nwhether it is based on the plaintiff’s disability makes a meaningful\ndifference to the analysis at hand. Indeed, both of the parties vigorously\nargue that a Title VII decision should answer this ADA question (Green\nfor Garity, Beck for APWU). Accordingly, though our decision today\nanswers only the question before us—whether a prima facie disability\ndiscrimination claim brought against a union under the ADA requires\nproof that the union breached its duty of fair representation—our\nreasoning is informed and supported by an analysis of the same question\nin the Title VII context.\n\f                     GARITY V. APWU                         21\n\n   1. Our decision in Beck did not hold that breach of the\n      duty of fair representation is an element in a Title VII\n      discrimination claim brought against a union\n\n    In Beck, we addressed a Title VII claim brought by\nCheryl Beck, an employee at a grocery store, against the\nunion that represented her. 506 F.3d at 877–78. In a\nsituation quite similar to this one, Beck argued that her\nunion’s refusal to arbitrate her grievances against the grocery\nstore was due to discrimination on the basis of her sex, a\nviolation of Title VII. Id. In addition to her discrimination\nclaim, Beck also brought an independent “duty of fair\nrepresentation claim” against her union. Id. at 878.\n\n    We first analyzed Beck’s breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation claim. Noting that the “duty of fair\nrepresentation” is “imposed on labor organizations because\nof their status as the exclusive bargaining representative for\nall of the employees in a given bargaining unit,” id. at 879\n(internal quotation marks omitted), we found that Beck’s\nunion “engaged in arbitrary conduct that substantially injured\na member,” a breach of the union’s legal and contractual\nduties to its members, id. at 880–81.\n\n    Next, we moved to Beck’s Title VII claim. We began by\ndeclaring that “[a] union violates Title VII if it deliberately\ndeclines to pursue a member’s claim because of the member’s\ngender.” Id. at 882. We also noted that the “standard burden-\nshifting framework established by the Supreme Court in\nMcDonnell Douglas, . . . applie[d] to a Title VII action\nagainst a union,” and explained that “a union member can\nmake a prima facie claim of discrimination by introducing\nevidence that the member ‘was singled out and treated less\nfavorably than others similarly situated on account of race or\n\f22                    GARITY V. APWU\n\nany other criterion impermissible under the statute.’” Id.\n(quoting Gay v. Waiters’ & Dairy Lunchmen’s Union, Local\nNo. 30, 694 F.2d 531, 537 (9th Cir. 1982)). Nowhere in our\nextensive discussion of the background of Title VII law in a\nunion context did we discuss a “duty of fair representation”\nelement or cite to any cases that include the element as part\nof a prima facie Title VII claim. See id. at 882–84.\n\n    It is not until we describe the district court’s analysis that\nthe first mention of an additional element is made. Noting\nthat the district court was “[r]elying on EEOC v. Reynolds\nMetals Co., 212 F. Supp. 2d 530, 539–40 (E.D. Va. 2002),”\nwe quoted the district court exactly:\n\n        [T]he district court stated, “To establish a\n        Title VII sex discrimination claim against a\n        union, an employee must show that: (1) the\n        employer violated the collective bargaining\n        agreement with respect to the employee;\n        (2) the union breached its duty of fair\n        representation by allowing the breach to go\n        unrepaired; and (3) there is some evidence of\n        gender animus among the union.”\n\nId. at 884. We also recognized the provenance of the three-\nfactor test used by the district court, explaining that it was\n“derived from a Seventh Circuit test for establishing a prima\nfacie case of discrimination, see Bugg v. Int’l Union of Allied\nIndus. Workers of Am., 674 F.2d 595 (7th Cir. 1982),” and\nnoted that the Seventh Circuit’s Bugg test was “generally\nconsistent with the McDonnell Douglas framework.” Beck,\n506 F.3d at 884.\n\f                          GARITY V. APWU                                 23\n\n    And that is the end of our analysis on the issue in Beck.\nWe did not delve into whether the Bugg test was the\ncontrolling test in our circuit, nor did we cite any of our cases\nthat apply the Seventh Circuit’s Bugg test.10 In all other\nrespects, we considered the action for breach of the duty of\nfair representation and the action for violation of Title VII\nseparately. See Beck, 506 F.3d at 886. If we were\nestablishing Bugg’s preeminence in this circuit, we would\nhave been more explicit about what we were doing; a covert\nsmuggling of a sister circuit’s test into our case law through\na reference to the district court’s citation of an out-of-circuit\ndistrict court case seems unlikely. The better reading of our\nBeck decision is that we were explaining how the district\ncourt reached its outcome, addressing out-of-circuit precedent\nin an exploratory or academic fashion, and holding that,\nbecause Beck had already proven a breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation on a separate claim, whether or not that\nelement was included in the Title VII prima facie case had no\nbearing on her ultimate success under that statute. We had no\nneed to parse the Seventh Circuit’s additional element\nbecause, in Beck, the nature of the violation of the duty of fair\nrepresentation was also sufficient to prove a Title VII\nviolation under the traditional McDonnell Douglas\nframework. See 506 F.3d at 884 (observing that the district\n\n\n  10\n     Nor could we have, because such cases simply do not exist. Aside\nfrom Beck’s discussion of Bugg, the Seventh Circuit’s former test makes\nan appearance in only one of our cases, an unpublished memorandum\ndisposition from 1994: Sanders v. Los Angeles Unified School District,\n42 F.3d 1402 (9th Cir. 1994) (unpublished table decision). There we\nstated that Bugg “set out a three-pronged test for establishing a prima facie\nclaim of discrimination against a union,” but we applied that test to the\nplaintiff’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. 42 F.3d at *1. We then applied\na test derived from McDonnell Douglas, not Bugg, to the plaintiff’s Title\nVII claim. Id. at *2.\n\f24                    GARITY V. APWU\n\ncourt had “held that the union’s ‘failure to repair the breach\n[of the collective bargaining agreement] was due to a\ndiscriminatory motivation based on plaintiff’s sex’”).\n\n    Our decision in Golden v. Local 55 of the International\nAssociation of Firefighters, 633 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1980),\nlends credence to our reading of Beck. There, Black\nfirefighters brought actions against their union for violation\nof Title VII and breach of the duty of fair representation, and\nwe found that “[t]he same facts underl[ay] [both] the\nfirefighters’ Title VII . . . and ‘unfair representation’ claims.”\nGolden, 633 F.2d at 819. We found no evidence that the\nunion had breached its duty of fair representation, id. at\n821–22; 823–24, yet we also gave a lengthy analysis of\nplaintiffs’ Title VII claims, id. at 822–23. If “breach of the\nduty of fair representation” was a necessary element of a Title\nVII claim against a union, we would have had no need to\nseparately offer that Title VII analysis—once we established\nthat Local 55 did not breach the duty, the case would have\nbeen over. Had Beck required proof of a breach of the duty\nof fair representation before a plaintiff could bring a Title VII\naction against a union, it would have added a new element to\nthe test set out in Golden, and thus undermined that decision.\nSee also Pejic v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 840 F.2d 667,\n671–74 (9th Cir. 1988) (treating separately Title VII and duty\nof fair representation claims against a union).\n\n    Accordingly, we do not read Beck to require a plaintiff\nbringing a Title VII discrimination claim—or, by analogy, an\nADA disability discrimination claim—against a union to\nprove a breach of the union’s duty of fair representation in his\nprima facie case, nor can we find any other circuit precedent\nthat requires as much. Rather, we take Beck at its word that\nthe key inquiry in a Title VII case against a union is whether\n\f                      GARITY V. APWU                         25\n\nthe union “deliberately declines to pursue a member’s claim\nbecause of” a protected classification. 506 F.3d at 882. As\nsuch, we hold that Beck does not compel a different result\nthan we reach here.\n\n    2. The Seventh Circuit’s decision in Green\n\n    We think that the better rule is set out in the Seventh\nCircuit’s recent decision in Green v. American Federation of\nTeachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 604, in which\nthat court rejected its prior analysis in Bugg and held that a\n“claim against a labor organization under [Title VII] does not\ndepend on showing that . . . the union violated any state\nstatute or contract.” 740 F.3d at 1107. The court explained\nthat “the application of Title VII to employers does not\ndepend on a statute or contract outside of Title VII,” and that\n“[n]othing in the text or genesis of Title VII suggests that\nclaims against labor organizations should be treated\ndifferently.” Id. at 1105 (emphasis added). To support its\nholding, the Green court looked to the text of the statute,\ndiscussed the history and purpose of Title VII, and referred to\nSupreme Court precedent setting forth the prima facie\nelements of a Title VII claim. See id. at 1105–07.\n\n    First, Green noted that Congress explicitly applied Title\nVII to unions by way of § 2000e-2(c). Id. at 1105–06; see\nalso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (“It shall be an unlawful\nemployment practice for a labor organization (1) to exclude\nor to expel from its membership, or otherwise to discriminate\nagainst, any individual because of his race, color, religion,\nsex, or national origin . . . .”). The court explained that when\nthe law was enacted in 1964, “some states had laws\nauthorizing (even requiring) employers and unions to\ndiscriminate against blacks,” and “[m]any unions had\n\f26                   GARITY V. APWU\n\nnegotiated collective bargaining agreements” with racially\ndiscriminatory elements. Green, 740 F.3d at 1105. A\n“principal objective of the federal statute,” then, “was to\nrequire labor organizations to disregard those statutes and\ncontracts and to end racial differences in treatment.” Id. at\n1106.\n\n    With Title VII’s anti-discriminatory purpose front-of-\nmind, the Green court found that premising Title VII’s\napplicability on whether a union had violated a contract or\nstatute in addition to committing a discriminatory act would\nrender the statute “pointless.” Id. The Green court set out the\nproblem succinctly:\n\n       Unless a contract, or some other statute, gave\n       the plaintiff an entitlement, Title VII would\n       do nothing. Yet if a union has, and violates,\n       such a duty, then a remedy may be had under\n       that statute or contract. Title VII would be\n       otiose, and claims of discrimination against\n       unions would be either unavailing or\n       unnecessary.\n\nId. Put differently, if a Title VII claim required a breach of\ncontract or a violation of some statutory duty, the plaintiff\ncould simply sue under the contract or statute, rendering Title\nVII superfluous. The court then observed that the suggestion\nin its prior cases—including Bugg—that a plaintiff must show\na violation of the duty of fair representation in order to\nsustain a Title VII action against a union “conflate[d] Title\nVII with the elements of a hybrid breach-of-contract/duty-of-\nfair-representation claim against an employer and union\nunder 29 U.S.C. § 185.” Id. Disapproving Bugg, the court\n\f                           GARITY V. APWU                                 27\n\ndecided that “[t]his approach [did] not bear any evident\nrelation to Title VII,” and “withdr[e]w the language.” Id.\n\n    To bolster its holding, the Seventh Circuit highlighted\nhow absurd the union’s argument would be in other contexts.\nSee id. at 1105. For example, if a Title VII claim relied on\nbreach of a contract, how could a prospective employee ever\nbring a claim against a prospective employer for racially\nbiased hiring practices? Obviously no contract has been\nformed between the two parties because the employee was\nnever hired, but Title VII certainly covers this interaction.\nSimilarly, if an employer and employee have an at-will\nemployment contract, the employer has not violated the terms\nof the contract by firing the employee on account of race.\nBut again, there is no dispute that Title VII would provide the\nemployee relief. There is no reason, the Seventh Circuit\nasserted, to treat claims against a union any differently. Id.\n\n    Next, the Green court pivoted to the text of Title VII and\nthe Supreme Court’s precedent setting forth the elements of\na prima facie Title VII claim. See id. at 1105–06. A reading\nof the statutes “forbid[ding] discrimination by any labor\norganization”11 and “forbid[ding] retaliation against a person\n\n\n\n 11\n    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice\nfor a labor organization (1) to exclude or to expel from its membership, or\notherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of his race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin; (2) to limit, segregate, or classify\nits membership or applicants for membership, or to classify or fail or\nrefuse to refer for employment any individual, in any way which would\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities, or\nwould limit such employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\nhis status as an employee or as an applicant for employment, because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (3) to\n\f28                        GARITY V. APWU\n\nwho has asserted rights under Title VII”12 unearths no\nmention of a contractual breach or statutory violation that\nunion members must prove. See Green, 740 F.3d at 1105.\nNor does an analysis of McDonnell Douglas’s well-known\nroadmap of a Title VII prima facie claim reveal such\nrequirement.13 Though the Seventh Circuit recognized that\n“courts regularly have restated or modified the elements [of\na Title VII claim] to cover new situations” in the forty years\nsince the McDonnell Douglas decision, it noted that a court\nis “not authorized to add to that framework in a way that\ncauses Title VII as administered to include elements missing\nfrom Title VII as enacted.” Green, 740 F.3d at 1106–07.\nDemanding that a plaintiff show that “the union violated any\nstate statute or contract . . . cannot properly be added as part\nof the prima facie case.” Id. at 1107.

Green’s application to Garity’s ADA claims\n\n    We are persuaded by the Green court’s decision that a\nTitle VII claim against a union does not include an extra-\ntextual “breach of the duty of fair representation” element,\nand see no reason why the Seventh Circuit’s analysis should\nnot apply with equal force to the ADA claim before us here.\nLike Title VII, the ADA was promulgated to combat\ndiscrimination in the workplace,14 and indeed, the statute\nnotes that “unlike individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin,\n[or] religion”—the groups protected by Title VII—\n“individuals who have experienced discrimination on the\nbasis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress\nsuch discrimination.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(4).15 Like Title VII,\nthe ADA includes labor organizations as a covered entity.\nCompare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) with 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2).\nLike Title VII, the ADA does not refer to any element that\napplies only to claims brought by union members against\ntheir unions. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (Title VII\ndiscrimination) with 42 U.S.C. § 12112 (ADA\ndiscrimination); also compare § 2000e-3(a) (Title VII\n\n\n 14\n   See George Rutherglen, Title VII as Precedent: Past and Prologue for\nFuture Legislation, 10 Stan. J. of C.R. & C.L. 159, 166–67 (2014)\n(describing the ADA as a “descendant[] of Title VII” that made Title VII’s\n“prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national\norigin, color, and religion applicable to discrimination on the basis of . . .\ndisability”).\n      15\n      § 12101(4) also notes that “individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of . . . age” have “legal recourse to redress\nsuch discrimination.” Workplace discrimination on the basis of age was\naddressed by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,\n29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\n\f30                        GARITY V. APWU\n\nretaliation) with § 12203(a) (ADA retaliation). And, most\nimportantly, like the prima facie Title VII claim outlined by\nthe Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas, the prima facie\nADA claims for disability discrimination and retaliation\ndeveloped in this circuit do not include a “breach of the duty\nof fair representation” element.16\n\n    Just as the Seventh Circuit explained in Green, we are not\nauthorized to add another element to a prima facie claim\nunder the ADA, especially when the legislature and our court\nhave both already spoken so clearly on the issue. Nor would\nwe even if we could. If an ADA claim against a union\nrequired that the plaintiff show a breach of contract—namely\nthat the union had breached its duty of fair representation to\nits member—the plaintiff would have no need to sue under\nthe ADA, as she could simply sue for breach of contract. See\nGreen, 740 F.3d at 1106. It makes no sense to design a set of\nprima facie elements that renders the underlying claim\nunnecessary.\n\n    APWU’s argument to the contrary confuses the goals of\nanti-discrimination laws, like Title VII and the ADA, with the\npurposes of labor laws, like § 301 of the Labor Management\nRelations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. § 185, and the National\nLabor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq. APWU, quite\ncorrectly, explains that federal labor laws impose upon unions\n\n 16\n    See Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins., 237 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir.\n2001) (“[T]o establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA\nshe must show that she: (1) is disabled; (2) is qualified; and (3) suffered\nan adverse employment action because of her disability.”); see also Pardi\nv. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004) (“To establish\na prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, an employee must show\nthat: (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) suffered an adverse\nemployment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the two.”).\n\f                      GARITY V. APWU                          31\n\na “responsibility and duty of fair representation” to their\nmembers. Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S.\n554, 563–65 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBecause federal law affords unions a “wide range of\nreasonableness” and “broad authority,” see id. at 563–64\n(internal quotation marks omitted), this duty is breached only\nby conduct that is “arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad\nfaith”—a rather deferential standard, Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S.\n171, 190 (1967). And indeed that deferential standard\nworked in APWU’s favor here: Garity lost her breach of the\nduty of fair representation claim before the district court and\nthis court.\n\n    But anti-discrimination statutes like the ADA cannot be\nread to parrot a cause of action that already exists under\nfederal labor laws. Title VII and the ADA were enacted\ndecades after those union-boosting laws and imposed\nadditional affirmative responsibilities on unions. Their\nplaintiff-friendly pleading standards—essentially, to make\nout a prima facie case under Title VII, the claimant need only\nmake a series of factual assertions before the burden shifts to\nthe defendant, see McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at\n802–03—make clear that the free hand unions have in other\nlabor matters does not extend to discrimination suits. Unions\nare uniquely knowledgeable when it comes to collective\nbargaining agreements and employment contracts, and the\nlaw affords them some latitude when adjudicating disputes\narising from those contracts; there is no reason to grant them\nthe same deference when it comes to determining if unions\ndiscriminated against their members on the basis of a\nprotected classification like disability. What the cases\ndemonstrate is that a plaintiff may have an easier path to\nproving a Title VII or an ADA claim when she can also show\nthat the union has violated its duty of fair representation. See,\n\f32                         GARITY V. APWU\n\ne.g., Beck, 506 F.3d at 884–85. What this case also shows,\nhowever, is that the converse is not necessarily true: A\nplaintiff may still have a Title VII or an ADA claim even if\nshe can’t prove a violation of the labor laws.\n\n    Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s order\ndismissing Garity’s ADA claims on issue preclusion grounds,\nand remand for further proceedings as to her discrimination\nand retaliation claims.17 We do not pass on the merits of\nthese claims, but note that, prior to the district court’s issue\npreclusion order, it had determined that Garity had proffered\nsufficient evidence to survive APWU’s motion to dismiss.\n\n                                     IV\n\n    The judgment of the district court with respect to Garity’s\nclaims for disability discrimination and retaliation under the\nADA is reversed, and the case is remanded to the district\ncourt for further proceedings. Considering our judgment in\nthis opinion and the accompanying memorandum disposition,\nthe parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n 17\n     Garity also argues that she has properly stated an ADA claim against\nAPWU for failure to accommodate her disabilities. See Allen v. Pac. Bell,\n348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Because we are unsure\nif the district court passed on this claim in the first instance, we remand it\nto the district court for further proceedings. We address the district court’s\ndismissal of Garity’s ADA claim for hostile work environment in a\nseparate unpublished memorandum filed with this opinion.\n\f",

APWU                          3\n\n                          OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Rosemary Garity, a clerk at the United States Postal\nService office in Pahrump, Nevada, suffers from a litany of\nphysical and emotional disabilities. Despite her willingness\nto perform her job duties, Garity repeatedly complained to her\nrepresentatives at the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-\nCIO (“APWU”) that postal service management refused to\naccommodate her disabilities. Garity alleges that APWU,\nrather than filing and processing her grievances, sided with\nmanagement, discriminating and retaliating against her\nbecause of her disabilities.\n\n    Garity brought two complaints against APWU in federal\ncourt, alleging a contractual breach of APWU’s duty of fair\nrepresentation in the first, and alleging a series of violations\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”),\n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Nevada state tort laws in the\nsecond. After two different district court judges determined\nthat Garity’s complaints should proceed as independent\nactions, one district court judge (Dawson, J.) dismissed\nGarity’s first complaint, finding that, though APWU’s\nbehavior towards Garity may have been negligent, APWU’s\nactions were not a breach of its duty of fair representation. In\nlight of this judgment, a second district court judge (Pro, J.)\ntossed Garity’s second complaint, ruling that, because a prima\nfacie claim of disability discrimination against a union\nnecessarily required a showing of a breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation, Garity’s ADA claims were barred by the issue\npreclusion doctrine. Garity had failed to prove a required\nelement in her first complaint, the district court explained,\n\f4                         GARITY V. APWU\n\nand there was no need to re-litigate that element in her second\ncomplaint.\n\n     The question before us is whether a prima facie claim for\ndisability discrimination against a union necessarily requires\na showing that the union breached its duty of fair\nrepresentation. If so, the district court’s application of the\nissue preclusion bar was proper and Garity’s ADA claims\nfail; if not, Garity’s ADA claims survive. We endorse the\nSeventh Circuit’s reasoning in Green v. American Federation\nof Teachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 604,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2014), and hold that a prima facie\ndisability discrimination claim against a union does not\nrequire that a plaintiff demonstrate that the union breached its\nduty of fair representation. Accordingly, Garity’s ADA\nclaims are not barred by issue preclusion, and we reverse and\nremand to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n                                     I\n\nA. Facts\n\n    Garity began working as a clerk at the United States\nPostal Service office in Pahrump, Nevada in 2008, and served\nas the “shop steward” of Local #7156—the Pahrump affiliate\nof the APWU—from 2009 to 2011.1 Garity describes herself\nas “a disabled individual” suffering from a range of “physical\nand mental impairments” that include “heel spurs, chest pain,\nchronic fatigue, sleep disturbance, osteoporosis[,] myalgia,\n\n\n    1\n   Our description of the facts is largely derived from Garity’s complaint.\nWe are to take these facts as true for the purposes of analyzing APWU’s\nmotion to dismiss. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556\n(2007).\n\f                     GARITY V. APWU                          5\n\nmuscle spasms and . . . cancer,” as well as “anxiety disorder,\nmajor depressive disorder, [and] panic attacks.” Despite her\nconditions, Garity asserts that she can “perform the essential\nfunctions of many of the duties available” as long as Postal\nService management provides her with proper\naccommodations.\n\n    In 2010, Debra Blankenship was appointed postmaster of\nthe Pahrump office. In response to perceived instances of\nfavoritism and disparate treatment observed under the new\nleadership, Garity and other postal employees filed a hostile\nwork environment grievance. At around the same time, Kathi\nPoulos was elected president of Local #7156, and Garity\nalleges that, though Poulos acknowledged Garity’s grievance\nas “valid,” she refused to process it. After Garity was unable\nto attend a grievance meeting in Las Vegas in early 2011 due\nto her disabilities, Poulos removed Garity from her shop\nsteward position and appointed herself to the position the next\nday. As part of Poulos’s new duties as shop steward, she was\nresponsible for filing employment grievances raised by Garity\nand other Local #7156 members with Postal Service\nmanagement.\n\n    In the months that followed, Garity forwarded a litany of\ngrievances to Poulos, alleging that management improperly\ndelayed the mail, sent her home early without pay, and\ncommitted various acts of retaliation and harassment against\nher. Garity informed Poulos that “the contract had been\nviolated” and reminded Poulos that it was her “job to\nrepresent employees,” but alleged that Poulos “did not\ninvestigate or file any of [her] grievances.” Because Poulos\n“either wo[uld]n’t [file] or ha[d] agreed with management to\nnot file grievances,” Garity alleges in her complaint,\n\f6                    GARITY V. APWU\n\n“[m]anagement [was] well aware that they c[ould] do\nanything they want[ed] to [her] with no repercussions.”\n\n    According to Garity, conditions in the Pahrump post\noffice continued to deteriorate throughout 2011. In January,\nGarity asked Poulos to file a series of grievances stemming\nfrom an adverse disciplinary action taken against her by\nmanagement, but Poulos refused, stating that she “already had\ntoo many grievances” to process and choosing instead to\nwithdraw roughly a dozen of Garity’s previously filed\ngrievances. In February, the Pahrump office’s management\nconvened a meeting to discuss work assignments that\naccommodated Garity’s disability, but rather than finding her\nappropriate tasks, post office management simply cut\nGarity’s work hours. Stonewalled by Poulos, Garity\napproached an alternate APWU shop steward to see if he\nwould file her grievances, but fared no better. And after\nPoulos refused to file additional grievances, withdrew others,\nand failed to represent her in the proceedings on still others,\nGarity filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(“EEOC”) and National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”)\ncomplaints against her union for discrimination in February\nand March.\n\n    In April of 2011, Garity alleges that she was suspended\nfor thirty days after an incident in which Garity refused to go\ninto a room alone with a male employee against whom she\nhad pending sexual harassment charges. An altercation with\nBlankenship ensued, and Poulos was called to the office.\nGarity alleges that Poulos did not sufficiently defend her in a\nthree-page letter Poulos later wrote describing the incident,\nand that the letter was in fact used to justify Garity’s\nsuspension. Garity complained about Local #7156’s actions\nto the national APWU to no avail, and, after repeatedly\n\f                       GARITY V. APWU                            7\n\nrequesting additional disability accommodations, Garity was\nfired from her position on June 11, 2011.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n    In July 2011, Garity filed two separate complaints against\nAPWU in federal court.2 Her first complaint (“Complaint\nOne”) alleged that APWU breached its duty of fair\nrepresentation by violating provisions of its collective\nbargaining agreement. Garity, acting pro se, styled these\nclaims as “breach of contract” claims. This complaint was\nassigned to the Honorable Kent Dawson of the District of\nNevada.\n\n    Garity’s second complaint—the one at issue here—was\nassigned to the Honorable Philip Pro of the District of Nevada\n(“Complaint Two”). In this complaint, Garity pleaded claims\nfor disability discrimination under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 and the ADA, Nevada state tort claims for\nnegligent retention and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, and claims for conspiracy to deprive her of rights\nunder 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986.\n\n    In August 2011, Garity filed a “Motion to Keep Cases\nSeparated as Originally Filed,” explaining that her “claims of\ndiscrimination and the tort claims clearly involve different\nquestions of law from breach of contract/failure to represent,\nbreach of the APWU Constitution, . . . etc.” Five days later,\nthe APWU moved to consolidate Garity’s two complaints\ninto a single case, arguing that though “the legal claims\ndiffer, the facts alleged [in the two complaints] are virtually\n\n  2\n    Garity’s complaints were originally filed against both APWU and\nLocal #7156. The latter is no longer a party to this litigation.\n\f8                    GARITY V. APWU\n\nidentical.” In October 2011, in an unexplained order, Judge\nPro granted Garity’s motion and denied APWU’s motion.\nThree months later, Judge Dawson also denied APWU’s\nmotion, finding that the “Defendants have failed to show that\nboth complaints contain common questions of law or fact\nsufficient to justify consolidating them.” Accordingly, both\nclaims proceeded independently.\n\n    1. Complaint One\n\n    After giving Garity a chance to amend her complaint,\nJudge Dawson granted APWU’s motion to dismiss Complaint\nOne with prejudice on July 18, 2012. The court found that\nGarity’s “claims [were] an amalgam of legal conclusions”\nthat did not support the proposition that “Defendants\nbreached their duty of fair representation.” The court\nrecognized that the union is afforded wide latitude to attend\nto its internal business and found that Garity’s “factual\nallegations” suggested “at worst negligence.” Garity\nappealed the court’s decision in Complaint One to this court,\nand we affirmed Judge Dawson’s dismissal order in a\nunanimous memorandum disposition. Garity v. APWU-AFL-\nCIO, 585 F. App’x 383 (9th Cir. 2014) (mem.). The Supreme\nCourt denied Garity’s petition for a writ of certiorari. Garity\nv.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015) (mem.).\n\n    2. Complaint Two\n\n   After Garity filed an amended complaint including\nadditional factual details, Judge Pro granted in part and\ndenied in part APWU’s motion to dismiss. Beginning with\n\f                          GARITY V. APWU                                   9\n\nGarity’s ADA claims,3 the district court found that Garity had\nstated a claim for disability discrimination. The court\nexplained that Garity had adequately alleged that\nAPWU—“motivated, at least in part, by animus towards\n[Garity]’s disabilities or requests for accommodation”—\n“refused to file grievances and joined in [the Postal Service’s]\ndiscriminatory practices,” triggering a series of adverse\nemployment actions. The district court also determined that\nGarity had “pled sufficient facts” to support her retaliation\nclaim, noting that she had raised the inference of a “causal\nlink” between protected activity, like filing union grievances,\nand her suspension and termination. The district court,\nhowever, granted APWU’s motion to dismiss as to Garity’s\nhostile work environment claim, noting that, though Garity\nhad demonstrated that “she subjectively found her work\nenvironment hostile and abusive,” she had not shown that a\n“reasonable person” would agree or that any “mental abuse,\nharassment, or bullying” was “based on her disability.”\n\n\n\n 3\n   Garity’s amended complaint pleads her disability discrimination claims\nas Title VII violations, but disability is not a protected class under that\nstatute. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (prohibiting discrimination by unions\nbased on “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”). However, Garity\nalso references violations of the “ADA of 1990,” in her amended\ncomplaint. “Because [Garity] appeared pro se in the district court, we [are\nto] liberally construe [her] pleadings.” Hearns v. Terhune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790904\"><a href=\"/opinion/790904/clarence-leonard-hearns-jr-v-cal-terhune-robert-powell-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1040 (9th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, as the district court did below, we will\ntreat Garity’s self-styled “Title VII” claims as discrimination claims under\nthe ADA.

The court\nfound that Garity’s ADA claims “must be dismissed because\neach requires [Garity] to prove the . . . breach of the duty of\nfair representation,” a showing that Judge Dawson, analyzing\nthe same “nucleus of operative facts,” had previously\ndetermined that Garity had not made. The court did not cite\nany case law to support its formulation of the elements of a\nprima facie ADA claim against a union, nor did it explain\nwhy it had not discussed the breach element in its earlier\nruling sustaining Garity’s ADA claims.4\n\n    Garity timely appealed to this court. After one round of\nbriefing, the Appellate Commissioner appointed Garity pro\nbono counsel, authorized replacement briefing, and\nspecifically noted that “[i]n addition to any other issues the\nparties address in their briefs, they shall address the elements\nof a Title VII claim against a union in light of subsequent\n\n\n  4\n    The district court also dismissed Garity’s tort claims under Nevada\nlaw, as well as her federal claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986.

She asserts\nthat, because a disability discrimination claim against a union\ndoes not require that a plaintiff demonstrate a breach of the\nduty of fair representation by the union, her inability to make\nsuch a showing on the contract claims in her first complaint\nis not necessarily fatal to the ADA claims in her second\ncomplaint. Before addressing Garity’s issue preclusion\nargument, however, we begin by answering APWU’s\n\f12                       GARITY V. APWU\n\nassertion that Garity’s entire second complaint should be\nbarred by the doctrine of claim preclusion.\n\nA. Garity’s Second Complaint Is Not Barred by Claim\n   Preclusion\n\n    As a threshold matter, APWU argues that Garity’s second\ncomplaint—the complaint at issue here—should have been\nbarred in its entirety by the doctrine of claim preclusion, or\nres judicata. Because both of Garity’s complaints were\n“predicated on discrimination and a general failure of the\nAPWU to represent [her],” APWU notes, “all of the grounds\nin Garity’s Complaint [Two] could have been asserted in her\nComplaint [One].” Appellee’s Br. 32. Put more simply,\nAPWU argues that because all of Garity’s causes of action\nderive from the same factual foundation, she should not have\nsplit them into two discrete complaints and should have\nbrought them in one consolidated action.5 We disagree.\n\n    “Claim preclusion ‘applies when there is (1) an identity\nof claims; (2) a final judgment on the merits; and (3) identity\nor privity between the parties.’” Cell Therapeutics, Inc. v.\nLash Grp.

R. Civ. P. 18(a). Garity could have brought all of\nher claims in a single complaint. But Rule 18 is “permissive”; it is the\ndoctrine of claim preclusion that “focuses on what a party ought to have\nlitigated in the first action.” Larry L. Teply & Ralph U. Whitten, Civil\nProcedure 622, 962–63 (3d ed. 2004). The question, then, is whether\nGarity was obligated to bring her claims in a single complaint because a\ndecision in one suit would preclude the assertions of her claims in the\nsecond suit.\n\f                     GARITY V. APWU                        13\n\nHere, there is no dispute that the district court’s order\ndismissing Complaint One on 12(b)(6) grounds was a final\njudgment on the merits, see Stewart, 297 F.3d at 957, or that\nthe parties to each suit are identical. The application of the\nclaim preclusion doctrine, then, hinges on an analysis of\nwhether there is an identity—or equivalency—of claims\nbetween Garity’s two complaints.\n\n    To determine if there is an “identity of claims,” we look\nto four factors, “which we do not apply mechanistically”:\n\n           (1) whether the two suits arise out of the\n       same transactional nucleus of facts;\n       (2) whether rights or interests established in\n       the prior judgment would be destroyed or\n       impaired by prosecution of the second action;\n       (3) whether the two suits involve infringement\n       of the same right; and (4) whether\n       substantially the same evidence is presented\n       in the two actions.\n\nMpoyo v.

Here, that party is APWU.\n\f14                       GARITY V. APWU\n\n    Though APWU can quickly check-off the “same\nevidence” factor,6 the other elements are not quite so clear-\ncut. Turning to the first element, “[w]hether two suits arise\nout of the ‘same transactional nucleus’ depends upon whether\nthey are related to the same set of facts and whether they\ncould conveniently be tried together.” ProShipLine, 609 F.3d\nat 968 (emphasis in original) (second set of internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, two different district court judges\ndecided that Garity’s two complaints could not be\nconveniently tried together. Indeed, as Judge Dawson\nexplained in denying APWU’s motion to consolidate, APWU\n“failed to show that both complaints contain common\nquestions of law or fact sufficient to justify consolidating\nthem.” That said, district courts have “broad discretion” to\nconsolidate complaints, Inv’rs Research Co. v. U.S. Dist.\nCourt for Cent. Dist. of Cal., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777 (9th Cir.\n1989); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a) (noting that a court\n“may,” but is not required to, consolidate actions if they\n“involve a common question of law or fact” (emphasis\nadded)), and a decision to refuse consolidation does not\nnecessarily bear on the applicability of the claim preclusion\ndoctrine. Additionally, there is no serious dispute that the\nsame nucleus of facts gave rise to both complaints—Garity\nadmitted as much by cutting and pasting her factual\nallegations into both complaints. This element leans in favor\nof APWU.\n\n     The “rights and interests” element strongly favors Garity.\nAPWU has an obvious interest in avoiding successive\nlitigation over claims arising from the same set of facts, and\n\n\n  6\n   Garity lifted substantial portions of her factual claims from her first\ncomplaint and inserted them directly into her second complaint. The\nevidence presented is not just “substantially the same”—it is identical.\n\f                      GARITY V. APWU                         15\n\nthe public has an interest in “avoiding inconsistent results and\npreserving judicial economy.” Clements v.

Here, however, the district\ncourts—both of them—found that judicial economy would be\nserved by keeping the cases separated and litigating them\nindependently. The question of whether Garity should be\nforced to join her claims in a single suit was litigated and\ndecided against APWU. Two district courts independently\ndetermined that Garity’s claims—her “rights and interests”—\nin Complaint One were distinct from her “rights and\ninterests” in Complaint Two.\n\n    The “infringement of the same rights” element also favors\nGarity. While our precedents do not offer a great deal of\nclarification as to how this element should be analyzed, we\ngenerally perform a basic matching exercise. See, e.g., Sidhu\nv. Fletco Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776479\"><a href=\"/opinion/776479/tarlochan-sidhu-v-the-flecto-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 900 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining\nthat “rights asserted in the two actions [we]re different”\nbecause they involved infringement of different provisions of\na contract). Garity’s first complaint alleges infringement of\nher rights under the contract APWU members have with their\nunion, while her second complaint alleges infringement of her\nright to be free from unlawful discrimination based on her\ndisability. Put simply, the claims here do not match. One\ncomplaint sounds in contract, the other in federal anti-\ndiscrimination laws and tort.\n\n    This four-factor test leaves us with something of a split\ndecision, but, on balance, the test leans hard in Garity’s\ndirection. The purpose of the claim preclusion doctrine is to\navoid successive litigation when all of a plaintiff’s claims\nderive from a common factual core and can be efficiently and\neffectively tried together. But implicit in the doctrine is the\nassumption that the plaintiff actually had the chance to be\n\f16                        GARITY V. APWU\n\nheard on all of her claims in the first proceeding. Indeed, as\nthe Supreme Court has explained, “invocation of res judicata\nor claim preclusion” requires that “the first adjudication\noffer[ed] a full and fair opportunity to litigate.” Kremer v.\nChem. Constr. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110706\"><a href=\"/opinion/110706/kremer-v-chemical-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 & n.22 (1982).\n\n    Here, Garity was not offered a full and fair opportunity in\nthe proceedings concerning Complaint One to litigate the\nclaims she included in Complaint Two because Judges\nDawson and Pro kept the claims separate. It would be an\nodd outcome indeed that by (twice) beating back APWU’s\nmotion to consolidate her complaints, Garity unwittingly\nstepped on a claim preclusion landmine by litigating\nComplaint One independently. After reading two district\ncourt orders explicitly stating that her two complaints were\nsufficiently distinct as to warrant keeping them separated, we\ncannot reasonably expect that Garity, acting pro se, would\nhave the wherewithal to request that the court reverse its\norder and consolidate her complaints in order to fend off the\nclaim preclusion bar. As the Second Restatement of\nJudgments point out, there is a general exception to the claim\npreclusion doctrine when the court “has expressly reserved\nthe plaintiff’s right to maintain the second action.”7\n\n\n\n\n    7\n      APWU references our unpublished decision in Ramos v. Apfel,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1352</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision), for the\nproposition that claim preclusion can still apply when district court judges\nrefuse to consolidate cases. First, this citation to pre-2007 unpublished\nauthority violates our rules, and we need not consider it. See 9th Cir. R.\n36-3(c). Second, that case involved a litigant’s efforts to have precisely\nthe same ALJ ruling reviewed by two different district judges after a third\ndistrict judge did not catch that the litigant was seeking “duplicate\nreview.” That situation is in no way analogous to the instant case.\n\f                           GARITY V. APWU                                 17\n\nRestatement (Second) Judgments § 26(1)(b).                         That is\nprecisely what happened here.\n\n     The “full and fair opportunity to litigate” requirement\noperates as a safety valve to give courts some leeway in the\napplication of the claim preclusion doctrine. That leeway is\nwarranted here: Garity should not be faulted for relying on\nthe decisions of two district court judges mandating that her\ncomplaints be kept separate. Garity is not attempting to take\na second bite at her first apple; she is requesting a first bite at\nher second apple—an apple two district court judges told her\nto keep in a separate basket. We reject APWU’s claim\npreclusion argument, and hold that Garity’s second complaint\nis not barred by the adverse judgment she received as to her\nfirst complaint.\n\nB. Garity’s Second Complaint Is Not Barred by Issue\n   Preclusion Because a Claim of Disability Discrimination\n   Against a Union Does Not Require a Showing of a Breach\n   of the Duty of Fair Representation\n\n    Even though we find that Garity’s second complaint\nsurvives APWU’s claim preclusion challenge, before her\nADA causes of action in that complaint can be considered on\ntheir merits, those claims must also survive APWU’s issue\npreclusion challenge.\n\n\n      APWU also cites Yapp v. Excel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158331\"><a href=\"/opinion/158331/yapp-v-excel-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir.\n1999). Yapp is also quite different from the case at bar. There, the\nplaintiff (assisted by counsel) signed a settlement agreement with the\ndefendant to resolve his first complaint, aware that he might trigger a\nclaim preclusion issue as to his second complaint. Id. at 1229. As the\nTenth Circuit explained, “Yapp chose to forego a full and fair opportunity\nto litigate [his second claim] in order to satisfy his immediate appetite” for\na settlement. Id. at 1230. Garity made no such choice here.\n\f18                        GARITY V. APWU\n\n    APWU argues that a prima facie disability discrimination\nclaim against a union requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that\nthe union breached its duty of fair representation; because\nJudge Dawson ruled that Garity had failed to make that\nshowing as to her breach of contract claims in Complaint\nOne, APWU asserts—and the district court held—that she is\nbarred by the doctrine of issue preclusion from relitigating\nthat precise issue in Complaint Two. In support of this\nproposition, APWU directs us to our decision in Beck v.\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 99,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1290437\"><a href=\"/opinion/1290437/beck-v-united-food-and-commercial-workers-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2007), and argues that we have already\naddressed the elements of a discrimination claim against a\nunion and have come down in its favor.\n\n    For her part, Garity argues that Beck leaves this question\nopen, and asks us to side with the Seventh Circuit’s recent\ndecision in Green v. American Federation of\nTeachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 604, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2014), where that circuit held that a breach of\nthe duty of fair representation was not part of a prima facie\nTitle VII discrimination claim against a union. Because,\nGarity argues, the breach element litigated adversely to\nGarity in Complaint One has no bearing on her ADA claims\nin Complaint Two, issue preclusion does not apply.8\n\n\n  8\n    There is no dispute that if Garity’s ADA claims require her to show\nthat APWU breached its duty of fair representation, she loses on issue\npreclusion grounds. Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, “bars\nsuccessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and\nresolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\neven if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.” Taylor,\n553 U.S. at 892 (internal quotation marks omitted). To determine if the\nissue preclusion doctrine applies, we apply a three-prong test, asking if\n“(1) the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical\nto the one which is sought to be relitigated; (2) the first proceeding ended\n\f                          GARITY V. APWU                                19\n\n    Garity gets the better of the argument. We agree that\nBeck does not control our decision here, as it did not add a\n“breach of the duty of fair representation” element to prima\nfacie claims under anti-discrimination statutes like Title VII\nor the ADA. Nor do we think that such an element should be\nincluded. As the Seventh Circuit’s persuasive decision in\nGreen explains, nothing in Title VII suggests that union\nmembers must demonstrate a breach of the union’s\ncontractual duty to provide fair representation before stating\na claim for racial, religious, or gender discrimination under\nTitle VII. Green, 740 F.3d at 1105 (analyzing a prima facie\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c)). And because we have\nlong analyzed anti-discrimination statutes like Title VII and\nthe ADA in parallel fashion, we hold that the Green court’s\nanalysis applies with equal force to union members with\ndisabilities seeking to challenge their union’s discriminatory\nactions under the ADA.9 Accordingly, Garity’s ADA claims\n\n\nwith a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom [issue\npreclusion] is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the first\nproceeding.” Paulo v.

If a breach of the duty of fair representation is a necessary\nelement for Garity’s ADA claims in Complaint Two, Judge Dawson’s\nearlier ruling on that element would have preclusive effect and Garity’s\nADA claims would fail.\n 9\n    We recognize that both Beck and Green addressed claims for Title VII\nviolations against unions rather than claims under the ADA as we have\nhere. See Beck, 506 F.3d at 876; Green, 740 F.3d at 1105. However, due\nto the similarities in language and purpose between the two statutes, courts\naround the country—unless they find a good reason to do otherwise—\ngenerally use Title VII precedent to interpret ADA claims.

Indeed, both of the parties vigorously\nargue that a Title VII decision should answer this ADA question (Green\nfor Garity, Beck for APWU). Accordingly, though our decision today\nanswers only the question before us—whether a prima facie disability\ndiscrimination claim brought against a union under the ADA requires\nproof that the union breached its duty of fair representation—our\nreasoning is informed and supported by an analysis of the same question\nin the Title VII context.\n\f                     GARITY V. APWU                         21\n\n   1. Our decision in Beck did not hold that breach of the\n      duty of fair representation is an element in a Title VII\n      discrimination claim brought against a union\n\n    In Beck, we addressed a Title VII claim brought by\nCheryl Beck, an employee at a grocery store, against the\nunion that represented her. 506 F.3d at 877–78. In a\nsituation quite similar to this one, Beck argued that her\nunion’s refusal to arbitrate her grievances against the grocery\nstore was due to discrimination on the basis of her sex, a\nviolation of Title VII. Id. In addition to her discrimination\nclaim, Beck also brought an independent “duty of fair\nrepresentation claim” against her union. Id. at 878.\n\n    We first analyzed Beck’s breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation claim. Noting that the “duty of fair\nrepresentation” is “imposed on labor organizations because\nof their status as the exclusive bargaining representative for\nall of the employees in a given bargaining unit,” id. at 879\n(internal quotation marks omitted), we found that Beck’s\nunion “engaged in arbitrary conduct that substantially injured\na member,” a breach of the union’s legal and contractual\nduties to its members, id. at 880–81.\n\n    Next, we moved to Beck’s Title VII claim. We began by\ndeclaring that “[a] union violates Title VII if it deliberately\ndeclines to pursue a member’s claim because of the member’s\ngender.” Id. at 882. We also noted that the “standard burden-\nshifting framework established by the Supreme Court in\nMcDonnell Douglas, . . . applie[d] to a Title VII action\nagainst a union,” and explained that “a union member can\nmake a prima facie claim of discrimination by introducing\nevidence that the member ‘was singled out and treated less\nfavorably than others similarly situated on account of race or\n\f22                    GARITY V.

Nowhere in our\nextensive discussion of the background of Title VII law in a\nunion context did we discuss a “duty of fair representation”\nelement or cite to any cases that include the element as part\nof a prima facie Title VII claim. See id. at 882–84.\n\n    It is not until we describe the district court’s analysis that\nthe first mention of an additional element is made. Noting\nthat the district court was “[r]elying on EEOC v. Reynolds\nMetals Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2342994\"><a href=\"/opinion/2342994/eeoc-v-reynolds-metals-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We also recognized the provenance of the three-\nfactor test used by the district court, explaining that it was\n“derived from a Seventh Circuit test for establishing a prima\nfacie case of discrimination, see Bugg v.

APWU                                 23\n\n    And that is the end of our analysis on the issue in Beck.\nWe did not delve into whether the Bugg test was the\ncontrolling test in our circuit, nor did we cite any of our cases\nthat apply the Seventh Circuit’s Bugg test.10 In all other\nrespects, we considered the action for breach of the duty of\nfair representation and the action for violation of Title VII\nseparately. See Beck, 506 F.3d at 886. If we were\nestablishing Bugg’s preeminence in this circuit, we would\nhave been more explicit about what we were doing; a covert\nsmuggling of a sister circuit’s test into our case law through\na reference to the district court’s citation of an out-of-circuit\ndistrict court case seems unlikely. The better reading of our\nBeck decision is that we were explaining how the district\ncourt reached its outcome, addressing out-of-circuit precedent\nin an exploratory or academic fashion, and holding that,\nbecause Beck had already proven a breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation on a separate claim, whether or not that\nelement was included in the Title VII prima facie case had no\nbearing on her ultimate success under that statute. We had no\nneed to parse the Seventh Circuit’s additional element\nbecause, in Beck, the nature of the violation of the duty of fair\nrepresentation was also sufficient to prove a Title VII\nviolation under the traditional McDonnell Douglas\nframework. See 506 F.3d at 884 (observing that the district\n\n\n  10\n     Nor could we have, because such cases simply do not exist.

There we\nstated that Bugg “set out a three-pronged test for establishing a prima facie\nclaim of discrimination against a union,” but we applied that test to the\nplaintiff’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. 42 F.3d at *1.

There, Black\nfirefighters brought actions against their union for violation\nof Title VII and breach of the duty of fair representation, and\nwe found that “[t]he same facts underl[ay] [both] the\nfirefighters’ Title VII . . . and ‘unfair representation’ claims.”\nGolden, 633 F.2d at 819. We found no evidence that the\nunion had breached its duty of fair representation, id. at\n821–22; 823–24, yet we also gave a lengthy analysis of\nplaintiffs’ Title VII claims, id. at 822–23. If “breach of the\nduty of fair representation” was a necessary element of a Title\nVII claim against a union, we would have had no need to\nseparately offer that Title VII analysis—once we established\nthat Local 55 did not breach the duty, the case would have\nbeen over. Had Beck required proof of a breach of the duty\nof fair representation before a plaintiff could bring a Title VII\naction against a union, it would have added a new element to\nthe test set out in Golden, and thus undermined that decision.\nSee also Pejic v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502345\"><a href=\"/opinion/502345/vojislav-pejic-v-hughes-helicopters-inc-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n671–74 (9th Cir. 1988) (treating separately Title VII and duty\nof fair representation claims against a union).\n\n    Accordingly, we do not read Beck to require a plaintiff\nbringing a Title VII discrimination claim—or, by analogy, an\nADA disability discrimination claim—against a union to\nprove a breach of the union’s duty of fair representation in his\nprima facie case, nor can we find any other circuit precedent\nthat requires as much. Rather, we take Beck at its word that\nthe key inquiry in a Title VII case against a union is whether\n\f                      GARITY V. APWU                         25\n\nthe union “deliberately declines to pursue a member’s claim\nbecause of” a protected classification. 506 F.3d at 882. As\nsuch, we hold that Beck does not compel a different result\nthan we reach here.\n\n    2. The Seventh Circuit’s decision in Green\n\n    We think that the better rule is set out in the Seventh\nCircuit’s recent decision in Green v. American Federation of\nTeachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 604, in which\nthat court rejected its prior analysis in Bugg and held that a\n“claim against a labor organization under [Title VII] does not\ndepend on showing that . . . the union violated any state\nstatute or contract.” 740 F.3d at 1107. The court explained\nthat “the application of Title VII to employers does not\ndepend on a statute or contract outside of Title VII,” and that\n“[n]othing in the text or genesis of Title VII suggests that\nclaims against labor organizations should be treated\ndifferently.” Id. at 1105 (emphasis added). To support its\nholding, the Green court looked to the text of the statute,\ndiscussed the history and purpose of Title VII, and referred to\nSupreme Court precedent setting forth the prima facie\nelements of a Title VII claim. See id. at 1105–07.\n\n    First, Green noted that Congress explicitly applied Title\nVII to unions by way of § 2000e-2(c). Id. at 1105–06; see\nalso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (“It shall be an unlawful\nemployment practice for a labor organization (1) to exclude\nor to expel from its membership, or otherwise to discriminate\nagainst, any individual because of his race, color, religion,\nsex, or national origin . . . .”). The court explained that when\nthe law was enacted in 1964, “some states had laws\nauthorizing (even requiring) employers and unions to\ndiscriminate against blacks,” and “[m]any unions had\n\f26                   GARITY V. APWU\n\nnegotiated collective bargaining agreements” with racially\ndiscriminatory elements. Green, 740 F.3d at 1105. A\n“principal objective of the federal statute,” then, “was to\nrequire labor organizations to disregard those statutes and\ncontracts and to end racial differences in treatment.” Id. at\n1106.\n\n    With Title VII’s anti-discriminatory purpose front-of-\nmind, the Green court found that premising Title VII’s\napplicability on whether a union had violated a contract or\nstatute in addition to committing a discriminatory act would\nrender the statute “pointless.” Id. The Green court set out the\nproblem succinctly:\n\n       Unless a contract, or some other statute, gave\n       the plaintiff an entitlement, Title VII would\n       do nothing. Yet if a union has, and violates,\n       such a duty, then a remedy may be had under\n       that statute or contract. Title VII would be\n       otiose, and claims of discrimination against\n       unions would be either unavailing or\n       unnecessary.\n\nId. Put differently, if a Title VII claim required a breach of\ncontract or a violation of some statutory duty, the plaintiff\ncould simply sue under the contract or statute, rendering Title\nVII superfluous. The court then observed that the suggestion\nin its prior cases—including Bugg—that a plaintiff must show\na violation of the duty of fair representation in order to\nsustain a Title VII action against a union “conflate[d] Title\nVII with the elements of a hybrid breach-of-contract/duty-of-\nfair-representation claim against an employer and union\nunder 29 U.S.C. § 185.” Id. Disapproving Bugg, the court\n\f                           GARITY V. APWU                                 27\n\ndecided that “[t]his approach [did] not bear any evident\nrelation to Title VII,” and “withdr[e]w the language.” Id.\n\n    To bolster its holding, the Seventh Circuit highlighted\nhow absurd the union’s argument would be in other contexts.\nSee id. at 1105. For example, if a Title VII claim relied on\nbreach of a contract, how could a prospective employee ever\nbring a claim against a prospective employer for racially\nbiased hiring practices? Obviously no contract has been\nformed between the two parties because the employee was\nnever hired, but Title VII certainly covers this interaction.\nSimilarly, if an employer and employee have an at-will\nemployment contract, the employer has not violated the terms\nof the contract by firing the employee on account of race.\nBut again, there is no dispute that Title VII would provide the\nemployee relief. There is no reason, the Seventh Circuit\nasserted, to treat claims against a union any differently. Id.\n\n    Next, the Green court pivoted to the text of Title VII and\nthe Supreme Court’s precedent setting forth the elements of\na prima facie Title VII claim. See id. at 1105–06. A reading\nof the statutes “forbid[ding] discrimination by any labor\norganization”11 and “forbid[ding] retaliation against a person\n\n\n\n 11\n    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice\nfor a labor organization (1) to exclude or to expel from its membership, or\notherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of his race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin; (2) to limit, segregate, or classify\nits membership or applicants for membership, or to classify or fail or\nrefuse to refer for employment any individual, in any way which would\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities, or\nwould limit such employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\nhis status as an employee or as an applicant for employment, because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (3) to\n\f28                        GARITY V.

See Green, 740 F.3d at 1105.\nNor does an analysis of McDonnell Douglas’s well-known\nroadmap of a Title VII prima facie claim reveal such\nrequirement.13 Though the Seventh Circuit recognized that\n“courts regularly have restated or modified the elements [of\na Title VII claim] to cover new situations” in the forty years\nsince the McDonnell Douglas decision, it noted that a court\nis “not authorized to add to that framework in a way that\ncauses Title VII as administered to include elements missing\nfrom Title VII as enacted.” Green, 740 F.3d at 1106–07.\nDemanding that a plaintiff show that “the union violated any\nstate statute or contract . . . cannot properly be added as part\nof the prima facie case.” Id. at 1107.

APWU                                 29\n\n       3. Green’s application to Garity’s ADA claims\n\n    We are persuaded by the Green court’s decision that a\nTitle VII claim against a union does not include an extra-\ntextual “breach of the duty of fair representation” element,\nand see no reason why the Seventh Circuit’s analysis should\nnot apply with equal force to the ADA claim before us here.\nLike Title VII, the ADA was promulgated to combat\ndiscrimination in the workplace,14 and indeed, the statute\nnotes that “unlike individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin,\n[or] religion”—the groups protected by Title VII—\n“individuals who have experienced discrimination on the\nbasis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress\nsuch discrimination.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(4).15 Like Title VII,\nthe ADA includes labor organizations as a covered entity.\nCompare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) with 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2).\nLike Title VII, the ADA does not refer to any element that\napplies only to claims brought by union members against\ntheir unions. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c) (Title VII\ndiscrimination) with 42 U.S.C. § 12112 (ADA\ndiscrimination); also compare § 2000e-3(a) (Title VII\n\n\n 14\n   See George Rutherglen, Title VII as Precedent: Past and Prologue for\nFuture Legislation, 10 Stan. J. of C.R. & C.L. 159, 166–67 (2014)\n(describing the ADA as a “descendant[] of Title VII” that made Title VII’s\n“prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national\norigin, color, and religion applicable to discrimination on the basis of . . .\ndisability”).\n      15\n      § 12101(4) also notes that “individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of . . . age” have “legal recourse to redress\nsuch discrimination.” Workplace discrimination on the basis of age was\naddressed by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,\n29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\n\f30                        GARITY V. APWU\n\nretaliation) with § 12203(a) (ADA retaliation). And, most\nimportantly, like the prima facie Title VII claim outlined by\nthe Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas, the prima facie\nADA claims for disability discrimination and retaliation\ndeveloped in this circuit do not include a “breach of the duty\nof fair representation” element.16\n\n    Just as the Seventh Circuit explained in Green, we are not\nauthorized to add another element to a prima facie claim\nunder the ADA, especially when the legislature and our court\nhave both already spoken so clearly on the issue. Nor would\nwe even if we could. If an ADA claim against a union\nrequired that the plaintiff show a breach of contract—namely\nthat the union had breached its duty of fair representation to\nits member—the plaintiff would have no need to sue under\nthe ADA, as she could simply sue for breach of contract. See\nGreen, 740 F.3d at 1106. It makes no sense to design a set of\nprima facie elements that renders the underlying claim\nunnecessary.\n\n    APWU’s argument to the contrary confuses the goals of\nanti-discrimination laws, like Title VII and the ADA, with the\npurposes of labor laws, like § 301 of the Labor Management\nRelations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. § 185, and the National\nLabor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq. APWU, quite\ncorrectly, explains that federal labor laws impose upon unions\n\n 16\n    See Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas.

And indeed that deferential standard\nworked in APWU’s favor here: Garity lost her breach of the\nduty of fair representation claim before the district court and\nthis court.\n\n    But anti-discrimination statutes like the ADA cannot be\nread to parrot a cause of action that already exists under\nfederal labor laws. Title VII and the ADA were enacted\ndecades after those union-boosting laws and imposed\nadditional affirmative responsibilities on unions. Their\nplaintiff-friendly pleading standards—essentially, to make\nout a prima facie case under Title VII, the claimant need only\nmake a series of factual assertions before the burden shifts to\nthe defendant, see McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at\n802–03—make clear that the free hand unions have in other\nlabor matters does not extend to discrimination suits. Unions\nare uniquely knowledgeable when it comes to collective\nbargaining agreements and employment contracts, and the\nlaw affords them some latitude when adjudicating disputes\narising from those contracts; there is no reason to grant them\nthe same deference when it comes to determining if unions\ndiscriminated against their members on the basis of a\nprotected classification like disability. What the cases\ndemonstrate is that a plaintiff may have an easier path to\nproving a Title VII or an ADA claim when she can also show\nthat the union has violated its duty of fair representation. See,\n\f32                         GARITY V. APWU\n\ne.g., Beck, 506 F.3d at 884–85. What this case also shows,\nhowever, is that the converse is not necessarily true: A\nplaintiff may still have a Title VII or an ADA claim even if\nshe can’t prove a violation of the labor laws.\n\n    Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s order\ndismissing Garity’s ADA claims on issue preclusion grounds,\nand remand for further proceedings as to her discrimination\nand retaliation claims.17 We do not pass on the merits of\nthese claims, but note that, prior to the district court’s issue\npreclusion order, it had determined that Garity had proffered\nsufficient evidence to survive APWU’s motion to dismiss.\n\n                                     IV\n\n    The judgment of the district court with respect to Garity’s\nclaims for disability discrimination and retaliation under the\nADA is reversed, and the case is remanded to the district\ncourt for further proceedings. Considering our judgment in\nthis opinion and the accompanying memorandum disposition,\nthe parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n 17\n     Garity also argues that she has properly stated an ADA claim against\nAPWU for failure to accommodate her disabilities. See Allen v. Pac. Bell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784117\"><a href=\"/opinion/784117/no-02-55721/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1114 (9th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Because we are unsure\nif the district court passed on this claim in the first instance, we remand it\nto the district court for further proceedings. We address the district court’s\ndismissal of Garity’s ADA claim for hostile work environment in a\nseparate unpublished memorandum filed with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
