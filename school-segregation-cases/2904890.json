See generally 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d); Holland v. Florida, __\n\nU.S. __, 130 S.Ct. 2549 (2010). Jeffrey G. Hutchinson was convicted of four\n\ncounts of first degree murder for shotgunning to death his girlfriend, Renee\n\nFlaherty, and her three children: nine-year-old Geoffrey, seven-year-old Amanda,\n\nand four-year-old Logan. Hutchinson v. State, 882 So. 2d 943, 948–49 (Fla. 2004)\n\nabrogated by Deparvine v. State, 995 So. 2d 351 (Fla. 2008). He was sentenced to\n\nlife imprisonment for the murder of Renee Flaherty and to death for the murder of\n\neach child. Id. at 949. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct\n\nappeal. Id. at 961. After an evidentiary hearing state collateral relief was denied,\n\nand that denial was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court. Hutchinson v. State,\n\n17 So. 3d 696, 702–04 (Fla. 2009).\n\n      The district court dismissed Hutchinson’s 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition for\n\nfederal habeas relief because it was not filed until July 24, 2009, which was three\n\nyears, nine months, and twenty-four days (or 1,393 days) after the one-year statute\n\nof limitations contained in § 2244(d) had run on September 30, 2005. Hutchinson\n\nv. Florida, No. 5:09-CV-261-RS, 2010 WL 3833921 (N.D. Fla. Sept. 28, 2010).\n\nThis is Hutchinson’s appeal from that dismissal.\n\n      Under § 2244(d)(1)(A) the one-year period for filing a federal habeas\n\n                                          2\n\fpetition starts running on the date “on which the [state court] judgment became\n\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking\n\nsuch review.” But § 2244(d)(2) provides that “[t]he time during which a properly\n\nfiled application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\n\nthe pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted.” In order for that\n\n§ 2244(d)(2) statutory tolling to apply, the petitioner must file his state collateral\n\npetition before the one-year period for filing his federal habeas petition has run.\n\nMcCloud v. Hooks, 560 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir. 2009); Alexander v. Sec’y,\n\nDep’t of Corr., 523 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir. 2008) abrogated on other grounds\n\nby Wall v. Kholi, __ U.S. __, 131 S.Ct. 1278 (2011); see also Hunter v. Ferrell,\n\n587 F.3d 1304, 1308 n.3 (11th Cir. 2009). Hutchinson’s state collateral petition\n\nwas not filed until October 20, 2005, which was twenty days after the entire one-\n\nyear period for filing the federal petition had run on September 30, 2005, and as a\n\nresult none of the limitations period for filing his federal petition was left to be\n\ntolled. From that point on Hutchinson’s hopes for relief were riding all or nothing\n\non his state collateral petition, and the result came up nothing when the Florida\n\nSupreme Court affirmed the denial of collateral relief. See Hutchinson, 17 So. 3d\n\nat 702–04.\n\n      Hutchinson recognizes both that his federal habeas petition should have\n\n                                           3\n\fbeen filed by September 30, 2005, and that because his state collateral petition was\n\nnot filed until October 20, 2005, he cannot claim statutory tolling under §\n\n2244(d)(2) for any of the time that his state collateral proceeding was ongoing.\n\nHis sole contention is that he is entitled to equitable tolling. See generally\n\nHolland, 130 S.Ct. 2549. Equitable tolling is, well, equitable in nature, and\n\ndecisions regarding it must be made “on a case-by-case basis” in light of “specific\n\ncircumstances, often hard to predict in advance,” although we “can and do draw\n\nupon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.” Id. at 2563 (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). We turn now to the specific facts and circumstances of this case\n\nas well as to the decisions in similar cases for guidance.\n\n      The parties agree that the problem in this case arose because the attorneys\n\nwho filed Hutchinson’s state collateral petition misunderstood the date on which\n\nthe limitations period began to run at the end of the direct appeal process and, as a\n\nresult, they miscalculated the filing deadline. Because no petition for writ of\n\ncertiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court as part of the direct appeal,\n\nthe time for filing the federal habeas petition started running upon “the expiration\n\nof the time for seeking such review.” 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A). Hutchinson’s\n\nattorneys understood that, but they misunderstood when the time for seeking\n\ncertiorari review of a state court’s judgment expired. They thought that the time\n\n                                          4\n\ffor doing so expired ninety days after the Florida Supreme Court issued its\n\nmandate on July 22, 2004. See App. A ¶ 2. Instead, the time actually expired\n\nninety days after the issuance of the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment (the\n\nopinion was the judgment), which had happened twenty-one days earlier on July 1,\n\n2004. See Sup. Ct. R. 13.3 (“The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs\n\nfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not\n\nfrom the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).”).\n\n       As a result of that misunderstanding, Hutchinson’s attorneys miscalculated\n\nthe deadline by which they were required to file either Hutchinson’s federal\n\nhabeas petition or file his state collateral petition in time to statutorily toll the\n\nfederal limitations period. They believed that they had until October 20, 2005,\n\ninstead of September 30, 2005, which was the actual deadline.1 Because they filed\n\nHutchinson’s state collateral petition on October 20, 2005, the § 2244(d)(2) tolling\n\nprovision did not kick in and when Hutchinson finally filed his federal habeas\n\npetition on July 24, 2009, it was three-and-three-quarters years too late.\n\n       A petitioner has the burden of establishing his right—if “right” is not too\n\n\n       1\n         By our calculations, the actual deadline should have been September 29, 2005, because\nthat is one year after September 29, 2004, the date on which the judgment of the state court\nbecame final under § 2244(d)(1)(A). For some reason, the district court said and the parties say\nthat the deadline was September 30, 2005. Because the difference makes no difference we will\nuse the September 30, 2005 date, too.\n\n                                                5\n\fstrong a word in the area of equity—to equitable tolling. He must plead or proffer\n\nenough facts that, if true, would justify an evidentiary hearing on the issue.\n\nChavez v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 647 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir. 2011). And\n\nthe allegations supporting equitable tolling must be specific and not conclusory.\n\nId. at 1061. The Supreme Court did say in Holland that although equitable relief\n\nis flexible and all the facts and circumstances must be considered, we should\n\n“draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.” Holland, 130\n\nS.Ct. at 2563. We take that statement to mean this is not an area free of rules of\n\nlaw, governed entirely by the chancellor’s foot, but we are instead bound by\n\nprecedent to the extent that there is precedent.2\n\n\n\n       2\n       And it is a good thing that rules of precedent apply here. Even Blackstone, who was\nsomething of a fan of equity, warned that:\n\n       [T]he liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light, must not be indulged too far;\n       lest thereby we destroy all law, and leave the decision of every question entirely in the\n       breast of the judge. And law, without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more\n       desirable for the public good, than equity without law: which would make every judge a\n       legislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then be almost as many\n       different rules of action laid down in our courts, as there are differences of capacity and\n       sentiment in the human mind.\n\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *62; see also 1 Joseph Story, Commentaries on Equity\nJurisprudence § 19, at 16 (13th ed. 1886) (“If indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess\nthe unbounded jurisdiction which has been thus generally ascribed to it . . . it would be the most\ngigantic in its sway, and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary power, that could well be\ndevised.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f      Binding precedent has laid down two requirements that a federal habeas\n\npetitioner must meet before a court can grant him equitable tolling of the §\n\n2244(d) statute of limitations. In the Supreme Court’s words: “[A] petitioner is\n\nentitled to equitable tolling only if he shows (1) that he has been pursuing his\n\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.”\n\nHolland, 130 S.Ct. at 2562 (quotation marks omitted); Lawrence v. Florida, 549\n\nU.S. 327, 336, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 1085 (2007); see also Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1066,\n\n1068. The Supreme Court has also instructed us that “a garden variety claim of\n\nexcusable neglect such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a\n\nfiling deadline does not warrant equitable tolling.” Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2564\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted); Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336–37, 127 S.Ct.\n\nat 1085 (“Attorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable\n\ntolling, particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no\n\nconstitutional right to counsel.”); see also Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1066.\n\n      This case involves, in Holland’s language, “a garden variety claim of\n\nexcusable neglect,” arising from “a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to\n\nmiss a filing deadline.” See Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2564 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe attorneys who filed the state collateral petition for Hutchinson misunderstood\n\nwhat § 2244(d)(1)(A)’s “expiration of the time for seeking such review” meant\n\n                                          7\n\fwhen read against Supreme Court Rule 13.3. The fact that they ought to have\n\nknown better does not justify equitable tolling.3 The attorneys who miscalculated\n\nthe deadline for filing in the Lawrence case did so because they were not aware of\n\nwell-settled law that should have prevented any confusion on their part. See\n\nLawrence, 549 U.S. at 336–37, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. Yet, the Supreme Court still\n\nheld that equitable tolling was not justified in that case because “[a]ttorney\n\nmiscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.” Id. at 336,\n\n127 S.Ct. at 1085. If attorney miscalculation, error, or negligence were enough for\n\nequitable tolling, the § 2244(d) statute of limitations would be tolled to the brink\n\nof extinction because in practically every case where there is a failure to meet the\n\nfiling deadline an attorney is at fault. See Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1071 (“In virtually\n\n\n\n       3\n         Any implicit criticism by us of Hutchinson’s attorneys for their mistake is tempered by\nawareness that a panel of this Court made exactly the same mistake a year-and-a-half before\nthose two attorneys did. The opinion in Diaz v. Secretary for the Department of Corrections, 362\nF.3d 698 (11th Cir. 2004), states that “[t]he 90-day period in which Diaz could have filed a\npetition in the United States Supreme Court expired on June 19, 1997, at which time the clock\nbegan to run on the one-year limitation for the filing of habeas petitions.” Id. at 699. The\nopinion in that case shows, however, that June 19, 1997 was 90 days after the state appellate\ncourt’s mandate had issued and not 90 days after its opinion had issued, which was 16 days\nearlier. See id. We do not know if the Diaz opinion confused Hutchinson’s counsel or if they\nwere even aware of it. What we do know is that no one is perfect; we all make mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fevery case where the issue of equitable tolling comes up one or more attorneys\n\nshould have acted with more dispatch, but more than that is required.”).\n\n      Hutchinson argues that more is involved here than simple attorney error or\n\nmiscalculation. The “more” that he contends is involved is set out in the affidavit\n\nthat he filed in the district court in response to the motion to dismiss his federal\n\nhabeas petition as untimely. (That affidavit is reproduced in full as Appendix A to\n\nthis opinion.) In his affidavit, Hutchinson states that he repeatedly expressed to\n\nthe two attorneys who were representing him his concern about the statute of\n\nlimitations, and on September 22, 2005 he told them “point blank and in no\n\nuncertain terms to ‘either file my rule 3.851 motion immediately or I will\n\ndischarge you and file it myself.’” App. A ¶ 15. On that occasion, Hutchinson\n\nrecounts, both attorneys promised him that they “would file the motion on or\n\nbefore September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after\n\nthe mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851 motion\n\nwas not actually due until ‘October 20th.’” Id. According to Hutchinson, he again\n\ntold his two attorneys that if they did not file the Rule 3.851 motion “immediately”\n\nhe would file it himself because he knew that was “the only way [he] could\n\nprevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on [his] 2254 petition.” Id.\n\nThe attorneys “guaranteed” him that they would file the state court motion “no\n\n                                           9\n\flater than September 28, 2005.” Id. But they did not do that. Instead, they filed\n\nthe state court motion on October 20, 2005.4\n\n       Hutchinson alleges that but for his attorneys’ promise to file by September\n\n28, 2005 he “would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.851 motion to\n\nprevent 28 U.S.C. § 2255(d)(1)’s [sic] one-year limitations period from expiring.”\n\nApp. A ¶ 16. He attached to his affidavit “facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se\n\nStatus and Rule 3.851 Motion that [he] would have filed on September 23, 2005,\n\nbut for [the attorneys’] promise.” Id. Those two facsimiles are each dated\n\nSeptember 23, 2005 and signed by Hutchinson, indicating that he was ready,\n\nwilling, and able to file his motion to proceed pro se and his Rule 3.851 motion\n\non or soon after that date and would have done so but for his attorneys’ promises,\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          In his affidavit Hutchinson states that before the statute of limitations ran he met with\nattorney Brody three times, App. A ¶¶ 7, 10, 12, with attorney Hazen four times, id. ¶¶ 6, 8, 11,\n13, and with both of them on two other occasions, id. ¶¶ 14, 15. He states that during one of his\nmeetings with Brody alone, more than five months before the limitations period ran, Brody was\n“visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol,” id. ¶ 12, and during another meeting two-\nand-a-half months before the limitations period ran Brody was “sweating profusely and smelled\nof alcohol,” id. ¶ 14. Hutchinson also says that on that later occasion Hazen told him that Brody\nwas “just having a lot of personal problems.” Id. But there is no allegation that Brody’s\nimpairment, if any, caused the error in miscalculating the due date. See Chavez, 647 F.3d at\n1071 (holding that equitable tolling was not appropriate where “[t]here are . . . no allegations at\nall that [state post-conviction counsel’s] health had affected his ability to handle the case up to\nthe time he withdrew or that it had prevented him from filing the motion for state post-conviction\nrelief sooner”). Nor has Hutchinson alleged that attorney Hazen, who actually signed and filed\nthe Rule 3.851 motion in state court on October 20, 2005, was ever impaired in any way.\n\n                                                10\n\fwhich were not kept.5\n\n       Hutchinson knew, at least by October 19, 2005, that his attorneys had not\n\nfiled his state Rule 3.851 motion by the September 30, 2005 deadline (or the\n\nSeptember 28, 2005 deadline, as he had calculated it). We know that Hutchinson\n\nknew that because October 19, 2005 is the date Hutchinson signed, under penalty\n\nof perjury, the verification on the Rule 3.851 motion (which one of the attorneys\n\nfiled in state court the next day).6 Just twenty-seven days earlier he had told his\n\ntwo attorneys that filing the Rule 3.851 motion in state court by September 28,\n\n2005 was necessary to prevent the federal filing deadline from expiring. See App.\n\n\n\n       5\n         Hutchinson’s affidavit also states that on three occasions, the last of which was July 14,\n2005, he asked his attorneys to file a “shell-brief” in state court in order to prevent the time from\nrunning while they investigated his case and prepared the real motion for state collateral relief.\nApp. A ¶¶ 11, 13, 14. But attorney Hazen told him then that a state court “shell brief didn’t\nprovide the protection that it used to.” Id. ¶ 11. It appears that Hazen was correct about that.\nThe respondent’s brief in this case informs us that in 2001 Florida’s Rule 3.851 was amended to\nprohibit the filing of shell motions, see Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(e)(1)(D); Gonzalez v. State, 990\nSo. 2d 1017, 1034 & n.9 (Fla. 2008), and that shell motions are stricken by the Florida courts and\nno longer can be used to meet filing deadlines. In his reply brief, Hutchinson does not take issue\nwith any of that information.\n       6\n         Although Hutchinson’s affidavit and the date of his signature on the federal habeas\npetition establish beyond dispute that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his\nstate petition, our separately writing colleague asserts that Hutchinson had no reason to file his\nfederal habeas petition until nearly four years later because he relied on his attorneys’ assurances\nthat they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights. See Concurring Op.\nat 25–26. That assertion is belied by Hutchinson’s own sworn statements, which establish that\nhe knew his attorneys had missed the deadline, yet for years after realizing that he still made no\nattempt to file in federal court the collateral petition he had already drafted. However judges may\nfeel about the law applicable to this or any other area, we have no license to rewrite the facts of a\ncase.\n\n                                                 11\n\fA ¶ 15. And Hutchinson had already drafted, dated, and had ready to file a\n\ncomplete petition setting out all of the claims that he wanted to raise. Id. ¶¶\n\n15–16. By simply changing the name of the court in which that petition was to be\n\nfiled, Hutchinson himself could have filed his federal habeas petition on or soon\n\nafter October 20, 2005, which would have been just twenty days after the\n\nexpiration of the one-year limitations period.7\n\n       Yet Hutchinson did nothing of the sort for nearly four years. He did not file\n\nhis pro se habeas petition in federal court until July 24, 2009, which was long after\n\nthe state trial court had denied his Rule 3.851 motion on January 3, 2008, and was\n\nalso after the Florida Supreme Court had affirmed that denial on July 9, 2009.\n\n\n       7\n          Had Hutchinson done so, the federal district court could have held his federal habeas\npetition in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. See Rhines\nv. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 278–79, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 1535 (2005). Our colleague’s suggestion that a\ndistrict court might dismiss such a petition without abusing its discretion is contradicted by the\nonly authority she cites for that proposition, which is the Rhines decision. See Concurring Op. at\n26 n.21. The Supreme Court stated in Rhines that:\n\n       [I]t likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to\n       dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust,\n       his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that\n       the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such\n       circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed\n       petition. See Lundy, 455 U.S., at 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198 (the total exhaustion\n       requirement was not intended to “unreasonably impair the prisoner’s right to\n       relief”). In such a case, the petitioner’s interest in obtaining federal review of his\n       claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of\n       federal petitions.\n\nRhines, 544 U.S. at 278, 125 S.Ct. at 1535.\n\n                                                12\n\fMore to the point, Hutchinson waited to file his federal petition for three years,\n\nnine months and five days—a total of 1,374 days—after he learned on October 19,\n\n2005 that his attorneys had missed the deadline for a filing in state court that\n\nwould have tolled the federal limitations period. There is nothing in Hutchinson’s\n\naffidavit or in his briefs to explain his delay of nearly four years. Nothing.\n\n      We need not decide whether Hutchinson has established that an\n\nextraordinary circumstance stood in the way of his meeting the § 2244(d) filing\n\ndeadline, because he has not carried his burden of showing that he pursued his\n\nrights diligently. See Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2562; Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336, 127\n\nS.Ct. at 1085; see also Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1066, 1068. Although Hutchinson’s\n\naffidavit may show that he diligently attempted to have his state collateral motion\n\nfiled in time to give him the benefit of § 2244(d) statutory tolling, it does not show\n\nthat once that opportunity was missed he pursued his federal rights diligently.\n\nInstead, his affidavit and the other materials he has submitted show that he had in\n\nhand a petition that he could have re-labeled and filed pro se in federal court\n\nwithin three weeks after the one-year limitations period ran, but he waited three-\n\nand-three-quarter years before he filed a pro se federal habeas petition. That is not\n\nreasonable diligence.\n\n      Hutchinson’s lengthy delay in filing his pro se federal habeas petition stands\n\n                                          13\n\fin stark contrast to the petitioner’s diligence in the Holland case. The Supreme\n\nCourt stressed that “the very day that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock\n\nhad expired due to [his attorney’s] failings, Holland prepared his own habeas\n\npetition pro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.” Holland, 130 S.Ct. at\n\n2565 (emphasis in original). Holland’s filing of his federal habeas petition the day\n\nafter he learned that “his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney’s]\n\nfailings” may be “maximum feasible diligence,” id., which is not required.\n\nBut Hutchinson’s failure to do anything to get his federal habeas petition filed for\n\nnearly four years after he learned that the AEDPA clock had run out due to his\n\nattorneys’ miscalculation is not even “reasonable diligence,” which is required, id.\n\n      The district court did not err in concluding that Hutchinson was not entitled\n\nto equitable tolling of 1,393 days.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the result only:\n\n       Initially, I disagree with the majority’s holding that Hutchinson was not\n\nreasonably diligent in pursuing his claims. He did everything any reasonable\n\nclient would do to assure that his lawyers protected his interests, including\n\nimploring his lawyers to file his post-conviction pleadings in a timely manner.\n\nThe majority’s suggestion that Hutchinson should have filed a placeholder pro se\n\nhabeas petition is simply not logical when Hutchinson was represented by lawyers\n\nwho were assuring him that his claims were being pursued.\n\n       However, no matter how diligent Hutchinson was or could have been, as the\n\nlaw stands today, this Court still could not grant Hutchinson the relief of equitable\n\ntolling because the Supreme Court has held that, notwithstanding his diligence, a\n\ndefendant is responsible for and must bear the consequences of his lawyer’s\n\nnegligence.1 See Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336–37; Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S.\n\n722, 753–54 (1991); see also Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. ___ , ___ (2012) (slip\n\nop., at 7); Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563.\n\n       The holdings of Lawrence and Coleman are premised on the continued\n\n\n       1\n         In order to merit equitable tolling, a petitioner must establish “(1) that he has been\npursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.”\nHolland v. Florida, 560 U.S. ___, ___,130 S. Ct. 2549, 2562 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). A lawyer’s negligence does not constitute an “extraordinary circumstance.” See id. at\n2564 (citing Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U.S. 327, 336 (2007)). Here, where Hutchinson’s lawyers\nnegligently filed his state post-conviction petition too late to statutorily toll the federal habeas\nfiling deadline, their negligence does not constitute an “extraordinary circumstance.”\n\fapplication to death row inmates of the agency theory of the lawyer-client\n\nrelationship. See, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565 U.S. ___, ___, 132 S. Ct. 912, 922\n\n(2012) (explaining that Coleman’s holding was based on “well-settled principles\n\nof agency law” that “the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of\n\nhis agent.”). However, as amplified below, none of the key assumptions\n\nunderlying the application of an agency relationship to a death-sentenced client\n\nand his lawyer are valid in the post-conviction context.2 When the law already\n\nrecognizes equitable exceptions to holding a client responsible for his lawyer’s\n\nactions under circumstances with less drastic consequences, an exception should\n\nalso be made for death row inmates so that their lawyer’s negligence does not\n\npreclude federal review of constitutional claims.\n\n                      I. Agency Principles and Death Row Inmates\n\n       An agency relationship exists to permit one person to act on behalf of\n\nanother.3 Generally the principal chooses an agent to act on his behalf for a\n\n\n       2\n          See Adam Liptak, Foreword, Agency and Equity: Why do we blame clients for their\nlawyers’ mistakes?, 110 Mich. L. R. 875, 875 (2012) (stating that “clients and lawyers fit the\nagency model imperfectly. Agency law is built on the concepts of free choice, consent, and\nloyalty, and it is not unusual to find lawyer-client relationships in which some or all of these\nelements are missing.”).\n       3\n         See 1 Floyd R. Mechem Treatise on the Law of Agency § 80 (2d ed. 1914) (“It is the\ngeneral rule that an agency may be created for the performance of any lawful act, and that\nwhatever a person may lawfully do, if acting in his own right and in his own behalf, he may\nlawfully delegate to an agent.”).\n\n                                                 16\n\fspecific purpose,4 and in a traditional lawyer-client relationship, a client hires a\n\nlawyer to represent him in a discrete legal matter. The legitimacy of transferring\n\nresponsibility for the lawyer’s negligence from the lawyer to the client is based on\n\nseveral assumptions that underpin the agency relationship. First, it is assumed that\n\nthe client voluntarily chooses his lawyer for competence, diligence, and loyalty.5\n\nSecond, it is assumed that the client has the ability to direct the actions of the\n\nlawyer6 or, at the very least, that constant and adequate opportunities exist for\n\ncommunication between the client and his lawyer.7\n\n       But these assumptions do not apply to inmates on death row, almost all of\n\nwhom do not choose their lawyers. Instead they must depend on appointed or pro\n\nbono volunteer counsel who too often lack expertise in post-conviction death\n\npenalty representation. See, e.g., Maples, 132 S. Ct. at 918. Consequently, the\n\nrepresentation provided in state and federal post-conviction proceedings is too\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         See Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958) (“Agency is the fiduciary relation\nwhich results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act\non his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act.”).\n       5\n           See Model Rules of Prof’l Conduct R. 1.1, 1.3 (2009).\n       6\n           See id.

The\n\nSupreme Court noted that not only does Alabama set “low eligibility requirements\n\nfor lawyers appointed to represent indigent capital defendants at trial,” Maples,\n\n132 S. Ct. at 917, it is “[n]early alone” in not “guarantee[ing] representation to\n\nindigent capital defendants in post-conviction proceedings,” id. at 918. Instead,\n\nAlabama primarily relies on the efforts of out-of-state volunteer lawyers to handle\n\npost-conviction representation. Id.\n\n       The agency analogy also breaks down because death row inmates have a\n\nlimited ability to communicate with their lawyers.11 Prisons are often located in\n\nfar-flung places that are difficult for lawyers to reach and often the lawyers are not\n\neven located within the same state as their death row clients. Additionally,\n\ninmates have restricted access to phones, the internet, and law libraries. In\n\nLawrence and Holland, it was the lack of access to word processing systems and a\n\n\n\n       10\n        See Gary Blakenship, Registry Lawyers Defended at Committee Meeting, Fla.

In Alabama, death row inmates’ phone calls are limited to twenty-five\n\nminutes, with prison officials determining the schedule and frequency of phone\n\nconversations.12 According to Georgia’s inmate orientation handbook, phone calls\n\nin Georgia prisons are limited to fifteen minutes.13\n\n       Moreover, if a death row inmate is held in a super-maximum security prison\n\nor a segregation housing unit (“SHU”), which most are, these barriers may be even\n\nmore difficult to overcome. First, access to basic reading and writing materials\n\nmay be entirely restricted, depending on how much of a security threat the inmate\n\nis deemed to be. See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521 (2006) (upholding prison\n\nregulation that denies access to written material to violent inmates). Second,\n\ncommunication with the outside world becomes even more challenging and more\n\nrestricted. “In virtually every state, death-row inmates are ‘locked down’ in their\n\ncell for most of the day, have little or no access to educational or other prison\n\n\n       12\n        Alabama Department of Corrections, Inmate Telephone System Admin.

Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 214\n\n(2005). Finally, the psychological effects of spending extended periods in solitary\n\nconfinement—commonly known as SHU syndrome—may impair an inmate’s\n\nmental capabilities to the extent that his active participation in litigation becomes\n\nimpossible.15\n\n       Finally, even if death row inmates were given the ability to access their\n\nattorneys without these formidable obstacles, most death row inmates lack the\n\nskills and intellect to supervise, direct or police the activities of their lawyers in\n\nthe way that the agency paradigm assumes. “Capital inmates almost uniformly are\n\nindigent, and often illiterate and uneducated.”16 The dangers of these\n\nshortcomings are all the more pronounced in the context of federal habeas\n\n       14\n         John H.

Michigan, 545 U.S. 605, 621 (2005) (“Sixty-eight percent of the state\nprison population did not complete high school, and many lack the most basic literacy skills. . . .\nSeven out of ten inmates fall in the lowest two out of five levels of literacy–marked by an\n\n                                                22\n\f        Moreover, a habeas petitioner is not permitted to interfere with his lawyer’s\n\ndeterminations regarding which claims to raise. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S.\n\n745, 751 (1983). Even if a client wanted to correct his lawyer’s mistakes, he\n\nwould not be entitled to do so. A prisoner does not have a right to file pro se\n\npleadings while represented by counsel. See United States v. Gwiazdzinski, 141\n\nF.3d 784, 787 (7th Cir. 1998). Courts routinely decline to consider pro se\n\npleadings when an inmate is represented by counsel. See Downs v. McNeil, 520\n\nF.3d 1311, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (“[E]ven a savvy petitioner, who may see the\n\nclock running out on his habeas time, can only cajole [or] plead with his counsel to\n\nfile the petition timely.”) (citations omitted); see also 11th Cir.

An inmate’s inability to supervise and control the\n\nactions of his lawyer makes this relationship far more akin to the paradigm of an\n\nindependent contractor than a traditional agency relationship.19 The negligent acts\n\nof an independent contractor, unlike those of an agent, are not imputed to the\n\nemployer for the very reason that the employer lacks the power to meaningfully\n\nsupervise the contractor.\n\n      The reality of the quality of post-conviction death penalty representation\n\navailable to indigent inmates on death row does not meet the Supreme Court’s\n\nrecognition that Congress intended these inmates to have access to “quality legal\n\nrepresentation” when it mandated the statutory right to counsel.

McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855.\n\n       The circumstances surrounding Hutchinson’s lawyers’ negligent filing of\n\nhis state post-conviction motion in this case illustrate the difficulties faced by a\n\ndeath row inmate who attempts to work diligently with his lawyers. While on\n\ndeath row, Hutchinson maintained communication—to the best of his\n\nability—with his lawyers and repeatedly asked them to timely file his state post-\n\nconviction motion so as to toll the filing deadline for his federal habeas petition.20\n\nEven the majority recognizes that Hutchinson was reasonably diligent up to the\n\ntime that his lawyers filed his motion for state post-conviction relief. What other\n\nsteps could Hutchinson reasonably have taken? Should he not have trusted his\n\nlawyers when they assured him they were aware of and would comply with all\n\nfiling deadlines? There is certainly no expectation that a civil client will shadow\n\nhis lawyer’s every move to ensure that all deadlines are met and all filings are in\n\norder. On the contrary, a represented client has every right to assume that his\n\nlawyer will competently discharge his duties.\n\n       Nonetheless, the majority concludes that Hutchinson was not reasonably\n\n       20\n           The fact that Hutchinson signed the Rule 3.851 motion on October 19, 2005 does not\nestablish beyond dispute that he knew that his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his\nstate petition. Although Hutchinson kept asking his lawyers to file his state petition, there is\nnothing to indicate that he knew the precise deadline. It is equally consistent with the facts to\nbelieve that he simply wanted his state petition filed and later accepted his attorneys’ advice that\nthe deadline was October 20, 2005.\n\n                                                 25\n\fdiligent because he should have filed a pro se federal habeas petition and asked to\n\nhave it held in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were\n\ncompleted. This course of action surely cannot be required of a client when he has\n\nlegal representation.21 A reasonable prisoner would have no cause to file\n\nhis own pleadings for the simple reason that it is assumed that it is his lawyer’s job\n\nto do so. Especially here, where Hutchinson’s lawyers repeatedly assured him that\n\nthey would file on time, Hutchinson had no reason to pursue an alternative avenue\n\nof relief. Reasonably relying on his lawyers’ assurances that they were doing what\n\nwas necessary to protect his federal habeas rights, Hutchinson did not file a pro se\n\nfederal habeas petition until it was too late.\n\n       21\n           Indeed, there is no guarantee that such a placeholder petition would be accepted by the\nfederal district court. See Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 277 (2005) (“[S]tay and abeyance\nshould be available only in limited circumstances . . . and is only appropriate when the district\ncourt determines there was good cause for the petitioner’s failure to present his claims first to the\nstate courts.”). In a concurring opinion with the judgment in Rhines, Justice Stevens, with whom\nJustices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, observed that conditioning the stay-and-abeyance procedure\non “good cause” instead of simply on a lack of “intentionally dilatory litigation tactics” left open\nthe door for “[t]he trickiness of some exhaustion requirements to infect issues of good cause . . .\n.” Id. at 279. Moreover, Rhines concerned an issue distinct from the case at hand in which some\nhabeas corpus claims had been exhausted in state court and others had not. The stay-and-\nabeyance procedure was endorsed in limited circumstances in order to preserve the petitioner’s\ninterest in obtaining review of his claims. Id. at 278. In contrast, the good cause inquiry in this\ncase would have involved issues of attorney negligence. In addition, Hutchinson’s ability to\nattempt to prevail upon the stay-and-abeyance procedure turned on both his access to information\nabout the procedure, and a presumption that he did not believe his attorneys’ advice that the\nfiling deadline for his application for state post-conviction relief in order to preserve his federal\nhabeas corpus right was on October 20, 2005. Under these circumstances, it is far from certain\nthat Hutchinson would have been granted stay-and-abeyance by a district court applying the good\ncause standard and unlikely that a panel of this Court would have reversed a district court denial\nthereof on an abuse of discretion review.\n\n                                                 26\n\f           II. Exceptions to Client Responsibility for Lawyer’s Conduct\n\n      Death row inmates should not be precluded from having their federal claims\n\nreviewed because of their lawyer’s negligence. Exceptions to the principle that all\n\nclients are responsible for the negligence of their lawyers exist elsewhere in the\n\nlaw. For example, when more important countervailing values are at stake,\n\nvarious rules of civil procedure provide courts with discretion to excuse\n\nprocedural defaults in cases of lawyer negligence. See, e.g., Dove v. CODESCO,\n\n569 F.2d 807, 810 (4th Cir. 1978) (“[T]he sanctions for attorney neglect should be\n\nborne if at all possible by the attorney himself rather than by his client.”); Jackson\n\nv. Washington Monthly Co., 569 F.2d 119, 123, n.23 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“[A] sound\n\ndiscretion hardly comprehends a pointless exaction of retribution. Dismissals for\n\nmisconduct attributable to lawyers, and in no [way] to their clients, invariably\n\npenalize the innocent and may let the guilty off scot-free.”).\n\n      Rule 60(b)(1), for example, provides relief from a final judgment for\n\nexcusable neglect, which can “encompass situations in which the failure to comply\n\nwith a filing deadline is attributable to negligence.” United States v. Davenport,\n\n668 F.3d 1316, 1324 (11th Cir. 2012). Similarly, Rule 55(c) has been applied to\n\ngive a client relief from the entry of a default that was caused by the negligence of\n\nan attorney under the “good cause standard.” Shepard Claims Serv., Inc. v.\n\n                                          27\n\fWilliam Darrah & Assocs., 796 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir. 1986). Exceptions such as\n\nthose available under Rules 55(c) and 60(b) exist because, unlike a pure\n\nprincipal-agent relationship, most clients are not able to exercise perfect control\n\nover their lawyers.\n\n      Likewise, under Rule 11, the agency principle is put aside in order for\n\ncourts to direct sanctions toward lawyers—and not their clients—when clients are\n\nnot implicated in or aware of the offending attorney error, bad faith, or negligence\n\nthat fall within a lawyer’s professional zone of control. Under Rule 11,\n\n“[s]anctionable conduct by a party’s counsel does not necessarily parlay into\n\nsanctionable conduct by a party.” Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1123 (11th\n\nCir. 2001) (citation omitted).\n\n      And under Rule 37, a district court has broad discretion to apportion\n\nsanctions for discovery abuses between lawyers and their clients. Devany v.\n\nCont’l Am. Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir. 1993). For example, Rule 37\n\nis not construed to authorize the sanction of dismissal “because of petitioner’s\n\nnoncompliance with a pretrial production order when it has been established that\n\nfailure to comply has been due to inability, and not to willfulness, bad faith, or any\n\nfault of petitioner.” Societe Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et\n\nCommerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 212 (1958). This Court has held that\n\n                                          28\n\f“[a] party’s simple negligence or other action grounded in a misunderstanding of a\n\ncourt order does not warrant dismissal.” Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nComm’n, 693 F.2d 1353, 1357 (11th Cir. 1982). See also Malautea v. Suzuki\n\nMotor Co., Ltd., 987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th Cir. 1993) (stating that “[v]iolation of\n\na discovery order caused by simple negligence, misunderstanding, or inability to\n\ncomply will not justify a Rule 37 default judgment or dismissal.”).\n\n      Making death row inmates wholly responsible for a lawyer’s negligence\n\ndoes not ensure that lawyers will timely assert their clients’ claims. Death row\n\nclients have little ability to hold their lawyers accountable for their negligence.\n\nAnd a policy of punishing death row inmates for such mistakes does not improve\n\nthe timeliness of lawyers’ actions. While civil litigants can seek relief for a\n\nlawyer’s mistake through a malpractice lawsuit, there is no remedy for a death row\n\ninmate. When a lawyer’s negligence forecloses consideration of the entirety of the\n\ndeath row inmate’s federal claims, the result is the imposition of the death penalty\n\nwithout federal review.\n\n      These cases and examples illustrate that countervailing values forge\n\nexceptions in the law. The countervailing value here is the protection of the right\n\nto federal review of a death row inmate’s federal habeas petition, which is\n\npremised, in part, on “equitable principles [which] have traditionally governed the\n\n                                          29\n\fsubstantive law of habeas corpus.” Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2560 (quotation marks\n\nomitted) (holding that the one-year statutory filing deadline for federal habeas\n\npetitions is subject to equitable tolling). Thus, in Holland, which presented the\n\nsame question as is presented here, the Supreme Court framed the inquiry as one\n\nof how equity applies while still acknowledging the federal statutory filing\n\ndeadline. See id. at 2563. The Court noted that the countervailing value of\n\nfederalism weighs more heavily in the case of failing to comply with a state’s\n\nprocedural rules than it does for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing\n\ndeadline which is concerned only “with federal timing rules.” Id. With these\n\nconsiderations in mind, the Court rejected a per se approach to the previously\n\nunqualified rule that “a petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error” in the\n\ncontext of Holland’s case. Id.22\n\n       More recently in Maples, 132 S. Ct. at 924, the Court held that a lawyer’s\n\nconduct that constitutes abandonment of his death row inmate client will also\n\nprovide the necessary basis for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing\n\ndeadline. The Court reached this conclusion, in part, because even agency\n\n       22\n          The crucial importance of the broader availability of equitable tolling is highlighted by\nthe subsequent developments in Holland’s case. Upon eventual remand to the district court,\nwhich granted Holland equitable tolling and then considered the merits of the constitutional\nclaims raised in Holland’s federal habeas petition, the court granted him habeas relief on his\nFaretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975) claim. Holland v. Tucker, No. 06-civ-20182 (S.D. Fla.\nMarch 30, 2012) (order granting in part petition for habeas corpus).\n\n                                                30\n\fprinciples acknowledge an exception to the assumption that a client must bear the\n\nrisk of the acts or omissions of his lawyer in the case of abandonment. Id.\n\n      However, to grant equitable tolling only in cases of complete lawyer\n\nabandonment or something akin to gross negligence does not go far enough. See\n\nHolland, 130 S. Ct. at 2567 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (“Allowing\n\nequitable tolling in cases involving gross rather than ordinary attorney negligence\n\nwould not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also be\n\nimpractical in the extreme. . . . [I]t has been aptly said that gross negligence is\n\nordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet added.”). Where is the equity in\n\ndenying the same relief to one inmate just because the acts or omissions of his\n\nlawyer were slightly less egregious than another inmate’s lawyer? Instead, the\n\nreality is that death row inmates’ access to competent, post-conviction legal\n\nrepresentation is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent and their ability to\n\ncommunicate freely and actively participate in their litigation is seriously\n\ncompromised. Under this reality, I question whether strict adherence to the\n\nprinciple that a death row inmate must bear the consequences of his lawyer’s\n\nnegligence is fair or just.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f",

Hutchinson’s state collateral petition\n\nwas not filed until October 20, 2005, which was twenty days after the entire one-\n\nyear period for filing the federal petition had run on September 30, 2005, and as a\n\nresult none of the limitations period for filing his federal petition was left to be\n\ntolled. From that point on Hutchinson’s hopes for relief were riding all or nothing\n\non his state collateral petition, and the result came up nothing when the Florida\n\nSupreme Court affirmed the denial of collateral relief. See Hutchinson, 17 So. 3d\n\nat 702–04.\n\n      Hutchinson recognizes both that his federal habeas petition should have\n\n                                           3\n\fbeen filed by September 30, 2005, and that because his state collateral petition was\n\nnot filed until October 20, 2005, he cannot claim statutory tolling under §\n\n2244(d)(2) for any of the time that his state collateral proceeding was ongoing.\n\nHis sole contention is that he is entitled to equitable tolling. See generally\n\nHolland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148483\"><a href=\"/opinion/148483/holland-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Equitable tolling is, well, equitable in nature, and\n\ndecisions regarding it must be made “on a case-by-case basis” in light of “specific\n\ncircumstances, often hard to predict in advance,” although we “can and do draw\n\nupon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.” Id. at 2563 (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). We turn now to the specific facts and circumstances of this case\n\nas well as to the decisions in similar cases for guidance.\n\n      The parties agree that the problem in this case arose because the attorneys\n\nwho filed Hutchinson’s state collateral petition misunderstood the date on which\n\nthe limitations period began to run at the end of the direct appeal process and, as a\n\nresult, they miscalculated the filing deadline. Because no petition for writ of\n\ncertiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court as part of the direct appeal,\n\nthe time for filing the federal habeas petition started running upon “the expiration\n\nof the time for seeking such review.” 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A). Hutchinson’s\n\nattorneys understood that, but they misunderstood when the time for seeking\n\ncertiorari review of a state court’s judgment expired. They thought that the time\n\n                                          4\n\ffor doing so expired ninety days after the Florida Supreme Court issued its\n\nmandate on July 22, 2004. See App. A ¶ 2. Instead, the time actually expired\n\nninety days after the issuance of the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment (the\n\nopinion was the judgment), which had happened twenty-one days earlier on July 1,\n\n2004. See Sup. Ct. R. 13.3 (“The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs\n\nfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not\n\nfrom the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).”).\n\n       As a result of that misunderstanding, Hutchinson’s attorneys miscalculated\n\nthe deadline by which they were required to file either Hutchinson’s federal\n\nhabeas petition or file his state collateral petition in time to statutorily toll the\n\nfederal limitations period. They believed that they had until October 20, 2005,\n\ninstead of September 30, 2005, which was the actual deadline.1 Because they filed\n\nHutchinson’s state collateral petition on October 20, 2005, the § 2244(d)(2) tolling\n\nprovision did not kick in and when Hutchinson finally filed his federal habeas\n\npetition on July 24, 2009, it was three-and-three-quarters years too late.\n\n       A petitioner has the burden of establishing his right—if “right” is not too\n\n\n       1\n         By our calculations, the actual deadline should have been September 29, 2005, because\nthat is one year after September 29, 2004, the date on which the judgment of the state court\nbecame final under § 2244(d)(1)(A). For some reason, the district court said and the parties say\nthat the deadline was September 30, 2005. Because the difference makes no difference we will\nuse the September 30, 2005 date, too.\n\n                                                5\n\fstrong a word in the area of equity—to equitable tolling.

We take that statement to mean this is not an area free of rules of\n\nlaw, governed entirely by the chancellor’s foot, but we are instead bound by\n\nprecedent to the extent that there is precedent.2\n\n\n\n       2\n       And it is a good thing that rules of precedent apply here.

And law, without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more\n       desirable for the public good, than equity without law: which would make every judge a\n       legislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then be almost as many\n       different rules of action laid down in our courts, as there are differences of capacity and\n       sentiment in the human mind.\n\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *62; see also 1 Joseph Story, Commentaries on Equity\nJurisprudence § 19, at 16 (13th ed. 1886) (“If indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess\nthe unbounded jurisdiction which has been thus generally ascribed to it . . . it would be the most\ngigantic in its sway, and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary power, that could well be\ndevised.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f      Binding precedent has laid down two requirements that a federal habeas\n\npetitioner must meet before a court can grant him equitable tolling of the §\n\n2244(d) statute of limitations.

The Supreme Court has also instructed us that “a garden variety claim of\n\nexcusable neglect such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a\n\nfiling deadline does not warrant equitable tolling.” Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2564\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted); Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336–37, 127 S.Ct.\n\nat 1085 (“Attorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable\n\ntolling, particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no\n\nconstitutional right to counsel.”); see also Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1066.\n\n      This case involves, in Holland’s language, “a garden variety claim of\n\nexcusable neglect,” arising from “a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to\n\nmiss a filing deadline.” See Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2564 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe attorneys who filed the state collateral petition for Hutchinson misunderstood\n\nwhat § 2244(d)(1)(A)’s “expiration of the time for seeking such review” meant\n\n                                          7\n\fwhen read against Supreme Court Rule 13.3. The fact that they ought to have\n\nknown better does not justify equitable tolling.3 The attorneys who miscalculated\n\nthe deadline for filing in the Lawrence case did so because they were not aware of\n\nwell-settled law that should have prevented any confusion on their part. See\n\nLawrence, 549 U.S. at 336–37, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. Yet, the Supreme Court still\n\nheld that equitable tolling was not justified in that case because “[a]ttorney\n\nmiscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.” Id. at 336,\n\n127 S.Ct. at 1085. If attorney miscalculation, error, or negligence were enough for\n\nequitable tolling, the § 2244(d) statute of limitations would be tolled to the brink\n\nof extinction because in practically every case where there is a failure to meet the\n\nfiling deadline an attorney is at fault. See Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1071 (“In virtually\n\n\n\n       3\n         Any implicit criticism by us of Hutchinson’s attorneys for their mistake is tempered by\nawareness that a panel of this Court made exactly the same mistake a year-and-a-half before\nthose two attorneys did.

The\nopinion in that case shows, however, that June 19, 1997 was 90 days after the state appellate\ncourt’s mandate had issued and not 90 days after its opinion had issued, which was 16 days\nearlier. See id. We do not know if the Diaz opinion confused Hutchinson’s counsel or if they\nwere even aware of it. What we do know is that no one is perfect; we all make mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fevery case where the issue of equitable tolling comes up one or more attorneys\n\nshould have acted with more dispatch, but more than that is required.”).\n\n      Hutchinson argues that more is involved here than simple attorney error or\n\nmiscalculation. The “more” that he contends is involved is set out in the affidavit\n\nthat he filed in the district court in response to the motion to dismiss his federal\n\nhabeas petition as untimely. (That affidavit is reproduced in full as Appendix A to\n\nthis opinion.) In his affidavit, Hutchinson states that he repeatedly expressed to\n\nthe two attorneys who were representing him his concern about the statute of\n\nlimitations, and on September 22, 2005 he told them “point blank and in no\n\nuncertain terms to ‘either file my rule 3.851 motion immediately or I will\n\ndischarge you and file it myself.’” App. A ¶ 15. On that occasion, Hutchinson\n\nrecounts, both attorneys promised him that they “would file the motion on or\n\nbefore September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after\n\nthe mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851 motion\n\nwas not actually due until ‘October 20th.’” Id. According to Hutchinson, he again\n\ntold his two attorneys that if they did not file the Rule 3.851 motion “immediately”\n\nhe would file it himself because he knew that was “the only way [he] could\n\nprevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on [his] 2254 petition.” Id.\n\nThe attorneys “guaranteed” him that they would file the state court motion “no\n\n                                           9\n\flater than September 28, 2005.” Id. But they did not do that. Instead, they filed\n\nthe state court motion on October 20, 2005.4\n\n       Hutchinson alleges that but for his attorneys’ promise to file by September\n\n28, 2005 he “would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.851 motion to\n\nprevent 28 U.S.C. § 2255(d)(1)’s [sic] one-year limitations period from expiring.”\n\nApp. A ¶ 16. He attached to his affidavit “facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se\n\nStatus and Rule 3.851 Motion that [he] would have filed on September 23, 2005,\n\nbut for [the attorneys’] promise.” Id. Those two facsimiles are each dated\n\nSeptember 23, 2005 and signed by Hutchinson, indicating that he was ready,\n\nwilling, and able to file his motion to proceed pro se and his Rule 3.851 motion\n\non or soon after that date and would have done so but for his attorneys’ promises,\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          In his affidavit Hutchinson states that before the statute of limitations ran he met with\nattorney Brody three times, App. A ¶¶ 7, 10, 12, with attorney Hazen four times, id. ¶¶ 6, 8, 11,\n13, and with both of them on two other occasions, id. ¶¶ 14, 15. He states that during one of his\nmeetings with Brody alone, more than five months before the limitations period ran, Brody was\n“visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol,” id. ¶ 12, and during another meeting two-\nand-a-half months before the limitations period ran Brody was “sweating profusely and smelled\nof alcohol,” id. ¶ 14. Hutchinson also says that on that later occasion Hazen told him that Brody\nwas “just having a lot of personal problems.” Id. But there is no allegation that Brody’s\nimpairment, if any, caused the error in miscalculating the due date. See Chavez, 647 F.3d at\n1071 (holding that equitable tolling was not appropriate where “[t]here are . . . no allegations at\nall that [state post-conviction counsel’s] health had affected his ability to handle the case up to\nthe time he withdrew or that it had prevented him from filing the motion for state post-conviction\nrelief sooner”). Nor has Hutchinson alleged that attorney Hazen, who actually signed and filed\nthe Rule 3.851 motion in state court on October 20, 2005, was ever impaired in any way.\n\n                                                10\n\fwhich were not kept.5\n\n       Hutchinson knew, at least by October 19, 2005, that his attorneys had not\n\nfiled his state Rule 3.851 motion by the September 30, 2005 deadline (or the\n\nSeptember 28, 2005 deadline, as he had calculated it). We know that Hutchinson\n\nknew that because October 19, 2005 is the date Hutchinson signed, under penalty\n\nof perjury, the verification on the Rule 3.851 motion (which one of the attorneys\n\nfiled in state court the next day).6 Just twenty-seven days earlier he had told his\n\ntwo attorneys that filing the Rule 3.851 motion in state court by September 28,\n\n2005 was necessary to prevent the federal filing deadline from expiring. See App.\n\n\n\n       5\n         Hutchinson’s affidavit also states that on three occasions, the last of which was July 14,\n2005, he asked his attorneys to file a “shell-brief” in state court in order to prevent the time from\nrunning while they investigated his case and prepared the real motion for state collateral relief.\nApp. A ¶¶ 11, 13, 14. But attorney Hazen told him then that a state court “shell brief didn’t\nprovide the protection that it used to.” Id. ¶ 11. It appears that Hazen was correct about that.\nThe respondent’s brief in this case informs us that in 2001 Florida’s Rule 3.851 was amended to\nprohibit the filing of shell motions, see Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(e)(1)(D); Gonzalez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1705778\"><a href=\"/opinion/1705778/gonzalez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1034 & n.9 (Fla. 2008), and that shell motions are stricken by the Florida courts and\nno longer can be used to meet filing deadlines. In his reply brief, Hutchinson does not take issue\nwith any of that information.\n       6\n         Although Hutchinson’s affidavit and the date of his signature on the federal habeas\npetition establish beyond dispute that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his\nstate petition, our separately writing colleague asserts that Hutchinson had no reason to file his\nfederal habeas petition until nearly four years later because he relied on his attorneys’ assurances\nthat they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights. See Concurring Op.\nat 25–26. That assertion is belied by Hutchinson’s own sworn statements, which establish that\nhe knew his attorneys had missed the deadline, yet for years after realizing that he still made no\nattempt to file in federal court the collateral petition he had already drafted. However judges may\nfeel about the law applicable to this or any other area, we have no license to rewrite the facts of a\ncase.\n\n                                                 11\n\fA ¶ 15. And Hutchinson had already drafted, dated, and had ready to file a\n\ncomplete petition setting out all of the claims that he wanted to raise. Id. ¶¶\n\n15–16. By simply changing the name of the court in which that petition was to be\n\nfiled, Hutchinson himself could have filed his federal habeas petition on or soon\n\nafter October 20, 2005, which would have been just twenty days after the\n\nexpiration of the one-year limitations period.7\n\n       Yet Hutchinson did nothing of the sort for nearly four years. He did not file\n\nhis pro se habeas petition in federal court until July 24, 2009, which was long after\n\nthe state trial court had denied his Rule 3.851 motion on January 3, 2008, and was\n\nalso after the Florida Supreme Court had affirmed that denial on July 9, 2009.\n\n\n       7\n          Had Hutchinson done so, the federal district court could have held his federal habeas\npetition in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. See Rhines\nv. Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278–79, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Our colleague’s suggestion that a\ndistrict court might dismiss such a petition without abusing its discretion is contradicted by the\nonly authority she cites for that proposition, which is the Rhines decision. See Concurring Op. at\n26 n.21. The Supreme Court stated in Rhines that:\n\n       [I]t likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to\n       dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust,\n       his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that\n       the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such\n       circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed\n       petition. See Lundy, 455 U.S., at 522, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In such a case, the petitioner’s interest in obtaining federal review of his\n       claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of\n       federal petitions.\n\nRhines, 544 U.S. at 278, 125 S.Ct. at 1535.\n\n                                                12\n\fMore to the point, Hutchinson waited to file his federal petition for three years,\n\nnine months and five days—a total of 1,374 days—after he learned on October 19,\n\n2005 that his attorneys had missed the deadline for a filing in state court that\n\nwould have tolled the federal limitations period. There is nothing in Hutchinson’s\n\naffidavit or in his briefs to explain his delay of nearly four years. Nothing.\n\n      We need not decide whether Hutchinson has established that an\n\nextraordinary circumstance stood in the way of his meeting the § 2244(d) filing\n\ndeadline, because he has not carried his burden of showing that he pursued his\n\nrights diligently. See Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2562; Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336, 127\n\nS.Ct. at 1085; see also Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1066, 1068. Although Hutchinson’s\n\naffidavit may show that he diligently attempted to have his state collateral motion\n\nfiled in time to give him the benefit of § 2244(d) statutory tolling, it does not show\n\nthat once that opportunity was missed he pursued his federal rights diligently.\n\nInstead, his affidavit and the other materials he has submitted show that he had in\n\nhand a petition that he could have re-labeled and filed pro se in federal court\n\nwithin three weeks after the one-year limitations period ran, but he waited three-\n\nand-three-quarter years before he filed a pro se federal habeas petition. That is not\n\nreasonable diligence.\n\n      Hutchinson’s lengthy delay in filing his pro se federal habeas petition stands\n\n                                          13\n\fin stark contrast to the petitioner’s diligence in the Holland case. The Supreme\n\nCourt stressed that “the very day that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock\n\nhad expired due to [his attorney’s] failings, Holland prepared his own habeas\n\npetition pro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.” Holland, 130 S.Ct. at\n\n2565 (emphasis in original). Holland’s filing of his federal habeas petition the day\n\nafter he learned that “his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney’s]\n\nfailings” may be “maximum feasible diligence,” id., which is not required.\n\nBut Hutchinson’s failure to do anything to get his federal habeas petition filed for\n\nnearly four years after he learned that the AEDPA clock had run out due to his\n\nattorneys’ miscalculation is not even “reasonable diligence,” which is required, id.\n\n      The district court did not err in concluding that Hutchinson was not entitled\n\nto equitable tolling of 1,393 days.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the result only:\n\n       Initially, I disagree with the majority’s holding that Hutchinson was not\n\nreasonably diligent in pursuing his claims. He did everything any reasonable\n\nclient would do to assure that his lawyers protected his interests, including\n\nimploring his lawyers to file his post-conviction pleadings in a timely manner.\n\nThe majority’s suggestion that Hutchinson should have filed a placeholder pro se\n\nhabeas petition is simply not logical when Hutchinson was represented by lawyers\n\nwho were assuring him that his claims were being pursued.\n\n       However, no matter how diligent Hutchinson was or could have been, as the\n\nlaw stands today, this Court still could not grant Hutchinson the relief of equitable\n\ntolling because the Supreme Court has held that, notwithstanding his diligence, a\n\ndefendant is responsible for and must bear the consequences of his lawyer’s\n\nnegligence.1 See Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336–37; Coleman v.

Mechem Treatise on the Law of Agency § 80 (2d ed. 1914) (“It is the\ngeneral rule that an agency may be created for the performance of any lawful act, and that\nwhatever a person may lawfully do, if acting in his own right and in his own behalf, he may\nlawfully delegate to an agent.”).\n\n                                                 16\n\fspecific purpose,4 and in a traditional lawyer-client relationship, a client hires a\n\nlawyer to represent him in a discrete legal matter. The legitimacy of transferring\n\nresponsibility for the lawyer’s negligence from the lawyer to the client is based on\n\nseveral assumptions that underpin the agency relationship. First, it is assumed that\n\nthe client voluntarily chooses his lawyer for competence, diligence, and loyalty.5\n\nSecond, it is assumed that the client has the ability to direct the actions of the\n\nlawyer6 or, at the very least, that constant and adequate opportunities exist for\n\ncommunication between the client and his lawyer.7\n\n       But these assumptions do not apply to inmates on death row, almost all of\n\nwhom do not choose their lawyers. Instead they must depend on appointed or pro\n\nbono volunteer counsel who too often lack expertise in post-conviction death\n\npenalty representation. See, e.g., Maples, 132 S. Ct. at 918.

Id.\n\n       The agency analogy also breaks down because death row inmates have a\n\nlimited ability to communicate with their lawyers.11 Prisons are often located in\n\nfar-flung places that are difficult for lawyers to reach and often the lawyers are not\n\neven located within the same state as their death row clients.

McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855.\n\n       The circumstances surrounding Hutchinson’s lawyers’ negligent filing of\n\nhis state post-conviction motion in this case illustrate the difficulties faced by a\n\ndeath row inmate who attempts to work diligently with his lawyers. While on\n\ndeath row, Hutchinson maintained communication—to the best of his\n\nability—with his lawyers and repeatedly asked them to timely file his state post-\n\nconviction motion so as to toll the filing deadline for his federal habeas petition.20\n\nEven the majority recognizes that Hutchinson was reasonably diligent up to the\n\ntime that his lawyers filed his motion for state post-conviction relief. What other\n\nsteps could Hutchinson reasonably have taken? Should he not have trusted his\n\nlawyers when they assured him they were aware of and would comply with all\n\nfiling deadlines? There is certainly no expectation that a civil client will shadow\n\nhis lawyer’s every move to ensure that all deadlines are met and all filings are in\n\norder. On the contrary, a represented client has every right to assume that his\n\nlawyer will competently discharge his duties.\n\n       Nonetheless, the majority concludes that Hutchinson was not reasonably\n\n       20\n           The fact that Hutchinson signed the Rule 3.851 motion on October 19, 2005 does not\nestablish beyond dispute that he knew that his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his\nstate petition. Although Hutchinson kept asking his lawyers to file his state petition, there is\nnothing to indicate that he knew the precise deadline. It is equally consistent with the facts to\nbelieve that he simply wanted his state petition filed and later accepted his attorneys’ advice that\nthe deadline was October 20, 2005.\n\n                                                 25\n\fdiligent because he should have filed a pro se federal habeas petition and asked to\n\nhave it held in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were\n\ncompleted. This course of action surely cannot be required of a client when he has\n\nlegal representation.21 A reasonable prisoner would have no cause to file\n\nhis own pleadings for the simple reason that it is assumed that it is his lawyer’s job\n\nto do so. Especially here, where Hutchinson’s lawyers repeatedly assured him that\n\nthey would file on time, Hutchinson had no reason to pursue an alternative avenue\n\nof relief. Reasonably relying on his lawyers’ assurances that they were doing what\n\nwas necessary to protect his federal habeas rights, Hutchinson did not file a pro se\n\nfederal habeas petition until it was too late.\n\n       21\n           Indeed, there is no guarantee that such a placeholder petition would be accepted by the\nfederal district court. See Rhines v. Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 277 (2005) (“[S]tay and abeyance\nshould be available only in limited circumstances . . . and is only appropriate when the district\ncourt determines there was good cause for the petitioner’s failure to present his claims first to the\nstate courts.”). In a concurring opinion with the judgment in Rhines, Justice Stevens, with whom\nJustices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, observed that conditioning the stay-and-abeyance procedure\non “good cause” instead of simply on a lack of “intentionally dilatory litigation tactics” left open\nthe door for “[t]he trickiness of some exhaustion requirements to infect issues of good cause . . .\n.” Id. at 279. Moreover, Rhines concerned an issue distinct from the case at hand in which some\nhabeas corpus claims had been exhausted in state court and others had not. The stay-and-\nabeyance procedure was endorsed in limited circumstances in order to preserve the petitioner’s\ninterest in obtaining review of his claims. Id. at 278. In contrast, the good cause inquiry in this\ncase would have involved issues of attorney negligence. In addition, Hutchinson’s ability to\nattempt to prevail upon the stay-and-abeyance procedure turned on both his access to information\nabout the procedure, and a presumption that he did not believe his attorneys’ advice that the\nfiling deadline for his application for state post-conviction relief in order to preserve his federal\nhabeas corpus right was on October 20, 2005. Under these circumstances, it is far from certain\nthat Hutchinson would have been granted stay-and-abeyance by a district court applying the good\ncause standard and unlikely that a panel of this Court would have reversed a district court denial\nthereof on an abuse of discretion review.\n\n                                                 26\n\f           II.

Death row\n\nclients have little ability to hold their lawyers accountable for their negligence.\n\nAnd a policy of punishing death row inmates for such mistakes does not improve\n\nthe timeliness of lawyers’ actions. While civil litigants can seek relief for a\n\nlawyer’s mistake through a malpractice lawsuit, there is no remedy for a death row\n\ninmate. When a lawyer’s negligence forecloses consideration of the entirety of the\n\ndeath row inmate’s federal claims, the result is the imposition of the death penalty\n\nwithout federal review.\n\n      These cases and examples illustrate that countervailing values forge\n\nexceptions in the law. The countervailing value here is the protection of the right\n\nto federal review of a death row inmate’s federal habeas petition, which is\n\npremised, in part, on “equitable principles [which] have traditionally governed the\n\n                                          29\n\fsubstantive law of habeas corpus.” Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2560 (quotation marks\n\nomitted) (holding that the one-year statutory filing deadline for federal habeas\n\npetitions is subject to equitable tolling). Thus, in Holland, which presented the\n\nsame question as is presented here, the Supreme Court framed the inquiry as one\n\nof how equity applies while still acknowledging the federal statutory filing\n\ndeadline. See id. at 2563. The Court noted that the countervailing value of\n\nfederalism weighs more heavily in the case of failing to comply with a state’s\n\nprocedural rules than it does for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing\n\ndeadline which is concerned only “with federal timing rules.” Id. With these\n\nconsiderations in mind, the Court rejected a per se approach to the previously\n\nunqualified rule that “a petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error” in the\n\ncontext of Holland’s case. Id.22\n\n       More recently in Maples, 132 S. Ct. at 924, the Court held that a lawyer’s\n\nconduct that constitutes abandonment of his death row inmate client will also\n\nprovide the necessary basis for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing\n\ndeadline. The Court reached this conclusion, in part, because even agency\n\n       22\n          The crucial importance of the broader availability of equitable tolling is highlighted by\nthe subsequent developments in Holland’s case. Upon eventual remand to the district court,\nwhich granted Holland equitable tolling and then considered the merits of the constitutional\nclaims raised in Holland’s federal habeas petition, the court granted him habeas relief on his\nFaretta v.

Holland v. Tucker, No. 06-civ-20182 (S.D. Fla.\nMarch 30, 2012) (order granting in part petition for habeas corpus).\n\n                                                30\n\fprinciples acknowledge an exception to the assumption that a client must bear the\n\nrisk of the acts or omissions of his lawyer in the case of abandonment. Id.\n\n      However, to grant equitable tolling only in cases of complete lawyer\n\nabandonment or something akin to gross negligence does not go far enough. See\n\nHolland, 130 S. Ct. at 2567 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (“Allowing\n\nequitable tolling in cases involving gross rather than ordinary attorney negligence\n\nwould not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also be\n\nimpractical in the extreme. . . . [I]t has been aptly said that gross negligence is\n\nordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet added.”). Where is the equity in\n\ndenying the same relief to one inmate just because the acts or omissions of his\n\nlawyer were slightly less egregious than another inmate’s lawyer? Instead, the\n\nreality is that death row inmates’ access to competent, post-conviction legal\n\nrepresentation is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent and their ability to\n\ncommunicate freely and actively participate in their litigation is seriously\n\ncompromised. Under this reality, I question whether strict adherence to the\n\nprinciple that a death row inmate must bear the consequences of his lawyer’s\n\nnegligence is fair or just.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f</pre>",
