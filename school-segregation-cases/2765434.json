Osborne and Baylor University bring this action seeking a writ of\r\nmandamus against Respondent, the Honorable Joe N. Johnson, Judge of the 170th Judicial District\r\nCourt of McLennan County.  This action stems from a discovery request served upon Osborne by\r\nreal parties in interest John and Naomi Fox.  Osborne and Baylor filed written objections to the\r\nrequest asserting among other things that some of the documents sought are protected by the\r\nattorney-client privilege.  After conducting a hearing and an in camera review of the documents\r\nalleged to be privileged, Respondent ordered Osborne and Baylor to produce the documents for\r\ndiscovery.  Osborne and Baylor bring this original proceeding seeking mandamus relief from\r\nRespondent’s order.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>John Fox was a professor of anthropology at Baylor.  Each summer Fox directed a group of\r\nBaylor students and other participants at a field school in Guatemala.  After the 1996 field school,\r\nseveral students registered complaints against Fox with Baylor officials concerning incidents which\r\noccurred at the field school.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Judy Parker was the primary complainant.  Parker alleged among other things that Fox\r\nengaged in inappropriate behavior and made inappropriate remarks which carried sexual overtones\r\nduring the field school.  The Foxes filed suit against Parker for libel, slander, tortious interference\r\nwith John Fox’s employment contract, and loss of consortium.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A number of Baylor administrators and other Baylor employees conducted an investigation\r\nof the allegations made by Parker and the others.  The investigators included, among others,\r\nBaylor Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs Donald Schmeltekopf, Dean of the\r\nCollege of Arts and Sciences Wallace Daniel, Osborne, who serves as the chair of Fox’s\r\ndepartment, General Counsel Basil Thomson, and Assistant General Counsel Charles\r\nBeckenhauer.  Each of the investigators participated to varying degrees in the investigation. \r\nApparently not every member of the investigative group was present at each witness interview or\r\nduring each discussion of the allegations.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Foxes served Osborne with a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to appear for a\r\ndeposition and also requiring him to produce among other items:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>●All notes, memorandae [sic], and minutes of meetings of committee investigating Dr.\r\nJohn Fox, together with notes and reports by the committee containing\r\nrecommendations, to include all draft copies of such notes and reports;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>●<span>    </span>All notes, minutes or documentation of committee meetings relative to the\r\ninvestigation of Dr. John Fox; and</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>●<span>    </span>Copies of all committee reports on file relating to the investigation of Dr. John\r\nFox, to include copies of all letters, notes and minutes of meetings with and\r\nfrom Baylor personnel in connection with the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Osborne and Baylor filed written objections to the subpoena asserting among other things that\r\nthe documents sought are privileged from discovery by the attorney-client privilege.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nR. Civ. Evid. </span>503.  Although Baylor itself was not subpoenaed, it objected on the basis that\r\nOsborne engaged in these activities as a representative of the university and in consultation with\r\ncounsel for the university.  <i>Id.</i> 503(a)(2).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The parties appeared before Respondent for a hearing on the objections.  Osborne and Baylor\r\npresented the testimony of Beckenhauer, who testified in pertinent part that during the\r\ninvestigation Osborne acted as a representative of Baylor and sought legal advice from\r\nBeckenhauer and other Baylor counsel in connection with the investigation.  They also tendered\r\nan affidavit signed by Osborne together with the documents (under seal) which they seek to shield\r\nfrom discovery.  After considering the testimony, the affidavit, the argument of counsel, and the\r\ndocuments themselves, Respondent overruled Osborne’s and Baylor’s objections and ordered them\r\nto produce the documents.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>II. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In order to establish their entitlement to mandamus relief, Osborne and Baylor must establish\r\nthat the court committed a clear abuse of discretion and that they have no adequate legal remedy. \r\n<i>Walker v. Packer</i>, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding).   When a trial court\r\nerroneously orders the production of documents protected by the attorney-client privilege, the\r\naggrieved party has no adequate remedy at law.  <i>Marathon Oil Co. v. Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d 585, 589\r\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, orig. proceeding); <i>see also West v. Solito</i>, 563 S.W.2d 240, 244 (Tex.\r\n1978) (orig. proceeding).  Thus, the central issue we must determine in this proceeding is whether\r\nRespondent clearly abused his discretion in ordering disclosure of the documents in question.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>When the court’s interpretation of a privilege against discovery is at issue, we review the\r\ncourt’s decision as a legal conclusion.  <i>Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 589; <i>Keene Corp. v. Caldwell</i>, 840\r\nS.W.2d 715, 718 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding).  We give limited\r\ndeference to such a conclusion.  <i>Walker</i>, 827 S.W.2d at 840.  “The trial court has no discretion\r\nto determine the law or to apply the law to the facts incorrectly.  A clear failure by the trial court\r\nto analyze or apply the law correctly is an abuse of discretion.”  <i>Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 589\r\n(citations omitted); <i>accord Caldwell</i>, 840 S.W.2d at 718.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>However, if the evidence presented suggests the privilege may not apply because the\r\ncommunication was not intended to be confidential or because the privilege was waived, a fact\r\nissue exists for the trial court to resolve.  <i>Cameron County v. Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d 742, 745\r\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1988, orig. proceeding).  If the parties present conflicting evidence\r\non the applicability of the privilege, the trial court’s decision “must be deemed conclusive.”  <i>Id.</i>;\r\n<i>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Fuller</i>, 695 S.W.2d 769, 773 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1985, orig. proceeding); <i>see\r\nalso West</i>, 563 S.W.2d at 245.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>III. THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Rule 503 of the Rules of Civil Evidence protects from discovery confidential communications\r\nbetween an attorney or the attorney’s representative and a client or the client’s representative\r\nwhich are “made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the\r\nclient   .   .   .   .”  <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.</span> 503(b).  In this case, we must determine whether the\r\ndocuments which Osborne and Baylor claim to be privileged by this rule constitute\r\ncommunications between “representatives” of Baylor and Baylor’s counsel and whether the\r\ncommunications were “confidential.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>A. <span>The Control Group Test</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>By the promulgation of Rule 503(a)(2), Texas adopted the control group test for determining\r\nwhether an individual qualifies as the representative of a corporation or other entity which has\r\nretained counsel.  <i>See National Tank Co. v. Brotherton</i>, 851 S.W.2d 193, 198 (Tex. 1993) (orig.\r\nproceeding).  This test finds its origin in <i>City of Philadelphia v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.</i>  210\r\nF. Supp. 483 (E.D. Penn. 1962).  In <i>Westinghouse</i>, the court held that a person qualifies as a\r\nrepresentative of a corporation for purposes of the attorney-client privilege if the person is “in a\r\nposition to control or even to take a substantial part in a decision about any action which the\r\ncorporation may take upon the advice of the attorney   .   .   .   .”  <i>Id.</i>, 210 F. Supp. at 485\r\n(quoted by <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Thus, the Court determined in <i>National Tank</i> that a person qualifies as a representative of a\r\ncorporation or other entity for purposes of Rule 503 if the person “is one having authority to\r\nobtain professional legal services, or to act on advice rendered pursuant thereto, on behalf of the\r\nclient.”  <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197 (quoting <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.</span> 503(a)(2)).  However,\r\nthe Court may have caused some confusion later in its opinion when it stated, “[U]nder Rule\r\n503(a)(2), the qualifying employees must be those actually having authority to hire counsel <i>and</i>\r\nto act on counsel’s advice   .   .   .   .”  <i>Id.</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 199 (emphasis added).  This statement\r\nappears to conflict with the plain language of the rule which states the test disjunctively.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We believe this isolated sentence was an inadvertent statement by the Court.  In the next\r\nparagraph, the Court observed that National Tank offered no evidence to prove that a particular\r\nmanager’s position in the corporation “vested [him] with authority to obtain professional legal\r\nservices, <i>or</i> to act on advice rendered pursuant thereto, on behalf of [National Tank].”  <i>Id.</i>, 851\r\nS.W.2d at 200 (emphasis added).  Thus, we conclude that in order to qualify as a representative\r\nof an entity under Rule 503, a person must be shown to either have the authority to obtain\r\nprofessional legal services on behalf of the organization <i>or</i> to act on advice rendered pursuant to\r\na request made under such authority.  Later opinions confirm this conclusion.  <i>See Ford Motor\r\nCo. v. Leggat</i>, 904 S.W.2d 643, 646 (Tex. 1995) (orig. proceeding); <i>El Centrio del Barrio, Inc.\r\nv. Barlow</i>, 894 S.W.2d 775, 778 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1994, orig. proceeding); <i>accord</i> 1\r\n<span>Steven Goode et al., Texas Practice: Guide to the Texas Rules of Evidence: Civil and\r\nCriminal</span> § 503.3, at 339 n.51 (2d ed. 1993); <i>but see Pittsburgh Corning Corp. v. Caldwell</i>, 861\r\nS.W.2d 423, 425 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, orig. proceeding) (citing control group\r\ntest conjunctively).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>An entity can “fairly easily” establish whether an employee qualifies as a representative by\r\naffidavit.  <i>See Cigna Corp. v. Spears</i>, 838 S.W.2d 561, 566 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1992, orig.\r\nproceeding).  “Generally, only someone relatively high on the corporate ladder will qualify.” \r\n<span>Goode</span> § 503.3, at 335-36.  “Communications with underlings who may make internal\r\nrecommendations to their superiors but who are not themselves authorized to make the final\r\ndecision will remain unprivileged.”  <i>Id.</i> at 341.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>B. <span>Confidentiality</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The attorney-client privilege only protects confidential communications.  <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.\r\n</span>503(b).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>A communication is “confidential” if not intended to be disclosed to third persons\r\nother than those to whom disclosure is made in furtherance of the rendition of\r\nprofessional legal services to the client or those reasonably necessary for the transmission\r\nof the communication.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Id.</i> 503(a)(5).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>  The issue of confidentiality focuses on the intent of the parties at the time the communications\r\nare made.  <span>Goode</span> § 503.5, at 347.  Communications made in the presence of others who do not\r\nqualify as representatives of the client or the lawyer are not considered confidential.  <i>Id.</i> at 348\r\nn.13 (citing <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid</span>. 503(b)); <i>see also Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d. at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>C. The Burden of Proof</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>An organization seeking protection from discovery of documents which it contends are\r\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege bears the burden to produce evidence by affidavit or\r\ntestimony demonstrating the applicability of the privilege.  <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166b(4); <i>Giffin v.\r\nSmith</i>, 688 S.W.2d 112, 114 (Tex. 1985) (orig. proceeding).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Once a prima facie showing of privilege is made, the party seeking discovery must tender\r\nevidence to refute the asserted privilege.  <i>See Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 591.  If the party introduces\r\nevidence which counters the claim of privilege, the trial court must conduct an in camera review\r\nof the documents to determine whether the asserted privilege applies.  <i>Id</i>. at 590.  Often the\r\ndocuments themselves will be the only evidence which substantiates (or refutes) the claimed\r\nprivilege.  <i>See Weisel Enter., Inc. v. Curry</i>, 718 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding);\r\n<i>Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 590.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>If in camera review is required, the party in possession of the documents must tender them\r\nto the court.  <i>Id.</i>  In doing so, the party must demonstrate the applicability of the privilege to the\r\ndocuments in question.  <i>See Giffin</i>, 688 S.W.2d at 114.  The documents must be segregated from\r\nother discoverable items.  <i>See Peeples v. Fourth Court of Appeals</i>, 701 S.W.2d 635, 637 (Tex.\r\n1985) (orig. proceeding).  We believe the better practice is that employed by Marathon Oil in\r\n<i>Moyé</i> where the company submitted a detailed log which identified each document and the\r\nprivileges asserted thereto.  <i>See Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 591.  Each document was separately\r\nnumbered and identified in the log.  <i>Id.</i> at 591, 593 nn.1-2.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>“As a reviewing court, we may conduct our own in camera inspection to determine whether\r\na trial court properly applied the law of privilege to the documents.”  <i>Id.</i> at 593 (citing <i>Barnes v.\r\nWhittington</i>, 751 S.W.2d 493, 495 (Tex. 1988) (orig. proceeding)).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>IV. THE EVIDENCE</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>A. The Tender of Osborne’s Affidavit</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>As a preliminary matter, the Foxes argue that Osborne and Baylor failed to introduce\r\nOsborne’s affidavit in evidence, and thus, it may not be considered by this Court.  Rule 166b(4)\r\nrequires that the affidavit be served on opposing counsel at least seven days before the hearing in\r\norder to be admitted as evidence.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166b(4).  At the beginning of the hearing,\r\ncounsel informed the court that it would tender Osborne’s affidavit with the documents in question\r\nfor the court’s in camera consideration.  Counsel stated, “I do not tender either the affidavit or the\r\nattached documents in evidence, Your Honor, at least for general use, but I would submit them\r\nto the Court for the Court’s consideration only and for in camera inspection of the enclosed\r\ndocuments for which we seek protection.”  At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel tendered the\r\naffidavit with the documents stating, “You don’t have to take [the affidavit], Judge, but I’m\r\ntendering it.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Foxes did not object to the tender of Osborne’s affidavit.  In fact, they attempted to\r\ntender his deposition testimony in the same manner.  Their counsel stated, “I will provide the\r\nJudge with an unsigned copy of [Osborne’s] deposition for his consideration   .   .   .   .”</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>    The\r\ncourt stated in its order that it “considered [among other things] the affidavit and deposition\r\ntestimony of Harold W. Osborne  .   .   .   .”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A similar tender has been approved by the Fourteenth Court of Appeals.  <i>GAF Corp. v.\r\nCaldwell</i>, 839 S.W.2d 149, 150-51 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding). \r\nIn <i>GAF</i>, the party resisting the discovery of certain documents tendered the documents in issue to\r\nthe court for in camera review with two affidavits attached.  <i>Id.</i> at 150.  The court concluded that\r\nthe affidavits constituted prima facie evidence that the documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege.  <i>Id. </i>at 151.  Apparently the trial court did not hold a formal hearing on the matter\r\nbut rather ordered the documents to be delivered for in camera review upon the filing of the\r\nobjections to the discovery request.  <i>Id.</i> at 149-50.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Although it is true that the party seeking discovery in <i>GAF</i> apparently did not contest the\r\npropriety of the manner in which the affidavits were submitted, the court stated unequivocally that\r\nthe affidavits “presented sufficient evidence to support [the claimed privilege]   .   .   .   .”  <i>Id.</i>\r\nat 151; <i>accord Shell Western E &amp; P, Inc. v. Oliver</i>, 751 S.W.2d 195, 196 (Tex. App.—Dallas\r\n1988, orig. proceeding) (By attaching affidavits to motion for protective order, “Shell   .   .   .  \r\nproduced evidence that the attorney-client privilege that it had asserted applied.”).  The Dallas\r\ncourt also stated, “An affidavit suffices to produce evidence concerning the applicability of a\r\ncertain privilege.”  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>One decision by our Supreme Court appears to contradict these cases.  In <i>Barnes</i>, the party\r\nobjecting to discovery submitted affidavits inside sealed envelopes which also contained the\r\ndocuments the party sought to protect.  <i>Barnes</i>, 751 S.W.2d at 495.  The Court stated, “These\r\naffidavits should not have been considered by the trial judge as evidence in support of the privilege\r\nbecause they were never filed with the district clerk; they contain no certificate of service; and,\r\nthey were not served on opposing counsel.”  <i>Id.</i>  The Court observed in a footnote, “Because [the\r\nparty] failed to properly serve the affidavits, the sworn statements constitute improper <i>ex parte</i>\r\ncommunications.”  <i>Id.</i>  n.1.  We consider <i>Barnes</i> distinguishable because Osborne served the\r\nFoxes with a copy of his affidavit in compliance with rule 166b(4).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>From these cases we conclude that in a hearing in which a party seeks protection from a\r\ndiscovery order, the party can satisfy the evidentiary requirements of rule 166b(4) by tendering\r\nan affidavit to the court without formally offering it in evidence, if the affidavit has been timely\r\nserved on opposing counsel in accordance with the rule.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Thus, we will consider Osborne’s\r\naffidavit in deciding the merits of this case.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>B. The Testimony</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In addition to the affidavit and the documents in issue, Osborne and Baylor presented the\r\ntestimony of Assistant General Counsel Beckenhauer.  Beckenhauer testified that he participated\r\nin the investigation of the complaints against Fox.  He explained that three Baylor administrators\r\nparticipated in a supervisory capacity: Schmeltekopf, Daniel, and Osborne, and he described the\r\nrespective positions of these officials in the chain of command.  Fox reported to Osborne; Osborne\r\nreported to Daniel; and Daniel reported to Schmeltekopf.  According to Beckenhauer, Osborne,\r\nDaniel, and Schmeltekopf each had “an inherent authority to deal with the potential disciplinary\r\nmatter.”  He explained that each could take some disciplinary action on his own other than\r\ntermination.  Although none possessed the authority to terminate Fox, any of the three could\r\n“initiate the dismissal process.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer testified that Osborne, Daniel, and Schmeltekopf each had the authority to seek\r\nout legal counsel in the matter involving Fox and to act on the advice of counsel in the matter. \r\nHe explained that the three of them prepared various drafts of summaries of the investigation; that\r\nhe guided them in the preparation of the drafts; that he gave them legal advice in connection with\r\nthe preparation of the drafts; and that in doing so, he was acting as counsel for Baylor and for\r\nBaylor’s representatives involved in the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>According to Beckenhauer, the investigators had to sift through many facts and make\r\nappropriate disciplinary recommendations.  Again he advised and counseled Osborne, Daniel, and\r\nSchmeltekopf at their request in connection with the compilation of drafts and summaries of\r\nfindings, proposals and recommendations in connection with the investigation.  Beckenhauer\r\ntestified that the documents tendered under seal include and reflect his advice and counsel and\r\nconsist of communications between the Baylor General Counsel’s office and the investigators and\r\nbetween the investigators themselves.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer concluded by asserting the attorney-client privilege on behalf of Baylor and by\r\ntestifying that he considers the documents confidential and that the documents were not intended\r\nto be disclosed to anyone lacking decision-making authority.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>On cross-examination, Beckenhauer explained that he acted as both investigator and counsel\r\nin the course of the investigation.  He testified that the investigators interviewed students and took\r\nwritten statements from them.  General Counsel Thomson and he advised and counseled the\r\ninvestigators on the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence and in making the\r\n“administrative decision” with respect to appropriate sanctions.  He did not recall that any of the\r\ndocuments tendered under seal contained any notes explicitly referencing his legal advice, but he\r\ndoes believe that the documents contain “[c]onceptual ideas [attributable to him] in terms of fact-finding and discipline and what the appropriate response may or may not be.”  He believed that\r\na part of his role as counsel in this matter included helping the investigators to evaluate whether\r\ntheir fact findings were reasonable.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer agreed that ultimate decision making authority in the Baylor hierarchy rests with\r\nthe university’s president.  After January 1997, Beckenhauer was no longer “intimately involved”\r\nwith the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Counsel for the Foxes read selected portions of Osborne’s deposition testimony into the\r\nrecord.  In the deposition, Osborne testified that the extent of his decision making authority was\r\nto confer with Daniel.  He identified Baylor Dean for Student Life Martha Lou Scott as another\r\nparticipant in the investigation.  He stated that he never received a copy of Parker’s written\r\ncomplaint or any other written complaint.  Osborne testified that Baylor Senior Counsel Bill\r\nUnderwood and Becky Singer interviewed him.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>C. <span>The Content of Osborne’s Affidavit</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Osborne explains in his affidavit that Schmeltekopf, Daniel, and he each have decision-making\r\nauthority for Baylor “including but not limited to the authority to initiate termination proceedings,\r\nto obtain legal counsel, and to act on the advice of legal counsel.”  He states that the three of them\r\n“prepared rough drafts and discussion drafts of summaries of the allegations,   .   .   .   of reports\r\nof the investigation of such allegations, along with rough drafts of preliminary findings, proposals,\r\nand recommendations   .   .   .   .”  He explains that they prepared these documents with the\r\nadvice of counsel and forwarded the documents to counsel “for review and comment.”  Counsel\r\nreturned the documents to them “with direction, guidance, and legal advice regarding [them].” \r\nThe documents “include, incorporate, and reflect the guidance, direction, and legal advice” given\r\nby counsel.  Osborne concludes that the documents “were made for the purpose of facilitating the\r\nrendition of legal services to Baylor University, and to us as representatives of Baylor[;]   .   .  \r\n.   were intended to be confidential and are confidential[;]   .   .   .   were not intended to be\r\ndisclosed to third persons[;] and have not been disclosed to third persons other than those to whom\r\ndisclosure is made in furtherance of the rendition of legal services to the client, or to those\r\nreasonably necessary for the transmission of the communications.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>V. THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The documents in issue came to this court stapled together in an envelope.  Various\r\ndocuments within the packet are individually stapled as well.  The documents can be generally\r\ncategorized as: (1) various drafts of a report on the investigation of the allegations against Fox and\r\na proposed cover letter for the report; (2) various drafts of a summary of the allegations; (3)\r\nvarious drafts of proposed sanctions and notations related to appropriate sanctions; (4) office\r\ncorrespondence between Beckenhauer and others concerning an issue tangentially related to the\r\ninvestigation of the allegations; and (5) various handwritten notes apparently made by Osborne\r\nrelating to the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VI. APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>A. Osborne’s Status</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Foxes argue that in order for Osborne to qualify as Baylor’s representative he must have\r\nultimate decision-making authority.  Professor Goode tends to support this position when he states\r\nthat under <i>National Tank</i>, an organization’s control group consists of only those “authorized to\r\nmake the final decision.”  <span>Goode</span> § 503.3, at 341.  However, we do not read the rule so narrowly.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A person qualifies as a representative of an entity such as Baylor if he has the authority to hire\r\ncounsel on behalf of Baylor or has the authority to act on advice rendered by counsel pursuant to\r\nan authorized request.  <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.</span> 503(a)(2); <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197.  As the\r\nCourt stated in <i>National Tank</i>, the rule extends not only to those “in a position to control” an\r\nentity’s decision, but also to those “in a position   .   .   .   to take a substantial part in [the]\r\ndecision   .   .   .   .”  <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer’s testimony and Osborne’s affidavit both assert that Osborne, Daniel, and\r\nSchmeltekopf each possessed the authority to obtain legal counsel on behalf of the university and\r\nto act on counsel’s advice.  The evidence presented shows that Osborne at least played a\r\nsubstantial role in the investigation of the allegations and in the recommendation of the appropriate\r\nsanctions to be imposed.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The only evidence the Foxes offered to counter this is Osborne’s statements that his authority\r\nis limited to conferring with Daniel and that he never received a copy of any of the written\r\ncomplaints filed against Fox.  This evidence is not sufficient to rebut Osborne’s and Baylor’s\r\nprima facie showing that Osborne was a member of the Baylor control group.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>B. <span>Confidentiality</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer’s testimony and Osborne’s affidavit both explained that the investigators\r\nprepared the various drafts of their investigative reports and recommended sanctions in\r\nconsultation with counsel.  The testimony and affidavit both assert that the documents tendered\r\nunder seal incorporate and reflect counsel’s advice.  The testimony and affidavit also claim that\r\nthe communications contained in the documents were made for the purpose of facilitation of legal\r\nservices to Baylor and were intended to be confidential.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>From this evidence, Osborne and Baylor made a prima facie showing that the documents\r\ntendered under seal are protected by the attorney-client privilege.  However, other evidence raised\r\nfact questions on the issues of whether the documents were intended to be confidential or whether\r\ntheir confidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Osborne testified in his deposition that at least one other person was involved in the\r\ninvestigation, the dean of student life.  This evidence presented the court with fact questions it had\r\nto resolve in order to determine whether the documents in question were kept confidential by\r\nBaylor as other Baylor employees were involved in the investigation besides Baylor’s counsel and\r\nthe three “primary” investigators.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Under this state of facts, the documents themselves must be examined to resolve these\r\nquestions.  <i>See Weisel Enter.</i>, 718 S.W.2d at 58; <i>Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 590.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(1) The Investigation Report Drafts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>These drafts contain a summary of the procedures employed in the investigation; a summary\r\nof the allegations; the findings of the investigators; recommended sanctions; and justifications for\r\nthe proposed sanctions.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The drafts state that interviews of witnesses were conducted “by one or more of the following\r\nindividuals:” Schmeltekopf, Daniel, Osborne, “Dean for Student Life Martha Lou Scott (the\r\nperson to whom the allegations concerning the Field School In Guatemala were originally made),”\r\nThomson, Beckenhauer, “Director of Internal Audit Juan Alejandro and Assistant Director of\r\nInternal Audit Karen Wash.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Neither Osborne nor Baylor offered any evidence that Scott, Alejandro, and Wash are\r\nrepresentatives of the university under Rule 503(a)(2).  We cannot presume from their respective\r\ntitles that they are members of Baylor’s control group and thus authorized to seek or act on legal\r\nadvice.  <i>See El Centro</i>, 894 S.W.2d at 779; <i>Cigna Corp.</i>, 838 S.W.2d at 565-66; <i>see also National\r\nTank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 200.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Thus, the investigative reports themselves suggest that their contents were disclosed to some\r\nextent to other Baylor employees who have not been shown to be within the control group.  This\r\nconstitutes “some evidence either that the communications were never intended to be confidential,\r\nor that the privilege was waived by disclosure to third parties   .   .   .   .”  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d\r\nat 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>If anything in the documents themselves raises a question as to whether the privilege\r\napplies, we can no longer presume the documents to be privileged, but the existence of\r\nthe privilege becomes a question of fact for the trial court, based on the documents and\r\nthe circumstances under which the communications were made.”</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Id.</i>  When the evidence raises a fact question with respect to whether a document was not intended\r\nto be confidential or whether the privilege was waived by subsequent disclosure, the trial court’s\r\ndecision is conclusive.  <i>Id.</i> at 745; <i>Gulf Oil</i>, 695 S.W.2d at 773.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Therefore, because a fact issue exists regarding whether the investigative report summaries\r\nwere intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent\r\ndisclosure, the trial court’s conclusion that these documents are not protected by the attorney-client\r\nprivilege is conclusive.  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(2) The Summaries of the Allegations</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>These documents contain recitations of the allegations against Fox and the evidence which the\r\ninvestigators received tending to support or disprove the allegations.  According to the summaries:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>“[t]he allegations are listed in order of the perceived strength of the evidence supporting\r\nthem.  Individual allegations within categories are similarly ranked.  Judgment of relative\r\nstrength of evidence is based on the number of persons making the allegation, whether\r\nthe allegation appears in a sworn statement, and the perceived quality of the testimony\r\nof the person or persons making or corroborating the allegation.”</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer testified that Thomson and he counseled the investigators on the reliability of the\r\nevidence presented.  He suggested that the investigators’ conclusions about the reasonableness of\r\ntheir findings were based at least in part on their counsel.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Assuming for the sake of argument that such counsel falls within the ambit of “professional\r\nlegal services,” however, the allegations are incorporated into the investigative report summaries\r\nwe have previously addressed.  We have already determined that a fact issue exists regarding\r\nwhether the investigative report summaries were intended to be confidential or whether their\r\nconfidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure.  Because the allegations are incorporated into\r\nthe investigative report summaries, a fact issue exists regarding whether the allegation summaries\r\nwere intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent\r\ndisclosure.  Therefore, the trial court’s conclusion that these documents are not protected by the\r\nattorney-client privilege is conclusive.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(3) The Proposed Sanctions</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The drafts of the proposed sanctions are literally that.  They contain various proposed\r\nsanctions with commentary.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We have already determined that a fact issue exists regarding whether the investigative report\r\nsummaries were intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by\r\nsubsequent disclosure.  Because the proposed sanctions are incorporated into the investigative\r\nreport summaries, a fact issue exists regarding whether the proposed sanctions were intended to\r\nbe confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure.  Therefore,\r\nthe trial court’s conclusion that these documents are not protected by the attorney-client privilege\r\nis conclusive.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(4) The Office Correspondence</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>These documents appear to be inter-office correspondence discussing an immigration matter. \r\nIn the first memorandum, Beckenhauer presented the options available to Osborne, Daniel, and\r\nSchmeltekopf regarding this matter.  Four months later, Beckenhauer sent a similar note. \r\nSchmeltekopf then replied to Beckenhauer’s note.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer sent carbon copies of his original note to three other individuals whose status\r\nwith Baylor is not shown by the record.  Schmeltekopf sent carbon copies of his reply to these\r\nthree individuals and General Counsel Thomson.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Neither Osborne nor Baylor offered any evidence that the individuals who received copies of\r\nthis correspondence are representatives of the university under Rule 503(a)(2).  We cannot\r\npresume that they are representatives of Baylor.  <i>See El Centro</i>, 894 S.W.2d at 779; <i>Cigna Corp.</i>,\r\n838 S.W.2d at 565-66; <i>see also National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 200.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Thus, the correspondence suggests on its face that it was disclosed to some extent to others\r\nwho have not been shown to be representatives of Baylor.  This constitutes “some evidence either\r\nthat the communications were never intended to be confidential, or that the privilege was waived\r\nby disclosure to third parties   .   .   .   .”  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Therefore, because a fact issue exists regarding whether the correspondence was intended to\r\nbe confidential or whether its confidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure, the trial court’s\r\nconclusion that these documents are not protected by the attorney-client privilege is conclusive. \r\n<i>Id.</i> at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(5) The Handwritten Notes</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The content of the handwritten notes suggest that they were written by Osborne.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  They\r\ninclude among other things comments on appropriate sanctions to be assessed, comments on the\r\nwitnesses’ statements, and questions raised by the witnesses’ statements. The notes are not\r\nseparately identified in any fashion to suggest who was present when Osborne made them or when\r\nhe made them.  They include comments made by others identified as Ben, John,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> Bill, and Becky.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> \r\nThey also reflect counsel from Senior Counsel Bill Underwood. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Generally, if a document contains information that is discoverable together with information\r\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege, the entirety of the document is protected by the\r\nprivilege.  <i>See Pittsburgh Corning</i>, 861 S.W.2d at 425; <i>see also Keene Corp.</i>, 840 S.W.2d at 719-20.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>However, the handwritten notes do not constitute a single document.  They are a series of\r\ndocuments, and the content of these documents show that each was prepared at different times\r\nduring the investigation.  Moreover, Beckenhauer testified that the investigators discussed with\r\nThomson and he the reliability and credibility of the witnesses whom they had interviewed.  By\r\nsubmitting the notes together to the court without providing further evidence concerning when they\r\nwere prepared, who was present or participated in the discussions which led to their preparation,\r\nor the status and identity of the persons whose comments are reflected in the notes, a fact issue\r\nexists regarding whether the notes were intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality\r\nwas waived by subsequent disclosure.  Thus, the trial court’s conclusion that these documents are\r\nnot protected by the attorney-client privilege is conclusive.  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VII. CONCLUSION</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The evidence presented raises a fact issue concerning whether the documents tendered under\r\nseal were intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent\r\ndisclosure.  The trial court’s resolution of this fact issue is conclusive.  Therefore, we conclude\r\nthat Respondent did not abuse his discretion in ordering production of the documents.  We deny\r\nOsborne’s and Baylor’s petition for mandamus relief.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                                               </span>REX D.

Osborne and Baylor University bring this action seeking a writ of\r\nmandamus against Respondent, the Honorable Joe N. Johnson, Judge of the 170th Judicial District\r\nCourt of McLennan County.  This action stems from a discovery request served upon Osborne by\r\nreal parties in interest John and Naomi Fox.  Osborne and Baylor filed written objections to the\r\nrequest asserting among other things that some of the documents sought are protected by the\r\nattorney-client privilege.  After conducting a hearing and an in camera review of the documents\r\nalleged to be privileged, Respondent ordered Osborne and Baylor to produce the documents for\r\ndiscovery.  Osborne and Baylor bring this original proceeding seeking mandamus relief from\r\nRespondent’s order.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>John Fox was a professor of anthropology at Baylor.  Each summer Fox directed a group of\r\nBaylor students and other participants at a field school in Guatemala.  After the 1996 field school,\r\nseveral students registered complaints against Fox with Baylor officials concerning incidents which\r\noccurred at the field school.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Judy Parker was the primary complainant.  Parker alleged among other things that Fox\r\nengaged in inappropriate behavior and made inappropriate remarks which carried sexual overtones\r\nduring the field school.  The Foxes filed suit against Parker for libel, slander, tortious interference\r\nwith John Fox’s employment contract, and loss of consortium.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A number of Baylor administrators and other Baylor employees conducted an investigation\r\nof the allegations made by Parker and the others.  The investigators included, among others,\r\nBaylor Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs Donald Schmeltekopf, Dean of the\r\nCollege of Arts and Sciences Wallace Daniel, Osborne, who serves as the chair of Fox’s\r\ndepartment, General Counsel Basil Thomson, and Assistant General Counsel Charles\r\nBeckenhauer.  Each of the investigators participated to varying degrees in the investigation. \r\nApparently not every member of the investigative group was present at each witness interview or\r\nduring each discussion of the allegations.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Foxes served Osborne with a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to appear for a\r\ndeposition and also requiring him to produce among other items:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>●All notes, memorandae [sic], and minutes of meetings of committee investigating Dr.\r\nJohn Fox, together with notes and reports by the committee containing\r\nrecommendations, to include all draft copies of such notes and reports;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>●<span>    </span>All notes, minutes or documentation of committee meetings relative to the\r\ninvestigation of Dr. John Fox; and</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>●<span>    </span>Copies of all committee reports on file relating to the investigation of Dr. John\r\nFox, to include copies of all letters, notes and minutes of meetings with and\r\nfrom Baylor personnel in connection with the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Osborne and Baylor filed written objections to the subpoena asserting among other things that\r\nthe documents sought are privileged from discovery by the attorney-client privilege.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nR. Civ. Evid. </span>503.  Although Baylor itself was not subpoenaed, it objected on the basis that\r\nOsborne engaged in these activities as a representative of the university and in consultation with\r\ncounsel for the university.  <i>Id.</i> 503(a)(2).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The parties appeared before Respondent for a hearing on the objections.  Osborne and Baylor\r\npresented the testimony of Beckenhauer, who testified in pertinent part that during the\r\ninvestigation Osborne acted as a representative of Baylor and sought legal advice from\r\nBeckenhauer and other Baylor counsel in connection with the investigation.  They also tendered\r\nan affidavit signed by Osborne together with the documents (under seal) which they seek to shield\r\nfrom discovery.  After considering the testimony, the affidavit, the argument of counsel, and the\r\ndocuments themselves, Respondent overruled Osborne’s and Baylor’s objections and ordered them\r\nto produce the documents.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>II. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In order to establish their entitlement to mandamus relief, Osborne and Baylor must establish\r\nthat the court committed a clear abuse of discretion and that they have no adequate legal remedy. \r\n<i>Walker v.

THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Rule 503 of the Rules of Civil Evidence protects from discovery confidential communications\r\nbetween an attorney or the attorney’s representative and a client or the client’s representative\r\nwhich are “made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the\r\nclient   .   .   .   .”  <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.</span> 503(b).  In this case, we must determine whether the\r\ndocuments which Osborne and Baylor claim to be privileged by this rule constitute\r\ncommunications between “representatives” of Baylor and Baylor’s counsel and whether the\r\ncommunications were “confidential.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>A. <span>The Control Group Test</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>By the promulgation of Rule 503(a)(2), Texas adopted the control group test for determining\r\nwhether an individual qualifies as the representative of a corporation or other entity which has\r\nretained counsel.  <i>See National Tank Co. v. Brotherton</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1471456\"><a href=\"/opinion/1471456/national-tank-co-v-brotherton/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 198 (Tex. 1993) (orig.\r\nproceeding).  This test finds its origin in <i>City of Philadelphia v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.</i>  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1963443\"><a href=\"/opinion/1963443/city-of-philadelphia-v-westinghouse-electric-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (E.D. Penn. 1962).  In <i>Westinghouse</i>, the court held that a person qualifies as a\r\nrepresentative of a corporation for purposes of the attorney-client privilege if the person is “in a\r\nposition to control or even to take a substantial part in a decision about any action which the\r\ncorporation may take upon the advice of the attorney   .   .   .   .”  <i>Id.</i>, 210 F. Supp. at 485\r\n(quoted by <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Thus, the Court determined in <i>National Tank</i> that a person qualifies as a representative of a\r\ncorporation or other entity for purposes of Rule 503 if the person “is one having authority to\r\nobtain professional legal services, or to act on advice rendered pursuant thereto, on behalf of the\r\nclient.”  <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197 (quoting <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.</span> 503(a)(2)).  However,\r\nthe Court may have caused some confusion later in its opinion when it stated, “[U]nder Rule\r\n503(a)(2), the qualifying employees must be those actually having authority to hire counsel <i>and</i>\r\nto act on counsel’s advice   .   .   .   .”  <i>Id.</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 199 (emphasis added).  This statement\r\nappears to conflict with the plain language of the rule which states the test disjunctively.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We believe this isolated sentence was an inadvertent statement by the Court.  In the next\r\nparagraph, the Court observed that National Tank offered no evidence to prove that a particular\r\nmanager’s position in the corporation “vested [him] with authority to obtain professional legal\r\nservices, <i>or</i> to act on advice rendered pursuant thereto, on behalf of [National Tank].”  <i>Id.</i>, 851\r\nS.W.2d at 200 (emphasis added).  Thus, we conclude that in order to qualify as a representative\r\nof an entity under Rule 503, a person must be shown to either have the authority to obtain\r\nprofessional legal services on behalf of the organization <i>or</i> to act on advice rendered pursuant to\r\na request made under such authority.

THE EVIDENCE</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>A. The Tender of Osborne’s Affidavit</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>As a preliminary matter, the Foxes argue that Osborne and Baylor failed to introduce\r\nOsborne’s affidavit in evidence, and thus, it may not be considered by this Court.  Rule 166b(4)\r\nrequires that the affidavit be served on opposing counsel at least seven days before the hearing in\r\norder to be admitted as evidence.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166b(4).  At the beginning of the hearing,\r\ncounsel informed the court that it would tender Osborne’s affidavit with the documents in question\r\nfor the court’s in camera consideration.  Counsel stated, “I do not tender either the affidavit or the\r\nattached documents in evidence, Your Honor, at least for general use, but I would submit them\r\nto the Court for the Court’s consideration only and for in camera inspection of the enclosed\r\ndocuments for which we seek protection.”  At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel tendered the\r\naffidavit with the documents stating, “You don’t have to take [the affidavit], Judge, but I’m\r\ntendering it.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Foxes did not object to the tender of Osborne’s affidavit.  In fact, they attempted to\r\ntender his deposition testimony in the same manner.  Their counsel stated, “I will provide the\r\nJudge with an unsigned copy of [Osborne’s] deposition for his consideration   .   .   .   .”</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>    The\r\ncourt stated in its order that it “considered [among other things] the affidavit and deposition\r\ntestimony of Harold W. Osborne  .   .   .   .”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A similar tender has been approved by the Fourteenth Court of Appeals.  <i>GAF Corp. v.\r\nCaldwell</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411993\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411993/gaf-corp-v-caldwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 150-51 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding). \r\nIn <i>GAF</i>, the party resisting the discovery of certain documents tendered the documents in issue to\r\nthe court for in camera review with two affidavits attached.  <i>Id.</i> at 150.  The court concluded that\r\nthe affidavits constituted prima facie evidence that the documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege.  <i>Id. </i>at 151.  Apparently the trial court did not hold a formal hearing on the matter\r\nbut rather ordered the documents to be delivered for in camera review upon the filing of the\r\nobjections to the discovery request.  <i>Id.</i> at 149-50.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Although it is true that the party seeking discovery in <i>GAF</i> apparently did not contest the\r\npropriety of the manner in which the affidavits were submitted, the court stated unequivocally that\r\nthe affidavits “presented sufficient evidence to support [the claimed privilege]   .   .   .   .”  <i>Id.</i>\r\nat 151; <i>accord Shell Western E &amp; P, Inc. v. Oliver</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518258\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518258/shell-western-e-p-inc-v-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 196 (Tex. App.—Dallas\r\n1988, orig. proceeding) (By attaching affidavits to motion for protective order, “Shell   .   .   .  \r\nproduced evidence that the attorney-client privilege that it had asserted applied.”).  The Dallas\r\ncourt also stated, “An affidavit suffices to produce evidence concerning the applicability of a\r\ncertain privilege.”  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>One decision by our Supreme Court appears to contradict these cases.  In <i>Barnes</i>, the party\r\nobjecting to discovery submitted affidavits inside sealed envelopes which also contained the\r\ndocuments the party sought to protect.  <i>Barnes</i>, 751 S.W.2d at 495.  The Court stated, “These\r\naffidavits should not have been considered by the trial judge as evidence in support of the privilege\r\nbecause they were never filed with the district clerk; they contain no certificate of service; and,\r\nthey were not served on opposing counsel.”  <i>Id.</i>  The Court observed in a footnote, “Because [the\r\nparty] failed to properly serve the affidavits, the sworn statements constitute improper <i>ex parte</i>\r\ncommunications.”  <i>Id.</i>  n.1.  We consider <i>Barnes</i> distinguishable because Osborne served the\r\nFoxes with a copy of his affidavit in compliance with rule 166b(4).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>From these cases we conclude that in a hearing in which a party seeks protection from a\r\ndiscovery order, the party can satisfy the evidentiary requirements of rule 166b(4) by tendering\r\nan affidavit to the court without formally offering it in evidence, if the affidavit has been timely\r\nserved on opposing counsel in accordance with the rule.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Thus, we will consider Osborne’s\r\naffidavit in deciding the merits of this case.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>B. The Testimony</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In addition to the affidavit and the documents in issue, Osborne and Baylor presented the\r\ntestimony of Assistant General Counsel Beckenhauer.  Beckenhauer testified that he participated\r\nin the investigation of the complaints against Fox.  He explained that three Baylor administrators\r\nparticipated in a supervisory capacity: Schmeltekopf, Daniel, and Osborne, and he described the\r\nrespective positions of these officials in the chain of command.  Fox reported to Osborne; Osborne\r\nreported to Daniel; and Daniel reported to Schmeltekopf.  According to Beckenhauer, Osborne,\r\nDaniel, and Schmeltekopf each had “an inherent authority to deal with the potential disciplinary\r\nmatter.”  He explained that each could take some disciplinary action on his own other than\r\ntermination.  Although none possessed the authority to terminate Fox, any of the three could\r\n“initiate the dismissal process.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer testified that Osborne, Daniel, and Schmeltekopf each had the authority to seek\r\nout legal counsel in the matter involving Fox and to act on the advice of counsel in the matter. \r\nHe explained that the three of them prepared various drafts of summaries of the investigation; that\r\nhe guided them in the preparation of the drafts; that he gave them legal advice in connection with\r\nthe preparation of the drafts; and that in doing so, he was acting as counsel for Baylor and for\r\nBaylor’s representatives involved in the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>According to Beckenhauer, the investigators had to sift through many facts and make\r\nappropriate disciplinary recommendations.  Again he advised and counseled Osborne, Daniel, and\r\nSchmeltekopf at their request in connection with the compilation of drafts and summaries of\r\nfindings, proposals and recommendations in connection with the investigation.  Beckenhauer\r\ntestified that the documents tendered under seal include and reflect his advice and counsel and\r\nconsist of communications between the Baylor General Counsel’s office and the investigators and\r\nbetween the investigators themselves.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer concluded by asserting the attorney-client privilege on behalf of Baylor and by\r\ntestifying that he considers the documents confidential and that the documents were not intended\r\nto be disclosed to anyone lacking decision-making authority.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>On cross-examination, Beckenhauer explained that he acted as both investigator and counsel\r\nin the course of the investigation.  He testified that the investigators interviewed students and took\r\nwritten statements from them.  General Counsel Thomson and he advised and counseled the\r\ninvestigators on the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence and in making the\r\n“administrative decision” with respect to appropriate sanctions.  He did not recall that any of the\r\ndocuments tendered under seal contained any notes explicitly referencing his legal advice, but he\r\ndoes believe that the documents contain “[c]onceptual ideas [attributable to him] in terms of fact-finding and discipline and what the appropriate response may or may not be.”  He believed that\r\na part of his role as counsel in this matter included helping the investigators to evaluate whether\r\ntheir fact findings were reasonable.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer agreed that ultimate decision making authority in the Baylor hierarchy rests with\r\nthe university’s president.  After January 1997, Beckenhauer was no longer “intimately involved”\r\nwith the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Counsel for the Foxes read selected portions of Osborne’s deposition testimony into the\r\nrecord.  In the deposition, Osborne testified that the extent of his decision making authority was\r\nto confer with Daniel.  He identified Baylor Dean for Student Life Martha Lou Scott as another\r\nparticipant in the investigation.  He stated that he never received a copy of Parker’s written\r\ncomplaint or any other written complaint.  Osborne testified that Baylor Senior Counsel Bill\r\nUnderwood and Becky Singer interviewed him.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>C. <span>The Content of Osborne’s Affidavit</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Osborne explains in his affidavit that Schmeltekopf, Daniel, and he each have decision-making\r\nauthority for Baylor “including but not limited to the authority to initiate termination proceedings,\r\nto obtain legal counsel, and to act on the advice of legal counsel.”  He states that the three of them\r\n“prepared rough drafts and discussion drafts of summaries of the allegations,   .   .   .   of reports\r\nof the investigation of such allegations, along with rough drafts of preliminary findings, proposals,\r\nand recommendations   .   .   .   .”  He explains that they prepared these documents with the\r\nadvice of counsel and forwarded the documents to counsel “for review and comment.”  Counsel\r\nreturned the documents to them “with direction, guidance, and legal advice regarding [them].” \r\nThe documents “include, incorporate, and reflect the guidance, direction, and legal advice” given\r\nby counsel.  Osborne concludes that the documents “were made for the purpose of facilitating the\r\nrendition of legal services to Baylor University, and to us as representatives of Baylor[;]   .   .  \r\n.   were intended to be confidential and are confidential[;]   .   .   .   were not intended to be\r\ndisclosed to third persons[;] and have not been disclosed to third persons other than those to whom\r\ndisclosure is made in furtherance of the rendition of legal services to the client, or to those\r\nreasonably necessary for the transmission of the communications.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>V. THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The documents in issue came to this court stapled together in an envelope.  Various\r\ndocuments within the packet are individually stapled as well.  The documents can be generally\r\ncategorized as: (1) various drafts of a report on the investigation of the allegations against Fox and\r\na proposed cover letter for the report; (2) various drafts of a summary of the allegations; (3)\r\nvarious drafts of proposed sanctions and notations related to appropriate sanctions; (4) office\r\ncorrespondence between Beckenhauer and others concerning an issue tangentially related to the\r\ninvestigation of the allegations; and (5) various handwritten notes apparently made by Osborne\r\nrelating to the investigation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VI. APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>A. Osborne’s Status</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Foxes argue that in order for Osborne to qualify as Baylor’s representative he must have\r\nultimate decision-making authority.  Professor Goode tends to support this position when he states\r\nthat under <i>National Tank</i>, an organization’s control group consists of only those “authorized to\r\nmake the final decision.”  <span>Goode</span> § 503.3, at 341.  However, we do not read the rule so narrowly.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A person qualifies as a representative of an entity such as Baylor if he has the authority to hire\r\ncounsel on behalf of Baylor or has the authority to act on advice rendered by counsel pursuant to\r\nan authorized request.  <span>Tex. R. Civ. Evid.</span> 503(a)(2); <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197.  As the\r\nCourt stated in <i>National Tank</i>, the rule extends not only to those “in a position to control” an\r\nentity’s decision, but also to those “in a position   .   .   .   to take a substantial part in [the]\r\ndecision   .   .   .   .”  <i>National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 197.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer’s testimony and Osborne’s affidavit both assert that Osborne, Daniel, and\r\nSchmeltekopf each possessed the authority to obtain legal counsel on behalf of the university and\r\nto act on counsel’s advice.  The evidence presented shows that Osborne at least played a\r\nsubstantial role in the investigation of the allegations and in the recommendation of the appropriate\r\nsanctions to be imposed.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The only evidence the Foxes offered to counter this is Osborne’s statements that his authority\r\nis limited to conferring with Daniel and that he never received a copy of any of the written\r\ncomplaints filed against Fox.  This evidence is not sufficient to rebut Osborne’s and Baylor’s\r\nprima facie showing that Osborne was a member of the Baylor control group.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>B. <span>Confidentiality</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer’s testimony and Osborne’s affidavit both explained that the investigators\r\nprepared the various drafts of their investigative reports and recommended sanctions in\r\nconsultation with counsel.  The testimony and affidavit both assert that the documents tendered\r\nunder seal incorporate and reflect counsel’s advice.  The testimony and affidavit also claim that\r\nthe communications contained in the documents were made for the purpose of facilitation of legal\r\nservices to Baylor and were intended to be confidential.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>From this evidence, Osborne and Baylor made a prima facie showing that the documents\r\ntendered under seal are protected by the attorney-client privilege.  However, other evidence raised\r\nfact questions on the issues of whether the documents were intended to be confidential or whether\r\ntheir confidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Osborne testified in his deposition that at least one other person was involved in the\r\ninvestigation, the dean of student life.  This evidence presented the court with fact questions it had\r\nto resolve in order to determine whether the documents in question were kept confidential by\r\nBaylor as other Baylor employees were involved in the investigation besides Baylor’s counsel and\r\nthe three “primary” investigators.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Under this state of facts, the documents themselves must be examined to resolve these\r\nquestions.  <i>See Weisel Enter.</i>, 718 S.W.2d at 58; <i>Moyé</i>, 893 S.W.2d at 590.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(1) The Investigation Report Drafts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>These drafts contain a summary of the procedures employed in the investigation; a summary\r\nof the allegations; the findings of the investigators; recommended sanctions; and justifications for\r\nthe proposed sanctions.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The drafts state that interviews of witnesses were conducted “by one or more of the following\r\nindividuals:” Schmeltekopf, Daniel, Osborne, “Dean for Student Life Martha Lou Scott (the\r\nperson to whom the allegations concerning the Field School In Guatemala were originally made),”\r\nThomson, Beckenhauer, “Director of Internal Audit Juan Alejandro and Assistant Director of\r\nInternal Audit Karen Wash.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Neither Osborne nor Baylor offered any evidence that Scott, Alejandro, and Wash are\r\nrepresentatives of the university under Rule 503(a)(2).  We cannot presume from their respective\r\ntitles that they are members of Baylor’s control group and thus authorized to seek or act on legal\r\nadvice.  <i>See El Centro</i>, 894 S.W.2d at 779; <i>Cigna Corp.</i>, 838 S.W.2d at 565-66; <i>see also National\r\nTank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 200.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Thus, the investigative reports themselves suggest that their contents were disclosed to some\r\nextent to other Baylor employees who have not been shown to be within the control group.  This\r\nconstitutes “some evidence either that the communications were never intended to be confidential,\r\nor that the privilege was waived by disclosure to third parties   .   .   .   .”  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d\r\nat 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>If anything in the documents themselves raises a question as to whether the privilege\r\napplies, we can no longer presume the documents to be privileged, but the existence of\r\nthe privilege becomes a question of fact for the trial court, based on the documents and\r\nthe circumstances under which the communications were made.”</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Id.</i>  When the evidence raises a fact question with respect to whether a document was not intended\r\nto be confidential or whether the privilege was waived by subsequent disclosure, the trial court’s\r\ndecision is conclusive.  <i>Id.</i> at 745; <i>Gulf Oil</i>, 695 S.W.2d at 773.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Therefore, because a fact issue exists regarding whether the investigative report summaries\r\nwere intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent\r\ndisclosure, the trial court’s conclusion that these documents are not protected by the attorney-client\r\nprivilege is conclusive.  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(2) The Summaries of the Allegations</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>These documents contain recitations of the allegations against Fox and the evidence which the\r\ninvestigators received tending to support or disprove the allegations.  According to the summaries:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>“[t]he allegations are listed in order of the perceived strength of the evidence supporting\r\nthem.  Individual allegations within categories are similarly ranked.  Judgment of relative\r\nstrength of evidence is based on the number of persons making the allegation, whether\r\nthe allegation appears in a sworn statement, and the perceived quality of the testimony\r\nof the person or persons making or corroborating the allegation.”</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer testified that Thomson and he counseled the investigators on the reliability of the\r\nevidence presented.  He suggested that the investigators’ conclusions about the reasonableness of\r\ntheir findings were based at least in part on their counsel.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Assuming for the sake of argument that such counsel falls within the ambit of “professional\r\nlegal services,” however, the allegations are incorporated into the investigative report summaries\r\nwe have previously addressed.  We have already determined that a fact issue exists regarding\r\nwhether the investigative report summaries were intended to be confidential or whether their\r\nconfidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure.  Because the allegations are incorporated into\r\nthe investigative report summaries, a fact issue exists regarding whether the allegation summaries\r\nwere intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent\r\ndisclosure.  Therefore, the trial court’s conclusion that these documents are not protected by the\r\nattorney-client privilege is conclusive.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(3) The Proposed Sanctions</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The drafts of the proposed sanctions are literally that.  They contain various proposed\r\nsanctions with commentary.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We have already determined that a fact issue exists regarding whether the investigative report\r\nsummaries were intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by\r\nsubsequent disclosure.  Because the proposed sanctions are incorporated into the investigative\r\nreport summaries, a fact issue exists regarding whether the proposed sanctions were intended to\r\nbe confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure.  Therefore,\r\nthe trial court’s conclusion that these documents are not protected by the attorney-client privilege\r\nis conclusive.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(4) The Office Correspondence</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>These documents appear to be inter-office correspondence discussing an immigration matter. \r\nIn the first memorandum, Beckenhauer presented the options available to Osborne, Daniel, and\r\nSchmeltekopf regarding this matter.  Four months later, Beckenhauer sent a similar note. \r\nSchmeltekopf then replied to Beckenhauer’s note.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Beckenhauer sent carbon copies of his original note to three other individuals whose status\r\nwith Baylor is not shown by the record.  Schmeltekopf sent carbon copies of his reply to these\r\nthree individuals and General Counsel Thomson.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Neither Osborne nor Baylor offered any evidence that the individuals who received copies of\r\nthis correspondence are representatives of the university under Rule 503(a)(2).  We cannot\r\npresume that they are representatives of Baylor.  <i>See El Centro</i>, 894 S.W.2d at 779; <i>Cigna Corp.</i>,\r\n838 S.W.2d at 565-66; <i>see also National Tank</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 200.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Thus, the correspondence suggests on its face that it was disclosed to some extent to others\r\nwho have not been shown to be representatives of Baylor.  This constitutes “some evidence either\r\nthat the communications were never intended to be confidential, or that the privilege was waived\r\nby disclosure to third parties   .   .   .   .”  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Therefore, because a fact issue exists regarding whether the correspondence was intended to\r\nbe confidential or whether its confidentiality was waived by subsequent disclosure, the trial court’s\r\nconclusion that these documents are not protected by the attorney-client privilege is conclusive. \r\n<i>Id.</i> at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(5) The Handwritten Notes</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The content of the handwritten notes suggest that they were written by Osborne.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  They\r\ninclude among other things comments on appropriate sanctions to be assessed, comments on the\r\nwitnesses’ statements, and questions raised by the witnesses’ statements. The notes are not\r\nseparately identified in any fashion to suggest who was present when Osborne made them or when\r\nhe made them.  They include comments made by others identified as Ben, John,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> Bill, and Becky.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> \r\nThey also reflect counsel from Senior Counsel Bill Underwood. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Generally, if a document contains information that is discoverable together with information\r\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege, the entirety of the document is protected by the\r\nprivilege.  <i>See Pittsburgh Corning</i>, 861 S.W.2d at 425; <i>see also Keene Corp.</i>, 840 S.W.2d at 719-20.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>However, the handwritten notes do not constitute a single document.  They are a series of\r\ndocuments, and the content of these documents show that each was prepared at different times\r\nduring the investigation.  Moreover, Beckenhauer testified that the investigators discussed with\r\nThomson and he the reliability and credibility of the witnesses whom they had interviewed.  By\r\nsubmitting the notes together to the court without providing further evidence concerning when they\r\nwere prepared, who was present or participated in the discussions which led to their preparation,\r\nor the status and identity of the persons whose comments are reflected in the notes, a fact issue\r\nexists regarding whether the notes were intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality\r\nwas waived by subsequent disclosure.  Thus, the trial court’s conclusion that these documents are\r\nnot protected by the attorney-client privilege is conclusive.  <i>Hinojosa</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 746.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VII. CONCLUSION</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The evidence presented raises a fact issue concerning whether the documents tendered under\r\nseal were intended to be confidential or whether their confidentiality was waived by subsequent\r\ndisclosure.  The trial court’s resolution of this fact issue is conclusive.  Therefore, we conclude\r\nthat Respondent did not abuse his discretion in ordering production of the documents.  We deny\r\nOsborne’s and Baylor’s petition for mandamus relief.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                                               </span>REX D.
