S 1983 challenging the\nconstitutionality as applied to them of a New Jersey prison\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The Honorable William W Schwarzer, United States District Court for\nthe Northern District Court of California, sitting by designation.\n\n                                  2\n\fpolicy that allows correctional officials to designate\n\"security threat groups\" (\"STGs) and transfer core members\nof these groups to a special unit. Once in this unit, core\nmembers must participate in a behavior modification\nprogram before returning to the general prison population.\nThe plaintiffs asserted that these regulations violate\nnumerous constitutional provisions, including the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal\nProtection and Due Process Clauses. The District Court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, who\nare New Jersey prison officials. We affirm.\n\nI.\n\nA.\n\nFaced with increasing gang violence in correctional\nfacilities throughout the state, the New Jersey Department\nof Corrections promulgated a policy in 1998 that was\ndesigned to isolate and rehabilitate gang members. Under\nthis policy, prison officials can designate STGs and transfer\nthe \"core\" members of these groups to the\"Security Threat\nGroup Management Unit\" (\"STGMU\"). The goal of this policy\nis to \"limit Security Threat Group activities and, in doing\nso, minimize the occurrence of assaults on staff and\ninmates.\" App. 125.\n\nThe specifics of this policy were outlined in a Department\nof Corrections document entitled \"Policy Statement for the\nManagement of Security Threat Group Members\" (\"STG\nPolicy\"). See App. at 125-52. Related regulations were also\nissued.\n\nThe STG Policy defines an STG as:\n\n       A group of inmates, designated by the Commissioner,\n       who may gather together regularly and informally,\n       possessing common characteristics, interests and goals\n       which serve to distinguish the group or group members\n       from other inmate groups or other inmates and which,\n       as a discrete entity, poses a threat to the safety of staff,\n       other inmates, the community, and/or damages to, or\n       destruction of property, and/or interrupting the safe,\n\n                                3\n\f       secure and orderly operation of the correctional\n       facility(ies).\n\nApp. 126. STGs are officially designated by the\nCommissioner based on recommendations from the\nIntelligence Section of the Central Office Internal Affairs\nUnit (\"Intelligence Section\") of the Department of\nCorrections. See id. at 128.\n\nThe STG Policy lists several factors that the Intelligence\nSection takes into account in considering whether a group\nshould be designated as an STG. See id. These include the\nfollowing characteristics of the group: (1) its history and\npurpose; (2) its organizational structure; (3) the propensity\nfor violence of the group and its members; (4) actual or\nplanned acts of violence reasonably attributable to the\ngroup; (5) other illegal or prohibited acts reasonably\nattributable to the group; (6) the \"[d]emographics of the\ngroup,\" including its size, location, and pattern of\nexpansion or decline; and (7) the degree of threat that the\ngroup poses. See App. 128. Designation of a group as an\nSTG has the effect of prohibiting inmates from engaging in\nactivities related to the group. Under prison regulations, it\nis a serious infraction for an inmate to \"participat[e] in an\nactivity related to a security threat group,\" N.J.A.C. 10A:4-\n4.1(.010), or to \"possess[ ] or exhibit[ ] anything related to a\nsecurity threat group.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(.011). It is also a\nserious infraction for an inmate to attempt to do either of\nthe above. See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(.803).\n\nThe STG Policy lists criteria to be considered in\ndetermining whether a particular inmate should be\nclassified as an STG member. These include: (1) an\ninmate's acknowledgment of membership; (2) the presence\nof an STG tattoo; (3) the possession of STG paraphernalia;\n(4) information from an outside agency; (5) information\nfrom an Internal Affairs report or investigation; (6)\ncorrespondence from other inmates or outside contacts; (7)\nSTG photographs; and (8) any other factors that suggest\nthat the inmate is involved in STG activities2 or is an STG\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Policy Statement defines \"Security Threat Group Activities\" as:\n\n       activities or actions of an inmate which relate either directly or\n       indirectly to goals of a Security Threat Group. These activities\n\n                               4\n\fmember. See App. 129. Any inmate who satisfies two of\nthese criteria may be designated as an STG member.\n\nAn inmate may be identified as a \"core\" member of an\nSTG if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied:\n\n       1. The inmate has a [Department of Corrections]\n       documented status as a recognized Security Threat\n       Group leader;\n\n       2. The inmate has taken a [Department of\n       Corrections] documented part/role in an activity,\n       behavior or involvement in an event/incident\n       associated with a Security Threat Group;\n\n       3. The inmate's [Department of Corrections]\n       documented activities, behavior or involvement in an\n       event/incident whether associated with a Security\n       Threat Group or not, poses a threat to the safety of\n       staff, other inmates, or the community; cause damages\n       to, or destruction of property; cause the interruption of\n       the safe, secure and orderly operation of the\n       correctional facilities;\n\n       4. The inmate has been identified as a Security Threat\n       Group Member and has been found guilty of a\n       prohibited act which is an asterisk offence [sic] in\n       accordance with N.J.A.C. 10A:4 \"Inmate Disciple\"\n       whether or not this offense was related to a Security\n       Threat Group's activities or not.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       include but are not limited to; Possession of Security Threat Group\n       literature such as lessons, membership lists, manuals and artwork;\n       Possession of Security Threat Group paraphernalia such as, beads,\n       artwork, medallions and clothing articles; Observation by staff of\n       known Security Threat Group hand-signs and/or signals;\n       Participation in Security Threat Group related assaults,\n       disturbances, meetings, gatherings, incidents and events; Sending\n       or receiving Security Threat Group related correspondence;\n       Recruiting of other inmates to join a Security Threat Group.\n\nApp. at 126.\n\n3. The term \"asterisk offense\" designates a grade of inmate infraction. It\nis defined as \"a prohibited act preceded by a number and an asterisk\nthat is considered the most serious and results in the most severe\nsanction(s).\" N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.2.\n\n                               5\n\fId. at 130.\n\nIf an inmate is identified as a core member, the inmate is\ntransferred to the STGMU and placed in \"Pre-Hearing\nSecurity Threat Group Management Unit\" status. App. 131.\nAt this point, the inmate is provided with written notice\nthat he or she is being considered for placement in the\nSTGMU and is given at least 48 hours' notice of the hearing\nbefore the STGMU Hearing Committee. Id. At the hearing,\nthe inmate may appear in person or may present his or her\ncase through a representative or through written\nsubmissions. Id. at 132. The STGMU Hearing Committee\nmay validate the assignment of the inmate to the STGMU if\nthe evidence supports a finding that the inmate is an STG\nmember, has taken an active role in STG activities, and\nsatisfies one of the four previously mentioned conditions.\nId. at 133. If the STGMU Hearing Committee assigns the\ninmate to the STGMU, the inmate may appeal to the\nadministrator of the prison. Id. The administrator's decision\nmay then be challenged in state court.\n\nAn inmate assigned to the STGMU remains in maximum\ncustody until the inmate successfully completes a three-\nphase behavior modification and education program. App.\n135. This program \"is designed to give the inmate the\ninsight and tools necessary to interact appropriately,\nwithout the perceived need of membership in a Security\nThreat Group.\" Id. The inmate is taught anger\nmanagement, conflict resolution, and social interactive\nskills that feature alternatives to violence. Id . The\nCommittee monitors the inmate's progress and determines\nwhether the inmate should advance to the next phase and\neventually return to the general prison population. Id. In\norder to complete the program and return to the general\nprison population, an inmate must sign a form renouncing\naffiliation with all STGs. See App. at 248, 302-04, 443.\n\nB.\n\nThe Five Percent Nation originated in New York City in\nthe 1960s after its leader, Clarence Smith (also known as\nClarence 13X and Father Allah), broke away from the\nNation of Islam. The group's name derives from its belief in\n\n                                6\n\f\"Supreme Mathematics,\" which breaks down the population\nof the world into three groups: the Ten Percent, the Eighty-\nFive Percent, and the Five Percent.\n\nThe Ten Percent are those who have subjugated most of\nthe world. They include white people and others who\npropagate the myth of a nonexistent \"mystery God.\"4 The\nTen Percent are described as follows in a Five Percent\nNation text:\n\n       [The 10% are] the rich, slave makers of the poor. Who\n       teach[ ] the poor lies to believe that the Almighty true\n       and living God is a spook and cannot be seen by the\n       physical eye, otherwise known as the blood suckers of\n       the poor.\n\nApp. 361.\n\nThe Eighty-Five Percent are those who are subjugated\nand deceived. They \"worship what they know not, .. . are\neasily led in the wrong direction but [are] hard to lead in\nthe right direction.\" App. 361.\n\nFinally, the Five Percent are African Americans who have\nachieved self-knowledge. App. 361. They \"know the black\nman's true nature and that God is within man himself.\"\nAppellants' Br. at 14. Male members of the group are\nreferred to as \"Gods,\" female members are called \"Earths,\"\nand the group often refers to itself as \"The Nation of Gods\nand Earths.\" See App. 458. A declaration of a member\nexplains:\n\n        . . . The Nation of Gods and Earths emphasizes the\n       individual, human freedom and choice.\n\n        . . . Our teachings include texts such as the Bible,\n       the Koran, \"The 120 Degrees,\" \"Supreme Mathematics,\"\n       and \"Supreme Alphabet\".\n\n        . . . The Nation of Gods and Earths teaches that. . .\n       our status, as black men, is commensurate with that\n       of the Supreme being.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. As stated in one of the group's \"lessons\": \"There is no mystery God.\nThe SON OF MAN has searched for that mystery God for trillions of\nyears and was unable to find this so-called mystery God.\" App. 360.\n\n                               7\n\f        . . . We teach man to stop looking for a mystical God\n       to come and solve our problems but to take\n       responsibility to solve our own problems ourselves.\n\n        . . . We teach that worship of Allah is tantamount to\n       worship of oneself and that everyone has \"God\" within\n       him.\n\nApp. 458-59.\n\nDespite the mysterious murder of Clarence 13X in June\nof 1969, the Five Percent Nation flourished in certain prison\nsystems. According to a report prepared by Roland Holvey\nof the New Jersey Department of Corrections Internal\nAffairs Office (\"the Holvey Report\"), the Five Percent Nation\nbecame such a strong presence in New York prisons that\nHispanic inmates were prompted to form their own gang,\nknown as the Latin Kings, to protect themselves from\nattacks by Five Percenters. The Five Percent Nation became\nactive in New Jersey prisons in the early 1980s and has\nsince become the largest group in the state's prison system.\nIn addition to New York and New Jersey, the group is also\nknown to exist in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,\nMaryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,\nSouth Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Five Percent Nation claims that it does not promote\nor advocate violence, but evidence links the group with\nnumerous incidents of prison violence. Indeed, according to\nthe Holvey report, many in the law enforcement community\nconsider the Five Percent Nation to be \"one of the greatest\nthreats to the social fabric\" of the prisons. See App. 336. In\nsupport of this conclusion, the Holvey report cites a string\nof incidents that occurred in New Jersey prisons between\nAugust 1990 and July 1997. See App. at 341-43. In August\n1990, a Five Percenter was a member of a small group of\ninmates who repeatedly stabbed a prison officer and\nseverely beat other officers. See App. at 341. In May 1993,\nan investigation revealed that a Five Percenter sent an\nanonymous letter threatening the lives of prison staff at\nEast Jersey State Prison. See id. In December 1993, more\nthan 30 inmates at Northern State Prison participated in a\ngroup demonstration in the gymnasium during afternoon\nrecess. See id. A subsequent investigation revealed that the\n\n                               8\n\fgroup was planning to assault prison staff because prison\nofficials refused to recognize the Five Percent Nation as a\nreligion. See id. Information was also received that the Five\nPercenters were planning to \"take a cop\" in the afternoon.\nSee Sealed Appendix at 24. In March 1995, two Five\nPercenters in the Southern State Correctional Facility were\ninvolved in an altercation inside a housing unit. See id. at\n342. In May 1996, approximately 50 to 60 inmates\nbelonging to the Five Percent Nation or a rival gang\nconducted an unauthorized meeting during evening\nrecreation. See id. In August 1996, a melee broke out\nbetween Five Percenters and another group in a state\nprison. See id. Between 25 and 30 inmates were involved in\nfights. See id. On a day in November 1996, 24 inmates in\na youth correctional facility who were affiliated with the\nFive Percent Nation or rival Hispanic gangs were involved in\nthree separate incidents. See id. In February 1997, a Five\nPercenter at Riverfront State Prison attacked and seriously\ninjured a correctional officer. See id. at 343. The officer\nsuffered a punctured lung after being stabbed with a\nhomemade knife. See id. After the attack, four other Five\nPercenters barricaded themselves in the gymnasium, set\nfires, and damaged prison property. See id. Also in\nFebruary 1997, a member of the Five Percent Nation was\ninvolved in a fight with another inmate. See id. In March\n1997, officers at Riverfront State Prison received\ninformation that Five Percenters had contracted with\nmembers of another gang to assault prison staff members.\nSee id. In July 1997, Five Percenters at Middlesex County\nJail participated in a hunger strike. See id. Officers were\nrequired to use smoke and concussion grenades to enter\ntwo barricaded housing units. See id.\n\nBased largely on the recommendations of Investigator\nHolvey and others in the Intelligence Section, the\nCommissioner designated the Five Percent Nation as an\nSTG. The Commissioner also designated two Hispanic\ngangs, the Latin Kings and the NETAs, and two white\ngangs, the Prison Bikers Brotherhood and the Aryan\nBrothers. App. 280. On March 4, 1998, several inmates,\nincluding plaintiffs Alexander Kettles and John Harris, were\nidentified as core members of the Five Percent Nation and\ntransferred to the STGMU. See Appellants' Br. at 9. Kettles\n\n                               9\n\facknowledges being a member of the Five Percent Nation,\nsee App. at 36 (Kettles's Affidavit), while Harris denies\nmembership. See App. 61 (Harris's Affidavit). Harris claims\nto be a Rastafarian who \"gain[s] personal and spiritual\nfulfillment by examining and studying all religions,\nincluding The Five Percent Nation.\" Id. He believes that\nstudying other religions enables him to \"better understand\nand accept others['] points of view.\" Id. He asserts that he\nwas falsely identified as a Five Percenter simply because he\nreceived a letter from a friend who was a member and\nbecause some of his Rastafarian literature contained a Five\nPercent Nation symbol. He refused to sign a statement\ndisavowing association with STGs because he believes that\nsigning would amount to an admission that he belongs to\nthe Five Percent Nation. See id. at 62. The third plaintiff,\nJael Fraise, admits membership in the Five Percent Nation.\nSee Appellants' Brief at 9. He was validated as a core\nmember and transferred to the STGMU based on his\npossession of Five Percenter material. See id.\n\nKettles, Harris, and Fraise filed separate lawsuits against\nDepartment of Corrections officials under 42 U.S.C.S 1983,\nasserting that their treatment under the STG Policy violated\ntheir constitutional rights. They sought injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief and damages.\n\nC.\n\nIn an unpublished opinion, the District Court granted the\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court first\naddressed the plaintiffs' claims that the enforcement of the\nSTG Policy had violated their rights under the Free Exercise\nClause. Although the defendants contended that the Five\nPercent Nation is not a \"religion\" within the meaning of the\nFirst Amendment, the Court did not resolve this issue but\nrather assumed for the sake of argument that the Five\nPercent Nation is a \"religion.\" The Court then applied the\nstandard set out by the Supreme Court in Turner v. Safley,\n482 U.S. 78 (1987), for assessing prison regulations that\nrestrict inmates' constitutional rights. Under Turner, a\nregulation passes muster if it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests. See 482 U.S. at 89. Turner\ninstructs courts to weigh four factors when applying this\n\n                               10\n\fstandard: first, whether the regulation bears a\"valid,\nrational connection\" to a legitimate and neutral\ngovernmental objective; second, whether prisoners have\nalternative ways of exercising the circumscribed right;\nthird, whether accommodating the right would have a\ndeleterious impact on other inmates, guards, and the\nallocation of prison resources generally; and fourth,\nwhether alternatives exist that \"fully accommodate[ ] the\nprisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological\ninterests.\" Id. at 91.\n\nWith respect to the first factor, the District Court noted\nthat the designation of the Five Percent Nation as an STG\nwas based on concern about security. The Court recognized\nthis as a valid penological concern that is unrelated to the\nsuppression of expression and is consequently neutral for\npurposes of the Turner analysis. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 14; see\nalso id. After finding \"ample evidence that the Five Percent\nNation as a group poses a threat to prison security,\" the\nCourt concluded that the decision to designate the Five\nPercent Nation as an STG was rationally related to this\nlegitimate and neutral government objective. Id. at 14-15.\nThe Court also held that the STG Policy's restrictions on\nthe activities of STG members were all rationally related to\nthe goal of prison safety and security. See id. at 15-19. The\nCourt thus concluded that the first Turner factor weighed in\nfavor of the STG Policy.\n\nIn analyzing the second factor -- the availability of\nalternative ways of exercising the circumscribed right -- the\nDistrict Court stated that \"[t]here must simply be some\nform of expression available to the inmates . . . and here\nthat requirement is met.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 20 (citing O'Lone\nv. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 352 (1987)). The Court\nnoted that the STG Policy does not impose a total ban on\nassociation and expression by STG members and that such\ninmates continue to have opportunities to participate in\nreligious programs, to fast and pray, to possess certain\nreligious items, and to express their political, social, and\ncultural views in other ways. See id. at 21.\n\nTurning to the third factor -- the impact that\naccommodating the asserted constitutional right would\nhave on other inmates, guards, and the allocation of prison\n\n                               11\n\fresources generally -- the District Court believed that\n\"[a]ccomodating plaintiffs' desire to associate and engage in\nSTG activities . . . undoubtedly would adversely impact the\ninmate population and prison staff at all correctional\nfacilities by exposing them to a greater risk of assault and\ndisturbance.\" Id. at 22. The Court thus held that the STG\nPolicy satisfied Turner's third factor.\n\nFinally, the District Court held that the Policy was also\nsupported by the fourth factor -- the absence of\nalternatives that would fully accommodate the prisoner's\nrights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests. The\nCourt opined that \"[r]equiring an accommodation, like\nmandating further STG activity on the part of inmates prior\nto classification, or further demonstration of [a particular\ninmate's] dangerousness before placement at the STGMU,\n[would] expose[ ] the general inmate population and the\ncorrectional facility staff to an increased risk of violence.\"\nDist Ct. Op. at 23. The Court did not feel that an\nindividualized determination of the threat presented by\neach inmate identified as an STG member was a viable\nalternative because, among other things, it would place an\nundue burden on prison staff. See id. at 24. Accordingly,\nthe Court held that all four of Turner's prongs weighed in\nfavor of the STG Policy, that the Policy was reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests, and that it did\nnot violate the plaintiffs' free exercise rights.\n\nThe District Court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that\nthe defendants had violated their equal protection rights by\nsingling out their religion for unfavorable treatment. The\nCourt noted that \"[t]here is nothing in the Constitution\nwhich requires prison officials to treat all inmate groups\nalike where differentiation is necessary to avoid an\nimminent threat of institutional disruption or violence.\"\nDist. Ct. Op. at 24-25 (quoting Jones v. North Carolina\nPrisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119, 136 (1977)). Finally, the\nDistrict Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the\nDepartment of Corrections violated due process by failing to\ngive adequate notice before promulgating and acting\npursuant to the STG Policy. The Court held that the\nplaintiffs had not shown that placement in the STGMU\ndeprived them of a protected liberty interest. The plaintiffs\nthen took this appeal.\n\n                               12\n\fII\n\nWe first address the plaintiffs' claim that the STG Policy\nviolates their First Amendment right to the free exercise of\ntheir religion. All parties urge us to resolve this issue by\napplying the standards set out in Turner, and we take that\napproach.5\n\nIn Turner, the Supreme Court began by noting that\n\"[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison\ninmates from the protections of the Constitution.\" 482 U.S.\nat 84. The Court recognized, however, that inmates'\nconstitutional rights must in some respects be limited in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. It is not clear that Turner factors should be considered before\ndetermining whether a contested prison regulation would violate the\nconstitutional right that the inmate invokes if the regulation were\napplied to persons not in prison. After all, incarceration almost always\nresults in a narrowing, not a broadening, of constitutional protections.\n\nTurner discussed five prior Supreme Court cases involving inmate\nconstitutional claims, and in all of those cases the challenged prison\nregulation would have been plainly unconstitutional outside the prison\ncontext. See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974)(restrictions on\nthe contents of incoming and outgoing prisoner mail); Pell v. Procunier,\n417 U.S. 817 (1974)(restrictions on face-to-face media interviews with\nindividual inmates); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, Inc., 433\nU.S. 119 (1977)(regulations prohibiting meetings, solicitations, and bulk\nmailings related to prison union); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520\n(1979)(restrictions on inmates' receipt of hardcover books not mailed\ndirectly from publishers, book clubs, or book stores); Block v.\nRutherford,\n468 U.S. 576 (1984)(ban on contact visits). The same is true of Turner\nitself, which concerned restrictions on the right of inmates to correspond\nwith other prisoners and to marry, as well as O'Lone v. Shabazz, supra,\nwhich involved restrictions on attendance at religious services.\n\nThe defendants have not argued, however, that we should first\ndetermine whether the regulations at issue here would violate the Free\nExercise Clause if applied outside the prison context. See Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993);\nEmployment Div. Dept. of Human Res. of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872\n(1990). We therefore do not reach this issue.\n\nWe also note that the plaintiffs have not raised any argument under\nthe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42\nU.S.C. S 2000cc-1, which may address some of the concerns expressed\nby the dissent, and we therefore do not discuss that statute.\n\n                               13\n\forder to accommodate the demands of prison\nadministration and to serve valid penological objectives. See\nid. The Court also emphasized that the judiciary is \"ill\nequipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of\nprison administration and reform\" and should therefore\ngive significant deference to judgments made by prison\nofficials in establishing, interpreting, and applying prison\nregulations. See id. at 84-85. Accordingly, the Court held,\nprison regulations that curtail an inmate's constitutional\nrights need only be reasonably related to legitimate\npenological objectives. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. See also,\ne.g., Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir. 1999);\nAbu-Jamal v. Price, 154 F.3d 128, 132 (3d Cir. 1998);\nCooper v. Tard, 855 F.2d 125, 128 (3d Cir. 1988). As noted,\nunder the Turner framework, four factors must be\nconsidered in assessing the reasonableness of such\nregulations. Id. at 90-91. We will discuss each of these\nfactors separately.\n\nA.\n\nWe agree with the District Court that the STG Policy is\nsupported by Turner's first prong. A prison regulation fails\nthis prong if it \"promotes an interest that is illegitimate or\nnot neutral, or . . . bears no `valid, rational connection' to\nthe asserted interest.\" Waterman, 183 F.3d at 214 (quoting\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89-90). Here, contrary to the suggestion\nof the dissent that the New Jersey scheme \"targets\nmembers of one religion,\" Dissent at 27, the STG Policy is\nentirely neutral and does not in any way take religion into\naccount. It is also beyond dispute that New Jersey has a\nlegitimate penological interest in maintaining order and\nsecurity within the prison system. See O'Lone , 482 U.S. at\n350-51; Turner, 482 U.S. at 91-92. Recognizing this, the\nplaintiffs challenge the STG Policy by arguing that the\nHolvey Report does not provide a sufficient basis for\nconcluding that prison violence can be attributed to the\nFive Percent Nation. See Appellants' Br. at 21-22. The\nplaintiffs maintain that there has been \"no showing . . .\nthat a greater proportion of Five Percenters are more violent\nthan a group of Christians, Muslims, Jews or atheists\" and\nthat the Holvey Report found only that some Five\n\n                               14\n\fPercenters are violent. Id. at 24. Contending that the\ndecision to classify the Five Percenters as an STG was\nbased on a report full of \"unfounded speculations,\" the\nplaintiffs argue that the STG Policy and the restrictions\nimposed on them are not rationally related to the legitimate\nobjective of maintaining prison order and security. We\ndisagree.\n\nAs discussed above, the Holvey Report recounts\nnumerous instances of actual or planned violence involving\nFive Percenters in New Jersey correctional facilities from\nAugust 1990 through July 1997. See App. 341-43.\nAlthough the plaintiffs and the dissent contend that these\nincidents are insufficient to justify STG treatment, Turner\ninstructs judges to exercise great caution before second-\nguessing the expert judgment of correctional officials on a\nquestion of this nature. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85;\nDeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 52 (3d Cir. 2000). The Turner\nCourt wrote:\n\n       \"[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly\n       urgent problems of prison administration and reform.' \"\n       [Martinez v. Procunier, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974).] As\n       the Martinez Court acknowledged, \"the problems of\n       prisons in America are complex and intractable. . . .\n       Id., at 404-405. Running a prison is an inordinately\n       difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning,\n       and the commitment of resources, all of which are\n       peculiarly within the province of the legislative and\n       executive branches of government. Prison\n       administration is, moreover, a task that has been\n       committed to the responsibility of those branches, and\n       separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of\n       judicial restraint. Where a state penal system is\n       involved, federal courts have, as we indicated in\n       Martinez, additional reason to accord deference to the\n       appropriate prison authorities. See id., at 405.\n\nTo these observations, we would add that a measure of\ndeference is especially appropriate when a regulation\nimplicates prison security.\n\nViewing the summary judgment record in the manner\ndictated by Turner, we are satisfied that the defendants had\n\n                               15\n\fadequate grounds for concluding that inmates belonging to\nthe Five Percent Nation present a serious security threat.\n\nWe note that other courts have reached the same\nconclusion. The Fourth Circuit has observed, the Five\nPercent Nation has a \"history of violence\" in the South\nCarolina prison system. See In re Long Term Admin.\nSegregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters , 174\nF.3d 464, 466-69 (4th Cir. 1999) (hereinafter \" Five\nPercenters\")(describing violent incidents involving members\nof the group and referring to a federal intelligence summary\nthat called the Five Percenters a \"radical Islamic\nsect/criminal group\" that \"is often boldly racist in its views,\nprolific in its criminal activities, and operates behind a\nfacade of cultural and religious rhetoric\"). The United\nStates District Court for the Western District of New York\nreached a similar conclusion concerning the New York\nsystem. See Self-Allah v. Annucci, No. 97-CV-607(H), 1999\nWL 299310, at *9 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 1999)(referring to the\n\"substantial history of violence associated with Five\nPercenter activities\" and finding that the Department of\nCorrections \"reasonably concluded that Five Percenters\nrepresent a STG within the [New York] prison system\").\nThat court wrote:\n\n       [T]he Five Percenters act as an organized group within\n       the prison system to receive new members, intimidate\n       members of rival groups, and participate in criminal\n       activity, including extortion, robbery, assaults and\n       drug trafficking. Seemingly innocuous literature is\n       used to send messages in code form. Five Percenter\n       literature also assists in keeping the gang organized, in\n       allowing members of the group to be identified, and in\n       legitimizing the group and its violent activities.\n\nId. Several other courts -- including a state court in New\nJersey -- have also referred to the close connection between\nthe Five Percent Nation and violence or gang-related\nactivity. See Allah v. Beyer, 1994 WL 549614, at *3 (D.N.J.\nMar. 29, 1994); Box v. Petsock, 697 F. Supp. 821, 831\n(M.D. Pa. 1987); Allah v. Department of Corr. , 742 A.2d 162,\n165 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999); Buford v. Goord, 686\nN.Y.S.2d 121, 122 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999) (referring to the\nFive Percent Nation as \"an unauthorized organization that\n\n                                16\n\fengages in gang-related activity both inside and outside of\nthe facility\"). We agree with these courts and therefore hold\nthat there is a rational connection between New Jersey's\nSTG regulations and the legitimate and neutral objective of\nmaintaining order and security within the prison system.6\n\nThe dissent disagrees with our evaluation of the first\nTurner factor primarily because the dissent is unwilling to\naccord any significant deference to the judgment of the\nresponsible New Jersey officials that the Five Percent\nNation presents a security threat within the state's\ncorrectional system. The dissent disparages the Holvey\nreport because Holvey's \"credentials consist largely of on-\nthe-job training.\" Dissent at 32. The dissent characterizes\nthe incidents of actual or planned violence recounted in the\nreport as merely \"anecdotal\" evidence and then diminishes\nthe significance of particular incidents on a variety of\ngrounds. Dissent at 32-33 n.9. For example, the dissent\ndescribes as merely a \"gathering\" an incident in which\nmembers of the Five Percent Nation congregated in a gym\nto protest their treatment by the authorities, and\ncorrectional officials received information that the Five\nPercenters were planning to \"take a cop.\" Id. Incidents in\nwhich Five Percenters attacked and seriously wounded\ncorrectional staff are dismissed as simply \"involving a single\nFPN member.\" Id. What the dissent seems to demand is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In fact, there is evidence in the record that the STG policy has been\neffective in reducing violence in prisons. As Investigator Holvey\ntestified\nduring his deposition: \"I can also say that since the opening of the\nSecurity Threat Group Management Unit on March 4th of 1998, there\nhave been no serious incidents, gang-related incidents, within the whole\nDepartment of Corrections. There's no question that it's a direct result\nof\nthe initiative of the Security Threat Group Management Unit.\" App. at\n259. According to Holvey, prior to the STG Policy,\"[e]very day there\nwould be some kind of gang-related incidents related to one of these five\ngangs [that had been designated as Security Threat Groups].\" Id. Howard\nBeyer, the Assistant Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections, also submitted an affidavit indicating that the program has\nbeen successful. See App. at 84 (\"The use of close custody units has\nproven successful in the maintenance of discipline, security, safety, and\nan orderly operation of correctional facilities in the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections and will continue to assist the administrators\nand management in the inmate population.\").\n\n                               17\n\feither (a) proof that the tenets of the Five Percent Nation\nrequire members to engage in violence7 or (b) hard\nstatistical proof that members of the Five Percent Nation\ncommit proportionally more acts of violence in New Jersey\nprisons than do members of other religions.8 Demanding\nproof of this stature before correctional officials can act to\nprevent gang violence is fundamentally inconsistent with\nTurner and would in all likelihood be paralyzing.\n\nB.\n\n1. We now consider the District Court's analysis of the\nsecond Turner factor. As noted, this factor requires a court\nto assess whether inmates retain alternative means of\nexercising the circumscribed right. See Turner , 482 U.S. at\n90; DeHart, 227 F.3d at 51. When assessing the availability\nof alternatives, the right in question must be viewed\n\"sensibly and expansively.\" DeHart, 227 F.3d at 53 (quoting\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 417 (1989)). Therefore,\nin a free exercise case, we must consider whether the\ninmate has \"alternative means of practicing his or her\nreligion generally, not whether [the] inmate has alternative\nmeans of engaging in [any] particular practice.\" Id. at 55.\nWe will first discuss the restrictions that the New Jersey\nPolicy imposed on the plaintiffs simply because they were\ndesignated as members of the Five Percent Nation; we will\nthen consider the additional restriction imposed as a result\nof their validation as core members.\n\n2. Ordinary members. In applying the second Turner\nfactor in a free exercise case, we must of course focus on\nthe beliefs of the inmate asserting the claim. It is obviously\nimpossible to determine whether a regulation leaves an\ninmate with alternative ways of practicing the inmate's\nreligion without identifying the religion's practices. The\nplaintiffs bore the burden of producing evidence of their\nbeliefs and practices. In order to do this, they submitted\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. See Dissent at 31 (demanding proof that \"membership in the Five\nPercent Nation carried with it a set of beliefs that each member acts\nupon to promote violence and disorder\" or proof that \"membership\nequates to an active commitment to violence\").\n\n8. See Dissent at 32-33.\n\n                               18\n\fthe declaration of G. Kalim, a member of the Five Percent\nNation and the editor of a newspaper called The Five\nPercenter. See App. 457-60. Mr. Kalim's declaration\nexplains the basic beliefs and practices of the Five Percent\nNation, and we have therefore closely examined Mr. Kalim's\ndeclaration to determine the degree to which the challenged\nSTG Policy restricts the plaintiffs' religious practices.\n\nMr. Kalim's declaration describes the Five Percent Nation\n(or The Nation of Gods and Earths, as he calls it) as a\nloosely structured group -- in his words, \"a group of people\nwho share a common way of life.\" App. 459. His declaration\ndoes not state that members of the group are required,\nexpected, or counseled to participate in or attend any rites\nor gatherings or to perform any acts of religious\nobservance. Indeed, his declaration states that\"[t]o become\na member . . . , all one need do is study the lessons and\naspire to live a righteous life.\" Id. at 459. His declaration\nmakes it clear that the group rejects belief in the\ntranscendent and instead focuses on human enlightenment\nand conduct as ends in themselves. According to Mr.\nKalim, the Five Percent Nation \"teach[es] man to stop\nlooking for a mystical God\" and \"emphasizes the individual,\nhuman freedom and choice.\" Id. at 458. He states that the\ngroup teaches people to attain \"knowledge and\nenlightenment,\" to have \"respect for society,\" and to eschew\nviolence and disavow \"white hatred.\" Id . He adds that the\ngroup attempts \"to train young individuals to better\nthemselves in the community\" and that the group's\n\"principal purpose is to teach our young self worth,\nresponsibility, and self love.\" Id. The group appears to\nbelieve that these goals can be achieved by understanding\nthe group's view of world history, see id., but it seems clear\nthat an understanding of this is viewed as a means to\nenlightenment and right behavior, not an end.\n\nBased on Mr. Kalim's declaration, it appears that one\ncentral practice of the Five Percent Nation is restricted by\nthe STG Policy provisions applicable to ordinary members,\nnamely, the ability to \"study the lessons.\" App. 459. As\nnoted, the Policy prohibits inmates from \"participating in\nany activity(ies) related to a security threat group\" or\npossessing the group's literature. See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-\n\n                               19\n\f4.1(.010), (.011). However, even the study of the Five\nPercent Nation's teachings is not completely prohibited. Mr.\nKalim's declaration states that the group's \"teachings\ninclude texts such as the Bible [and] the Koran.\"9 App. 458.\nWhile the STG Policy forbids possession of distinctively Five\nPercent Nation literature, it is undisputed that the Policy\nallows inmates to possess, study, and discuss the Bible and\nthe Koran. Accordingly, study of the Five Percent Nation's\nteachings is only partially restricted.\n\nThe STG Policy appears to leave ample room for all of the\nremaining activities mentioned in Mr. Kalim's declaration.\nCertainly nothing in the STG Policy restricts Five Percent\nNation members from discussing or seeking to achieve self-\nknowledge, self-respect, responsible conduct, or righteous\nliving. To be sure, the STG Policy restricts the ability of Five\nPercenters to achieve these things by following what the\ngroup may regard as the best avenue, i.e., by studying and\ndiscussing doctrines and materials distinctive to the Five\nPercent Nation. But alternative avenues clearly remain\nopen.\n\nIn sum, our examination of the second Turner factor in\nrelation to the plaintiffs' explanation of their beliefs leads us\nto the conclusion that, while the New Jersey STG policy\nundoubtedly imposes restrictions on the ability of rank-\nand-file Five Percenters to engage in activities related to the\ngroup, the Policy does not foreclose all alternative avenues\nof practice.\n\n3. Core members. Application of the second Turner\nfactor to \"core\" members presents an additional difficulty\nbecause the Policy requires core members assigned to the\nSTGMU to renounce \"affiliation\" with their STG as a\ncondition of returning to the general inmate population. See\nApp. at 248, 302-04, 443. If the STG Policy demanded that\ncore members of the Five Percent Nation renounce the\nbeliefs of the group, we could not say that the second\nTurner factor is satisfied. We do not, however, interpret the\nSTG Policy as demanding a renunciation of beliefs. (The\nPolicy does not, for example, require a core member to deny\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. As the plaintiffs put it in their brief, members of the group \"study\nthe\nwritings from the various recognized religions.\" Appellants' Br. at 14.\n\n                               20\n\fthe truth of the \"Supreme Mathematics.\") What it requires\ninstead is a promise not to associate with certain other\nprisoners while in prison.\n\nThe form that a core member must sign requires the core\nmember to renounce \"affiliation with all Security Threat\nGroups,\" App. 443, and a security threat group is defined\nby the Policy as \"[a] group of inmates . . . who may gather\ntogether regularly and informally . . . .\" Id . at 126. Thus,\nwhat is required is a renunciation of affiliation with a\nparticular group of inmates (those who belong to an STG),\nnot a renunciation of beliefs. In simpler terms, the Policy\nrequires the end of any form of gang membership or\nparticipation. In view of this interpretation of the STG\nPolicy, we conclude that even core members of the Five\nPercent Nation retain alternative avenues of practicing their\nreligion, namely, those previously discussed in connection\nwith ordinary members.\n\nC.\n\nWe agree with the District Court's analysis of Turner's\nthird prong. \"When accommodation of an asserted right will\nhave a significant `ripple effect' on fellow inmates or on\nprison staff, courts should be particularly deferential to the\ninformed discretion of corrections officials.\" Turner, 482\nU.S. at 90. The record, as noted, contains evidence that\nFive Percenters pose a security threat to prison officials and\nother inmates. Dist. Ct. Op. at 22. As the Fourth Circuit\nhas stated:\n\n       Prison administration often involves tough tradeoffs. In\n       the closed environment of a prison, greater liberties for\n       some may mean increased danger and intimidation for\n       others. Because increased freedom for the Five\n       Percenters would come \"only at the cost of significantly\n       less liberty and safety for everyone else, guards and\n       other prisoners alike,\" we are particularly reluctant to\n       interfere with the judgment of the [prison officials] in\n       this case.\n\nFive Percenters, 174 F.3d at 470 (quoting Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 92-93). Particularly in light of the highly deferential\n\n                               21\n\fstandard of review that applies here, we agree with the\nFourth Circuit and conclude that this factor is satisfied.\n\nD.\n\nWe also agree that Turner's fourth factor weighs in favor\nof the Policy. Turner does not impose a least-restrictive-\nalternative test. See Waterman, 183 F.3d at 219. Rather,\nour inquiry is whether there are alternatives that would\nimpose only \"de minimis cost to valid penological interests.\"\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 91.\n\nIn this case, the District Court considered alternatives to\nthe New Jersey system, such as toughening the showing\nneeded for STG designation, but concluded that these\nwould expose \"the general inmate population and the\ncorrectional facility staff to an increased risk of violence.\"\nDist. Ct. Op. at 23. The plaintiffs argue that the District\nCourt misunderstood their argument. See Appellants' Br. at\n32. They contend that the Department of Corrections\nshould not have designated \"an entire belief system,\" i.e.,\nthe Five Percent Nation, as an STG but instead should have\ndesignated only \"specific hierarchical `gangs' with members\nwho are Five Percenters.\" We disagree. We reiterate that our\ninquiry is not whether the state could have adopted a less\nrestrictive alternative but rather whether it could have\nadopted an alternative that imposed only \"de minimis cost\nto legitimate penological interests.\" Turner , 482 U.S. at 91.\nAs we have explained, the state had adequate grounds for\nconcluding that the Five Percent Nation presented a threat\nto prison order and security. The alternatives to which the\nplaintiffs point would have done less to mitigate this threat\nand thus would have had a more than de minimis impact\non the state's legitimate penological concerns. Therefore, we\nagree with the District Court that the final Turner factor\nsupports the Policy.\n\nE.\n\nWe have concluded that three of the four Turner factors\nweigh strongly in favor of the STG Policy. These factors are\nthe existence of a \"valid, rational connection\" to a legitimate\nand neutral governmental objective, the effect that\n\n                                22\n\faccommodating the plaintffs would have on other inmates,\nguards, and the allocation of prison resources generally,\nand the availability of alternative regulatory approaches\nthat would \"fully accommodate[ ] the prisoner's rights at de\nminimis cost to valid penological interests.\" The remaining\nfactor -- the availability of alternative means of exercising\nthe circumscribed right -- presents a closer question, but\nwe hold that it too is met. Accordingly, we affirm the\ndecision of the District Court that the challenged STG\nPolicy does not violate the plaintiffs' free exercise rights.\nAccord In re Long Term Admin. Segregation of Inmates\nDesignated as Five Percenters, 174 F.3d 464 (4th Cir.\n1999)(upholding similar South Carolina policy).\n\nIII.\n\nWe now consider the plaintiffs' argument that the\ndefendants violated their equal protection rights by treating\nthem less favorably than members of other religious\ngroups. See Appellants' Br. at 40. In making this argument,\nthe plaintiffs point to the Sunni Muslims, and claim that\nthis group, although similar to the Five Percent Nation, has\nbeen treated less harshly. According to the plaintiffs, the\nSunni Muslims have several of the characteristics of an\nSTG, such as a common history and purpose, an\norganizational structure, recognized leaders, customary\nsalutations, and a considerable size. They also note that\nHolvey admitted during his deposition that some Sunni\nMuslims had shown \"a propensity for violence . . . [o]n\noccasion\" and that some illegal or prohibited acts \"could be\nassociated with Sunni Muslims.\" See Appellants' Br. at 35-\n36. They also rely on Holvey's statement that the\"big\"\ndifference between the Sunni Muslims and the Five Percent\nNation is that the Sunnis practice a religion and the Five\nPercenters do not. See id. at 37.\n\nIn DeHart, our court, sitting en banc, held that when an\ninmate asserts an equal protection claim based on the\nallegedly disparate treatment of different religious groups,\nthe governing standard is whether the disparate treatment\nis \" `reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.' \"\n227 F.3d at 61 (citation omitted). That standard is met\nhere. While relying on one portion of Holvey's deposition,\n\n                               23\n\fthe plaintiffs do not mention another part of the deposition\nin which Holvey stated that the Sunni Muslims have a\nmuch lower propensity for violence than the Five\nPercenters. See App. 214. Moreover, while Holvey cited\nreligion as a major difference between the two groups,\nHolvey did not state that religion played any role in the\ndecision whether to designate either group as an STG. We\nnote that the STG Policy makes no reference to religion,\nand we are not aware of any other evidence in the record\nthat suggests that religion plays any role in STG\ndesignation decisions. In view of greater propensity for\nviolence demonstrated by members of the Five Percent\nNation, we hold that the group's designation as an STG\ndoes not violate equal protection.\n\nIV.\n\nThe plaintiffs' final argument is that the Department of\nCorrections violated their due process rights by failing to\nprovide any notice of the new regulations until the day of\nthe plaintiffs' transfer to the STGMU. The plaintiffs contend\nthat this deprived them of any opportunity to modify their\nbehavior to comply with the new regulations. See Reply\nBrief at 16-17. The District Court rejected this argument,\nconcluding that the plaintiffs were not deprived of a\nprotected liberty interest. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 26-28. We\nagree.\n\nTo succeed on their due process claim, the plaintiffs\nmust first demonstrate that they were deprived of a liberty\ninterest when they were transferred to the STGMU.\n\"Protected liberty . . . interests generally arise either from\nthe Due Process Clause or from state-created statutory\nentitlement.\" Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 143 (3d Cir.\n2000); see also Asquith v. Dep't of Corrections , 186 F.3d\n407, 409 (3d Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court has recognized\nthat \"[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement to\nwhich the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence\nimposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the\nConstitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself\nsubject an inmate's treatment by prison authorities to\njudicial oversight.\" Asquith, 186 F.3d at 410 (quoting Hewitt\nv. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 468 (1983)). Here, the plaintiffs\n\n                               24\n\fwere not subjected to confinement that exceeded the\nsentences imposed upon them or that otherwise violated\nthe Constitution, and therefore no liberty interest created\nby the Due Process Clause itself was impinged. See Hewitt,\n459 U.S. at 468 (\"It is plain that the transfer of an inmate\nto less amenable and more restrictive quarters for\nnonpunitive reasons is well within the terms of confinement\nordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence.\").\n\nThe defendants are also unable to demonstrate that they\nwere deprived of a state-created liberty interest. In Sandin\nv. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995), the Supreme Court set\nout the standard for determining whether a prisoner has\nbeen deprived of a state-created liberty interest. These\ninterests are \"generally limited to freedom from restraint\nwhich, while not exceeding the sentence in such an\nunexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due\nProcess Clause of its own force, . . . nonetheless imposes\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation\nto the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id.; see also Shoats,\n213 F.3d at 143; Asquith, 186 F.3d at 412. In ascertaining\nwhether something is an \"atypical and significant\"\nhardship, we must consider \"what a sentenced inmate may\nreasonably expect to encounter as a result of his or her\nconviction in accordance with due process of law.\" Asquith,\n186 F.3d at 412 (quoting Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703,\n706 & n.2 (3d Cir. 1997). Consequently, the focus of this\ninquiry should not be on the language of a particular\nregulation, but rather on the nature of the deprivation. See\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 481-82. Although inmates who are\ntransferred to the STGMU face additional restrictions, we\nhold that the transfer to the STGMU does not impose an\natypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life. See Griffin, 112 F.3d at 706-08 (15\nmonths in administrative segregation not atypical and\nsignificant hardship); see also, e.g., Jones v. Baker, 155\nF.3d 810, 813 (6th Cir. 1998)(confinement in administrative\nsegregation for two and one-half years is not \"atypical and\nsignificant\" hardship); Pichardo v. Kinker , 73 F.3d 612, 613\n(5th Cir. 1996)(rejecting as frivolous a claim that\nclassification as gang member and placement in\nadministrative segregation unit deprived inmate of a\nprotected liberty interest). Thus, the plaintiffs lack a\n\n                               25\n\fprotected liberty interest and their due process claim must\nfail. In addition, even if the plaintiffs had been deprived of\na protected liberty interest, the procedures used in\ndetermining whether an inmate is a core STG member\nsatisfy procedural due process. See Shoats, 213 F.3d at\n144-47. As noted, an inmate who is identified as a core\nSTG member receives notice and a hearing at which the\ninmate may be heard. The inmate may appeal an adverse\ndecision to the administrator of the prison and may obtain\njudicial review in state court. These procedures satisfy due\nprocess. Id. As for the plaintiffs' complaint that they were\nidentified as core members based on conduct that occurred\nbefore the STG Policy was promulgated, we held in Shoats\nthat due process is not violated by placing an inmate in\nadministrative custody based on past conduct that\nfurnishes a basis for predicting that the inmate will engage\nin future acts of violence if corrective measures are not\ntaken. Id. at 146-47.\n\nV.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, we affirm the decision\nof the District Court.\n\n                               26\n\fRENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nI disagree with the reasoning of, and result reached by,\nboth the District Court and the majority. I think we are\nfaced here with an issue of much greater import, both\npractically and analytically, than mere permissible prison\nregulation. While some measure of deference is certainly to\nbe afforded to prison authorities, nonetheless we must\nmake certain that we do not convert the Turner v. Safley\ntest into a rubber stamp. Here, the policy at issue has been\napplied so as to target a religious group for different\ntreatment, including a blanket denial of First Amendment\nrights.1 We must deal with this wholesale treatment of\nmembers of a religious group in a careful manner.\n\nAppellants urge us to address the following question:\nWhen the prison adopts a policy and then targets members\nof one religion and imposes significant burdens on-- even\nperhaps totally impedes -- their religious exercise, based\nsolely on the prisoners' religious affiliation, does not the\nfirst prong of the Turner v. Safley test require that the\nviolence of the group and the members subjected to this\ntreatment be clearly proven in order for such group\ntreatment to be \"reasonably related\" to the legitimate goal?2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. While providing a detailed description of the procedures provided by\nthe STG policy, the majority does not reference the extensive restrictions\nimposed on Appellants. According to the STG policy, restrictions on\ninmates in Phase 1 of the program include: strip-searches each time they\nleave or return to their cells; a total of five hours per week out of\ntheir\ncells; a shower or shave only every third day; only a single, non-contact\nvisit each month; only one monitored phone call per week; prohibition on\ncorrespondence with any other inmate, including incarcerated family\nmembers; all meals eaten in cells; and, no access to regular prison\nprograms. App. at A138-42, 148. Further, the Policy instructs that\n\"[t]here is a `Zero Tolerance' level for Security Threat Group activity\nwithin the Department's correctional facility(ies).\" App. at A152.\nExamples of such activities include: \"Possession of Security Threat\nGroup literature such as lessons, membership lists, and artwork;\nPossession of Security Threat Group paraphernalia such as beads,\nartwork, medallions, and clothing articles; . . . Participation in\nSecurity\nThreat Group related . . . meetings, gatherings, . .. and events . . . .\"\nApp. at A152.\n\n2. One could quibble with whether the restrictions are on all members,\nbecause the close custody only applies to those determined to be \"core\n\n                               27\n\fTwo key facts are present here that, I submit, warrant\nthat we proceed with extra caution. First, the policy is being\napplied based on membership in a group, specifically, in a\nreligious group; the individual conduct that results in the\npurported basis for the imposition of the restriction is not\nviolent or threatening activity, but, rather, is religious\nobservance essentially protected by the First Amendment.\nSecond, the cognitive \"leap\" from the fact of membership in\na religion to the validity of a concern about security is not\nan automatic one, not \"common sense,\" and we must\nrequire a showing of the proper fit between membership in\nthe religious group and valid security concerns.\n\nThe confluence of these two factors should cause us to\npause and consider the appropriate test, and the applicable\nevidentiary burden. We have noted that the first prong of\nTurner is subject to the test of a \"means-end fit,\" which we\nhave described as follows:\n\n       We may conclude that the statute bears no \"valid,\n       rational connection\" to rehabilitation if \"the logical\n       connection between the [statute] and the asserted goal\n       is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or\n       irrational.\"\n\nWaterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 215 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90 (1987). We went\non to explain: \"This standard is similar to rational-basis\nreview, under which a statutory classification can be\ndeclared unconstitutional only where the relationship of the\nclassification to its asserted goal is `so attenuated as to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nmembers.\" However, given that mere possession of materials about FPN\n(the sole basis for Fraise's designation) raises an individual to \"core\nmember\" status and the fact that these individuals will only be released\nfrom close custody upon repudiation of the religion, together with the\nweak case against Appellants, points to the conclusion that all FPN\nbelievers who either read or express in any fashion the teachings of the\nFive Percent Nation, are clearly at risk and subject to restrictive\ncustody.\nInterestingly, it has been noted that Five Percenters read and learn,\nrather than pray, as their religious observance, and this goes to the\nessence of what is being denied here. See Self-Allah v. Annucci, No. 97-\nCV-607(H), 1999 WL 299310, * 2 (W.D.N.Y. 1999) (\"Five Percenters are\nobligated to study and learn the lessons of the Five Percent Nation of\nIslam.\").\n\n                               28\n\frender the distinction arbitrary or irrational.' The\nlegislature's judgment therefore need not be perfect, just\nrational.\" Id. (citations omitted).\n\nBut what about the situation where the prison regulation\ntargets a specific religious group -- where it does not\nmerely burden the exercise of religion, but, rather,\neffectively singles out members of a certain religious group\nfor different treatment and denial of free exercise rights?3 I\nsuggest that in such a situation we should require an even\n\"closer fit\" between the religious group's classification and\nthe state's proffered security interests.\n\nThis unique aspect of this case has not been fully\nexplored by the parties, but it is nonetheless troubling.\nDoes it make any difference that the group targeted is a\nreligion and that \"core\" membership is the determining\nfactor for imposition of restrictions? Is this not more\ninsidious than a ban on certain conduct or specific activity\nthat happens to have an impact on one's religious beliefs or\nexercise? Laws targeting religious beliefs are clearly suspect;4\nand, the right to religious freedom is not to be surrendered\nat the prison door. See O'Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342,\n348 (1987).\n\nWhen applying the Turner test in a case placing harsh\nrestrictions upon inmates with certain religious beliefs, I\nproffer that we should indeed require a \"tight\" or \"closer\" fit\nbetween the correctional system's admittedly legitimate\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. In order to be released from the STGMU, inmates must sign a \"Letter\nof Intention\" expressing their intention \"to renounce formally and in\nspirit affiliation with all Security Threat Groups.\" App. at A443.\n\n4. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533\n(1993) (\"[A] law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible\n. . . .\"); McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618, 626 (1978) (\"The Free Exercise\nClause categorically prohibits government from regulating, prohibiting,\nor rewarding religious beliefs as such.\"); Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S.\n488, 495 (1961) (\"We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor\nthe Federal Government can constitutionally force a person `to profess a\nbelief or disbelief in any religion.\"); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S.\n296, 304 (1940) (\"In every case the power to regulate must be so\nexercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the\nprotected freedom.\").\n\n                                29\n\finterest and an inmate's beliefs. The Supreme Court has\nnot indicated that the Turner test must be a rigid one and\nhas in fact referenced with approval the concept that it\nwould be reasonable to require a closer \"fit\" in certain\ninstances, for example, where the threat to the government\ninterest is not as great.5 I suggest that a closer fit might be\nrequired when the inmate's interest -- his religious beliefs\n-- is so significant and the restrictions are so great.\n\nIn Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir.\n1999), we found a rational relationship where the\nauthorities denied prisoners the right to read pornographic\nmaterials. Testimony was presented by two different\npsychologists to the effect that pornographic material would\nthwart the effectiveness of the treatment being given to the\nprisoners -- who were all sex offenders who had exhibited\n\"repetitive and compulsive\" behavior. The prison authorities\nalso referred the court to a considerable body of research\nsupporting this view. We upheld the regulation and noted\nthat, there, we probably would not have needed the expert\nopinions because \" `common sense tells us that prisoners\nare more likely to develop the now-missing self-control and\nrespect for others if prevented from poring over pictures\nthat are themselves degrading and disrespectful.' \"\nWaterman, 183 F.3d at 217 (quoting Amatel v. Reno, 156\nF.3d 192, 199 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. In Abbott, the Supreme Court noted that where \"the nature of the\nasserted governmental interest is such as to require a lesser degree of\ncase-by-case discretion, a closer fit between the regulation and the\npurpose it serves may safely be required.\" Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S.\n401, 411-12 (1989) (discussing and overruling Procunier v. Martinez, 416\nU.S. 396 (1974)). The Supreme Court explained that the rejection of the\nregulation in Martinez was based on the Court's \"recognition that the\nregulated activity centrally at issue in that case-- outgoing personal\ncorrespondence from prisoners -- did not, by its very nature, pose a\nserious threat to prison order and security.\" Id. at 411. The Court\nclarified: \"We do not believe that Martinez should, or need, be read as\nsubjecting the decisions of prison officials to a strict `least\nrestrictive\nmeans' test.\" Abbott, 490 U.S. at 411. The Court overruled Martinez as\nfar as it suggested a legal distinction between incoming correspondence\nfrom prisoners and incoming correspondence from nonprisoners. Id. at\n413-14.\n\n                               30\n\fHowever, this reasoning does not apply here. There, we\napproved of a ban on certain literature based on specific\nobjective criteria demonstrably consistent with legitimate\npenological objectives; here, we are faced with a round-up\nof all members of a purportedly violent religion so that they\ncan be subjected to religious \"detox\" in the name of\nsecurity. I submit that if prison authorities are to be\npermitted to target and categorize a certain religion so as to\nseverely circumscribe First Amendment rights, based solely\non membership in the religion, we should require that the\nfirst prong of the Turner v. Safley test be satisfied only by,\nat a minimum, a close fit between the targeted religion and\nproblem sought to be avoided, here, to \"minimize the\noccurrence of assaults on staff and inmates,\" and\nevidentiary requirements that leave no room for doubt. To\nrequire any less is to permit -- perhaps encourage--\nprofiling: that is, the arbitrary attribution of certain\ncharacteristics to a group and, therefore, members of that\ngroup, resulting in denial of rights and different,\ndisadvantaged treatment.\n\nFurther, it would be one thing if the prisons were only\n\"profiling\" security threat groups that are clearly violent\n\"gangs;\" but, here, the District Court assumed that the Five\nPercent Nation was a religion.6 The evidence before the\nDistrict Court was woefully lacking that membership in the\nFive Percent Nation carried with it a set of beliefs that each\nmember acts upon to promote violence and disorder. 7 The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. This case would present different issues had the District Court not\nassumed that the Five Percent Nation was a religion. The Court would\nhave been required to determine whether FPN would be considered a\nreligion, and therefore accorded the protections provided by the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. As this issue is not before us,\nand was not before the District Court, we need not decide whether the\nFPN would satisfy these requirements, but only stress that non-\ntraditional belief systems found to be religious in nature will be\nafforded\nthe same protections as traditional ones. See Africa v. Pennsylvania, 662\nF.2d 1025, 1031-32 (3d Cir. 1981) (setting forth three indicia to be used\nin determining whether a \"religion\" is at issue).\n\n7. While the FPN tenets may be racial in tone, racism is not the same as\nviolence. See McCabe v. Arave, 827 F.2d 634, 638 (9th Cir. 1987)\n(\"[P]rison authorities have no legitimate penological interest in\nexcluding\n\n                               31\n\fDistrict Court relied on a report prepared by Ronald Holvey,\nan eighteen-year veteran employee of the New Jersey\ncorrectional system. His credentials consist largely of on-\nthe-job training,8 and his report includes no proof of what,\nI suggest, is required -- namely, that membership equates\nto an active commitment to violence. Instead, the report is\nanecdotal, recounting, as the Appellees even note in their\nbrief, \"twelve violent or threateningly violent incidents\ninvolving a member or members of the Five Percent Nation\"\nduring a seven year period. Appellees' Brief, p. 14. There is\nno proof of violent gang activity involving FPN members in\nNew Jersey prisons, and none of the incidents links the\nconduct to the members' religious beliefs.9 Mr. Holvey cites\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nreligious books from the prison library merely because they contain\nracist views. Courts have repeatedly held that prisons may not ban all\nreligious literature that reflects racism.\"); Stefanow v. McFadden, 103\nF.3d 1466, 1472-73 (9th Cir. 1996) (applying Turner and observing that\n\"[m]erely `advocating racial purity' is insufficient to justify\nconfiscati[ng]\"\nreligious material, and upholding the confiscation of the book\nChristianities Ancient Enemy because it directly advocates violence by\nissuing an explicit \"call to arms for white Christians to fight back in `a\nwar for survival' \"); Murphy v. Missouri Dep't of Corrs., 814 F.2d 1252,\n1257 (8th Cir. 1987) (holding that restriction of inmate access to racist\nreligious materials \"must be limited to those materials that advocate\nviolence or that are so racially inflammatory as to be reasonably likely\nto\ncause violence at the prison\"); Aikens v. Jenkins, 534 F.2d 751, 756-57\n(7th Cir. 1976) (striking down a regulation banning all racist periodicals\nin prison because the regulation \"is not narrow enough to reach only\nthat material which encourages violence, and invites prison officials to\napply their own personal prejudices and opinions as standards\").\n\n8. Holvey has eighteen years of experience in corrections employment,\nincluding service as a corrections officer. Appellees note that he belongs\nto several national or regional law enforcement or intelligence\norganizations, including the National Major Gang Task Force, and that\nhe has assisted several states and organizations, including the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, with the process of identifying security threat\ngroups and members as well as training. Holvey Deposition, App. at\nA249-50, 254-58.\n\n9. The majority characterizes the Holvey Report as reporting a \"string of\nincidents\" and as citing \"numerous instances of actual or planned\nviolence involving Five Percenters in New Jersey correctional facilities\n\n                               32\n\fabsolutely no statistics with respect to crimes by Five\nPercent Nation members, as compared to crimes by other\ngroups. In fact, in pointing out that one in seven prison\ninmates is a member of the Five Percent Nation, the paucity\nof violent incidents purported to be linked to FPN members\nactually casts doubt on the violent nature of the group. No\nshowing was made that there was a greater proportion of\nviolence by FPN members than by groups of other kinds,\nsuch as Christians, Jews, or Muslims. The evidence is\nprobative only of the assertion that there are several\nmembers of the FPN that have committed violent or unruly\nacts.\n\nNowhere in their brief do Appellees counter, let alone\npoint to evidence that would meet, Appellants' statement\nthat the Five Percent Nation's \"teaching does not in any\nway advocate or encourage violence or disorderliness.\"10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbetween August 1990 and July 1997.\" Maj. at 15. In reality, a careful\nscrutiny of the report and corresponding attachments reveals very little\nevidence of planned or actual violence by FPN members, let alone by the\nFive Percent Nation as a group. In his report, Holvey lists twelve\n\"Specific\nViolent Acts/Intended Acts of Violence/Specific Illegal or Prohibited\nActs.\" App. at A342-43. Of this twelve, three do not even involve the New\nJersey correctional facilities, App. at A402-03, 404-11, and two more\nrelate to New Jersey youth facilities -- one involving a gathering of\napproximately 50 FPN and NETA members, and the other consisting of\na fight including some believed to be FPN members. App. at SA41-46. Of\nthe remaining seven incidents there were two gatherings, App. at SA24-\n29, A412, and three incidents involving a single FPN member. App. at\nSA5-20, SA48-56. There was only one report of a series of altercations\nallegedly involving more than one FPN member along with several Sunni\nMuslims. App. at SA37-39. And one letter allegedly from an FPN member\nthreatening violence against prison guards. SA21. None of these\nincidents reflects activity atypical of aggressive behavior one would\nanticipate in a prison setting. The incidents cited in the report do not\ndemonstrate the FPN's violent tendencies as a group or gang in the New\nJersey prison system. The report conflates incidents from other places,\nas well as violence by other inmates where a FPN member may have\nbeen tangentially involved, with incidents involving the FPN as a group.\n\n10. Moreover, it should be noted that Appellees in their brief really fail\nto\naddress the underlying \"disconnect\" that I perceive, but urge instead\nthat the threat group policy is related to a legitimate goal. Appellants\nconcede this, but argue that the designation of the Five Percent Nation\nis not so related because there is no valid connection in the New Jersey\nprison system between the Five Percent Nation and security concerns.\n\n                               33\n\fApp. Br. at 22. Rather, the District Court and the majority\nallude to the findings of other courts to the effect that the\nFive Percent Nation fosters violence. Those courts based\ntheir rulings on evidence before them, involving the facts\npresented to them. The District Court here should demand\nno less, but only the Holvey report was presented and relied\nupon. There is no basis for the District Court to take\njudicial notice of the evidence before other courts.\n\nFurther, most of the decisions referenced by the District\nCourt and the majority, in addition to being non-\nprecedential, are either distinguishable or not relevant.11 In\nthe most persuasive and well-reasoned opinion cited, Self-\nAllah v. Annucci, No. 97-CV-607(H), 1999 WL 299310, *2\n(W.D.N.Y. 1999), the issue is quite different -- whether the\ncourt would enjoin the prison authorities' confiscation of\nthe prisoners' copies of The Five Percenter. The injunction\nwas denied, based upon extensive testimony and evidence\npresented with respect to the violent propensity of the Five\nPercenters in the New York system. Many witnesses\ntestified (including Mr. Holvey) in favor of the relationship\nbetween the gang violence in the system and the group. The\nCourt concluded:\n\n       Plaintiff has demonstrated that Five Percenterism, in\n       its pure, uncorrupted form, represents a system of\n       beliefs which, outside the prison context, does not\n       advocate or promote violence. However, the testimony\n       presented by defendants showed a clear relationship\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. See Allah v.

The majority is misguided to suggest that this\nsupports their conclusion \"that inmates belonging to the\nFive Percent Nation present a serious security threat.\" Maj.\nat 16 (emphasis added). There is a very important\ndifference between a threat posed by \"belonging\" to a\nreligion and that allegedly posed by the circulation of the\ngroup's literature.\n\nIn the only other court of appeals case involving a similar\nthreat group policy, In re Long Term Admin. Segregation of\nInmates Designated as Five Percenters, 174 F.3d 464 (4th\nCir. 1999) [hereinafter Five Percenters], the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit noted its jurisprudence as\nrequiring \"some minimally rational relationship,\" id. at 468,\nand emphasized the Supreme Court's jurisprudence calling\nfor deference, especially when dealing with state\ncorrectional institutions and the preservation of order\ntherein. Id. at 469 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 85, and Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979)). The court noted\n\"ample evidence in the records\" supporting the\nreasonableness of the conclusion that they posed a threat\nto prison security, including incidents in 1992, 1993, and\nthree specific incidents in 1995, and referenced at least one\nincident report in which it was stated that \" `these five\ninmates acted as a group,' that they `felt as if they were\nacting in a manner acceptable to the[ir] religious beliefs,'\nand that they `spoke of more violence to come.' \" Id. at 466.\nThe prisoners in that case were not denied their religious\nliterature (this claim had been settled), and the court gave\ngreat deference to the prison system's decision as\n\"manifestly a rational action.\" Id. at 470. The court went on\nto explain:\n\n       The question is not whether [the South Carolina\n       Department of Corrections (\"SCDC\") director's]\n       conclusion was indisputably correct, but whether his\n       conclusion was rational and therefore entitled to\n       deference. Confronted with multiple reports of an\n       identifiable group whose members not only threatened\n       but had actually committed serious, violent acts in the\n       SCDC system and elsewhere, [SCDC Director's]\n\n                               35\n\f       decision to designate the Five Percenters as an STG\n       was manifestly a rational action.\n\nId. at 470 (citation omitted). It explained:\"Allowing prison\nofficials to act only after a demonstration of individual\ndangerousness would deprive them of the all-important\noption of prevention. The threat of violence here was a\ngroup threat, and prison administrators were entitled to\naddress it in those terms.\" Id. at 466.\n\nWhile I think the test of \"minimally\" rational relationship\nhas not been employed by our court and chips away at\nTurner, I cannot argue with the result reached in that case.12\nThe group had been identified based on clear, repeated past\ngroup violent conduct, attributable to its set of beliefs. But\nwe have no such evidentiary record here. Accordingly, not\nonly is the purported relationship more tenuous but the\ngenuineness of the security threat is more remote as well.\nAdditionally, the restrictions there did not include denial of\nliterature, which is at the heart of the FPN's exercise. In the\ncase before us, the implications are much more far-\nreaching and the evidence much less relevant and\nconvincing. There has been no showing of the \"means-end\nfit\" to satisfy the wholesale denial of religious freedom and\nexercise.\n\nIf the inquiry does not satisfy the first prong of Turner,\nwhich we have explained received the greatest weight, the\nprison's action must fail. See Shaw v. Murphy , 532 U.S.\n223, 121 S. Ct. 1475, 1479 (2001) (\"If the connection\nbetween the regulation and the asserted goal is`arbitrary or\nirrational,' then the regulation fails, irrespective of whether\nthe other factors tilt in its favor.\"). Therefore, we need not\nreach the other prongs. However, I cannot help but note my\ndisagreement with the ease with which the majority\ndispenses with the second and third prong as well. The\nanswer to the \"alternate means\" prong is really self-evident\n-- the prison authorities' course of \"treatment\" is designed\nto cause the FPN adherent to give up his faith, not permit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. In Shaw v. Murphy, Justice Thomas referred to rebutting the\npresumption of rationality. However, that language was dicta and I\nsuggest did not lower the standard of Turner , nor did it require the\nburden of proof to fall on the plaintiff.\n\n                               36\n\fhim to practice it. This is much different than the facts\nbefore the Fourth Circuit in Five Percenters, where the\ncourt found that because the prisoners could still pray, fast\nand study religious materials, the \"alternate means\" test\nwas satisfied, and the proven violence satisfied the\"no\nready alternatives\" prong. In the course of this treatment,\nthe FPN member is barred from the teachings, which are at\nthe heart of the Five Percent Nation religious experience.\nFurthermore, to be released from close custody he must\npromise to never again affiliate with FPN. Thus, the desired\nresult of the treatment is to eradicate the belief. It is\ndifficult to see how, realistically, there are \"alternate\nmeans\" here.\n\nIn connection with the \"impact of the accommodation on\nothers\" prong, here, the premise that potential violence\ncannot be accommodated assumes the very violence that I\nsuggest has not been shown. I would suggest that the\nabsence of a showing of the violent connection as discussed\nabove undermines the findings of the District Court and the\nmajority with respect to this prong as well.\n\nWe have in this country a rich tradition of protecting\nindividual rights, including the rights of prisoners. We have\nexplained that \"the Supreme Court has made clear that\n`convicted prisoners do not forfeit all constitutional\nprotections by reason of their conviction and confinement\nin prison' \" DeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 50 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(en banc) (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545\n(1979)). Furthermore, \" `Inmates clearly retain protections\nafforded by the First Amendment, . . . including its directive\nthat no law shall prohibit the free exercise of religion.\" Id.\n(quoting O'Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348 (1987)). At\nthe same time, we have a fast-developing body of law to the\neffect that, while inmates do not shed their constitutional\nprotections at the jailhouse door, nonetheless \"a prison\ninmate `retains [only] those rights that are not inconsistent\nwith his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate\npenological objectives of the corrections system,' \" id. at 51\n(quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974)), and\n\"the constitutional rights that prisoners possess are more\nlimited in scope than the constitutional rights held by\nindividuals in society at large.\" Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S.\n223, 229 (2001).\n\n                               37\n\fWe have, at times, overreacted in response to perceived\ncharacteristics of groups thought to be dangerous to our\nsecurity or way of life and condemned individuals based on\ngroup membership. See, e.g., Garner v. Bd. of Pub. Works,\n341 U.S. 716 (1951) (upholding requirement that all city\nemployees must disclose membership to the Communist\nparty and swear an oath of loyalty); Korematsu v. United\nStates, 323 U.S. 214 (1944) (affirming the constitutionality\nof \"excluding\" people of Japanese descent from the West\nCoast during World War II). Only later, when we have\nviewed these reactions with some perspective, have we\nacknowledged that the wholesale treatment of certain\ngroups was not consistent with the basic tenets of our\ndemocracy. Here, similarly, it seems as though there is a\nrush to brand the Five Percent Nation as a \"violent\"\nreligious sect. But, who is next? Would it be the Sunni\nMuslims, whose tenets, Appellants argue, are similar?\nWould it be the Nation of Islam, viewed by some as racist?\nWhile these may be inmates, and prisoners, they are\nnonetheless people. We should therefore be concerned, and\nbe careful in labeling and judging them based solely on\nmembership in a religious group.\n\nIf membership in such groups can objectively be shown,\nupon close scrutiny, to be equated to posing a real threat\nof violence in the prison setting, then treatment of such\ngroup members in wholesale fashion, even though it\ndeprives them of their constitutional rights, would be\nconsistent with legitimate penological objectives, and would\nbe permissible. Otherwise, such discriminatory treatment\ntreads impermissibly on their constitutional rights.\n\nI would reverse the District Court's ruling and deny\ndefendant's motion for summary judgment for lack of a\nshowing that the first prong of the Turner v. Safley test has\nbeen satisfied.13\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. I see no need to address Appellants' equal protection or due\nprocess claims. I agree with the majority that we apply the same Turner\nanalysis to Appellants' equal protection claim that we did to their First\nAmendment claims, and my concerns with the majority's Turner analysis\ncarries over to the equal protection analysis as well. On the other hand,\nI will not provide my own reasoning regarding Appellants' due process\nclaim, as I agree with that provided by the majority.\n\n                               38\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               39\n\f",

S 1983 challenging the\nconstitutionality as applied to them of a New Jersey prison\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The Honorable William W Schwarzer, United States District Court for\nthe Northern District Court of California, sitting by designation.\n\n                                  2\n\fpolicy that allows correctional officials to designate\n\"security threat groups\" (\"STGs) and transfer core members\nof these groups to a special unit. Once in this unit, core\nmembers must participate in a behavior modification\nprogram before returning to the general prison population.\nThe plaintiffs asserted that these regulations violate\nnumerous constitutional provisions, including the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal\nProtection and Due Process Clauses. The District Court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, who\nare New Jersey prison officials. We affirm.\n\nI.\n\nA.\n\nFaced with increasing gang violence in correctional\nfacilities throughout the state, the New Jersey Department\nof Corrections promulgated a policy in 1998 that was\ndesigned to isolate and rehabilitate gang members. Under\nthis policy, prison officials can designate STGs and transfer\nthe \"core\" members of these groups to the\"Security Threat\nGroup Management Unit\" (\"STGMU\"). The goal of this policy\nis to \"limit Security Threat Group activities and, in doing\nso, minimize the occurrence of assaults on staff and\ninmates.\" App. 125.\n\nThe specifics of this policy were outlined in a Department\nof Corrections document entitled \"Policy Statement for the\nManagement of Security Threat Group Members\" (\"STG\nPolicy\"). See App. at 125-52. Related regulations were also\nissued.\n\nThe STG Policy defines an STG as:\n\n       A group of inmates, designated by the Commissioner,\n       who may gather together regularly and informally,\n       possessing common characteristics, interests and goals\n       which serve to distinguish the group or group members\n       from other inmate groups or other inmates and which,\n       as a discrete entity, poses a threat to the safety of staff,\n       other inmates, the community, and/or damages to, or\n       destruction of property, and/or interrupting the safe,\n\n                                3\n\f       secure and orderly operation of the correctional\n       facility(ies).\n\nApp. 126. STGs are officially designated by the\nCommissioner based on recommendations from the\nIntelligence Section of the Central Office Internal Affairs\nUnit (\"Intelligence Section\") of the Department of\nCorrections. See id. at 128.\n\nThe STG Policy lists several factors that the Intelligence\nSection takes into account in considering whether a group\nshould be designated as an STG. See id. These include the\nfollowing characteristics of the group: (1) its history and\npurpose; (2) its organizational structure; (3) the propensity\nfor violence of the group and its members; (4) actual or\nplanned acts of violence reasonably attributable to the\ngroup; (5) other illegal or prohibited acts reasonably\nattributable to the group; (6) the \"[d]emographics of the\ngroup,\" including its size, location, and pattern of\nexpansion or decline; and (7) the degree of threat that the\ngroup poses. See App. 128. Designation of a group as an\nSTG has the effect of prohibiting inmates from engaging in\nactivities related to the group. Under prison regulations, it\nis a serious infraction for an inmate to \"participat[e] in an\nactivity related to a security threat group,\" N.J.A.C. 10A:4-\n4.1(.010), or to \"possess[ ] or exhibit[ ] anything related to a\nsecurity threat group.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(.011). It is also a\nserious infraction for an inmate to attempt to do either of\nthe above. See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(.803).\n\nThe STG Policy lists criteria to be considered in\ndetermining whether a particular inmate should be\nclassified as an STG member. These include: (1) an\ninmate's acknowledgment of membership; (2) the presence\nof an STG tattoo; (3) the possession of STG paraphernalia;\n(4) information from an outside agency; (5) information\nfrom an Internal Affairs report or investigation; (6)\ncorrespondence from other inmates or outside contacts; (7)\nSTG photographs; and (8) any other factors that suggest\nthat the inmate is involved in STG activities2 or is an STG\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Policy Statement defines \"Security Threat Group Activities\" as:\n\n       activities or actions of an inmate which relate either directly or\n       indirectly to goals of a Security Threat Group. These activities\n\n                               4\n\fmember. See App. 129. Any inmate who satisfies two of\nthese criteria may be designated as an STG member.\n\nAn inmate may be identified as a \"core\" member of an\nSTG if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied:\n\n       1. The inmate has a [Department of Corrections]\n       documented status as a recognized Security Threat\n       Group leader;\n\n       2. The inmate has taken a [Department of\n       Corrections] documented part/role in an activity,\n       behavior or involvement in an event/incident\n       associated with a Security Threat Group;\n\n       3. The inmate's [Department of Corrections]\n       documented activities, behavior or involvement in an\n       event/incident whether associated with a Security\n       Threat Group or not, poses a threat to the safety of\n       staff, other inmates, or the community; cause damages\n       to, or destruction of property; cause the interruption of\n       the safe, secure and orderly operation of the\n       correctional facilities;\n\n       4. The inmate has been identified as a Security Threat\n       Group Member and has been found guilty of a\n       prohibited act which is an asterisk offence [sic] in\n       accordance with N.J.A.C. 10A:4 \"Inmate Disciple\"\n       whether or not this offense was related to a Security\n       Threat Group's activities or not.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       include but are not limited to; Possession of Security Threat Group\n       literature such as lessons, membership lists, manuals and artwork;\n       Possession of Security Threat Group paraphernalia such as, beads,\n       artwork, medallions and clothing articles; Observation by staff of\n       known Security Threat Group hand-signs and/or signals;\n       Participation in Security Threat Group related assaults,\n       disturbances, meetings, gatherings, incidents and events; Sending\n       or receiving Security Threat Group related correspondence;\n       Recruiting of other inmates to join a Security Threat Group.\n\nApp. at 126.\n\n3. The term \"asterisk offense\" designates a grade of inmate infraction. It\nis defined as \"a prohibited act preceded by a number and an asterisk\nthat is considered the most serious and results in the most severe\nsanction(s).\" N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.2.\n\n                               5\n\fId. at 130.\n\nIf an inmate is identified as a core member, the inmate is\ntransferred to the STGMU and placed in \"Pre-Hearing\nSecurity Threat Group Management Unit\" status. App. 131.\nAt this point, the inmate is provided with written notice\nthat he or she is being considered for placement in the\nSTGMU and is given at least 48 hours' notice of the hearing\nbefore the STGMU Hearing Committee. Id. At the hearing,\nthe inmate may appear in person or may present his or her\ncase through a representative or through written\nsubmissions. Id. at 132. The STGMU Hearing Committee\nmay validate the assignment of the inmate to the STGMU if\nthe evidence supports a finding that the inmate is an STG\nmember, has taken an active role in STG activities, and\nsatisfies one of the four previously mentioned conditions.\nId. at 133. If the STGMU Hearing Committee assigns the\ninmate to the STGMU, the inmate may appeal to the\nadministrator of the prison. Id. The administrator's decision\nmay then be challenged in state court.\n\nAn inmate assigned to the STGMU remains in maximum\ncustody until the inmate successfully completes a three-\nphase behavior modification and education program. App.\n135. This program \"is designed to give the inmate the\ninsight and tools necessary to interact appropriately,\nwithout the perceived need of membership in a Security\nThreat Group.\" Id. The inmate is taught anger\nmanagement, conflict resolution, and social interactive\nskills that feature alternatives to violence. Id . The\nCommittee monitors the inmate's progress and determines\nwhether the inmate should advance to the next phase and\neventually return to the general prison population. Id. In\norder to complete the program and return to the general\nprison population, an inmate must sign a form renouncing\naffiliation with all STGs. See App. at 248, 302-04, 443.\n\nB.\n\nThe Five Percent Nation originated in New York City in\nthe 1960s after its leader, Clarence Smith (also known as\nClarence 13X and Father Allah), broke away from the\nNation of Islam. The group's name derives from its belief in\n\n                                6\n\f\"Supreme Mathematics,\" which breaks down the population\nof the world into three groups: the Ten Percent, the Eighty-\nFive Percent, and the Five Percent.\n\nThe Ten Percent are those who have subjugated most of\nthe world. They include white people and others who\npropagate the myth of a nonexistent \"mystery God.\"4 The\nTen Percent are described as follows in a Five Percent\nNation text:\n\n       [The 10% are] the rich, slave makers of the poor. Who\n       teach[ ] the poor lies to believe that the Almighty true\n       and living God is a spook and cannot be seen by the\n       physical eye, otherwise known as the blood suckers of\n       the poor.\n\nApp. 361.\n\nThe Eighty-Five Percent are those who are subjugated\nand deceived. They \"worship what they know not, .. . are\neasily led in the wrong direction but [are] hard to lead in\nthe right direction.\" App. 361.\n\nFinally, the Five Percent are African Americans who have\nachieved self-knowledge. App. 361. They \"know the black\nman's true nature and that God is within man himself.\"\nAppellants' Br. at 14. Male members of the group are\nreferred to as \"Gods,\" female members are called \"Earths,\"\nand the group often refers to itself as \"The Nation of Gods\nand Earths.\" See App. 458. A declaration of a member\nexplains:\n\n        . . . The Nation of Gods and Earths emphasizes the\n       individual, human freedom and choice.\n\n        . . . Our teachings include texts such as the Bible,\n       the Koran, \"The 120 Degrees,\" \"Supreme Mathematics,\"\n       and \"Supreme Alphabet\".\n\n        . . . The Nation of Gods and Earths teaches that. . .\n       our status, as black men, is commensurate with that\n       of the Supreme being.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. As stated in one of the group's \"lessons\": \"There is no mystery God.\nThe SON OF MAN has searched for that mystery God for trillions of\nyears and was unable to find this so-called mystery God.\" App. 360.\n\n                               7\n\f        . . . We teach man to stop looking for a mystical God\n       to come and solve our problems but to take\n       responsibility to solve our own problems ourselves.\n\n        . . . We teach that worship of Allah is tantamount to\n       worship of oneself and that everyone has \"God\" within\n       him.\n\nApp. 458-59.\n\nDespite the mysterious murder of Clarence 13X in June\nof 1969, the Five Percent Nation flourished in certain prison\nsystems. According to a report prepared by Roland Holvey\nof the New Jersey Department of Corrections Internal\nAffairs Office (\"the Holvey Report\"), the Five Percent Nation\nbecame such a strong presence in New York prisons that\nHispanic inmates were prompted to form their own gang,\nknown as the Latin Kings, to protect themselves from\nattacks by Five Percenters. The Five Percent Nation became\nactive in New Jersey prisons in the early 1980s and has\nsince become the largest group in the state's prison system.\nIn addition to New York and New Jersey, the group is also\nknown to exist in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,\nMaryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,\nSouth Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Five Percent Nation claims that it does not promote\nor advocate violence, but evidence links the group with\nnumerous incidents of prison violence. Indeed, according to\nthe Holvey report, many in the law enforcement community\nconsider the Five Percent Nation to be \"one of the greatest\nthreats to the social fabric\" of the prisons. See App. 336. In\nsupport of this conclusion, the Holvey report cites a string\nof incidents that occurred in New Jersey prisons between\nAugust 1990 and July 1997. See App. at 341-43. In August\n1990, a Five Percenter was a member of a small group of\ninmates who repeatedly stabbed a prison officer and\nseverely beat other officers. See App. at 341. In May 1993,\nan investigation revealed that a Five Percenter sent an\nanonymous letter threatening the lives of prison staff at\nEast Jersey State Prison. See id. In December 1993, more\nthan 30 inmates at Northern State Prison participated in a\ngroup demonstration in the gymnasium during afternoon\nrecess. See id. A subsequent investigation revealed that the\n\n                               8\n\fgroup was planning to assault prison staff because prison\nofficials refused to recognize the Five Percent Nation as a\nreligion. See id. Information was also received that the Five\nPercenters were planning to \"take a cop\" in the afternoon.\nSee Sealed Appendix at 24. In March 1995, two Five\nPercenters in the Southern State Correctional Facility were\ninvolved in an altercation inside a housing unit. See id. at\n342. In May 1996, approximately 50 to 60 inmates\nbelonging to the Five Percent Nation or a rival gang\nconducted an unauthorized meeting during evening\nrecreation. See id. In August 1996, a melee broke out\nbetween Five Percenters and another group in a state\nprison. See id. Between 25 and 30 inmates were involved in\nfights. See id. On a day in November 1996, 24 inmates in\na youth correctional facility who were affiliated with the\nFive Percent Nation or rival Hispanic gangs were involved in\nthree separate incidents. See id. In February 1997, a Five\nPercenter at Riverfront State Prison attacked and seriously\ninjured a correctional officer. See id. at 343. The officer\nsuffered a punctured lung after being stabbed with a\nhomemade knife. See id. After the attack, four other Five\nPercenters barricaded themselves in the gymnasium, set\nfires, and damaged prison property. See id. Also in\nFebruary 1997, a member of the Five Percent Nation was\ninvolved in a fight with another inmate. See id. In March\n1997, officers at Riverfront State Prison received\ninformation that Five Percenters had contracted with\nmembers of another gang to assault prison staff members.\nSee id. In July 1997, Five Percenters at Middlesex County\nJail participated in a hunger strike. See id. Officers were\nrequired to use smoke and concussion grenades to enter\ntwo barricaded housing units. See id.\n\nBased largely on the recommendations of Investigator\nHolvey and others in the Intelligence Section, the\nCommissioner designated the Five Percent Nation as an\nSTG. The Commissioner also designated two Hispanic\ngangs, the Latin Kings and the NETAs, and two white\ngangs, the Prison Bikers Brotherhood and the Aryan\nBrothers. App. 280. On March 4, 1998, several inmates,\nincluding plaintiffs Alexander Kettles and John Harris, were\nidentified as core members of the Five Percent Nation and\ntransferred to the STGMU. See Appellants' Br. at 9. Kettles\n\n                               9\n\facknowledges being a member of the Five Percent Nation,\nsee App. at 36 (Kettles's Affidavit), while Harris denies\nmembership. See App. 61 (Harris's Affidavit). Harris claims\nto be a Rastafarian who \"gain[s] personal and spiritual\nfulfillment by examining and studying all religions,\nincluding The Five Percent Nation.\" Id. He believes that\nstudying other religions enables him to \"better understand\nand accept others['] points of view.\" Id. He asserts that he\nwas falsely identified as a Five Percenter simply because he\nreceived a letter from a friend who was a member and\nbecause some of his Rastafarian literature contained a Five\nPercent Nation symbol. He refused to sign a statement\ndisavowing association with STGs because he believes that\nsigning would amount to an admission that he belongs to\nthe Five Percent Nation. See id. at 62. The third plaintiff,\nJael Fraise, admits membership in the Five Percent Nation.\nSee Appellants' Brief at 9. He was validated as a core\nmember and transferred to the STGMU based on his\npossession of Five Percenter material. See id.\n\nKettles, Harris, and Fraise filed separate lawsuits against\nDepartment of Corrections officials under 42 U.S.C.S 1983,\nasserting that their treatment under the STG Policy violated\ntheir constitutional rights. They sought injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief and damages.\n\nC.\n\nIn an unpublished opinion, the District Court granted the\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court first\naddressed the plaintiffs' claims that the enforcement of the\nSTG Policy had violated their rights under the Free Exercise\nClause. Although the defendants contended that the Five\nPercent Nation is not a \"religion\" within the meaning of the\nFirst Amendment, the Court did not resolve this issue but\nrather assumed for the sake of argument that the Five\nPercent Nation is a \"religion.\" The Court then applied the\nstandard set out by the Supreme Court in Turner v. Safley,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), for assessing prison regulations that\nrestrict inmates' constitutional rights. Under Turner, a\nregulation passes muster if it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests. See 482 U.S. at 89. Turner\ninstructs courts to weigh four factors when applying this\n\n                               10\n\fstandard: first, whether the regulation bears a\"valid,\nrational connection\" to a legitimate and neutral\ngovernmental objective; second, whether prisoners have\nalternative ways of exercising the circumscribed right;\nthird, whether accommodating the right would have a\ndeleterious impact on other inmates, guards, and the\nallocation of prison resources generally; and fourth,\nwhether alternatives exist that \"fully accommodate[ ] the\nprisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological\ninterests.\" Id. at 91.\n\nWith respect to the first factor, the District Court noted\nthat the designation of the Five Percent Nation as an STG\nwas based on concern about security. The Court recognized\nthis as a valid penological concern that is unrelated to the\nsuppression of expression and is consequently neutral for\npurposes of the Turner analysis. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 14; see\nalso id. After finding \"ample evidence that the Five Percent\nNation as a group poses a threat to prison security,\" the\nCourt concluded that the decision to designate the Five\nPercent Nation as an STG was rationally related to this\nlegitimate and neutral government objective. Id. at 14-15.\nThe Court also held that the STG Policy's restrictions on\nthe activities of STG members were all rationally related to\nthe goal of prison safety and security. See id. at 15-19. The\nCourt thus concluded that the first Turner factor weighed in\nfavor of the STG Policy.\n\nIn analyzing the second factor -- the availability of\nalternative ways of exercising the circumscribed right -- the\nDistrict Court stated that \"[t]here must simply be some\nform of expression available to the inmates . . . and here\nthat requirement is met.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 20 (citing O'Lone\nv. Estate of Shabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (1987)). The Court\nnoted that the STG Policy does not impose a total ban on\nassociation and expression by STG members and that such\ninmates continue to have opportunities to participate in\nreligious programs, to fast and pray, to possess certain\nreligious items, and to express their political, social, and\ncultural views in other ways. See id. at 21.\n\nTurning to the third factor -- the impact that\naccommodating the asserted constitutional right would\nhave on other inmates, guards, and the allocation of prison\n\n                               11\n\fresources generally -- the District Court believed that\n\"[a]ccomodating plaintiffs' desire to associate and engage in\nSTG activities . . . undoubtedly would adversely impact the\ninmate population and prison staff at all correctional\nfacilities by exposing them to a greater risk of assault and\ndisturbance.\" Id. at 22. The Court thus held that the STG\nPolicy satisfied Turner's third factor.\n\nFinally, the District Court held that the Policy was also\nsupported by the fourth factor -- the absence of\nalternatives that would fully accommodate the prisoner's\nrights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests. The\nCourt opined that \"[r]equiring an accommodation, like\nmandating further STG activity on the part of inmates prior\nto classification, or further demonstration of [a particular\ninmate's] dangerousness before placement at the STGMU,\n[would] expose[ ] the general inmate population and the\ncorrectional facility staff to an increased risk of violence.\"\nDist Ct. Op. at 23. The Court did not feel that an\nindividualized determination of the threat presented by\neach inmate identified as an STG member was a viable\nalternative because, among other things, it would place an\nundue burden on prison staff. See id. at 24. Accordingly,\nthe Court held that all four of Turner's prongs weighed in\nfavor of the STG Policy, that the Policy was reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests, and that it did\nnot violate the plaintiffs' free exercise rights.\n\nThe District Court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that\nthe defendants had violated their equal protection rights by\nsingling out their religion for unfavorable treatment. The\nCourt noted that \"[t]here is nothing in the Constitution\nwhich requires prison officials to treat all inmate groups\nalike where differentiation is necessary to avoid an\nimminent threat of institutional disruption or violence.\"\nDist. Ct. Op. at 24-25 (quoting Jones v. North Carolina\nPrisoners' Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109718\"><a href=\"/opinion/109718/jones-v-north-carolina-prisoners-labor-union-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (1977)). Finally, the\nDistrict Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the\nDepartment of Corrections violated due process by failing to\ngive adequate notice before promulgating and acting\npursuant to the STG Policy. The Court held that the\nplaintiffs had not shown that placement in the STGMU\ndeprived them of a protected liberty interest. The plaintiffs\nthen took this appeal.\n\n                               12\n\fII\n\nWe first address the plaintiffs' claim that the STG Policy\nviolates their First Amendment right to the free exercise of\ntheir religion. All parties urge us to resolve this issue by\napplying the standards set out in Turner, and we take that\napproach.5\n\nIn Turner, the Supreme Court began by noting that\n\"[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison\ninmates from the protections of the Constitution.\" 482 U.S.\nat 84. The Court recognized, however, that inmates'\nconstitutional rights must in some respects be limited in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. It is not clear that Turner factors should be considered before\ndetermining whether a contested prison regulation would violate the\nconstitutional right that the inmate invokes if the regulation were\napplied to persons not in prison. After all, incarceration almost always\nresults in a narrowing, not a broadening, of constitutional protections.\n\nTurner discussed five prior Supreme Court cases involving inmate\nconstitutional claims, and in all of those cases the challenged prison\nregulation would have been plainly unconstitutional outside the prison\ncontext.

As noted,\nunder the Turner framework, four factors must be\nconsidered in assessing the reasonableness of such\nregulations. Id. at 90-91. We will discuss each of these\nfactors separately.\n\nA.\n\nWe agree with the District Court that the STG Policy is\nsupported by Turner's first prong. A prison regulation fails\nthis prong if it \"promotes an interest that is illegitimate or\nnot neutral, or . . . bears no `valid, rational connection' to\nthe asserted interest.\" Waterman, 183 F.3d at 214 (quoting\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89-90). Here, contrary to the suggestion\nof the dissent that the New Jersey scheme \"targets\nmembers of one religion,\" Dissent at 27, the STG Policy is\nentirely neutral and does not in any way take religion into\naccount. It is also beyond dispute that New Jersey has a\nlegitimate penological interest in maintaining order and\nsecurity within the prison system. See O'Lone , 482 U.S. at\n350-51; Turner, 482 U.S. at 91-92. Recognizing this, the\nplaintiffs challenge the STG Policy by arguing that the\nHolvey Report does not provide a sufficient basis for\nconcluding that prison violence can be attributed to the\nFive Percent Nation. See Appellants' Br. at 21-22. The\nplaintiffs maintain that there has been \"no showing . . .\nthat a greater proportion of Five Percenters are more violent\nthan a group of Christians, Muslims, Jews or atheists\" and\nthat the Holvey Report found only that some Five\n\n                               14\n\fPercenters are violent. Id. at 24. Contending that the\ndecision to classify the Five Percenters as an STG was\nbased on a report full of \"unfounded speculations,\" the\nplaintiffs argue that the STG Policy and the restrictions\nimposed on them are not rationally related to the legitimate\nobjective of maintaining prison order and security. We\ndisagree.\n\nAs discussed above, the Holvey Report recounts\nnumerous instances of actual or planned violence involving\nFive Percenters in New Jersey correctional facilities from\nAugust 1990 through July 1997. See App. 341-43.\nAlthough the plaintiffs and the dissent contend that these\nincidents are insufficient to justify STG treatment, Turner\ninstructs judges to exercise great caution before second-\nguessing the expert judgment of correctional officials on a\nquestion of this nature. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85;\nDeHart v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770486\"><a href=\"/opinion/770486/robert-perry-dehart-v-martin-horn-commissioner-of-corrections-james-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (3d Cir. 2000).

Procunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109016\"><a href=\"/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1974).] As\n       the Martinez Court acknowledged, \"the problems of\n       prisons in America are complex and intractable. . . .\n       Id., at 404-405. Running a prison is an inordinately\n       difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning,\n       and the commitment of resources, all of which are\n       peculiarly within the province of the legislative and\n       executive branches of government. Prison\n       administration is, moreover, a task that has been\n       committed to the responsibility of those branches, and\n       separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of\n       judicial restraint. Where a state penal system is\n       involved, federal courts have, as we indicated in\n       Martinez, additional reason to accord deference to the\n       appropriate prison authorities. See id., at 405.\n\nTo these observations, we would add that a measure of\ndeference is especially appropriate when a regulation\nimplicates prison security.\n\nViewing the summary judgment record in the manner\ndictated by Turner, we are satisfied that the defendants had\n\n                               15\n\fadequate grounds for concluding that inmates belonging to\nthe Five Percent Nation present a serious security threat.\n\nWe note that other courts have reached the same\nconclusion. The Fourth Circuit has observed, the Five\nPercent Nation has a \"history of violence\" in the South\nCarolina prison system.

The United\nStates District Court for the Western District of New York\nreached a similar conclusion concerning the New York\nsystem. See Self-Allah v.

We agree with these courts and therefore hold\nthat there is a rational connection between New Jersey's\nSTG regulations and the legitimate and neutral objective of\nmaintaining order and security within the prison system.6\n\nThe dissent disagrees with our evaluation of the first\nTurner factor primarily because the dissent is unwilling to\naccord any significant deference to the judgment of the\nresponsible New Jersey officials that the Five Percent\nNation presents a security threat within the state's\ncorrectional system. The dissent disparages the Holvey\nreport because Holvey's \"credentials consist largely of on-\nthe-job training.\" Dissent at 32. The dissent characterizes\nthe incidents of actual or planned violence recounted in the\nreport as merely \"anecdotal\" evidence and then diminishes\nthe significance of particular incidents on a variety of\ngrounds. Dissent at 32-33 n.9. For example, the dissent\ndescribes as merely a \"gathering\" an incident in which\nmembers of the Five Percent Nation congregated in a gym\nto protest their treatment by the authorities, and\ncorrectional officials received information that the Five\nPercenters were planning to \"take a cop.\" Id. Incidents in\nwhich Five Percenters attacked and seriously wounded\ncorrectional staff are dismissed as simply \"involving a single\nFPN member.\" Id. What the dissent seems to demand is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In fact, there is evidence in the record that the STG policy has been\neffective in reducing violence in prisons. As Investigator Holvey\ntestified\nduring his deposition: \"I can also say that since the opening of the\nSecurity Threat Group Management Unit on March 4th of 1998, there\nhave been no serious incidents, gang-related incidents, within the whole\nDepartment of Corrections. There's no question that it's a direct result\nof\nthe initiative of the Security Threat Group Management Unit.\" App. at\n259. According to Holvey, prior to the STG Policy,\"[e]very day there\nwould be some kind of gang-related incidents related to one of these five\ngangs [that had been designated as Security Threat Groups].\" Id. Howard\nBeyer, the Assistant Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections, also submitted an affidavit indicating that the program has\nbeen successful. See App. at 84 (\"The use of close custody units has\nproven successful in the maintenance of discipline, security, safety, and\nan orderly operation of correctional facilities in the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections and will continue to assist the administrators\nand management in the inmate population.\").\n\n                               17\n\feither (a) proof that the tenets of the Five Percent Nation\nrequire members to engage in violence7 or (b) hard\nstatistical proof that members of the Five Percent Nation\ncommit proportionally more acts of violence in New Jersey\nprisons than do members of other religions.8 Demanding\nproof of this stature before correctional officials can act to\nprevent gang violence is fundamentally inconsistent with\nTurner and would in all likelihood be paralyzing.\n\nB.\n\n1. We now consider the District Court's analysis of the\nsecond Turner factor. As noted, this factor requires a court\nto assess whether inmates retain alternative means of\nexercising the circumscribed right. See Turner , 482 U.S. at\n90; DeHart, 227 F.3d at 51. When assessing the availability\nof alternatives, the right in question must be viewed\n\"sensibly and expansively.\" DeHart, 227 F.3d at 53 (quoting\nThornburgh v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417 (1989)). Therefore,\nin a free exercise case, we must consider whether the\ninmate has \"alternative means of practicing his or her\nreligion generally, not whether [the] inmate has alternative\nmeans of engaging in [any] particular practice.\" Id. at 55.\nWe will first discuss the restrictions that the New Jersey\nPolicy imposed on the plaintiffs simply because they were\ndesignated as members of the Five Percent Nation; we will\nthen consider the additional restriction imposed as a result\nof their validation as core members.\n\n2. Ordinary members. In applying the second Turner\nfactor in a free exercise case, we must of course focus on\nthe beliefs of the inmate asserting the claim. It is obviously\nimpossible to determine whether a regulation leaves an\ninmate with alternative ways of practicing the inmate's\nreligion without identifying the religion's practices. The\nplaintiffs bore the burden of producing evidence of their\nbeliefs and practices. In order to do this, they submitted\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. See Dissent at 31 (demanding proof that \"membership in the Five\nPercent Nation carried with it a set of beliefs that each member acts\nupon to promote violence and disorder\" or proof that \"membership\nequates to an active commitment to violence\").\n\n8. See Dissent at 32-33.\n\n                               18\n\fthe declaration of G. Kalim, a member of the Five Percent\nNation and the editor of a newspaper called The Five\nPercenter. See App. 457-60. Mr. Kalim's declaration\nexplains the basic beliefs and practices of the Five Percent\nNation, and we have therefore closely examined Mr. Kalim's\ndeclaration to determine the degree to which the challenged\nSTG Policy restricts the plaintiffs' religious practices.\n\nMr. Kalim's declaration describes the Five Percent Nation\n(or The Nation of Gods and Earths, as he calls it) as a\nloosely structured group -- in his words, \"a group of people\nwho share a common way of life.\" App. 459. His declaration\ndoes not state that members of the group are required,\nexpected, or counseled to participate in or attend any rites\nor gatherings or to perform any acts of religious\nobservance. Indeed, his declaration states that\"[t]o become\na member . . . , all one need do is study the lessons and\naspire to live a righteous life.\" Id. at 459. His declaration\nmakes it clear that the group rejects belief in the\ntranscendent and instead focuses on human enlightenment\nand conduct as ends in themselves. According to Mr.\nKalim, the Five Percent Nation \"teach[es] man to stop\nlooking for a mystical God\" and \"emphasizes the individual,\nhuman freedom and choice.\" Id. at 458. He states that the\ngroup teaches people to attain \"knowledge and\nenlightenment,\" to have \"respect for society,\" and to eschew\nviolence and disavow \"white hatred.\" Id . He adds that the\ngroup attempts \"to train young individuals to better\nthemselves in the community\" and that the group's\n\"principal purpose is to teach our young self worth,\nresponsibility, and self love.\" Id. The group appears to\nbelieve that these goals can be achieved by understanding\nthe group's view of world history, see id., but it seems clear\nthat an understanding of this is viewed as a means to\nenlightenment and right behavior, not an end.\n\nBased on Mr. Kalim's declaration, it appears that one\ncentral practice of the Five Percent Nation is restricted by\nthe STG Policy provisions applicable to ordinary members,\nnamely, the ability to \"study the lessons.\" App. 459. As\nnoted, the Policy prohibits inmates from \"participating in\nany activity(ies) related to a security threat group\" or\npossessing the group's literature. See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-\n\n                               19\n\f4.1(.010), (.011). However, even the study of the Five\nPercent Nation's teachings is not completely prohibited. Mr.\nKalim's declaration states that the group's \"teachings\ninclude texts such as the Bible [and] the Koran.\"9 App. 458.\nWhile the STG Policy forbids possession of distinctively Five\nPercent Nation literature, it is undisputed that the Policy\nallows inmates to possess, study, and discuss the Bible and\nthe Koran. Accordingly, study of the Five Percent Nation's\nteachings is only partially restricted.\n\nThe STG Policy appears to leave ample room for all of the\nremaining activities mentioned in Mr. Kalim's declaration.\nCertainly nothing in the STG Policy restricts Five Percent\nNation members from discussing or seeking to achieve self-\nknowledge, self-respect, responsible conduct, or righteous\nliving. To be sure, the STG Policy restricts the ability of Five\nPercenters to achieve these things by following what the\ngroup may regard as the best avenue, i.e., by studying and\ndiscussing doctrines and materials distinctive to the Five\nPercent Nation. But alternative avenues clearly remain\nopen.\n\nIn sum, our examination of the second Turner factor in\nrelation to the plaintiffs' explanation of their beliefs leads us\nto the conclusion that, while the New Jersey STG policy\nundoubtedly imposes restrictions on the ability of rank-\nand-file Five Percenters to engage in activities related to the\ngroup, the Policy does not foreclose all alternative avenues\nof practice.\n\n3. Core members. Application of the second Turner\nfactor to \"core\" members presents an additional difficulty\nbecause the Policy requires core members assigned to the\nSTGMU to renounce \"affiliation\" with their STG as a\ncondition of returning to the general inmate population. See\nApp. at 248, 302-04, 443. If the STG Policy demanded that\ncore members of the Five Percent Nation renounce the\nbeliefs of the group, we could not say that the second\nTurner factor is satisfied. We do not, however, interpret the\nSTG Policy as demanding a renunciation of beliefs. (The\nPolicy does not, for example, require a core member to deny\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. As the plaintiffs put it in their brief, members of the group \"study\nthe\nwritings from the various recognized religions.\" Appellants' Br. at 14.\n\n                               20\n\fthe truth of the \"Supreme Mathematics.\") What it requires\ninstead is a promise not to associate with certain other\nprisoners while in prison.\n\nThe form that a core member must sign requires the core\nmember to renounce \"affiliation with all Security Threat\nGroups,\" App. 443, and a security threat group is defined\nby the Policy as \"[a] group of inmates . . . who may gather\ntogether regularly and informally . . . .\" Id . at 126. Thus,\nwhat is required is a renunciation of affiliation with a\nparticular group of inmates (those who belong to an STG),\nnot a renunciation of beliefs. In simpler terms, the Policy\nrequires the end of any form of gang membership or\nparticipation. In view of this interpretation of the STG\nPolicy, we conclude that even core members of the Five\nPercent Nation retain alternative avenues of practicing their\nreligion, namely, those previously discussed in connection\nwith ordinary members.\n\nC.\n\nWe agree with the District Court's analysis of Turner's\nthird prong. \"When accommodation of an asserted right will\nhave a significant `ripple effect' on fellow inmates or on\nprison staff, courts should be particularly deferential to the\ninformed discretion of corrections officials.\" Turner, 482\nU.S. at 90. The record, as noted, contains evidence that\nFive Percenters pose a security threat to prison officials and\nother inmates. Dist. Ct. Op. at 22. As the Fourth Circuit\nhas stated:\n\n       Prison administration often involves tough tradeoffs. In\n       the closed environment of a prison, greater liberties for\n       some may mean increased danger and intimidation for\n       others. Because increased freedom for the Five\n       Percenters would come \"only at the cost of significantly\n       less liberty and safety for everyone else, guards and\n       other prisoners alike,\" we are particularly reluctant to\n       interfere with the judgment of the [prison officials] in\n       this case.\n\nFive Percenters, 174 F.3d at 470 (quoting Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 92-93). Particularly in light of the highly deferential\n\n                               21\n\fstandard of review that applies here, we agree with the\nFourth Circuit and conclude that this factor is satisfied.\n\nD.\n\nWe also agree that Turner's fourth factor weighs in favor\nof the Policy. Turner does not impose a least-restrictive-\nalternative test. See Waterman, 183 F.3d at 219. Rather,\nour inquiry is whether there are alternatives that would\nimpose only \"de minimis cost to valid penological interests.\"\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 91.\n\nIn this case, the District Court considered alternatives to\nthe New Jersey system, such as toughening the showing\nneeded for STG designation, but concluded that these\nwould expose \"the general inmate population and the\ncorrectional facility staff to an increased risk of violence.\"\nDist. Ct. Op. at 23. The plaintiffs argue that the District\nCourt misunderstood their argument. See Appellants' Br. at\n32. They contend that the Department of Corrections\nshould not have designated \"an entire belief system,\" i.e.,\nthe Five Percent Nation, as an STG but instead should have\ndesignated only \"specific hierarchical `gangs' with members\nwho are Five Percenters.\" We disagree. We reiterate that our\ninquiry is not whether the state could have adopted a less\nrestrictive alternative but rather whether it could have\nadopted an alternative that imposed only \"de minimis cost\nto legitimate penological interests.\" Turner , 482 U.S. at 91.\nAs we have explained, the state had adequate grounds for\nconcluding that the Five Percent Nation presented a threat\nto prison order and security. The alternatives to which the\nplaintiffs point would have done less to mitigate this threat\nand thus would have had a more than de minimis impact\non the state's legitimate penological concerns. Therefore, we\nagree with the District Court that the final Turner factor\nsupports the Policy.\n\nE.\n\nWe have concluded that three of the four Turner factors\nweigh strongly in favor of the STG Policy. These factors are\nthe existence of a \"valid, rational connection\" to a legitimate\nand neutral governmental objective, the effect that\n\n                                22\n\faccommodating the plaintffs would have on other inmates,\nguards, and the allocation of prison resources generally,\nand the availability of alternative regulatory approaches\nthat would \"fully accommodate[ ] the prisoner's rights at de\nminimis cost to valid penological interests.\" The remaining\nfactor -- the availability of alternative means of exercising\nthe circumscribed right -- presents a closer question, but\nwe hold that it too is met. Accordingly, we affirm the\ndecision of the District Court that the challenged STG\nPolicy does not violate the plaintiffs' free exercise rights.\nAccord In re Long Term Admin.

See Appellants' Br. at 40. In making this argument,\nthe plaintiffs point to the Sunni Muslims, and claim that\nthis group, although similar to the Five Percent Nation, has\nbeen treated less harshly. According to the plaintiffs, the\nSunni Muslims have several of the characteristics of an\nSTG, such as a common history and purpose, an\norganizational structure, recognized leaders, customary\nsalutations, and a considerable size. They also note that\nHolvey admitted during his deposition that some Sunni\nMuslims had shown \"a propensity for violence . . . [o]n\noccasion\" and that some illegal or prohibited acts \"could be\nassociated with Sunni Muslims.\" See Appellants' Br. at 35-\n36. They also rely on Holvey's statement that the\"big\"\ndifference between the Sunni Muslims and the Five Percent\nNation is that the Sunnis practice a religion and the Five\nPercenters do not. See id. at 37.\n\nIn DeHart, our court, sitting en banc, held that when an\ninmate asserts an equal protection claim based on the\nallegedly disparate treatment of different religious groups,\nthe governing standard is whether the disparate treatment\nis \" `reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.' \"\n227 F.3d at 61 (citation omitted). That standard is met\nhere. While relying on one portion of Holvey's deposition,\n\n                               23\n\fthe plaintiffs do not mention another part of the deposition\nin which Holvey stated that the Sunni Muslims have a\nmuch lower propensity for violence than the Five\nPercenters. See App. 214. Moreover, while Holvey cited\nreligion as a major difference between the two groups,\nHolvey did not state that religion played any role in the\ndecision whether to designate either group as an STG. We\nnote that the STG Policy makes no reference to religion,\nand we are not aware of any other evidence in the record\nthat suggests that religion plays any role in STG\ndesignation decisions. In view of greater propensity for\nviolence demonstrated by members of the Five Percent\nNation, we hold that the group's designation as an STG\ndoes not violate equal protection.\n\nIV.\n\nThe plaintiffs' final argument is that the Department of\nCorrections violated their due process rights by failing to\nprovide any notice of the new regulations until the day of\nthe plaintiffs' transfer to the STGMU. The plaintiffs contend\nthat this deprived them of any opportunity to modify their\nbehavior to comply with the new regulations. See Reply\nBrief at 16-17. The District Court rejected this argument,\nconcluding that the plaintiffs were not deprived of a\nprotected liberty interest. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 26-28. We\nagree.\n\nTo succeed on their due process claim, the plaintiffs\nmust first demonstrate that they were deprived of a liberty\ninterest when they were transferred to the STGMU.\n\"Protected liberty . . . interests generally arise either from\nthe Due Process Clause or from state-created statutory\nentitlement.\" Shoats v.

Thus, the plaintiffs lack a\n\n                               25\n\fprotected liberty interest and their due process claim must\nfail. In addition, even if the plaintiffs had been deprived of\na protected liberty interest, the procedures used in\ndetermining whether an inmate is a core STG member\nsatisfy procedural due process. See Shoats, 213 F.3d at\n144-47. As noted, an inmate who is identified as a core\nSTG member receives notice and a hearing at which the\ninmate may be heard. The inmate may appeal an adverse\ndecision to the administrator of the prison and may obtain\njudicial review in state court. These procedures satisfy due\nprocess. Id. As for the plaintiffs' complaint that they were\nidentified as core members based on conduct that occurred\nbefore the STG Policy was promulgated, we held in Shoats\nthat due process is not violated by placing an inmate in\nadministrative custody based on past conduct that\nfurnishes a basis for predicting that the inmate will engage\nin future acts of violence if corrective measures are not\ntaken. Id. at 146-47.\n\nV.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, we affirm the decision\nof the District Court.\n\n                               26\n\fRENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nI disagree with the reasoning of, and result reached by,\nboth the District Court and the majority. I think we are\nfaced here with an issue of much greater import, both\npractically and analytically, than mere permissible prison\nregulation. While some measure of deference is certainly to\nbe afforded to prison authorities, nonetheless we must\nmake certain that we do not convert the Turner v. Safley\ntest into a rubber stamp. Here, the policy at issue has been\napplied so as to target a religious group for different\ntreatment, including a blanket denial of First Amendment\nrights.1 We must deal with this wholesale treatment of\nmembers of a religious group in a careful manner.\n\nAppellants urge us to address the following question:\nWhen the prison adopts a policy and then targets members\nof one religion and imposes significant burdens on-- even\nperhaps totally impedes -- their religious exercise, based\nsolely on the prisoners' religious affiliation, does not the\nfirst prong of the Turner v. Safley test require that the\nviolence of the group and the members subjected to this\ntreatment be clearly proven in order for such group\ntreatment to be \"reasonably related\" to the legitimate goal?2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. While providing a detailed description of the procedures provided by\nthe STG policy, the majority does not reference the extensive restrictions\nimposed on Appellants. According to the STG policy, restrictions on\ninmates in Phase 1 of the program include: strip-searches each time they\nleave or return to their cells; a total of five hours per week out of\ntheir\ncells; a shower or shave only every third day; only a single, non-contact\nvisit each month; only one monitored phone call per week; prohibition on\ncorrespondence with any other inmate, including incarcerated family\nmembers; all meals eaten in cells; and, no access to regular prison\nprograms. App. at A138-42, 148. Further, the Policy instructs that\n\"[t]here is a `Zero Tolerance' level for Security Threat Group activity\nwithin the Department's correctional facility(ies).\" App. at A152.\nExamples of such activities include: \"Possession of Security Threat\nGroup literature such as lessons, membership lists, and artwork;\nPossession of Security Threat Group paraphernalia such as beads,\nartwork, medallions, and clothing articles; . . . Participation in\nSecurity\nThreat Group related . . . meetings, gatherings, . .. and events . . . .\"\nApp. at A152.\n\n2. One could quibble with whether the restrictions are on all members,\nbecause the close custody only applies to those determined to be \"core\n\n                               27\n\fTwo key facts are present here that, I submit, warrant\nthat we proceed with extra caution. First, the policy is being\napplied based on membership in a group, specifically, in a\nreligious group; the individual conduct that results in the\npurported basis for the imposition of the restriction is not\nviolent or threatening activity, but, rather, is religious\nobservance essentially protected by the First Amendment.\nSecond, the cognitive \"leap\" from the fact of membership in\na religion to the validity of a concern about security is not\nan automatic one, not \"common sense,\" and we must\nrequire a showing of the proper fit between membership in\nthe religious group and valid security concerns.\n\nThe confluence of these two factors should cause us to\npause and consider the appropriate test, and the applicable\nevidentiary burden. We have noted that the first prong of\nTurner is subject to the test of a \"means-end fit,\" which we\nhave described as follows:\n\n       We may conclude that the statute bears no \"valid,\n       rational connection\" to rehabilitation if \"the logical\n       connection between the [statute] and the asserted goal\n       is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or\n       irrational.\"\n\nWaterman v.

The Supreme Court explained that the rejection of the\nregulation in Martinez was based on the Court's \"recognition that the\nregulated activity centrally at issue in that case-- outgoing personal\ncorrespondence from prisoners -- did not, by its very nature, pose a\nserious threat to prison order and security.\" Id. at 411.

I submit that if prison authorities are to be\npermitted to target and categorize a certain religion so as to\nseverely circumscribe First Amendment rights, based solely\non membership in the religion, we should require that the\nfirst prong of the Turner v. Safley test be satisfied only by,\nat a minimum, a close fit between the targeted religion and\nproblem sought to be avoided, here, to \"minimize the\noccurrence of assaults on staff and inmates,\" and\nevidentiary requirements that leave no room for doubt. To\nrequire any less is to permit -- perhaps encourage--\nprofiling: that is, the arbitrary attribution of certain\ncharacteristics to a group and, therefore, members of that\ngroup, resulting in denial of rights and different,\ndisadvantaged treatment.\n\nFurther, it would be one thing if the prisons were only\n\"profiling\" security threat groups that are clearly violent\n\"gangs;\" but, here, the District Court assumed that the Five\nPercent Nation was a religion.6 The evidence before the\nDistrict Court was woefully lacking that membership in the\nFive Percent Nation carried with it a set of beliefs that each\nmember acts upon to promote violence and disorder. 7 The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. This case would present different issues had the District Court not\nassumed that the Five Percent Nation was a religion. The Court would\nhave been required to determine whether FPN would be considered a\nreligion, and therefore accorded the protections provided by the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. As this issue is not before us,\nand was not before the District Court, we need not decide whether the\nFPN would satisfy these requirements, but only stress that non-\ntraditional belief systems found to be religious in nature will be\nafforded\nthe same protections as traditional ones.

Holvey has eighteen years of experience in corrections employment,\nincluding service as a corrections officer. Appellees note that he belongs\nto several national or regional law enforcement or intelligence\norganizations, including the National Major Gang Task Force, and that\nhe has assisted several states and organizations, including the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, with the process of identifying security threat\ngroups and members as well as training. Holvey Deposition, App. at\nA249-50, 254-58.\n\n9. The majority characterizes the Holvey Report as reporting a \"string of\nincidents\" and as citing \"numerous instances of actual or planned\nviolence involving Five Percenters in New Jersey correctional facilities\n\n                               32\n\fabsolutely no statistics with respect to crimes by Five\nPercent Nation members, as compared to crimes by other\ngroups. In fact, in pointing out that one in seven prison\ninmates is a member of the Five Percent Nation, the paucity\nof violent incidents purported to be linked to FPN members\nactually casts doubt on the violent nature of the group. No\nshowing was made that there was a greater proportion of\nviolence by FPN members than by groups of other kinds,\nsuch as Christians, Jews, or Muslims. The evidence is\nprobative only of the assertion that there are several\nmembers of the FPN that have committed violent or unruly\nacts.\n\nNowhere in their brief do Appellees counter, let alone\npoint to evidence that would meet, Appellants' statement\nthat the Five Percent Nation's \"teaching does not in any\nway advocate or encourage violence or disorderliness.\"10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbetween August 1990 and July 1997.\" Maj. at 15. In reality, a careful\nscrutiny of the report and corresponding attachments reveals very little\nevidence of planned or actual violence by FPN members, let alone by the\nFive Percent Nation as a group. In his report, Holvey lists twelve\n\"Specific\nViolent Acts/Intended Acts of Violence/Specific Illegal or Prohibited\nActs.\" App. at A342-43. Of this twelve, three do not even involve the New\nJersey correctional facilities, App. at A402-03, 404-11, and two more\nrelate to New Jersey youth facilities -- one involving a gathering of\napproximately 50 FPN and NETA members, and the other consisting of\na fight including some believed to be FPN members. App. at SA41-46. Of\nthe remaining seven incidents there were two gatherings, App. at SA24-\n29, A412, and three incidents involving a single FPN member. App. at\nSA5-20, SA48-56. There was only one report of a series of altercations\nallegedly involving more than one FPN member along with several Sunni\nMuslims. App. at SA37-39. And one letter allegedly from an FPN member\nthreatening violence against prison guards. SA21. None of these\nincidents reflects activity atypical of aggressive behavior one would\nanticipate in a prison setting. The incidents cited in the report do not\ndemonstrate the FPN's violent tendencies as a group or gang in the New\nJersey prison system. The report conflates incidents from other places,\nas well as violence by other inmates where a FPN member may have\nbeen tangentially involved, with incidents involving the FPN as a group.\n\n10. Moreover, it should be noted that Appellees in their brief really fail\nto\naddress the underlying \"disconnect\" that I perceive, but urge instead\nthat the threat group policy is related to a legitimate goal. Appellants\nconcede this, but argue that the designation of the Five Percent Nation\nis not so related because there is no valid connection in the New Jersey\nprison system between the Five Percent Nation and security concerns.\n\n                               33\n\fApp. Br. at 22. Rather, the District Court and the majority\nallude to the findings of other courts to the effect that the\nFive Percent Nation fosters violence. Those courts based\ntheir rulings on evidence before them, involving the facts\npresented to them. The District Court here should demand\nno less, but only the Holvey report was presented and relied\nupon. There is no basis for the District Court to take\njudicial notice of the evidence before other courts.\n\nFurther, most of the decisions referenced by the District\nCourt and the majority, in addition to being non-\nprecedential, are either distinguishable or not relevant.11 In\nthe most persuasive and well-reasoned opinion cited, Self-\nAllah v. Annucci, No. 97-CV-607(H), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">299310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2\n(W.D.N.Y. 1999), the issue is quite different -- whether the\ncourt would enjoin the prison authorities' confiscation of\nthe prisoners' copies of The Five Percenter. The injunction\nwas denied, based upon extensive testimony and evidence\npresented with respect to the violent propensity of the Five\nPercenters in the New York system. Many witnesses\ntestified (including Mr. Holvey) in favor of the relationship\nbetween the gang violence in the system and the group. The\nCourt concluded:\n\n       Plaintiff has demonstrated that Five Percenterism, in\n       its pure, uncorrupted form, represents a system of\n       beliefs which, outside the prison context, does not\n       advocate or promote violence.

Id. at 469 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 85, and Bell\nv.

The court noted\n\"ample evidence in the records\" supporting the\nreasonableness of the conclusion that they posed a threat\nto prison security, including incidents in 1992, 1993, and\nthree specific incidents in 1995, and referenced at least one\nincident report in which it was stated that \" `these five\ninmates acted as a group,' that they `felt as if they were\nacting in a manner acceptable to the[ir] religious beliefs,'\nand that they `spoke of more violence to come.' \" Id. at 466.\nThe prisoners in that case were not denied their religious\nliterature (this claim had been settled), and the court gave\ngreat deference to the prison system's decision as\n\"manifestly a rational action.\" Id. at 470. The court went on\nto explain:\n\n       The question is not whether [the South Carolina\n       Department of Corrections (\"SCDC\") director's]\n       conclusion was indisputably correct, but whether his\n       conclusion was rational and therefore entitled to\n       deference. Confronted with multiple reports of an\n       identifiable group whose members not only threatened\n       but had actually committed serious, violent acts in the\n       SCDC system and elsewhere, [SCDC Director's]\n\n                               35\n\f       decision to designate the Five Percenters as an STG\n       was manifestly a rational action.\n\nId. at 470 (citation omitted). It explained:\"Allowing prison\nofficials to act only after a demonstration of individual\ndangerousness would deprive them of the all-important\noption of prevention. The threat of violence here was a\ngroup threat, and prison administrators were entitled to\naddress it in those terms.\" Id. at 466.\n\nWhile I think the test of \"minimally\" rational relationship\nhas not been employed by our court and chips away at\nTurner, I cannot argue with the result reached in that case.12\nThe group had been identified based on clear, repeated past\ngroup violent conduct, attributable to its set of beliefs. But\nwe have no such evidentiary record here. Accordingly, not\nonly is the purported relationship more tenuous but the\ngenuineness of the security threat is more remote as well.\nAdditionally, the restrictions there did not include denial of\nliterature, which is at the heart of the FPN's exercise. In the\ncase before us, the implications are much more far-\nreaching and the evidence much less relevant and\nconvincing. There has been no showing of the \"means-end\nfit\" to satisfy the wholesale denial of religious freedom and\nexercise.\n\nIf the inquiry does not satisfy the first prong of Turner,\nwhich we have explained received the greatest weight, the\nprison's action must fail.

Therefore, we need not\nreach the other prongs. However, I cannot help but note my\ndisagreement with the ease with which the majority\ndispenses with the second and third prong as well. The\nanswer to the \"alternate means\" prong is really self-evident\n-- the prison authorities' course of \"treatment\" is designed\nto cause the FPN adherent to give up his faith, not permit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. In Shaw v. Murphy, Justice Thomas referred to rebutting the\npresumption of rationality. However, that language was dicta and I\nsuggest did not lower the standard of Turner , nor did it require the\nburden of proof to fall on the plaintiff.\n\n                               36\n\fhim to practice it. This is much different than the facts\nbefore the Fourth Circuit in Five Percenters, where the\ncourt found that because the prisoners could still pray, fast\nand study religious materials, the \"alternate means\" test\nwas satisfied, and the proven violence satisfied the\"no\nready alternatives\" prong. In the course of this treatment,\nthe FPN member is barred from the teachings, which are at\nthe heart of the Five Percent Nation religious experience.\nFurthermore, to be released from close custody he must\npromise to never again affiliate with FPN. Thus, the desired\nresult of the treatment is to eradicate the belief. It is\ndifficult to see how, realistically, there are \"alternate\nmeans\" here.\n\nIn connection with the \"impact of the accommodation on\nothers\" prong, here, the premise that potential violence\ncannot be accommodated assumes the very violence that I\nsuggest has not been shown. I would suggest that the\nabsence of a showing of the violent connection as discussed\nabove undermines the findings of the District Court and the\nmajority with respect to this prong as well.\n\nWe have in this country a rich tradition of protecting\nindividual rights, including the rights of prisoners.

See, e.g., Garner v. Bd. of Pub. Works,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104923\"><a href=\"/opinion/104923/garner-v-board-of-public-works-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1951) (upholding requirement that all city\nemployees must disclose membership to the Communist\nparty and swear an oath of loyalty); Korematsu v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1944) (affirming the constitutionality\nof \"excluding\" people of Japanese descent from the West\nCoast during World War II). Only later, when we have\nviewed these reactions with some perspective, have we\nacknowledged that the wholesale treatment of certain\ngroups was not consistent with the basic tenets of our\ndemocracy. Here, similarly, it seems as though there is a\nrush to brand the Five Percent Nation as a \"violent\"\nreligious sect. But, who is next? Would it be the Sunni\nMuslims, whose tenets, Appellants argue, are similar?\nWould it be the Nation of Islam, viewed by some as racist?\nWhile these may be inmates, and prisoners, they are\nnonetheless people. We should therefore be concerned, and\nbe careful in labeling and judging them based solely on\nmembership in a religious group.\n\nIf membership in such groups can objectively be shown,\nupon close scrutiny, to be equated to posing a real threat\nof violence in the prison setting, then treatment of such\ngroup members in wholesale fashion, even though it\ndeprives them of their constitutional rights, would be\nconsistent with legitimate penological objectives, and would\nbe permissible. Otherwise, such discriminatory treatment\ntreads impermissibly on their constitutional rights.\n\nI would reverse the District Court's ruling and deny\ndefendant's motion for summary judgment for lack of a\nshowing that the first prong of the Turner v. Safley test has\nbeen satisfied.13\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. I see no need to address Appellants' equal protection or due\nprocess claims. I agree with the majority that we apply the same Turner\nanalysis to Appellants' equal protection claim that we did to their First\nAmendment claims, and my concerns with the majority's Turner analysis\ncarries over to the equal protection analysis as well. On the other hand,\nI will not provide my own reasoning regarding Appellants' due process\nclaim, as I agree with that provided by the majority.\n\n                               38\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               39\n\f</pre>",
