Plaintiffs Ruben Chavez (“Israel”), Arthur Fisher, Joshua\nDeLosSantos, and the Bible Believers (collectively “the Bible Believers” or “Plaintiffs”) appeal\nthe district court order entering summary judgment in favor of Defendants Sheriff Benny N.\nNapoleon, Deputy Chief Dennis Richardson, Deputy Chief Mike Jaafar, and Wayne County\n(collectively “Wayne County” or “Defendants”). Plaintiffs initiated this constitutional tort action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Defendants violated their First Amendment rights to\nfreedom of speech and free exercise of religion, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment right to\nequal protection of the laws. The district court held that Defendants’ actions in cutting off the\nBible Believers’ religious speech did not violate the Constitution. We REVERSE the judgment\nof the district court in full and REMAND this case for entry of summary judgment in favor of\nPlaintiffs, for the calculation of damages, and for the award of appropriate injunctive relief,\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government\nmay not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive\nor disagreeable.” Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 458 (2011) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “Nowhere is this [First Amendment] shield more necessary than in our own\ncountry for a people composed [from such diverse backgrounds].” Cantwell v. Connecticut,\n310 U.S. 296, 310 (1940). Born from immigrants, our national identity is woven together from a\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 3\n\nmix of cultures and shaped by countless permutations of geography, race, national origin,\nreligion, wealth, experience, and education. Rather than conform to a single notion of what it\nmeans to be an American, we are fiercely individualistic as a people, despite the common threads\nthat bind us. This diversity contributes to our capacity to hold a broad array of opinions on an\nincalculable number of topics. It is our freedom as Americans, particularly the freedom of\nspeech, which generally allows us to express our views without fear of government sanction.\n\n       Diversity, in viewpoints and among cultures, is not always easy. An inability or a general\nunwillingness to understand new or differing points of view may breed fear, distrust, and even\nloathing. But it “is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears.”\nWhitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 376 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Robust discourse,\nincluding the exchanging of ideas, may lead to a better understanding (or even an appreciation)\nof the people whose views we once feared simply because they appeared foreign to our own\nexposure. But even when communication fails to bridge the gap in understanding, or when\nunderstanding fails to heal the divide between us, the First Amendment demands that we tolerate\nthe viewpoints of others with whom we may disagree. If the Constitution were to allow for the\nsuppression of minority or disfavored views, the democratic process would become imperiled\nthrough the corrosion of our individual freedom. Because “[t]he right to speak freely and to\npromote diversity of ideas . . . is . . . one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from\ntotalitarian regimes,” Terminiello v. City of Chi., 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949), dissent is an essential\ningredient of our political process.\n\n       The First Amendment “may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a\ncondition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to\nanger.” Id. If we are not persuaded by the contents of another’s speech, “the remedy to be\napplied is more speech, not enforced silence.”         Whitney, 274 U.S. at 377 (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring). And although not all manner of speech is protected, generally, we interpret the First\nAmendment broadly so as to favor allowing more speech. See Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536,\n578 (1965) (“[W]hen passing on the validity of a regulation of conduct, which may indirectly\ninfringe on free speech, this Court . . . weigh[s] the circumstances in order to protect, not to\ndestroy, freedom of speech.” (internal quotation marks omitted)) (Black, J., concurring).\n\fNo. 13-1635                  Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                Page 4\n\n        This case calls on us to confirm the boundaries of free speech protections in relation to\nangry, hostile, or violent crowds that seek to silence a speaker with whom the crowd disagrees.\nSet against the constitutional right to freedom of speech, we must balance the state’s interest in\ninsuring public safety and preventing breaches of the peace. The scenario presented by this case,\nknown as the “heckler’s veto,” occurs when police silence a speaker to appease the crowd and\nstave off a potentially violent altercation.1 The particular facts of this case involve a group of\nself-described Christian evangelists preaching hate and denigration to a crowd of Muslims, some\nof whom responded with threats of violence. The police thereafter removed the evangelists to\nrestore the peace. Bearing in mind the interspersed surges of ethnic, racial, and religious conflict\nthat from time to time mar our national history, the constitutional lessons to be learned from the\ncircumstances of this case are both timeless and markedly seasonable.\n\n        In this opinion we reaffirm the comprehensive boundaries of the First Amendment’s free\nspeech protection, which envelopes all manner of speech, even when that speech is loathsome in\nits intolerance, designed to cause offense, and, as a result of such offense, arouses violent\nretaliation. We also delineate the obligations and duties of law enforcement personnel or public\nofficials who, in the exercise of the state’s police power, seek to extinguish any breaches of the\npeace that may arise when constitutionally protected speech has stirred people to anger, and even\nto violence.\n\n                                                     Facts\n\n        A.       Dearborn and the Arab International Festival\n\n        Dearborn—home of the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company—is a city\nlocated in Wayne County, Michigan, that borders Detroit and has a stable population of\napproximately 100,000 people.2 Dearborn is also home to one of the largest populations of Arab\n\n\n\n\n        1\n          The term “heckler’s veto” is ascribed to Harry Kalven, a constitutional scholar, who noted when writing\nabout free speech and angry crowds, “If the police can silence the speaker, the law in effect acknowledges a veto\npower in hecklers who can, by being hostile enough, get the law to silence any speaker of whom they do not\napprove.” Harry Kalven, Jr., The Negro and the First Amendment 140 (Ohio St. Univ. Press 1965).\n        2\n           State & County QuickFacts: Dearborn (city), Michigan, United                 States   Census   Bureau,\nhttp://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2621000.html (last revised Oct. 14, 2015).\n\fNo. 13-1635                  Bible Believers, et al. v.

Page 5\n\nAmericans in the country—second only to New York City.3                       Dearborn’s Arab American\npopulation is comprised of both Christian and Muslim families whose national origins include\nLebanon, Armenia, Yemen, Iraq, and Palestine, among other nations.4\n\n        Beginning in 1996 and continuing for 17 years thereafter, each June, Dearborn celebrated\nits Arab heritage and culture by hosting the Arab International Festival. The Festival, which was\nfree to the public, featured Middle Eastern food, music, artisan booths, cultural acts, and other\namusements, including carnival rides. A principal purpose of the Festival was to promote\ncultural exchange. Each year, the Festival took place on a stretch of Warren Avenue, covering\nseveral blocks temporarily closed to vehicular traffic.                The street became a pedestrian\nthoroughfare lined with vendors and information booths. The brick and mortar stores lining the\nWarren sidewalks also remained open. The Festival attracted people from around the world, and\nby 2012, it was the largest festival of its kind in the United States, annually drawing more than\n300,000 people over the course of three days.\n\n        Given the size of attendance and the Festival’s focus on cultural exchange, a diverse\narray of religious groups requested permission to set up information booths on the Festival\ngrounds.5     The Festival also had a history of attracting certain Christian evangelists who\npreferred to roam free among the crowd and proselytize to the large number of Muslims who\nwere typically in attendance each year.6 These evangelists would come from across the country\nto distribute leaflets up and down the sidewalks of Warren Avenue in the heart of the Festival.\nThis practice was disrupted in 2009 when the Dearborn police enforced an anti-leafletting policy\npromoted by the American Arab Chamber of Commerce—the Festival’s primary sponsor—and\n\n        3\n          G.

These groups were stationed under one tent, along with\nother non-religious organizations seeking to share information.\n        6\n          The Muslim population in Dearborn is notable, distinctly, for its relative size and longtime\npresence; both the largest mosque and one of the oldest mosques in the United States are located in\nDearborn.

Wayne County, et al.                  Page 6\n\nratified by the City. A panel of this Court subsequently held that Dearborn’s anti-leafletting\npolicy unconstitutionally encroached on the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment\nbecause it failed to serve a substantial government interest and it was not narrowly tailored, as is\nrequired with respect to any time, place, or manner restriction on protected speech. See Saieg v.\nCity of Dearborn, 641 F.3d 727 (6th Cir. 2011). The City of Dearborn thereafter ceded to the\nWayne County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) primary responsibility over Festival security in future\nyears.\n\n         B.       The Bible Believers\n\n         The Bible Believers were among the self-described evangelical groups that attended the\nFestival for the purpose of spreading their Christian beliefs. The founder and leader of the Bible\nBelievers, known as “Israel,” testified that due to his sincerely held religious beliefs he was\nrequired “to try and convert non-believers, and call sinners to repent.” Therefore, Israel and his\nBible Believers regularly engaged in street preaching, which consisted of advocating for their\nChristian beliefs and parading around with banners, signs, and tee-shirts that displayed messages\nassociated with those beliefs. Many of the signs and messages displayed by the Bible Believers\ncommunicated overtly anti-Muslim sentiments.\n\n         In 2011, Israel attended the Festival with a number of Bible Believers to preach to the\ncrowd of Festival-goers. Upon their arrival at the Festival on Friday, June 17, 2011, the Bible\nBelievers were directed to a protected area on the Festival grounds referred to as a “free speech\nzone.” When they returned to the Festival on Sunday, June 19, the Bible Believers were\ninformed that the free speech zone had been removed and would not be made available again.\nThe Bible Believers therefore opted to walk the public streets and sidewalks, spreading their\nmessage to those who passed by. The quintessential attribute of the Bible Believers’ message\nwas intolerance, principally proclaiming that Mohammed was a false prophet who lied to them\nand that Muslims would be damned to hell if they failed to repent by rejecting Islam.7 This\nmessage was not well received by certain elements of the crowd. The Bible Believers allege that\nthey were assaulted by various members of the crowd and that the WCSO initially watched and\n\n\n         7\n          We presume that the character of the Bible Believers’ activities in 2011 was similar if not essentially the\nsame as their activities in 2012, although the record is devoid of a specific factual account of the 2011 Festival.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.        Page 7\n\ndid nothing, then eventually silenced the Bible Believers by kicking them out and requiring them\nto leave the Festival grounds. They also alleged that Deputy Chief Jaafar personally arrested one\nof the Bible Believers to the delight of the “violent Muslims.” No formal action was taken by\neither party as a result of this alleged incident.\n\n        C.      May 2012 Pre-Festival Letters and Preparation\n\n        Israel and his Bible Believers determined to return to Dearborn the following year for the\n2012 Arab International Festival.       Prior to the Festival, the Bible Believers, through their\ncounsel, sent a letter to Defendants Wayne County and Sheriff Napoleon recounting the Bible\nBelievers’ experience at the 2011 Festival. The letter also apprised Defendants of the Bible\nBelievers’ expectations for the group’s return visit:\n\n        In light of the past actions by the officers, I write to remind the Wayne County\n        Sheriff’s Department [sic] of two points. First, the officers have a duty to protect\n        speakers like Israel from the reactions of hostile audiences. See Glasson v. City of\n        Louisville, 518 F.2d 899, 906 (6th Cir. 1975) (“A police officer has the duty not to\n        ratify and effectuate a heckler’s veto nor may he join a moiling mob intent on\n        suppressing ideas. Instead, he must take reasonable action to protect from\n        violence persons exercising their constitutional rights.”). If the officers allow a\n        hostile audience to silence a speaker, the officers themselves effectively silence\n        the speaker and effectuate a “heckler’s veto.” The First Amendment simply does\n        not countenance this scenario. See, e.g., Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 134; Boos v.\n        Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 320-21 (1998). See also Smith v. Ross, 482 F.2d 33, 37\n        (6th Cir. 1973) (“[S]tate officials are not entitled to rely on community hostility as\n        an excuse not to protect, by inaction or affirmative conduct, the exercise of\n        fundamental rights.”). Second, Israel has the First Amendment right to engage in\n        peaceful expression on streets and sidewalks during the Arab International\n        Festival. See, e.g., Saieg v. City of Dearborn, 641 F.3d 727, 737-41 (6th Cir.\n        2011) (invaliding [sic] ban on literature distribution on public sidewalks open to\n        public during the Arab International Festival).\n\n(R. 13-7, May 9, 2012 Ctr. for Relig. Expression Ltr., PGID 110).\n\n        Wayne County, through its Corporation Counsel, responded by letter on June 14, 2012.\nThe letter indicated Wayne County’s disagreement with respect to both the characterization of\nevents at the 2011 Festival and with the Bible Believers’ interpretation of the law regarding the\nWCSO’s duties to the public and to the Bible Believers.            Corporation Counsel noted the\nWCSO’s intent to “maintain public order consistent with its legal obligations,” but specifically\ndisclaimed any “‘special relationship’ between the WCSO and Mr. Israel” to avoid the\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 8\n\npossibility that Israel would assert in subsequent litigation that the WCSO owed Bible Believers\na heightened measure of protection. (R. 13-8, Corp. Counsel Reply, PGID 112).\n\n        The letter went on to “remind [the Bible Believers] that, under state law and local\nordinances, individuals can be held criminally accountable for conduct which has the tendency to\nincite riotous behavior or otherwise disturb the peace.” (Id. at 113). In conclusion, Corporation\nCounsel likewise cited to Sixth Circuit precedent to support the County’s view that its\nobligations to protect the Bible Believers’ speechmaking had limitations:\n\n        [L]aw enforcement personnel are not required “to defend the right of a speaker to\n        address a hostile audience, however large and intemperate, when to do so would\n        unreasonably subject them to violent retaliation and physical injury.” Glasson v.\n        City of Louisville, 518 F.2d 899 at 909 (6th Cir. 1975). Rather, “[i]n such\n        circumstances, they may discharge their duty of preserving the peace by\n        intercepting his message or by removing the speaker for his own protection\n        . . . [.]”\n\n(Id. at 113).\n\n        Earlier that month, Deputy Chief Jaafar circulated an Operations Plan memorandum,\naddressed to Sheriff Napoleon, which outlined the policies and procedures to be followed by the\nWCSO throughout the course of the 2012 Arab International Festival. The second item in the\nmemorandum addressed potential “situation[s]” that could lead to trouble at the Festival. Among\nthe purported situations was “a radical group calling themselves ‘The Bible Believers’” that had\nbeen attracted to the Festival in recent years, and that would “possibly show up at the festival\ntrying to provoke [the WCSO] in a negative manner and attempt to capture the negativity on\nvideo camera.” (13-5, Ops. Plan, PGID 100). Deputy Chief Jaafar instructed his officers “to be\nalert and professional at all times . . . [and to] [r]epeat as many times as necessary” the\nappropriate orders to any group causing trouble. (Id.) As an example, he suggested repeating\nthe following command: “Sir, you are causing a disturbance, please keep moving.” (Id.) He\nalso noted that the WCSO would “not abridge or deny anyone’s Freedom of Speech, unless\npublic safety becomes [a] paramount concern.” (Id.)\n\n        The WCSO decided to employ both regular and reserve officers “to ensure public safety,\nkeep the peace, and maintain order in the event there is a disturbance.” (Id. at 101). According\nto Deputy Chief Richardson, a greater number of WCSO personnel were “allocated to the\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 9\n\nFestival . . . than . . . to the World Series or to the President of the United States when he visits\nMichigan.” (R. 13-6, Richardson Aff., PGID 107). The number of personnel also exceeded the\nnumber “allocated to other large festivals in Michigan.” (Id.) The Operations Plan listed\n51 officers (excluding those in command), most of whom were assigned to one of six zones.\nAmong this group, there were also 19 officers (including 6 mounted units) who were not\nassigned to any one specific zone, allowing them to respond to changing needs and\ncircumstances.\n\n        D.        The 2012 Arab International Festival8\n\n        The Bible Believers returned to Dearborn in 2012, at approximately 5:00 p.m. on Friday,\nJune 15, for the 17th Annual Arab International Festival. As they had done the previous year,\nthe Bible Believers traveled to the Festival so that they could exercise their sincerely held\nreligious beliefs. Unfortunately for the Festival-goers, those beliefs compelled Israel and his\nfollowers to hurl words and display messages offensive to a predominantly Muslim crowd, many\nof whom were adolescents. These messages were written on their tee-shirts and on the banners\nand signs that they carried. The following is a sampling of the Bible Believers’ messages:\n\n                                “Islam Is A Religion of Blood and Murder”\n            “Jesus Is the Way, the Truth and the Life. All Others Are Thieves and Robbers”\n                                 “Prepare to Meet Thy God – Amos 4:12”\n   “Jesus Is the Judge, Therefore Repent, Be Converted That Your Sins May Be Blotted Out”\n                                “Trust Jesus, Repent and Believe in Jesus”\n                         “Only Jesus Christ Can Save You From Sin and Hell”\n                                                “Turn or Burn”\n                                                   “Fear God”\n\n(R. 20-2, Israel Decl., PGID 176–77). In addition to the signs, one of the Bible Believers carried\na severed pig’s head on a spike, because, in Israel’s own words, it would “ke[ep] [the Muslims]\nat bay” since “unfortunately, they are kind of petrified of that animal.” (R. 28-A, Raw Festival\nFootage, Time: 00:49:45).\n\n        8\n          Most of the facts regarding the 2012 Arab International Festival are derived from a video recording that\nthe Bible Believers made during the Festival in order to contemporaneously memorialize their free speech activities.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 10\n\n       Laden with this imagery, the Bible Believers entered the Festival and began their\npreaching. At first, few people paid attention other than to glance at what appeared to be an odd\nassembly. The first speaker told the crowd that they should not follow “a false prophet,” who\nwas nothing but an “unclean drawing” and “a pedophile.” (Id. at 00:01:40). He continued by\ntelling what was by then a group made up of approximately thirty teenagers that “[y]our religion\nwill send you to hell.” (Id. at 00:03:30). Tensions started to rise as a few youths became\nincensed after the speaker taunted, “You believe in a prophet who is a pervert. Your prophet who\nwants to molest a child,” and “God will reject you. God will put your religion into hellfire when\nyou die.” (Id. at 00:03:56, 00:04:38). This continued as a few of the teens became agitated, until\none youth simply told his friends to “quit giving them attention,” convincing some members of\nthe crowd to disperse. (Id. at 00:06:07).\n\n       After approximately seven minutes of proselytizing, some elements of the crowd began\nto express their anger by throwing plastic bottles and other debris at the Bible Believers. An\nofficer was captured on video observing the scene without intervening or reprimanding the\njuvenile offenders. The size of the crowd ebbed and flowed. At one point an officer approached\nthe Bible Believers and commanded that the speakers stop using a megaphone or be cited for\nviolating city ordinances. The Bible Believers relented, but also responded by noting that “these\nangry kids are a little bit more vicious than the megaphone.” (Id. at 00:16:16). A few minutes\nlater, an officer did ask the kids to back up and subsequently removed one of the teenagers who\nhe saw throwing a bottle. However, all police presence and intervention dissipated after this\nminimal and isolated intervention.\n\n       The Bible Believers continued preaching for another ten minutes without the megaphone,\nall while a growing group of teenagers jeered and heckled, some throwing bottles and others\nshouting profanities. At one point, a parent stepped in to reprimand his child for participating in\nthe assault. The onslaught reached its climax when a few kids began throwing larger items such\nas milk crates. By that time, the Bible Believers had stopped all speechmaking whatsoever.\n\n       A number of debates spawned between members of the crowd (which had continued to\nswell) and individual Bible Believers. A particularly emotional youth debated with a Bible\nBeliever the merits of his group’s bigoted views, noting that he had studied both the Quran and\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.          Page 11\n\nthe Bible, and that Muslims believe in the same First Testament as the followers of Christianity.\nThis brief moment of reasoned debated devolved into a shouting match, and ended when the\nyouth was pulled away by an unidentified individual.\n\n        A few minutes later, the crowd of youths became quiet after four mounted officers simply\nrode by, without making commands or pausing—even for a moment. The calm persisted while\nIsrael gave an interview to a local news crew. But once this interview ended, and the police and\ncamera crews left the scene, the Bible Believers again were assaulted with flying debris. The\nBible Believers turned away from the crowd and started moving through the Festival for a\nsecond time. A large contingent of children ran after them, and the relatively light cascade of\ndebris intensified into a barrage of bottles, eggs, and other debris being hurled upon the Bible\nBelievers. When the Bible Believers again resettled at a new location, and with their backs no\nlonger facing the crowd, the torrent died down. At some point during the deluge, Israel was\nstruck in the face, which resulted in him suffering a small laceration.\n\n        When an officer arrived on the scene a few minutes later, the children’s belligerence and\nthe assaultive behavior again ceased. The officer bellowed at a few youths to move out of the\nway; they complied immediately. He then told Israel, “you are a danger to public safety right\nnow,” and stated that the WCSO did not have the manpower to keep the Bible Believers safe.\n(Id. at 00:43:12). The officer then suggested that the Bible Believers always “have the option to\nleave,” while he simultaneously ignored Israel’s plea that some sort of police presence just\nremain in the general vicinity. The officer departed, and the bottle throwing resumed.\n\n        A few minutes later, a group of officers returned to the area and cut a path through the\ncrowd in order to approach Israel and his followers. Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar pulled\nIsrael aside for the purpose of telling him that the Bible Believers would be escorted out of the\nFestival. But Israel responded that he was unprepared to leave without having the opportunity to\nfinish walking his parade route while exercising his First Amendment rights.\n\n        Richardson explained to Israel, “We have the responsibility of policing the entire festival,\nand obviously your conduct especially is causing this disturbance and it is a direct threat to the\nsafety of everyone here.” (Id. at 00:48:30). He also noted that “part of the reason they throw this\nstuff . . . is that you tell them stuff that enrages them.” (Id. at 00:49:03). Israel protested, first by\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 12\n\nnoting that the disturbances only occurred in the absence of any police presence, and second, by\ncommenting that the Bible Believers had stopped preaching altogether during the previous\ntwenty minutes and were only carrying signs. Israel suggested that if the WCSO just assigned\ntwo officers to insure that the crowd of adolescents surrounding the Bible Believers’\ndemonstration remained nonviolent, all concerns about public safety would be resolved. Deputy\nChief Jaafar chimed in at this point by telling Israel that the WCSO could not provide individual\nofficers for every group that wanted to protest at the Festival, and that Israel’s group needed to\nleave because his group’s conduct was “attracting a crowd and . . . affecting public safety.” (Id.\nat 00:50:40). When Israel continued to protest that he was not speaking and his signs were\npermissible, Richardson, again, pointed to the Bible Believers’ speech as the cause for the unrest.\nHe stated, “ya know, apparently what you are saying to them and what they are saying back to\nyou is creating danger.” (Id. at 00:50:48). Richardson continued suggesting that Israel leave, but\nIsrael refused to do so unless the WCSO was prepared to threaten Israel with the prospect of\nbeing arrested. Richardson expressed fear that the situation was escalating and stated, “the\nproblem is that one of your people’s gonna get hurt, or one of the crowd is gonna get hurt, or one\nof my officers is gonna get hurt.” (Id. at 00:52:41). When Israel again inquired whether the\nBible Believers would be arrested if they did not leave the Festival, Richardson only committed\nto saying that they would “probably” be cited if they did not allow themselves to be escorted out.\nHe thereafter told Israel that the Bible Believers were being “disorderly,” to which Israel replied,\nincredulously, “I would assume 200 angry Muslim children throwing bottles is more of a threat\nthan a few guys with signs.” (Id. at 00:53:48).\n\n       Following this exchange, Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar conferred with\nCorporation Counsel. Another half dozen officers stood along the edge of the barricaded area to\nwhich the Bible Believers had been secluded. On the other side of the barricade, the Festival\ncontinued. Richardson returned to speak with Israel and confirmed that Israel and his Bible\nBelievers would be cited for disorderly conduct if they did not immediately leave the Festival.\n(Id. at 00:55:03) (“If you don’t leave we’re gonna cite you for disorderly.”). Israel complied, and\nthe Bible Believers were escorted out of the Festival by more than a dozen officers. Four\nmounted officers also surveyed the scene on the edge of the Festival where the Bible Believers\nwere being directed to exit.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.     Page 13\n\n       The Bible Believers loaded into a van and departed. However, two WCSO cruisers\nimmediately began following the van and pulled the Bible Believers over within only a few\nblocks of the Festival—a third cruiser pulled up shortly thereafter. Officers claimed that the\nBible Believers were stopped because they had removed the license plate from their vehicle prior\nto their departure. After waiting for nearly thirty minutes, they were issued a citation. By that\ntime, two additional officers had arrived on bicycles, bringing the total number of law\nenforcement personnel involved in this traffic stop to eight officers.\n\n       The WCSO made a post-operation report summarizing its version of the day’s events.\nThe report noted that the WCSO was “able to ke[ep] reasonable control of civil peace[, but] [a]s\nthe crowd progress[ed] around the protestors to an unsafe level, we suggested to the protestors to\nleave the area immediately because public safety was being jeopardized.” (R. 13-9, Post-Op.\nRpt., PGID 114). The report further noted that “[a]ny subjects that were seen throwing objects\n[were] immediately taken into custody.” (Id.). They apparently did not see very much. Only\none citation was issued to a 21-year old man who was caught throwing a bottle. The WCSO\nofficers also issued three verbal warnings and briefly detained three juveniles, ranging in age\nfrom twelve to seventeen, before ultimately releasing them to the custody of their respective\nparents.\n\n       In summary, the Bible Believers attended the 2012 Festival for the purpose of exercising\ntheir First Amendment rights by spreading their anti-Islam religious message. When a crowd of\nyouthful hecklers gathered around the Bible Believers, the police did nothing.          When the\nhecklers began throwing bottles and other garbage at the Bible Believers, a WCSO officer\nintervened only to demand that the Bible Believers stop utilizing their megaphone to amplify\ntheir speech. Virtually absent from the video in the record is any indication that the police\nattempted to quell the violence being directed toward the Bible Believers by the lawless crowd of\nadolescents. Despite this apparent lack of effort to maintain any semblance of order at the\nFestival, each time the police appeared on the video—to reprimand the use of the Bible\nBelievers’ megaphone, to suggest that the Bible Believers had the “option to leave” the Festival,\nto trot by on horseback while doing next to nothing, and to expel the Bible Believers from the\nFestival under threat of arrest—the agitated crowd became subdued and orderly simply due the\nauthoritative presence cast by the police officers who were then in close proximity. Only once is\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.     Page 14\n\nan officer seen removing one of the bottle-throwing teens. Israel, when faced with the prospect\nof being arrested for disorderly conduct, observed, “and you would think we would be\ncomplaining, but we’re not.” (R. 28-A, Raw Festival Footage, Time: 00:55:16). The Bible\nBelievers were thereafter escorted from the Festival and ticketed by a large group of WCSO\nofficers for removing the license plate from their van.\n\n                                       Procedural History\n\n       On September 25, 2012, the Bible Believers initiated this suit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The complaint\nalleged that Defendants violated the Bible Believers’ rights of free speech and free exercise,\nprotected by the First Amendment, as well as their right to equal protection of the laws,\nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants answered, and then subsequently moved,\nsimultaneously, for summary judgment and dismissal of all of the Bible Believers’ claims. The\nBible Believers filed a response to Defendants’ motion, which included a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, and Defendants filed a reply. The district court issued an opinion granting\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, denying the Bible Believers’ cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, and dismissing the Bible Believers’ claims.\n\n       The Bible Believers thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal. The issues were briefed\nand the case was argued before a three-judge panel of this Court the following year. The panel,\nin a split decision, affirmed the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to\nWayne County and the individual Defendants. Bible Believers v. Wayne Cty., 765 F.3d 578\n(6th Cir. 2014). The Bible Believers petitioned for en banc rehearing. We granted that petition,\nthereby vacating the panel opinion, id. (opinion vacated, reh’g en banc granted Oct. 23, 2014),\nand heard oral argument for a second time on March 4, 2015.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       We review de novo an appeal from a grant of summary judgment. Gillie v. Law Office of\nEric A. Jones, LLC, 785 F.3d 1091, 1097 (6th Cir. 2015).

The facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party and the benefit of all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant must\nbe afforded to those facts. Id. The mere “scintilla of evidence” within the record that militates\nagainst the overwhelming weight of contradictory corroboration does not create a genuine issue\nof fact. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).\n\n                                                    Analysis\n\nI.      The First Amendment and the “Heckler’s Veto”\n\n        Free-speech claims require a three-step inquiry: first, we determine whether the speech at\nissue is afforded constitutional protection; second, we examine the nature of the forum where the\nspeech was made; and third, we assess whether the government’s action in shutting off the\nspeech was legitimate, in light of the applicable standard of review. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal\nDef. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797 (1985); Saieg, 641 F.3d at 734–35.\n\n        We need only to address steps one and three because the parties agree that the Festival\nconstituted a traditional public forum available to all forms of protected expression.9 The parties\nstrenuously dispute whether the Bible Believers’ conduct constituted incitement to riot, and they\nalso dispute the level of scrutiny that should be applied to this case. Ultimately, we find that\nDefendants violated the Bible Believers’ First Amendment rights because there can be no\nlegitimate dispute based on this record that the WCSO effectuated a heckler’s veto by cutting off\nthe Bible Believers’ protected speech in response to a hostile crowd’s reaction.\n\n        We address the following items in turn: protected versus unprotected speech; the\nappropriate level of scrutiny to be applied in a public forum given the facts of this case; the\nprecedents upon which the heckler’s veto doctrine is built; the rule derived from those\nprecedents; and the rule’s application to this case. We then address whether the individual\n\n        9\n           Defendants ostensibly concede that the Bible Believers’ speech and expression were protected, but the\nthrust of their arguments belies their purported concession. Therefore, a discussion of protected versus unprotected\nspeech is merited.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.        Page 16\n\nDefendants are liable or, instead, can seek refuge in the affirmative defense of qualified\nimmunity. Finally, we consider whether Wayne County can be held liable for the actions of its\nlaw enforcement personnel.\n\n       A.      Protected Speech\n\n       The First Amendment offers sweeping protection that allows all manner of speech to\nenter the marketplace of ideas. This protection applies to loathsome and unpopular speech with\nthe same force as it does to speech that is celebrated and widely accepted. The protection would\nbe unnecessary if it only served to safeguard the majority views. In fact, it is the minority view,\nincluding expressive behavior that is deemed distasteful and highly offensive to the vast majority\nof people, that most often needs protection under the First Amendment. See, e.g., Nat’l Socialist\nParty of Am. v. Vill. of Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 43–44 (1977) (recognizing First Amendment rights\nof Neo Nazis seeking to march with swastikas and to distribute racist and anti-Semitic\npropaganda in a predominantly Jewish community); Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447\n(1969) (recognizing the First Amendment rights of Ku Klux Klan members to advocate for white\nsupremacy-based political reform achieved through violent means); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S.\n397, 405–06 (1989) (recognizing flag burning as a form of political expression protected by the\nFirst Amendment); Snyder, 562 U.S. 443, 454–56 (2011) (recognizing a religious sect’s right to\npicket military funerals). “[I]f it is the speaker’s opinion that gives offense, that consequence is a\nreason for according it constitutional protection.” Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S.\n46, 55 (1988) (citation omitted). Religious views are no different. “After all, much political and\nreligious speech might be perceived as offensive to some.” Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393,\n409 (2007). Accordingly, “[t]he right to free speech . . . includes the right to attempt to persuade\nothers to change their views, and may not be curtailed simply because the speaker’s message\nmay be offensive to his audience.” Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 716 (2000). Any other rule\n“would effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of personal\npredilections,” Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 21 (1971), and the government might be\ninclined to “regulate” offensive speech as “a convenient guise for banning the expression of\nunpopular views.” Id. at 26. We tolerate the speech with which we disagree. When confronted\nby offensive, thoughtless, or baseless speech that we believe to be untrue, the “answer is\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 17\n\n[always] more speech.” Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 135 S. Ct. 1656, 1684 (2015) (Kennedy, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n        Despite the First Amendment’s broad sweep, not all speech is entitled to its sanctuary.\nThere are a limited number of categorical exclusions from the comprehensive protection offered\nby the Free Speech Clause.10 These exclusions are rooted in history and tradition, and include\nonly those forms of expression that are “long familiar to the bar” as falling outside the confines\nof First Amendment protection. United States v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537, 2544 (2012) (plurality\nopinion) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Two areas of unprotected speech that\nhave particular relevance to the interaction between offensive speakers and hostile crowds are\n“incitement to violence” (also known as “incitement to riot”) and “fighting words.” Both classes\nof speech are discussed below.\n\n                 1.       Incitement\n\n        The right to freedom of speech provides that a state cannot “proscribe advocacy of the\nuse of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing\nimminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” Brandenburg, 395 U.S.\nat 447 (footnote omitted). Advocacy for the use of force or lawless behavior, intent, and\nimminence, are all absent from the record in this case. The doctrine of incitement has absolutely\nno application to these facts.\n\n        The Bible Believers’ speech advocated for their Christian beliefs and for harboring\ncontempt for Islam.        This advocacy was purportedly intended to convince Muslims at the\nFestival that they should convert to Christianity. Regardless of the wisdom or efficacy of this\nstrategy, or of the gross intolerance the speakers’ conduct epitomized, disparaging the views of\nanother to support one’s own cause is protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., Snyder,\n562 U.S. at 454 (placards reading “You’re Going to Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” and “God Hates\nFags,” “certainly convey[ed] . . . [a] position on those issues” and constituted protected speech).\n\n\n\n        10\n          Obscenity, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), defamation, N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.\n254 (1964), fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio,\n395 U.S. 444 (1969), and information deleterious to national security, N.Y. Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713\n(1971).\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.          Page 18\n\n       The only references to violence or lawlessness on the part of the Bible Believers were\nmessages such as, “Islam is a Religion of Blood and Murder,” “Turn or Burn,” and “Your\nprophet is a pedophile.” These messages, however offensive, do not advocate for, encourage,\ncondone, or even embrace imminent violence or lawlessness. Although it might be inferred that\nthe Bible Believers’ speech was intended to anger their target audience, the record is devoid of\nany indication that they intended imminent lawlessness to ensue. Quite to the contrary, the Bible\nBelievers contacted Wayne County prior to their visit, requesting that the WCSO keep the public\nat bay so that the Bible Believers could “engage in their peaceful expression.”\n\n       It is not an easy task to find that speech rises to such a dangerous level that it can be\ndeemed incitement to riot. And unsurprisingly, “[t]here will rarely be enough evidence to create\na jury question on whether a speaker was intending to incite imminent crime.” Eugene Volokh,\nCrime-Facilitating Speech, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 1095, 1190 (2005).\n\n       In Hess v. Indiana, the Supreme Court held that a protestor who yelled, “We’ll take the\nfucking street again,” amidst an agitated crowd that was already resisting police authority could\nnot be punished for his speech. 414 U.S. 105, 107 (1973). Because “[t]he mere tendency of\nspeech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it,” Ashcroft v. Free\nSpeech Coal., 535 U.S. 234, 253 (2002), speech that fails to specifically advocate for listeners to\ntake “any action” cannot constitute incitement. Hess, 414 U.S. at 109.\n\n       Wayne County relies on Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315 (1951), to support the\nproposition that the Bible Believers’ speech was subject to sanction, and that such sanction does\nnot offend the Constitution. In Feiner, the Supreme Court upheld a conviction for breach of the\npeace where, in the context of a civil rights rally, a speaker “gave the impression that he was\nendeavoring to arouse the Negro people against the whites, urging that they rise up in arms and\nfight for equal rights.” Id. at 317. The majority, over a vigorous dissent, supported its holding\nby relying on police testimony that the crowd had become restless, “and there was some pushing,\nshoving and milling around.” Id. The majority described the scenario as a “crisis.” Id. at 321.\nThus, it has been said that Feiner “endorses a Heckler’s Veto.” Harry Kalven, Jr., A Worthy\nTradition: Freedom of Speech in America 89 (Jamie Kalven ed. 1988).\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.        Page 19\n\n       The better view of Feiner is summed up, simply, by the following truism: when a speaker\nincites a crowd to violence, his incitement does not receive constitutional protection.\nSee Glasson v. City of Louisville, 518 F.2d 899, 905 n.3 (6th Cir. 1975) (“For over twenty years\nthe Supreme Court has confined the rule in Feiner to a situation where the speaker in urging his\nopinion upon an audience intends to incite it to take action that the state has a right to prevent.”).\nFeiner lends little support for the notion that the Bible Believers’ speech amounted to incitement.\nThe Bible Believers did not ask their audience to rise up in arms and fight for their beliefs, let\nalone request that they hurl bottles and other garbage upon the Bible Believers’ heads.\n\n       Subsequent Supreme Court precedent illustrates that the speaker’s advocacy in Feiner\nitself could no longer be sanctioned as incitement. See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 553 U.S.\n285, 298–99 (2008) (“To be sure, there remains an important distinction between a proposal to\nengage in illegal activity and the abstract advocacy of illegality.”); NAACP v. Claiborne\nHardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 928 (1982) (“[T]he mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral\npropriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing\na group for violent action and steeling it to such action.” (citation omitted)); Communist Party of\nInd. v. Whitcomb, 414 U.S. 441, 450 (1974) (rejecting the notion that “any group that advocates\nviolen[ce] . . . as an abstract doctrine must be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful\naction”); see also 5 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law:\nSubstance and Procedure § 20.39(a) (5th ed. 2013) (noting that “[t]he authority of Feiner has\nbeen undercut significantly in subsequent [Supreme Court] cases”). In Claiborne Hardware Co.,\na speaker explicitly proposed to a large crowd that anyone who failed to abide by the terms of an\nagreed upon boycott would have to be “disciplined.” 458 U.S. at 902. The speaker also stated,\n“If we catch any of you going in any of them racist stores, we’re gonna break your damn neck.”\nId. Nonetheless, this speech was not deemed by the Court to be incitement. Id. at 928–29.\n\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to Brandenburg—not Feiner—as establishing\nthe test for incitement. See, e.g., Whitcomb, 414 U.S. at 447–48 (“We most recently summarized\nthe constitutional principles that have evolved in this area[—incitement—]in Brandenburg.”);\nClaiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. at 928 (“The emotionally charged rhetoric of [the plaintiff’s]\nspeeches did not transcend the bounds of protected speech set forth in Brandenburg.”); see also\nJames v. Meow Media, Inc., 300 F.3d 683, 698 (6th Cir. 2002) (“The Court firmly set out the test\n\fNo. 13-1635                  Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.             Page 20\n\nfor whether speech constitutes unprotected incitement to violence in Brandenburg.”).                       The\nBrandenburg test precludes speech from being sanctioned as incitement to riot unless (1) the\nspeech explicitly or implicitly encouraged the use of violence or lawless action,11 (2) the speaker\nintends that his speech will result in the use of violence or lawless action, and (3) the imminent\nuse of violence or lawless action is the likely result of his speech. 395 U.S. at 477. The Bible\nBelievers’ speech was not incitement to riot simply because they did not utter a single word that\ncan be perceived as encouraging violence or lawlessness. Moreover, there is absolutely no\nindication of the Bible Believers’ subjective intent to spur their audience to violence. The hostile\nreaction of a crowd does not transform protected speech into incitement.\n\n                 2.      Fighting Words\n\n        A second type of speech that is categorically excluded from First Amendment protection\nis known as “fighting words.” This category of unprotected speech encompasses words that\nwhen spoken aloud instantly “inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.”\nChaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942); see also Sandul v. Larion, 119 F.3d\n1250, 1255 (6th Cir. 1997). We rely on an objective standard to draw the boundaries of this\ncategory—no advocacy can constitute fighting words unless it is “likely to provoke the average\nperson to retaliation.” Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 592 (1969) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Offensive statements made generally to a crowd are\nnot excluded from First Amendment protection; the insult or offense must be directed\nspecifically at an individual. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 432 (1992) (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring); accord Cohen, 403 U.S. at 20 (defining fighting words as a “direct personal insult”).\nThe Bible Believers’ speech cannot be construed as fighting words because it was not directed at\nany individual. Furthermore, the average individual attending the Festival did not react with\nviolence, and of the group made up of mostly adolescents, only a certain percentage engaged in\nbottle throwing when they heard the proselytizing.\n\n\n        11\n           Incitement requires, in the view of some constitutional scholars, that “the words used by the speaker\nobjectively encouraged and urged and provoked imminent action.” 5 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak,\nTreatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure § 20.15(d) (Online ed. May 2015) (Westlaw subscription)\n(citing Hess, 414 U.S. 105; Volokh, supra, Crime-Facilitating Speech). Brandenburg’s plain language (reinforced\nby Hess) requires that the words must, at minimum, implicitly encourage the use of force or lawlessness, or the\nundertaking of some violent “act”; therefore, we say so explicitly today with little fanfare.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 21\n\n        B.     Free Speech in Public Fora\n\n        Next, we must determine the character of Defendants’ actions.          In public fora, the\ngovernment’s rights to “limit expressive activity are sharply circumscribed.” Perry Educ. Ass’n\nv. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983); see also Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S.\n474, 480 (1988) (public streets are the “archetype of a traditional public forum”). Speech\nrestrictions in these fora fall into two categories: content-based restrictions or time, place, and\nmanner restrictions that are content-neutral. United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983);\nSaieg, 641 F.3d at 734. The parties’ dispute is centered on whether Wayne County’s actions\nwere content neutral—a distinction that determines the applicable level of constitutional scrutiny.\nConnection Distrib. Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 290 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\n        “Listeners’ reaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis for regulation,” Forsyth Cty.\nv. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 134 (1992), or for taking an enforcement action against a\npeaceful speaker. See Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 133 n.1 (1966) (“Participants in an\norderly demonstration in a public place are not chargeable with the danger . . . that their critics\nmight react with disorder or violence.”); Glasson, 518 F.2d at 905. Therefore, we find that\nWayne County’s actions were decidedly content-based. It is indisputable that the WCSO acted\nagainst the Bible Believers in response to the crowd’s negative reaction.            Deputy Chief\nRichardson told Israel, “your conduct especially is causing this disturbance;” “part of the reason\nthey throw this stuff . . . is that you tell them stuff that enrages them;” “apparently what you are\nsaying to them and what they are saying back to you is creating danger;” and therefore, “[i]f you\ndon’t leave we’re gonna cite you for disorderly.”\n\n        The sum of Wayne County’s counter-argument to the charge that the Bible Believers’\nexpulsion was motivated by the views they espoused is merely that the WCSO Operations Plan\nwas content-neutral, and that the WCSO’s only consideration was maintaining the public safety.\nThis contention fails in the face of abundant evidence that the police have effectuated a heckler’s\nveto.   It is irrelevant whether the Operations Plan is content-neutral because the officers\nenforcing it are ordained with broad discretion to determine, based on listener reaction, that a\nparticular expressive activity is creating a public danger. Cf. Police Dep’t of Chi. v. Mosley,\n408 U.S. 92, 97 (1972) (“[B]ecause of their potential use as instruments for selectively\n\fNo. 13-1635                  Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.    Page 22\n\nsuppressing some points of view, this Court has condemned licensing schemes that lodge broad\ndiscretion in a public official to permit speech-related activity.”); see also Ctr. for Bio-Ethical\nReform, Inc. v. L.A. Cty. Sheriff Dep’t, 533 F.3d 780, 787 (9th Cir. 2008) (“If the statute, as read\nby the police officers on the scene, would allow or disallow speech depending on the reaction of\nthe audience, then the ordinance would run afoul of an independent species of prohibitions on\ncontent-restrictive regulations, often described as a First Amendment-based ban on the ‘heckler’s\nveto.’” (citing Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.S. 564, 567 (1970))).\n\n       C.      The Heckler’s Veto and Police Obligations\n\n       It is a fundamental precept of the First Amendment that the government cannot favor the\nrights of one private speaker over those of another. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). Accordingly, content-based restrictions on constitutionally\nprotected speech are anathema to the First Amendment and are deemed “presumptively invalid.”\nYsursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass’n, 555 U.S. 353, 358 (2009). An especially “egregious” form of\ncontent-based discrimination is that which is designed to exclude a particular point of view from\nthe marketplace of ideas. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829; Perry Educ. Ass’n, 460 U.S. at 62\n(Brennan, J., dissenting) (“Viewpoint discrimination is censorship in its purest form and\ngovernment regulation that discriminates among viewpoints threatens the continued vitality of\n‘free speech.’”). The heckler’s veto is precisely that type of odious viewpoint discrimination.\nCf. Police Dep’t of Chi., 408 U.S. at 98 (“‘[T]o deny this . . . group use of the streets because of\ntheir views . . . amounts . . . to an invidious discrimination.’” (quoting Cox, 379 U.S. at 581\n(Black, J., concurring))).\n\n       Both content- and viewpoint-based discrimination are subject to strict scrutiny. McCullen\nv. Coakley, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2530, 2534 (2014). No state action that limits protected speech will\nsurvive strict scrutiny unless the restriction is narrowly tailored to be the least-restrictive means\navailable to serve a compelling government interest. United States v. Playboy Entm’t Grp.,\n529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000). Punishing, removing, or by other means silencing a speaker due to\ncrowd hostility will seldom, if ever, constitute the least restrictive means available to serve a\nlegitimate government purpose. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940); Terminiello v.\nCity of Chi., 337 U.S. 1 (1949); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963); Cox v.\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                Page 23\n\nLouisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965); Gregory v. City of Chi., 394 U.S. 125 (1969). A review of\nSupreme Court precedent firmly establishes that the First Amendment does not countenance a\nheckler’s veto.\n\n                  1.      Early Cases: Clear and Present Danger\n\n        The “clear and present danger” test, first articulated by Justice Holmes in Schenck v.\nUnited States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), is a flexible means to protect speech while recognizing that\nthe government might have legitimate reasons for imposing speech-restrictions due to exigent\ncircumstances:\n\n        The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such\n        circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that\n        they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It\n        is a question of proximity and degree.\n\n249 U.S. at 52.12 The Supreme Court in Cantwell v. Connecticut and in Terminiello v. City of\nChicago utilized the clear and present danger test to establish the rights of speakers not to be\nsilenced on account of listeners’ hostility toward their message.\n\n        In Cantwell, a Jehovah’s Witness was convicted for inciting a breach of the peace after\ngoing into a predominantly Catholic neighborhood and playing (to bypassers who were willing\nto listen) a phonograph recording that demonized Catholicism. 310 U.S. at 302–03, 309. Two\nlisteners of the recording were so offended that they threatened the Witness that he better leave\nor face violent retaliation. Id. at 309. The Court recognized that with religion and politics in\nparticular, “[t]o persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, as we know, at times,\nresorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or\nstate, and even to false statement.” Id. at 310. Invoking the now-familiar clear and present\ndanger test, the Court found that the expressive activity did not fall outside of the confines of free\nspeech protection and therefore it could not lawfully be penalized by the state. Id. at 310–11.\n\n\n        12\n           Although this test was first introduced by Justice Holmes to uphold convictions of wartime dissenters\nunder the speech-repressive Espionage and Sedition Acts, Holmes continued to invoke this language in dissent\nthroughout the 1920s as a means to protect political speech, until it became firmly established as the governing rule\nfollowing its use in Justice Brandeis’ famous concurrence in Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927)—the\nfoundation of all modern First Amendment jurisprudence. David L. Hudson, Jr., Legal Almanac: The First\nAmendment: Freedom of Speech § 1:4 (Oct. 2012).\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 24\n\n        In Terminiello, the Supreme Court again applied the clear and present danger test to\noverturn a conviction based on a statute that allowed the state to punish speech based on crowd\nhostility—i.e. a heckler’s veto. 337 U.S. at 4–5. The hostility was quite real in that instance, as\nthe crowd had gathered outside the auditorium and begun throwing icepicks, bottles, and rocks,\nin response to the speaker’s remarks. Id. at 15 (Jackson, J., dissenting). Justice Douglas wrote\nfor the Court that “freedom of speech, though not absolute, is nevertheless protected against\ncensorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious\nsubstantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.” 337 U.S. at 4\n(citations omitted). He noted that constitutionally protected speech “may strike at prejudices and\npreconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.” Id.\nTherefore, the state cannot sanction speech, consistent with the Constitution, solely on the basis\nthat it “stirred people to anger, invited public dispute, or brought about a condition of unrest.”\nId. at 5.\n\n        Cantwell and Terminiello instruct that offensive religious proselytizing, as well as speech\nthat drives a crowd to extreme agitation, is not subject to sanction simply because of the violent\nreaction of offended listeners. Feiner came shortly after these cases, and it highlighted a\nsignificant flaw with the clear and present danger test in this context; chiefly, “it allows an\naudience reaction, if hostile enough, to be a basis for suppressing a speaker.”             Erwin\nChemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies 1041 (4th ed. 2011). The Supreme\nCourt recognized this flaw and eschewed any reliance on the clear and present danger test in the\ncivil-rights era cases involving hostile crowds. See, e.g., Gregory, 394 U.S. at 112–13. Those\ncases reasserted, as paramount, the right of the speaker to not be silenced.\n\n               2.      Civil-Rights Era: Protect the Speaker\n\n        In Edwards v. South Carolina, 187 black college and high school students were convicted\nfor breach of the peace following a peaceful protest, where, in small groups, the students\nmarched to the Columbia, South Carolina state house carrying placards bearing messages in\nsupport of equality and civil rights. 372 U.S. at 229–30. During the demonstration, between\n200 and 300 white observers gathered in a horseshoe around the students. Id. at 231. The police\nthreatened the students with arrest after “apprehend[ing] immin[ent] violence” by a number of\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 25\n\ntroublemakers in the crowd of onlookers. Id. at 245 (Clark, J., dissenting); id. at 231 & n.4\n(majority opinion). The Supreme Court reversed the convictions, distinguished Feiner as being a\ncase involving incitement, and reaffirmed Terminiello by recognizing that expressive activity\ncannot be proscribed merely because it “‘stirred people to anger, invited public dispute, or\nbrought about a condition of unrest.’” Id. at 238 (quoting Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 5).\n\n       Similarly, in Cox v. Louisiana, a student civil rights organizer led 2,000 fellow students\nin a peaceful protest outside of a courthouse in downtown Baton Rouge. 379 U.S. at 538–40.\nApproximately 100 to 300 white onlookers gathered to watch the protest. Id. at 541. When the\nstudent leader suggested to the protestors that they stage a sit-in at the segregated lunch counters\nin town, the crowd of onlookers reacted with jeers and became agitated. Id. at 550. Police\nfeared that “violence was about to erupt” from the crowd of onlookers and dispersed the student\nprotestors with a canister of tear gas, arresting the student leader the following day for breach of\nthe peace. Id. at 548, 550 n.12. The Supreme Court invoked Edwards, noting that the “evidence\nshowed no more than that the opinions which the students were peaceably expressing were\nsufficiently opposed to the views of the majority of the community to attract a crowd and\nnecessitate police protection,” and overturned the conviction because “constitutional rights may\nnot be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise.” Id. at 551 (citation,\nbrackets, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Finally, in Gregory v. City of Chicago, a group of civil rights protestors peacefully\nmarched around the Mayor of Chicago’s home to draw attention to and air their frustration with\nthe slow pace of integration in Chicago’s public schools. 394 U.S. at 111. The protestors were\nassaulted by onlookers with rocks and eggs, despite “a determined effort by the police to allow\nthe marchers to peacefully demonstrate.” Id. at 117 (Black, J., concurring). The protestors\nhurled invective back at their hecklers, but otherwise “maintained a decorum that sp[oke] well\nfor their determination simply to” exercise their constitutional rights. Id. The police determined\nthat the hecklers “were dangerously close to rioting,” and therefore ordered the protestors to\nleave. Id. at 120. They were charged with and convicted of breach of the peace for refusing to\nvacate. Id. The Court, in a plurality opinion, called it a “simple case” because due process does\nnot allow for a conviction for breach of the peace where there is no evidence that the protestors\nwere themselves disorderly.     Id. at 112.    Justice Black, joined by Justice Douglas in his\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.         Page 26\n\nconcurrence, reaffirmed Edwards and Cox as controlling, inasmuch as the state cannot punish a\nspeaker simply because his lawful speech has attracted an angry mob of hecklers. Id. at 123–24,\n124 n.8.\n\n       The civil-rights era cases tell us that police cannot punish a peaceful speaker as an easy\nalternative to dealing with a lawless crowd that is offended by what the speaker has to say.\nBecause the “right ‘peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of\ngrievances’ is specifically protected by the First Amendment,” Gregory, 394 U.S. at 119\n(Black, J., concurring), the espousal of views that are disagreeable to the majority of listeners\nmay at times “necessitate police protection,” Edwards, 372 U.S. at 237. “Liberty can only be\nexercised in a system of law which safeguards order.” Cox, 379 U.S. at 574. It is “a police\nofficer’s . . . duty . . . to enforce laws already enacted and to make arrests . . . for conduct already\nmade criminal.” Gregory, 394 U.S. at 120 (Black, J., concurring). Therefore, the natural order of\nlaw enforcement and crime mitigation are not upended simply because community hostility\nmakes it easier to act against the speaker rather than the individuals actually breaking the law;\nthis is true when it appears that a crowd may turn to rioting, Cox, 379 U.S. at 588, or even in the\nface of actual violence that was indiscriminately directed, Gregory, 394 U.S. at 129 (“The police\nwere dodging the rocks and eggs” along with the protestors) (Appendix to Opinion of Black, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n               3.       Sixth Circuit Precedent: Glasson and Damages Liability\n\n       In the decade following this string of Supreme Court precedents, a heckler’s veto case\ncame before the Sixth Circuit. See Glasson v. City of Louisville, 518 F.2d 899 (6th Cir. 1975).\nGlasson recognized, consistent with the aforementioned precedents, that “[a] police officer has\nthe duty not to ratify and effectuate a heckler’s veto nor may he join a moiling mob intent on\nsuppressing ideas.” Id. at 906.\n\n       The dispute in Glasson originated when a speaker intent on voicing her displeasure with\nthe Vietnam War, as well as the issues of racism and poverty in America, displayed a placard\nreflecting her grievances while waiting on a motorcade route for then-President Richard M.\nNixon. Id. at 901. One of the police officers responsible for crowd control noticed that a group\nof Nixon supporters on the opposite side of the street became agitated, started hollering, and\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 27\n\nwere likely to riot, after perceiving the poster.              Id. at 902.     Instead of reprimanding the\nrabble-rousing crowd, the officer destroyed the speaker’s poster after she refused to hide it from\nview. Id.\n\n        The police officer’s actions in Glasson were a patent violation of the speaker’s First\nAmendment rights, because the speaker did not “somehow forfeit[] the protection afforded her\nmessage by the Constitution because it unintentionally evoked a hostile reaction from others.”\nId. at 905. However, this Court’s inquiry in Glasson did not end there; the officers were entitled\nto seek shelter from damages by way of qualified immunity—then framed as a good faith\ndefense. Id. at 907. This defense was applicable if the officer acted reasonably under the\ncircumstances and in good faith. Id. With respect to reasonableness in the context of free speech\nand unruly hecklers, Glasson states:\n\n        Ideally, police officers will always protect to the extent of their ability the rights\n        of persons to engage in First Amendment activity. Yet, the law does not expect or\n        require them to defend the right of a speaker to address a hostile audience,\n        however large and intemperate, when to do so would unreasonably subject them\n        to violent retaliation and physical injury. In such circumstances, they may\n        discharge their duty of preserving the peace by intercepting his message or by\n        removing the speaker for his own protection without having to respond in\n        damages.\n\nId. at 909.13 Ultimately, the Glasson Court held that the officers could not claim the shelter of\nthe good-faith defense because (1) it was the hecklers who posed the threat, and not the speaker\n(if any threat existed at all); (2) a favorable number of other officers (relative to the size of the\ncrowd) were nearby and available to assist if called upon; and (3) had that number of officers\nbeen insufficient to accomplish the task, reinforcements should have been called before they\nchose to take action against the speaker. Id. at 910–11.\n\n                 4.       Constitutional Rule: No Heckler’s Veto\n\n        The Supreme Court, in Cantwell, Terminiello, Edwards, Cox, and Gregory, has\nrepeatedly affirmed the principle that “constitutional rights may not be denied simply because of\n\n\n        13\n           This rule allowing for police to be free from damages even when they silence the speaker so long as they\nacted reasonably is derived from Justice Frankfurter’s concurring opinion in Feiner. See Niemotko v. Maryland,\n340 U.S. 268, 289 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring and concurring in Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315).\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 28\n\nhostility to their assertion or exercise.” Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 535 (1963)\n(citations omitted). If the speaker’s message does not fall into one of the recognized categories\nof unprotected speech,14 the message does not lose its protection under the First Amendment due\nto the lawless reaction of those who hear it. Simply stated, the First Amendment does not permit\na heckler’s veto.\n\n       In this Circuit, a modicum of confusion is understandable with respect to the prohibition\nagainst the heckler’s veto due to Glasson’s discussion of a good-faith affirmative defense.\nHowever, this defense is inconsistent with subsequent Supreme Court precedent, with the strict\nscrutiny that must be applied to content-based discrimination, and with the superseding\naffirmative defense to a § 1983 suit—qualified immunity.15                        Therefore, to the extent that\nGlasson’s good-faith defense may be interpreted as altering the substantive duties of a police\nofficer not to effectuate a heckler’s veto, it is overruled. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n819 (1982) (“By defining the limits of qualified immunity essentially in objective terms, we\nprovide no license to lawless conduct.”).\n\n       In a balance between two important interests—free speech on one hand, and the state’s\npower to maintain the peace on the other—the scale is heavily weighted in favor of the First\nAmendment. See, e.g., Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 4. Maintenance of the peace should not be\nachieved at the expense of the free speech. The freedom to espouse sincerely held religious,\npolitical, or philosophical beliefs, especially in the face of hostile opposition, is too important to\nour democratic institution for it to be abridged simply due to the hostility of reactionary listeners\nwho may be offended by a speaker’s message. If the mere possibility of violence were allowed\nto dictate whether our views, when spoken aloud, are safeguarded by the Constitution,\nsurely the myriad views that animate our discourse would be reduced to the “standardization of\nideas . . . by . . . [the] dominant political or community groups.” Id. at 4–5. Democracy cannot\nsurvive such a deplorable result.\n\n       When a peaceful speaker, whose message is constitutionally protected, is confronted by a\nhostile crowd, the state may not silence the speaker as an expedient alternative to containing or\n\n       14\n            See footnote 10.\n       15\n            Qualified immunity and the good-faith defense are discussed in greater detail in Part IV of this opinion.\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.   Page 29\n\nsnuffing out the lawless behavior of the rioting individuals. See Watson, 373 U.S. at 535–36.\nNor can an officer sit idly on the sidelines—watching as the crowd imposes, through violence, a\ntyrannical majoritarian rule—only later to claim that the speaker’s removal was necessary for his\nor her own protection. “[U]ncontrolled official suppression of the privilege [of free speech]\ncannot be made a substitute for the duty to maintain order in connection with the exercise of\nth[at] right.” Hague v. Comm. for Indus. Org., 307 U.S. 496, 516 (1939). If the speaker, at his\nor her own risk, chooses to continue exercising the constitutional right to freedom of speech, he\nor she may do so without fear of retribution from the state, for the speaker is not the one\nthreatening to breach the peace or break the law. However, the Constitution does not require that\nthe officer “go down with the speaker.”16 If, in protecting the speaker or attempting to quash the\nlawless behavior, the officer must retreat due to risk of injury, then retreat would be warranted.\nThe rule to be followed is that when the police seek to enforce law and order, they must do so in\na way that does not unnecessarily infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.\nSee Gregory, 394 U.S. at 120 (“[A] police officer[’s] . . . duty is to enforce laws already enacted\nand to make arrests . . . for conduct already made criminal.”) (Black, J., concurring). The police\nmay go against the hecklers, cordon off the speakers, or attempt to disperse the entire crowd if\nthat becomes necessary. Moreover, they may take any appropriate action to maintain law and\norder that does not destroy the right to free speech by indefinitely silencing the speaker.\nFundamentally, no police action that hinders the speaker’s freedom of speech should be deemed\nlegitimate in the eyes of the Constitution unless it satisfies strict scrutiny, which requires the\npolice to achieve their ends by using only those means that are the least restrictive with respect to\nthe speaker’s First Amendment rights.\n\n       “[T]he Constitution demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed\ninvalid and that the [g]overnment bear the burden of showing their constitutionality.” Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2544 (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipses omitted). Wayne County has\nnot come close to meeting that burden in this case. There was a force of approximately fifty\nofficers at the Festival—nineteen of whom were purposely unassigned so that they could respond\nto changing circumstances. A crowd made up predominantly of adolescents began hurling\nplastic bottles and other trash at the Bible Believers. Law enforcement officers, despite their\n\n       16\n            Kalven, supra, The Negro and the First Amendment, at 140.\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 30\n\nnumbers, were virtually nowhere to be found, save for a few brief appearances. One of these\nappearances was solely for the purpose of telling the Bible Believers that they could no longer\nuse their megaphone.           At a later encounter, an officer came over not to reprimand the\ntroublemakers, but to inform the Bible Believers that they were free to leave the Festival. Each\ntime that an officer appeared, the adolescents’ lawless behavior relented, despite the lack of\nofficial reprimand.        Throughout the harassment and violence directed at them, the Bible\nBelievers remained calm and peaceful. While the Deputy Chiefs conferred with Corporation\nCounsel, and prior to the Bible Believers being forced to leave the Festival, there were\napproximately a dozen officers milling about in the background. Many of those officers were\nsufficiently unoccupied to follow the Bible Believers and observe their fellow officer ticket them\nfor driving a vehicle without a license plate. By the WCSO’s own admission in its post-\noperation report, the totality of the officers’ attempt to enforce the law constituted only a few\nverbal warnings being directed at the lawless adolescents and one individual being cited.\n\n         Wayne County disputes the sufficiency of their manpower to quell the crowd, but this\ncontention is specious. The video record evinces next to no attempt made by the officers to\nprotect the Bible Believers or prevent the lawless actions of the audience. The record also\nindicates a substantial police presence that went virtually unused. Wayne County claimed to\nhave assigned more law enforcement personnel to the Festival than had previously been assigned\nto crowd control when the President of the United States visited the area. We cannot justifiably\nset the bar so low for the police officers sworn to protect our communities (and occasionally the\nPresident) that there is any debate as to whether it is reasonable that the result of a purportedly\nsincere effort to maintain peace among a group of rowdy youths is few verbal warnings and a\nsingle arrest.17\n\n\n\n\n         17\n           Judge Gibbons’ dissent makes much of the presence of actual—as opposed to potential—violence\ndirected at the Bible Believers by the adolescent audience. Gibbons Dis. 53–54. However, the dissent’s\nunsupported, hyperbolic account of the Bible Believers as “bruised and bloodied,” Gibbons Dis. 54, ignores any\nresponsibility on the part of the WCSO to use some small part of its police force, and the aura of authority with\nwhich a sheriff’s office is imbued, to attempt to protect the Bible Believers from the lawless behavior of the crowd.\nSimilarly, because the WSCO made no genuine efforts to utilize its officers to prevent or punish the unlawful\nbehavior of the adolescents, it is unfair, on this record, to characterize the crowd’s conduct as “undeterred by police\npresence.” Gibbons Dis. 54.\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                  Page 31\n\n         We do not presume to dictate to law enforcement precisely how it should maintain the\npublic order. But in this case, there were a number of easily identifiable measures that could\nhave been taken short of removing the speaker: e.g., increasing police presence in the immediate\nvicinity, as was requested; erecting a barricade for free speech, as was requested; arresting or\nthreatening to arrest more of the law breakers, as was also requested; or allowing the Bible\nBelievers to speak from the already constructed barricade to which they were eventually\nsecluded prior to being ejected from the Festival. If none of these measures were feasible or had\nbeen deemed unlikely to prevail, the WCSO officers could have called for backup—as they\nappear to have done when they decided to eject the Bible Believers from the Festival—prior to\nfinding that it was necessary to infringe on the group’s First Amendment rights. We simply\ncannot accept Defendants’ position that they were compelled to abridge constitutional rights for\nthe sake of public safety, when at the same time the lawless adolescents who caused the risk with\ntheir assaultive behavior were left unmolested.18\n\n         The Bible Believers attended the Festival to exercise their First Amendment rights and\nspread their religious message. The way they conveyed their message may have been vile and\noffensive to most every person who believes in the right of their fellow citizens to practice the\nfaith of his or her choosing; nonetheless, they had every right to espouse their views. See\nCantwell, 310 U.S. at 309 (“The record played . . . would offend not only persons of [the\nCatholic] persuasion, but all others who respect the honestly held religious faith of their\nfellows.”). When the message was ill-received, the police did next to nothing to protect the\nBible Believers or to contain the lawlessness of the hecklers in the crowd. Instead, the WCSO\naccused the Bible Believers of being disorderly and removed them from the Festival.19 On this\n\n\n         18\n           In his dissent, Judge Rogers maintains that when assessing whether to cut off speech being made to a\nhostile crowd, law enforcement should be permitted to “tak[e] into account all of the factors” they routinely consider\nin keeping the peace, including “the nature of the crowd, the resources available to police at the time, and other\nfactors bearing on law enforcement’s ability to control the scene around a speaker.” Rogers Dis. 64. We hold the\nsame. On this point, the difference between our view and that of Judge Rogers is that Judge Rogers believes that the\nWCSO chose a constitutional course of conduct after considering these factors, and we find that they did not.\n         19\n           Contrary to Judge Rogers’ assertion, Rogers Dis. 62–63, the video record indicates that the WCSO\nthreatened to cite the Bible Believers for disorderly conduct not due to any purported failure to obey a police order,\nbut based on the unrest created by their speech. (R. 28-A, Raw Festival Footage, Time: 00:53:41 (Officer\nRichardson: “I’m not telling you that you’re going to be arrested, but, you know, you are a danger to the public\nsafety. You’re disorderly.”); id. at 00:54:58 (“Alright, you need to leave . . . . If you don’t leave we’re going to cite\nyou for disorderly. You are creating a disturbance . . . I mean look at your people here . . . This is crazy.”).\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.   Page 32\n\nrecord, there can be no reasonable dispute that the WCSO effectuated a heckler’s veto, thereby\nviolating the Bible Believers’ First Amendment rights.\n\n        In his dissent from this part of our holding, Judge Griffin opines that although Cantwell\nand Terminiello clearly established that police officers may not effectuate a heckler’s veto on\nbehalf of an irate mob, “those precedents left unanswered whether the police effectuate a\nheckler’s veto when they remove a speaker for his own safety rather than because of the content\nof the speech or its supposed effect on the crowd.” Griffin Dis. at 46–47. Fortunately, Cantwell\nand Terminiello were not the last cases to speak on the issue of a heckler’s veto, and later cases\nhave made clear that excluding a speaker from a public forum, under most circumstances, will\nnot constitute the least restrictive means for coping with a crowd’s hostile reaction to her\nconstitutionally protected speech. See supra Part I.C. Such a result comports with the high\npremium this nation places on speech safeguarded by the First Amendment.\n\n        Notably, a heckler’s veto effectuated by the police will nearly always be susceptible to\nbeing reimagined and repackaged as a means for protecting the public, or the speaker himself,\nfrom actual or impending harm.           After all, if the audience is sufficiently incensed by the\nspeaker’s message and responds aggressively or even violently thereto, one method of quelling\nthat response would be to cut off the speech and eject the speaker whose words provoked the\ncrowd’s ire. Our point here is that before removing the speaker due to safety concerns, and\nthereby permanently cutting off his speech, the police must first make bona fide efforts to protect\nthe speaker from the crowd’s hostility by other, less restrictive means. Although Glasson made\nthat requirement clear, and framed the removal of the speaker for his own protection as a last\nresort to be used only when defending the speaker “would unreasonably subject [officers] to\nviolent retaliation and physical injury,” 518 F.2d at 909, the WCSO made no discernible efforts\nto fulfill this obligation.\n\nII.     The First Amendment and Free Exercise\n\n        We next consider the Bible Believers’ claim that Wayne County violated their right to the\nfree exercise of religion. The right to free exercise of religion includes the right to engage in\nconduct that is motivated by the religious beliefs held by the individual asserting the claim.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.         Page 33\n\nPrater v. City of Burnside, 289 F.3d 417, 427 (6th Cir. 2002). The government cannot prohibit\nan individual from engaging in religious conduct that is protected by the First Amendment. Id.\n\n        The Bible Believers’ proselytizing at the 2012 Arab International Festival constituted\nreligious conduct, as well as expressive speech-related activity, that was likewise protected\nby the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105,\n108–10 (1943). Plaintiff Israel testified that he was required “to try and convert non-believers,\nand call sinners to repent” due to his sincerely held religious beliefs. We do not question the\nsincerity of that claim. Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 70 (1953) (“[I]t is no business of\ncourts to say that what is a religious practice or activity for one group is not religion under the\nprotection of the First Amendment.”); cf. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751,\n2778 (2014) (“[T]he federal courts have no business addressing whether the religious belief\nasserted in a RFRA case is reasonable.” (internal parentheses omitted)).\n\n        Free exercise claims are often considered in tandem with free speech claims and may rely\nentirely on the same set of facts. See, e.g., Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y of N.Y., Inc. v. Vill.\nof Stratton, 536 U.S. 150 (2002); Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 841. Defendants prevented the Bible\nBelievers from proselytizing based exclusively on the crowd’s hostile reaction to the religious\nviews that the Bible Believers were espousing. Therefore, the free exercise claim succeeds on\nthe same basis as the free speech claim. See Watchtower Bible, 536 U.S. at 150, 159 n.8.\n\nIII.   The Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection\n        The next inquiry is with respect to the Bible Believers’ equal protection claim. We have\nheld that:\n\n        The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no\n        state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\n        laws. To state an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must adequately plead that the\n        government treated the plaintiff disparately as compared to similarly situated\n        persons and that such disparate treatment . . . burdens a fundamental right, targets\n        a suspect class, or has no rational basis.\n\nCtr. for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. Napolitano, 648 F.3d 365, 379 (6th Cir. 2011) (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. Lac Vieux Desert\nBand of Lake Chippewa Indians v. Mich. Gaming Control Bd., 172 F.3d 397, 410 (6th Cir.\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                Page 34\n\n1999). Therefore, Wayne County’s actions are subject to strict scrutiny. San Antonio Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 16 (1973).                  “In determining whether individuals are\n‘similarly situated,’ a court should not demand exact correlation, but should instead seek relevant\nsimilarity.” Bench Billboard Co. v. City of Cincinnati, 675 F.3d 974, 987 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        The Festival included a number of other religious organizations that came to share their\nfaith by spreading a particular message.              There are several distinctions between the Bible\nBelievers and these other groups. Mainly, the Bible Believers chose, as was their right, not to\nregister for an assigned table under the information tent. Instead, they paraded through the\nFestival and proselytized, as was also their right, while carrying signs and a severed pig’s head.\nAlthough these actions set them apart from the other speakers and religious organizations at the\nFestival, they do not do so in any relevant respect. Any speaker could have walked the Festival\ngrounds with or without signs if they chose to do so. The Bible Believers, like the other religious\norganizations at the Festival, sought to spread their faith and religious message. Although they\ndeclined to utilize the tent set aside for outside groups, their conduct was at all times peaceful\nwhile they passionately advocated for their cause, much like any other religious group. Wayne\nCounty did not threaten the Bible Believers based on their decision to march with signs and\nbanners, but based on the content of the messages displayed on the signs and banners. The\ncounty’s disparate treatment of the Bible Believers was based explicitly on the fact that the Bible\nBelievers’ speech was found to be objectionable by a number of people attending the Festival.\nWayne County therefore violated the Bible Believers’ right to equal protection by treating them\nin a manner different from other speakers, whose messages were not objectionable to\nFestival-goers, by burdening their First Amendment rights. See Napolitano, 648 F.3d at 379.\n\nIV.      Qualified Immunity\n\n        Whether Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar can be held liable for civil damages is a\nseparate question from whether their actions violated the Constitution.20 Although Glasson\n\n\n        20\n            The Bible Believers are entitled to injunctive relief irrespective of the damages inquiry. See Harlow,\n457 U.S. at 818 (“[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for\ncivil damages”); Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 841 n.5 (1998) (noting that qualified immunity is not\navailable in “a suit to enjoin future conduct”); see also Cannon v. City & Cty. of Denver, 998 F.2d 867, 876 (10th\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 35\n\nspoke about a good-faith defense, qualified immunity—announced seven years after Glasson in\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald—is the presently available affirmative defense for government officials\nsubject to liability under § 1983. In Harlow, the Supreme Court removed the subjective element\nfrom the then-existing affirmative defense for government actors—the good faith inquiry.\nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 819 (“By defining the limits of qualified immunity essentially in objective\nterms, we provide no license to lawless conduct.”); see also Ohio Civil Serv. Emps. Assoc. v.\nSeiter, 858 F.2d 1171, 1173 (6th Cir. 1988) (“The law of qualified immunity was dramatically\nchanged by the Court in Harlow v. Fitzgerald.”).\n\n        Pursuant to Harlow, “government officials performing discretionary functions generally\nare shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”\n457 U.S. at 818. This standard presupposes two things: first, that the facts alleged by the\nplaintiff are sufficient to state a constitutional claim; and second, that the constitutional right\nwhich the officer has purportedly violated was clearly established at the time of the harm giving\nrise to the action. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201–02 (2001), abrogated by Pearson v.\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009) (holding that although the two-step inquiry set out in\nSaucier “is often beneficial,” courts may “exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of\nthe two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first”). Having already\nfound that the Deputy Chiefs effectuated an unconstitutional heckler’s veto, we need only decide\nwhether their actions violated law that was clearly established at the time of the 2012 Festival.\nWhether a point of law is clearly established necessarily turns on its breadth—i.e., the level of\nspecificity at which it is defined. See Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2094 (2012) (“[T]he\nright allegedly violated must be established not as a broad general proposition, but in a\nparticularized sense so that the contours of the right are clear to a reasonable official.” (citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted)). Although “existing precedent must have placed the . . .\nconstitutional question beyond debate,” “[a] case directly on point,” is not a prerequisite to\nfinding that a law is clearly established. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2083 (2011).\n\n\nCir. 1993) (“The protestors also seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the officers. Unlike the claim for\nmoney damages, there is no qualified immunity to shield the defendants from claims for these types of relief.”);\nPresbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States, 870 F.2d 518, 527 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Qualified immunity . . . does not\nbar actions for declaratory or injunctive relief.”).\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 36\n\n       Deputy Chief Defendants Richardson and Jaafar contend that, “no ‘clearly established’\nlaw existed on the subject of correct law enforcement response to a situation where speakers may\nor may not be engaged in protected speech, the audience in proximity to the speech reacts\nviolently, and the deputies do not have sufficient manpower to restrain the audience, to protect\nthe speakers, and to ensure their own safety.” See Appellee Supp. Br. at 21–23. The Deputy\nChiefs’ position is untenable and unsupported by the record. As is evident from the Supreme\nCourt opinions detailed above, and as explicitly stated in Glasson, “[a] police officer has the duty\nnot to ratify and effectuate a heckler’s veto . . . . Instead, he must take reasonable action to\nprotect from violence persons exercising their constitutional rights.”          518 F.2d at 906.\nDefendants were specifically put on notice of this requirement, insofar as the Bible Believers\nquoted this precise language in a letter that was sent to Wayne County.\n\n       To the extent that Glasson’s discussion of a good-faith defense confused the issue of\nwhether a heckler’s veto constitutes a constitutional violation, the facts and analysis in Glasson\nnonetheless alerted Defendants that removing a peaceful speaker, when the police have made no\nserious attempt to quell the lawless agitators, could subject them to liability. In Glasson, the\nCourt rejected the officers’ claims that the size of their force was insufficient to quell the\nhecklers that were purportedly “near to riot.” Id. at 910. The Court explicitly stated the\nrequirement that the police “take reasonable action to protect from violence persons exercising\ntheir constitutional rights,” id. at 906 (emphasis added), and found the officers’ actions\nunreasonable because they failed to call for reinforcements and failed to recognize the speaker’s\nright to be protected from violence. Id. at 910. These facts are substantially the same as those\nbefore us today.\n\n       Defendants emphasize the fact that Glasson involved an officer tearing up a sign in\nresponse to agitated hecklers, as opposed to officers removing a speaker in an attempt to quell an\nangry crowd that was actually engaged in violent retaliation. These distinctions are immaterial.\nThe violence here was not substantial, much less overwhelming, and speech, whether it be\noration or words written on a poster, is speech nonetheless. Moreover, this case was also about\nremoving from view signs that were considered offensive by a group of hecklers—as Israel\ninformed the Deputy Chiefs, his group was no longer preaching during the latter portion of the\nonslaught against them. Finally, it should be noted that Glasson involved a more compelling\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 37\n\nstate interest—protection of the President—yet the officers’ actions were still deemed to be\nunreasonable. See Wood v. Moss, 134 S. Ct. 2056, 2061 (2014) (citing Watts v. United States,\n394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969)) (“[S]afeguarding the President is . . . of overwhelming importance in\nour constitutional system.”).\n\n         Had the Bible Believers refused to leave, and consequently been arrested, charged, and\nconvicted of disorderly conduct, the convictions could certainly be held invalid pursuant to\nGregory.21 The Bible Believers’ decision to comply with the police officers’ demands, under\nthreat of arrest for disorderly conduct—as opposed to the speaker’s decision in Gregory to\ndisregard the officer’s command—cannot stand for the proposition that there was no clearly\nestablished law as to whether the police may threaten to arrest a peaceful speaker in order to\ncalm a hostile crowd of hecklers.22 Gregory, like this case, involved protestors who used\noffensive language and, in response, were assaulted with debris by a violent crowd of hecklers.\n         21\n             Disorderly conduct is governed by Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.167. The only provision of this statute that\nis at all remotely relevant to the Bible Believers’ conduct is subsection (l), which reads: “A person who is found\njostling or roughly crowding people unnecessarily in a public place.” As in Gregory:\n         The so-called ‘diversion tending to a breach of the peace’ . . . was limited entirely and exclusively\n         to the fact that when the policeman in charge of the special police detail concluded that the\n         hecklers observing the march were dangerously close to rioting and that the demonstrators and\n         others were likely to be engulfed in that riot, he ordered Gregory and his demonstrators to leave,\n         and Gregory—standing on what he deemed to be his constitutional rights—refused to do so. . . .\n         [T]he conduct involved here could become ‘disorderly’ only if the policeman’s command was a\n         law which the petitioners were bound to obey at their peril. But under our democratic system of\n         government, lawmaking is not entrusted to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on\n         his beat. . . . To let a policeman’s command become equivalent to a criminal statute comes\n         dangerously near making our government one of men rather than of laws. There are ample ways\n         to protect the domestic tranquility without subjecting First Amendment freedoms to such a clumsy\n         and unwieldy weapon.\nGregory, 394 U.S. at 120–21 (Black, J., concurring) (citations omitted).\n         22\n           Judge Gibbons’ dissent maintains that the clearly established right on which we base our holding is a\nspeaker’s “specific right . . . to be free from an effective removal when his safety and the safety of others have been\ncompromised by an unforeseen violent mob occasioning physical injury on both the speaker and innocent\nbystanders.” Gibbons Dis. 52. This statement both misapprehends our holding and mischaracterizes the record.\nWith regard to the factual inaccuracies, there is no indication that anyone other than the Bible Believers themselves,\nincluding any so-called “innocent bystanders,” suffered physical injury as a result of the audience’s hostile reaction\nto the group’s proselytizing. Further, after the first bottle was thrown, and the Bible Believers informed the officer\nobjecting to their use of the megaphone that they were being pelted with garbage by the adolescent crowd, there was\nnothing “unforesee[able]” about the risk of further aggression from this particular audience. In terms of legal\nmisconceptions, contorting our opinion to hold that a constitutional violation inevitably occurs when a speaker is\nremoved after his safety has been compromised by a lawless mob ignores our emphasis on law enforcement’s\nobligation to attempt to prevent violence occasioned by unruly crowds—as the law enforcement agency’s resources\npermit—before resorting to cutting off constitutionally protected speech. This order of operations, which first\nrequires officers to make sincere efforts to maintain order and protect the speaker, assures that law enforcement’s\nconduct is narrowly tailored to serve the compelling government purpose of assuring public safety.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 38\n\nOn facts such as these, state-sanctioned penalties for alleged breaches of the peace cannot\nwithstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\nV.        Monell: Municipal Liability\n          Finally, we address municipal liability. Municipalities are not vicariously liable for the\nactions of their employees. However, a municipality may be found responsible for § 1983\nviolations, and held liable for damages pursuant to Monell v. New York City Department of\nSocial Services, if the plaintiff demonstrates that the constitutional harm suffered was a result of\nthe municipality’s policy or custom. 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978); see also Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of\nBryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403 (1997).\n\n          A plaintiff may demonstrate the existence of a policy, custom, or usage in a variety of\nways, two of which are relevant to this appeal. First, she may provide evidence of a formal\npolicy officially adopted by the county.          Monell, 436 U.S. at 690.       Second, a single\nunconstitutional act or decision, when taken by an authorized decisionmaker, may be considered\na policy and thus subject a county to liability. Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480\n(1986).\n\n          We conclude that Wayne County Corporation Counsel’s involvement in drafting a letter\nto the Bible Believers, and in sanctioning the Deputy Chiefs’ decision to remove the Bible\nBelievers from the Festival, easily resolves the matter of municipal liability. “Monell is a case\nabout responsibility.” Id. at 478. Therefore, with respect to a single decision, municipal liability\nis appropriate “where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish policy with respect\nto the action ordered.” Id. at 481 (footnote omitted). Corporation Counsel informed the Bible\nBelievers by way of letter that “under state law and local ordinances, individuals can be held\ncriminally accountable for conduct which has the tendency to incite riotous behavior or\notherwise disturb the peace.” Then the Deputy Chiefs consulted Corporation Counsel at the\nFestival to confirm that they could threaten the Bible Believers with arrest for disorderly conduct\nbecause the Bible Believers speech had attracted an unruly crowd of teenagers. As discussed at\nlength, speech cannot be proscribed simply because it has a “tendency” to cause unrest or\nbecause people reacted violently in response to the speech. Ashcroft, 535 U.S. at 253 (“[T]he\nmere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it.”).\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 39\n\nCorporation Counsel’s misstatement of the law in a letter may not constitute an official policy,\nbut her direction and authorization for the Deputy Chiefs to threaten the Bible Believers with\narrest based on the prevailing circumstances is certainly an action for which she “possesse[d]\nfinal authority to establish municipal policy.” See Wayne Cty. Muni. Code § 4.312 (Corporation\ncounsel is the chief legal advisor to the County CEO and “all County agencies,” including the\nSheriff’s Office). The relevant facts in this case bearing on municipal liability are substantially\nsimilar to the facts of Pembaur. See 475 U.S. at 484 (“The Deputy Sheriffs who attempted to\nserve the capiases at petitioner’s clinic found themselves in a difficult situation. Unsure of the\nproper course of action to follow, they sought instructions from their supervisors.             The\ninstructions they received were to follow the orders of the County Prosecutor. The Prosecutor\nmade a considered decision based on his understanding of the law and commanded the officers\nforcibly to enter petitioner’s clinic. That decision directly caused the violation of Petitioner’s\nFourth Amendment rights.”). Therefore, Wayne County is liable.\n\n                                             Summary\n\n       From a constitutional standpoint, this should be an easy case to resolve. However, it is\nalso easy to understand Dearborn’s desire to host a joyous Festival celebrating the city’s Arab\nheritage in an atmosphere that is free of hate and negative influences. But the answer to\ndisagreeable speech is not violent retaliation by offended listeners or ratification of the heckler’s\nveto through threat of arrest by the police. The adults who did not join in the assault on the Bible\nBelievers knew that violence was not the answer; the parents who pulled their children away\nlikewise recognized that the Bible Believers could simply be ignored; and a few adolescents,\ninstead of hurling bottles, engaged in debate regarding the validity of the Bible Believers’\nmessage.    Wayne County, however, through its Deputy Chiefs and Corporation Counsel,\neffectuated a constitutionally impermissible heckler’s veto by allowing an angry mob of riotous\nadolescents to dictate what religious beliefs and opinions could and could not be expressed.\nThis, the Constitution simply does not allow.\n\n       The chief flaw affecting the dissents of Judges Rogers and Gibbons is that they\nacknowledge law enforcement’s obligation to protect the public in general, and speakers\nexercising their First Amendment rights in particular, Rogers Dis. 64; Gibbons Dis. 53–55, but\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 40\n\nseek to avoid holding the WCSO accountable to this standard by distorting the factual record to\nreflect an out-of-control situation in which the officers were powerless to quell the violence or\nreign in the mob. The “mob” in this case was comprised mostly of children and teenagers. The\n“violence,” though not imaginary, involved little more than plastic bottle and garbage throwing.\nAs evidenced in the video record, the WCSO’s efforts to prevent this behavior were virtually\nnon-existent. Instead, the officers largely ignored the lawless conduct of the crowd and directed\nwhat little attention they paid to the Bible Believers’ situation—prior to ejecting the group—to\nquieting and then silencing their speech.\n\n       “Speech is often provocative and challenging.           It may strike at prejudices and\npreconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”\nTerminiello, 337 U.S. at 4. Excluding viewpoints and ideas from the marketplace damages us by\noccasioning the risk that we might subject ourselves to “tyrannies of governing majorities,”\nWhitney, 274 U.S. at 376 (Brandeis, J., concurring), and thereby forestall “the advancement of\ntruth, science, morality, and [the] arts,” 1 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789,\nLetter to the Inhabitants of Quebec, 108 (Aug. 26, 1774). These are but a few of the reasons that\nthe First Amendment is integral to the vitality and longevity of a free society. These are the\nreasons why we must accept our differences and allow our fellow citizens to express their views\nregardless of our distaste for what they have to say.\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the Wayne County Defendants impermissibly cut off the Bible Believers’\nprotected speech, placed an undue burden on their exercise of religion, and treated them\ndisparately from other speakers at the 2012 Arab International Festival, solely on the basis of the\nviews that they espoused, Wayne County Defendants violated the Bible Believers’ constitutional\nrights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Deputy Chief Defendants are civilly liable to\nthe Bible Believers for having violated law that is clearly established by the Supreme Court\nprecedent set forth in Gregory v. City of Chicago, 394 U.S. 111 (1969). Wayne County is civilly\nliable because one of its chief legal policymakers counseled and authorized the Deputy Chiefs’\nactions. Therefore, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment by the district court in favor\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.

I concur in Judge Clay’s thorough analysis of the\nfacts and law in this case. I write separately only to clarify a few important issues involved in\nthis case and to respond to some of the misconceptions in other opinions.\n\n       I would have thought that a simple examination of pre-existing First Amendment law\nwould make the following points quite clear. Brandenburg v. Ohio held that obnoxious speech\ncannot be suppressed, even if the speaker is inciting listeners in favor of such speech, unless the\nspeech is likely to incite those listeners to imminent lawless action directed at others. 395 U.S.\n444, 447 (1969) (per curiam). Gregory v. City of Chicago made clear that the government\ncannot suppress speech (in that case, allegedly provocative demonstrations by civil-rights\nprotestors in Chicago) simply because opponents are threatening to become unruly. 394 U.S.\n111, 111–13 (1969). As Judge Clay amply demonstrates, everything that happened in this case\nfalls exactly within the above-mentioned cases. The Bible Believers were in a place they had a\nright to be—a public area—doing what they had a right to do—speaking about their religious\nbeliefs—when they were set upon and put in some degree of physical danger by those who\ndisagreed with their message.\n\n       Despite the colorful language in Judge Rogers’s dissent, the motivations of the Bible\nBelievers, and their status as a “majority” or “minority,” are of absolutely no importance as to\ntheir legal rights or the legality of the government’s actions. “[A] function of free speech under\nour system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it\ninduces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs\npeople to anger.” Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949) (emphases added). “In the realm\nof religious faith, and in that of political belief, sharp differences arise. In both fields the tenets\nof one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor. To persuade others to his own point of\nview, the pleader, as we know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have\nbeen, or are, prominent in church or state, and even to false statement. But the people of this\nnation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 43\n\nabuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on\nthe part of the citizens of a democracy.” Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 310 (1940)\n(emphasis added). “[I]f there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for\nattachment than any other it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who\nagree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.” United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S.\n644, 654–55 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\n\n       Contrary to these precedents, Judge Rogers characterizes the speakers as the disruptors,\nimposing themselves upon and unsettling unsuspecting passersby. That may or may not be a fair\ncharacterization, but it is in no way different from most free-speech cases that arise in public.\nAll of the quotations above are from cases where the speakers upset other people. The Jehovah’s\nWitnesses in Cantwell, for example, played phonographs criticizing the Roman Catholic Church\nin a largely Catholic neighborhood, much like the Bible Believers criticized Islam at the Arab\nInternational Festival. They may do it out of love or out of hate, but it makes no difference to the\nFirst Amendment.\n\n       Judge Rogers appears to present a new theory of unprotected speech: speakers are not\nprotected from arrest if they have some subjective intent that violence should be visited upon\nthemselves. No hint of this appears in any previous cases, and Gregory certainly implicitly\nrejects it. Judge Rogers’s arguments are reminiscent of those in his earlier opinion in Defoe,\nwhich established as the doctrine in our circuit alone that public-school officials have broad\ndiscretion to restrict student speech depending on the nature, not the effect, of the speech. Defoe\nex rel. Defoe v. Spiva, 625 F.3d 324, 338 (6th Cir. 2010) (Rogers, J., concurring) (controlling\nopinion). In this dissent, that erroneous doctrine is extended beyond the school setting and\nexpanded to deny the applicability of past free-speech doctrine when a speaker is maliciously\nseeking publicity for certain religious views.\n\n       The fact that someone can come up with a novel method of attacking a clearly established\ndoctrine, which novel attack has not previously been specifically rejected, does not detract from\nthe doctrine’s being “clearly established.”      Otherwise, no doctrine could ever be clearly\nestablished, as our law schools exist in large part precisely to teach how to come up with new\ntheories. The one situation in which I might think that an issue of material fact remained would\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.        Page 44\n\nbe if the disorder created by the attackers threatened to spill out to the general public, or to create\na threat to general public safety. But the defendants here do not even make an effort to raise that\nas a factual argument, and an examination of the extensive video of the incident does not show a\nlikelihood of violence to anyone other than the plaintiffs in this case.\n\n        Judge Rogers defends the police actions as mere “direction[s] to a citizen.” Rogers\nDissent, at 63. Yet the police clearly infringed the liberty interests of the Bible Believers. The\nstandard definition of an arrest is when a person “is not free to go.” If an officer gives a\ncommand “stay or we will arrest you,” that person is not free to go and is surely arrested.\nSimilarly, here the police order was “leave, or we will arrest you.” The plaintiffs were not free\nto stay any more than you would be if the police came to your house and said, “come with us to\nour police car or we will arrest you”; you are not free to stay and are surely under arrest.\nSee California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991) (“An arrest requires either physical force\n. . . or, where that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority.”).\n\n        But, Judge Rogers argues, if the police cannot force speakers to leave, those speakers will\nbe able to “get the police to help [them] attack and disrupt something like a minority cultural\nidentity fair, even if the police are not inclined to do so.” Rogers Dissent, at 60. The pellucid\nflaw in Judge Rogers’s dystopian scenario is that there is no police obligation to assist speakers\nin communicating their message. The law simply requires the government to refrain from\nsilencing speakers. Requiring officers to refrain from interfering with speech can hardly be\nequated with affirmatively enlisting unwilling officers to “help” speakers.\n\n        Judge Rogers’s opinion also has the disturbing implication that courts should decide who\nis a majority and who is a minority, and accord lesser rights to those whom judges deem a\nmajority and greater rights to those whom they deem a minority. Rogers Dissent, at 60, 65. The\ndissent makes explicit what may be implicit in the views of some: that First Amendment rights\nonly belong to those who “speak truth to power” and not those who “speak power to truth”; to\nthose who “question authority” and not those who would “question those who question\nauthority.” This is wrong both as a matter of doctrine and of practice. Again, no Supreme Court\ncase indicates that your rights depend on whether you are “punching up” or “punching down,”\nand indeed virtually all of them hold to the contrary.\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 45\n\n       Further, in this specific circumstance it is highly dubious that the plaintiffs here,\nrepresentatives of what most would consider an extreme and ill-mannered evangelical group, are\nimposing themselves on a minority. They were outnumbered in the immediate area, in a political\njurisdiction (Dearborn) in which the “minority” is in a clear preponderance, and in a wider area\n(Wayne County) whose political leanings are clearly shown by the actions of the police both in\nthis circumstance and in the previous correspondence in the record. It is both dangerous as a\nmatter of doctrine and misleading on the facts to make anything at all in this case rest on the\nconcepts of “majority” and “minority.”\n\n       Judge Rogers concludes his dissent by observing that it is “unfortunately ironic” that the\nBible Believers could invoke “cases involving minority civil rights protests.” Rogers Dissent, at\n65. But the real irony is that the very principle he articulates to allow the suppression of speech\ncould just as easily be used against civil-rights protesters challenging racism or religious\nintolerance. The beauty of our First Amendment is that it affords the same protections to all\nspeakers, regardless of the content of their message. If we encroach on the free-speech rights of\ngroups that we dislike today, those same doctrines can be used in the future to suppress freedom\nof speech for groups that we like.       I would have thought that if anything was “clearly\nestablished” in First Amendment law, it is that our view of “irony” does not trump the\nConstitution.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v.

I agree with the\nmajority opinion that both the officers and Wayne County violated the Bible Believers’ First\nAmendment rights. However, I would hold that Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar are\nentitled to qualified immunity because the right at issue was not clearly established at the time of\nthe 2012 Arab International Festival. For this reason, I join the majority opinion except for Part\nIV and the final two paragraphs of Part I.C.4, from which I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The doctrine of qualified immunity “shields government officials from civil damages\nliability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established\nat the time of the challenged conduct.” Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2093 (2012)\n(citation omitted). A right is clearly established when, “at the time of the challenged conduct,\n‘[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear’ that every ‘reasonable official would have\nunderstood that what he is doing violates that right.’” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2083\n(2011) (emphasis added) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). Put\nanother way, “existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question\nbeyond debate.” Id.\n\n       As Judge Clay correctly notes, when defining the scope of the right at issue, courts must\nbe cautious to define the right neither too narrowly nor too broadly. To that end, we must define\nthe right at issue “not as a broad general proposition, but in a particularized sense so that the\ncontours of the right are clear to a reasonable official.” Reichle, 132 S. Ct. at 2094 (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). Here, the right at issue is properly defined as the right to\nexercise one’s free speech rights in the face of a hostile crowd without the government\neffectuating a heckler’s veto by removing the speaker for his own safety.\n\n       At the time of the 2012 Arab International Festival, “existing precedent” had not placed\nthis constitutional question “beyond debate.” Ashcroft, 131 S. Ct. at 2083. Although the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940), and Terminiello v.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 47\n\nCity of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), had established the general proposition that police officers\nmay not effectuate a heckler’s veto, those precedents left unanswered whether the police\neffectuate a heckler’s veto when they remove a speaker for his own safety rather than because of\nthe content of the speech or its supposed effect on the crowd. Indeed, whether removing a\nspeaker for his own safety amounts to a heckler’s veto is the very question we resolve in this\ncase. And, though we answer that question in the affirmative, we had not done so at the time of\nthe 2012 Arab International Festival.\n\n       Contrary to the position of the majority opinion, precedent in fact confirms that at the\ntime of the 2012 Arab International Festival, the right at issue was debatable. In Glasson v. City\nof Louisville, 518 F.2d 899 (6th Cir. 1975)—decided well after Cantwell and Terminiello—this\ncourt opined that when police fear a violent crowd may inflict physical injury, “they may\ndischarge their duty of preserving the peace by intercepting his message or by removing the\nspeaker for his own protection without having to respond in damages.” Id. at 909. Though we\nnow correctly reject this part of Glasson as dicta and overrule this principle of law, we do so for\nthe first time. Indeed, Wayne County’s pre-festival letter to the Bible Believers—which forms a\nbasis for my conclusion that Wayne County is liable—explicitly relies on this passage from\nGlasson. The letter itself is evidence that the law in this area was not as clear as the majority\nopinion suggests as it relies on Glasson for the proposition that officers may constitutionally\nremove speakers for their own protection, and states that “[t]he law as announced in Glasson is\namong the laws [that Wayne County] is duty-bound to uphold.”\n\n       Nor does Glasson otherwise clearly establish the right at issue in this case. There, this\ncourt held that the police violated the plaintiff’s First Amendment rights when they destroyed the\nplaintiff’s anti-Nixon poster that had agitated a crowd of Nixon supporters. Glasson, 518 F.2d at\n902, 906. But, unlike this case, the crowd in Glasson was not actually violent towards the\nspeaker; they were merely “hollering” and “cheered” when the officers destroyed the poster. Id.\nat 902. Thus, Glasson did little more than reinforce the basic principle that the police may not\neffectuate a heckler’s veto. Glasson’s holding alone does not answer the question presented by\nthis case: whether the police effectuate a heckler’s veto by removing a speaker for his own\nsafety. In fact, Glasson suggests that they do not.\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 48\n\n       Moreover, although numerous Supreme Court decisions opine generally regarding the\nconstitutional infirmity of a heckler’s veto, none answer the specific question posed by this case.\nSee, e.g., Reno v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 880 (1997) (opining about the\nheckler’s veto in the context of online fora); Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum, 555 U.S.\n460, 468 (2009) (citing Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, 544 U.S. 550, 574 (2005) (Souter, J.,\ndissenting)) (restrictions on government speech amount to a heckler’s veto).\n\n       In sum, § 1983 does not require that defendant officers anticipate what we decide in this\ncase: that police effectuate a heckler’s veto when they remove a speaker from a hostile crowd\nfor the speaker’s own safety. At the time of the 2012 Arab International Festival, reasonable\nminds could have differed whether the officers’ treatment of the Bible Believers violated clearly\nestablished federal law. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from Part IV and the final two\nparagraphs of Part I.C.4 of the majority opinion.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v.

I agree with the\nmajority that the Bible Believers engaged in protected speech in a traditional public forum. I\nagree with the majority that the defendants curtailed the Bible Believers’ speech on the basis of\nits content. And I agree with the majority that the defendants had other options short of\nremoving the Bible Believers from the festival to deal with the public-safety problems generated\nby their speech. For these reasons, I must conclude that strict scrutiny governs the defendants’\nactions and that they have not satisfied it. See Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 2231\n(2015). In each of these respects, I therefore join Part I of the analysis in Judge Clay’s opinion.\nI part ways with this component of the majority opinion to the extent it draws the conclusion that\na “heckler’s veto” supplies a freestanding doctrinal basis for concluding that the defendants\nviolated the Bible Believers’ First Amendment rights.\n\n       That leaves (mainly) the question of qualified immunity. I agree with Judge Gibbons that\nthe obligations of the defendants in this unusual setting were not clearly established at the time of\nthe festival and accordingly join Parts II and III of her dissenting opinion. As Judge Gibbons’s\nopinion shows—and as the stark differences among the many opinions in this case confirm—the\nFirst Amendment requirements in this area did not provide the kind of clarity we normally\ndemand before imposing after-the-fact, money-damages liability on individual officers. Pity the\npolice officer then—and perhaps even now—tasked with identifying the lines of permissible and\nimpermissible peace-officer conduct in this non-peaceful area.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v.

As discussed below, however,\nBible Believers are not entitled to any of these remedies.          Even assuming, arguendo, the\nmajority’s position that a violation of the Bible Believers’ constitutional rights exists, qualified\nimmunity bars the suit against Officers Jaafar and Richardson in their individual capacities. The\nmunicipality is also not liable on the remaining damages claims because Bible Believers cannot\nestablish that the allegedly unconstitutional action was the result of a municipal policy. Lastly,\ndispensing with the remaining claims, the plaintiffs’ prayers for declaratory and injunctive relief\nare precluded by the absence of a credible threat or imminent injury.\n\n                                      A. Qualified Immunity\n\n          Bible Believers’ damages claim against the officers in their individual capacities should\nfail under qualified immunity because there was, and still remains, no clearly established law\npertaining to this specific right.\n\n          Qualified immunity affords a broad shield, ensuring “that those who serve the\ngovernment do so with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good.” Filarsky\nv. Delia, ––– U.S. ––––, 132 S. Ct. 1657, 1665 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). In\ndoing so, it “gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken\njudgments, and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 51\n\nStanton v. Sims, ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S. Ct. 3, 5 (2013) (per curiam) (emphasis added) (internal\ncitations and quotation marks omitted). The majority’s holding effectively strips the officers of\nthis broad protection, and instead of providing the officers with breathing room, all but\nsuffocates them.\n\n        To determine whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity, we must\nask whether “a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged” and, if so,\nwhether the right was “clearly established.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200–01 (2001).\nThe order of analysis is within the courts discretion. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236\n(2009). In this case, “it is plain that [the] constitutional right is not clearly established,” leaving\nthe constitutional question as an “essentially academic exercise.” See id. at 236–37 (permitting\ncourts to avoid potentially “difficult constitutional questions”). My analysis therefore centers on\nwhether the constitutional right that the defendants purportedly violated was clearly established.1\n\n        In determining whether a right is clearly established, it is imperative to articulate the right\nat issue with the appropriate specificity. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (“The relevant, dispositive\ninquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a\nreasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.” (emphasis\nadded)). If the right is characterized at its most general level, the second prong in qualified\nimmunity analysis would serve no purpose. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, ––– U.S. –––, 131 S. Ct.\n2074, 2084 (2011) (“We have repeatedly told courts . . . not to define clearly established law at a\nhigh level of generality. The general proposition, for example, that an unreasonable search or\nseizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative\nnature of particular conduct is clearly established.” (internal citations omitted)).\n\n        The definition, therefore, must be “particularized” in such a way that “[t]he contours of\nthe right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034 (internal citations\nomitted). A case directly on point is unnecessary, but “existing precedent must have placed the\nconstitutional question beyond debate.” Sims, 134 S. Ct. at 5 (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,\n\n\n        1\n           My analysis would remain the same whether or not a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a\nconstitutional violation occurred.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 52\n\n563 U.S. —–, —–, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2083 (2011)). To assist in its determination, the court\nshould “look first to the decisions of the Supreme Court, and then to the case law of this circuit.”\nGragg v. Ky. Cabinet for Workforce Dev., 289 F.3d 958, 964 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\n       Here, contrary to the majority’s characterization, the right in question is not the general\nright to free speech in spite of a crowd’s outrage, but the more specific right of a speaker to be\nfree from an effective removal when his safety and the safety of others have been compromised\nby an unforeseen violent mob occasioning physical injury on both the speaker and innocent\nbystanders. A court has yet to find that there is such a right. Thus the determinative question is\nwhether the officers could reasonably have believed—based on pre-existing precedent—that the\nFirst Amendment did not preclude them from effectively removing the Bible Believers. See\nOccupy Nashville v. Haslam, 769 F.3d 434, 445 (6th Cir. 2014) (“What matters is that reasonable\ngovernment officials could, like the State Officials here, understand the law very differently.”) If\npre-existing precedent would lead “officers of reasonable competence [to] disagree on [the]\nissue, immunity should be recognized.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986). There is\nnot one single case predating the conduct at issue that prohibits effectively removing a speaker in\na materially similar context. This alone weighs against a finding that the law was clearly\nestablished because the officers would not have had “‘fair notice that [their] conduct was\nunlawful.’” Lyons v. City of Xenia, 417 F.3d 565, 579 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Brosseau v.\nHaugen, 543 U.S. 194, 200 (2004)).\n\n       The majority says that the “heckler’s veto” doctrine—“firmly establish[ed]” by the\nSupreme Court as well as this court in Glasson v. City of Louisville, 518 F.2d 899 (6th Cir. 1975)\n(Op. at 22, 36)—clearly established the Bible Believers’ rights. But the Supreme Court’s\ndecisions in this department offer little guidance about today’s case. None of the cases cited by\nthe majority to derive the “heckler’s veto” rule involved government officials acting against a\nspeaker because of actually occurring violence, as opposed to signs of trouble that had not\nspilled over into violence. See Gregory v. City of Chicago, 394 U.S. 111, 111–12 (1969); Cox v.\nLouisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 550 (1965); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 231 (1963);\nTerminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 6 (1949); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309\n(1940). The majority sums up these decisions as “affirm[ing] the principle that ‘constitutional\nrights may not be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise.’” (Op. at 25\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 53\n\n(quoting Cox, 379 U.S. at 551).) The principle of course is right, see Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S.\n443, 458 (2011), but it does not tell us what police should do when verbal “hostility,” such as\nmere “muttering” and “grumbling,” see Cox, 379 U.S. at 543, descends into violence. Later\ncases say that the government may in some circumstances combat “actual” problems related to\nspeech, especially when public safety is on the line. See, e.g., McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S. Ct.\n2518, 2535 (2014); Brown v. Entm’t Merchants Ass’n, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2738 (2011); Schenck v.\nPro-Choice Network of W. N.Y., 519 U.S. 357, 376 (1997).\n\n       The Supreme Court’s infrequent invocation of a “heckler’s veto” rationale confirms the\nlack of guidance that the concept provides. The closest the Court has come to the facts of this\ncase when using the term is in a footnote to a 1966 plurality opinion. See Brown v. Louisiana,\n383 U.S. 131, 133 n.1 (1966) (plurality opinion). Even then, that use of “heckler’s veto” does\nnot help us because the Court invoked the term in the context of potential as opposed to actual\nviolence, reasoning that it would be unfair to suppress peaceful protestors due to the danger that\ncritics “might” react with disorder or violence. Id. On a few other occasions, the Court has used\n“heckler’s veto” as shorthand for the undesirability of opponents being able to cut off some\ndisfavored speech, idea, or policy, but none of those cases has any bearing here. See, e.g.,\nZivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2115 (2015) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting);\nPleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 468 (2009). In the last analysis, the Supreme\nCourt had not clearly established that the officers acted unconstitutionally in asking the Bible\nBelievers to leave in the face of ongoing violence, and the “heckler’s veto” does nothing to fill\nthat gap in authority.\n\n       Nor did Glasson—the only case that remotely mirrors the circumstances at issue—clearly\nestablish the law that controls this case. There, a police officer tore up the plaintiff’s sign\nbecause a group across the street, apparently angered by the sign’s message, began screaming at\nthe plaintiff and, as a result, the officer feared for the plaintiff’s safety. Glasson, 518 F.2d at\n902–03. The Sixth Circuit held that the police officers were liable for a First Amendment\nviolation. Id. at 912. The court found that “[t]he state may not rely on community hostility and\nthreats of violence to justify censorship.” Id. at 906. For “[t]o permit police officers . . . to\npunish for incitement or breach of the peace the peaceful communication of . . . messages\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 54\n\nbecause other persons are provoked and seek to take violent action against the speaker would\nsubvert the First Amendment.” Id. at 905.\n\n       According to the majority, Glasson put the officers on notice that removing the Bible\nBelievers in this circumstance could subject them to liability. (Op. at 36.) In so holding, the\nmajority again ignores the same factual difference—Glasson involved no violence and the case\nbefore us involved a violent mob inflicting physical harm on the speakers. In Glasson, the\nunruliness of the crowd was limited to muttered threats unaccompanied by action; it did not\ninvolve actual, physical violence. Id. Here, Bible Believers (and potentially other bystanders)\nwere showered with rocks, plastic bottles, garbage, and milk crates. (DE 1, Complaint, ¶ 46.)\nThe Bible Believers were bruised and bloodied, with one Bible Believer bleeding from his\nforehead. (Id. at 57). The majority attempts to mitigate the pointed difference between the two\nscenarios by proclaiming that the violence here was “much less overwhelming.” (Op. at 36.)\nWhile the majority’s tolerance for pain is certainly admirable, hundreds of teenaged children\nthrowing a deluge of objects—ranging from bottles to rocks to milk crates—can fairly be\ncharacterized as an overwhelming display of aggression and violence.\n\n       Glasson can be further distinguished from this case by the officers’ respective responses\nto the crowds. The officers in Glasson made absolutely no attempt to calm the crowd. Id. at\n905. In this case, although the majority faults the officers for not doing enough, neither party\ndisputes that the officers warned, detained, and cited several debris-throwers in an attempt to rein\nin the chaos.\n\n       While the holding in Glasson may clearly establish that an officer must refrain from\ninfringing on the right of a speaker when a crowd becomes angry and threatens violence, it does\nnot clearly establish an officer’s appropriate response to a physically violent and unruly mob of\nmostly children who are undeterred by police presence.\n\n       Moreover, despite Glasson’s ultimate conclusion, the court in Glasson made clear that\npolice officers “may discharge their duty of preserving the peace by . . . removing the speaker for\nhis own protection” when a hostile audience would unreasonably subject law enforcement to\nphysical injury. 518 F.2d at 909. Such a pronouncement echoes a recurrent principle: the First\nAmendment does not afford one an unfettered right to exercise free speech in the face of\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 55\n\njeopardizing the safety of members of the public. Police officers are charged with protecting the\n“‘lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.’” Grider v. Abramson, 180 F.3d 739,\n752 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 475 (1996)). And the\nSupreme Court has made plain that when a “clear and present danger” of disorder or other\n“immediate threat to public safety” appears, “the power of the state to prevent or punish is\nobvious.” Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 308 (1940). No court has ever\nrecognized a First Amendment right that is so absolute that it can stymie police efforts to cope\nwith highly volatile situations. Markedly, this court has emphasized that police officers must\ntake the actions necessary to protect the physical safety of citizens and the overall public order.\nSee Grider, 180 F.3d at 752.\n\n        The majority, seemingly disapproving the ramifications of Glasson, overrules it “to the\nextent that Glasson’s good-faith defense may be interpreted as altering the substantive duties of a\npolice officer not to effectuate a heckler’s veto.” (Op. at 26.) The majority’s decision to\noverrule Glasson ought to tell us all we need to know about the clearly established inquiry. At\nthe time of the incident, it was not sufficiently clear to a reasonable officer that removing the\nBible Believers for their own protection violated the First Amendment. Otherwise, there would\nbe no need to overrule this part of Glasson. Implicit—in truth explicit—in the majority’s\ndecision is the recognition that officials could understand the law differently at the time of this\nincident.2\n\n        Even after today’s decision, officials could understand the law differently. “Heckler’s\nveto,” as the many separate writings in this case suggest and as the Supreme Court’s own cases\nconfirm, is more often used as a debater’s point rather than as a doctrinal tool. Even on its own\nterms, the “rule” does not mean that the government must invariably ignore an opponent’s\nreaction in deciding how to treat speech. The doctrines of “incitement to imminent lawless\naction,” Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 449 (1969) (per curiam), and “fighting words,”\n\n        2\n          Indeed, the tenets of Glasson and Cantwell, when viewed in tandem, could lead a reasonable officer to\nconclude that he may not punish a speaker for peaceful expression merely because the listeners seek to take violent\naction against the speaker; but, the officer may remove a speaker for his own protection if the audience becomes so\nviolent as to potentially harm—or, as was the case here, actually harm—the speaker, an officer, or a bystander.\nWhen viewed through this lens, a reasonable officer, aware of the material distinctions between this case and\nGlasson, could believe that the escalating violence at the Arab Festival presented an example of when police may\nremove the speaker for his own protection.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 56\n\nCohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 20 (1971), allow censorship based on listener reactions, indeed\neven potential reactions. The majority seems to suggest that the “heckler’s veto” cases mean\nthat, once a speaker is outside these categories of “unprotected speech” and enters the field of\n“protected speech,” the listeners’ reactions to speech may never be the basis for government\nregulation. Surely that is not the law—and at least the Supreme Court has never said it is. “Such\na simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with\ncommon sense and with our jurisprudence as well.” R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384\n(1992).\n\n          Apparently recognizing as much, the majority suggests at one point that the police may\nlimit speech in order to protect the speaker from a violent reaction, but only as a last resort. (Op.\nat 22 (“Punishing, removing, or by other means silencing a speaker due to crowd hostility will\nseldom, if ever, constitute the least restrictive means available to serve a legitimate government\npurpose.”).) But at other points, the majority implies this is not the rule at all and that the police\nmay never limit speech in order to protect the speaker, even if doing so is the only way to protect\nthe speaker from serious injury or even death at the hands of an angry mob. (Op. at 28 (“Simply\nstated, the First Amendment does not permit a heckler’s veto.”); see also Op. at 44 (“The law\nsimply requires the government to refrain from silencing speakers.”) (Boggs, J., concurring).)\nGiven these mixed signals, it is not even obvious what has been clearly established by today’s\nopinion, much less clearly established what the law was when these officers were forced into\naction.\n\n          A situation where officers could understand the law in different ways, both at the time\nthey acted and after this court acts, is precisely the type of occasion in which police officers\nshould be shielded from personal damages liability. See Malley, 475 U.S. at 341 (finding that\nimmunity should be recognized in those instances where officers of reasonable competence\ncould disagree on the issue). The fact that reasonable officials can differ in their responses\nconfirms that it was not “plainly incompetent” for the police to believe they had a right to\neffectively remove the Bible Believers. Stanton, 134 S. Ct. at 5.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.     Page 57\n\n                                      B. Municipal Liability\n\n       As Monell has informed us, a municipality is only liable for constitutional violations\nresulting from official policies or customs. The “official policy” requirement “distinguish[es]\nthe acts of the municipality from the acts of employees of the municipality. Pembaur, 475 U.S.\n479. An official policy commonly refers to “formal rules or understandings . . . that establish\nfixed plans of action to be followed under similar circumstances.” Id. at 480. In this regard, the\nmajority admits that Corporations Counsel misstatement of the law in the letter responding to\nBible Believers does not amount to an official policy. (Op. 38–39.) Nevertheless, because a\nsingle decision by “government authorized decisionmakers” can also denote official policy,\nPembaur, 475 U.S. at 481, the majority finds that liability attaches to the municipality through\nthe Corporation Counsel’s instruction advising the Deputy Chiefs to threaten to issue the Bible\nBelievers a citation. (Id.) I must respectfully disagree.\n\n       The Bible Believers have presented no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find\nthat Corporations Counsel, or the Deputy Chiefs for that matter, possessed final decision making\nauthority. Unlike in Pembaur, where the Deputy Sheriffs were instructed by their supervisors to\nfollow the orders of the County Prosecutor, 475 U.S. 469, thus imbuing the Prosecutor with final\ndecisionmaking authority, here the evidence is devoid of any such instruction. Instead, the\nDeputy Chiefs merely conferred with Corporation Counsel because, after all, its duty is to\n“provide legal services” such as “advis[ing], consult[ing] or represent[ing]” Wayne County\nofficers. Wayne Cnty. Muni. Code § 4.312. Some advice to an officer, though perhaps ill-\nconceived, does not metamorphose Corporation Counsel into a decisionmaker with final\nauthority. Indeed, nothing in the municipal code vests Corporation Counsel with “final authority\nto establish policy.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. 478; see also id. at 483 (“Authority to make municipal\npolicy may be granted directly by a legislative enactment or may be delegated by an official who\npossess such authority[.]”). Nor does the evidence show that Corporation Counsel was bestowed\nwith such authority by a final decisionmaker.         Advice amounts to nothing more than a\nrecommendation, not a decision. Therefore, no genuine issues of material fact exist as to\nwhether the violation of the Bible Believers constitutional rights stemmed from Wayne County’s\npolicies or customs.\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                Page 58\n\n                                   C. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n\n        Because qualified immunity only protects officials from damages liability in their\nindividual capacities, Flagner v. Wilkinson, 241 F.3d 475, 483 (6th Cir. 2001), and finding no\nMonell liability only protects the county and officers from damages in their official capacity, the\nnext step is to address whether the Bible Believers are entitled to declaratory and injunctive\nrelief. They are not; the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege standing to claim injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief. See Kusens v. Pascal Co., Inc., 448 F.3d 349\n\n        That the plaintiffs have standing to pursue their damages claims has no bearing on\nwhether they have standing to request injunctive and declaratory relief. They “must demonstrate\nstanding separately for each form of relief sought.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.\nServs., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000). A prayer for both declaratory and injunctive relief requires an\nassessment of whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a legitimate likelihood of future harm.\nSee MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007) (“[T]he question in each case\nis whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial\ncontroversy . . . of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory\njudgment.” (emphasis added)); City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983). For the\nallegation of future harm to be sufficient, there must be a “substantial risk that the harm will\noccur,” or the threatened injury must be “certainly impending.” Susan B. Anthony List v.\nDriehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Grendell v. Ohio\nSupreme Court, 252 F.3d 828, 832 (6th Cir. 2001) (“‘[W]hen seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, a plaintiff must show actual present harm or a significant possibility of future harm in\norder to demonstrate the need for pre-enforcement review.’” (quoting Nat’l Rifle Assoc. of Am. v.\nMagaw, 132 F.3d 272, 279 (6th Cir. 1997)).3\n\n        The Bible Believers’ plans to continue to take an active role in advocating their religious\nbeliefs at a future Arab Festival is insufficient to demonstrate that future harm is likely. Bible\nBelievers fear that “they will again be attacked by Muslims and given the option by [the officers]\n\n        3\n           The inquiry focuses exclusively on prospective conduct. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 103 (“[P]ast exposure to\nillegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief if unaccompanied by\nany continuing, present adverse effects.” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Thus, the fact that\nBible Believers were threatened with disorderly conduct at the 2012 Arab Festival is irrelevant to the determination\nof whether injunctive relief is apposite.\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 59\n\nto either cease their free speech activity or face arrest for disorderly conduct.”                          (DE 1,\nComplaint, ¶ 70.) The facts in record belie any contention that they will be exposed to the same\nor similar circumstances as present here. For the past seventeen years the Arab Festival has gone\non virtually without incident—let alone any event remotely similar to the one at issue. This is so\ndespite the annual presence of a multitude of Christian missionaries and evangelists from across\nthe country. (DE 1, Compliant, ¶ 17). Even the Bible Believers concede that during this time\n“there was little to no conflict between the Christians and the Muslims who attended the Arab\nFestival.” (Id. ¶ 24.) In fact, Bible Believers’ attendance at the festival—including the day\nbefore the incident in question—was largely uneventful.\n\n         Given that the Arab-American Festival is no longer an annual event in Dearborn,4 there\nare serious doubts surrounding the very existence of the Festival in the future. Thus, the prospect\nof a recurring problem is not only “highly conjectural” and indefinite, but also “rest[s] on a string\nof actions the occurrence of which is merely speculative.” Grendell, 252 F.3d at 833. This\nspeculative injury is not sufficient to bestow the Bible Believers with standing to pursue\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. Thomas v. Campbell, 12 F.

Conclusion\n\n         In conclusion, I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues who believe that we\nshould reverse. Even assuming a violation of the Bible Believers constitutional rights, they are\nnot entitled to any relief: qualified immunity defeats plaintiffs’ individual damages claims\nagainst the officers; the absence of a municipal policy responsible for the alleged constitutional\nviolations prevents the plaintiffs from holding Wayne County liable; and finally, the lack of an\nimminent and credible injury precludes standing for the plaintiffs’ prayers for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief.\n\n         4\n          Cancelling the Arab International Festival Was an Admission of Defeat, ARAB AMERICAN\nNEWS (Apr. 2, 2015, 9:51 AM), http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_10291/Canceling-the-Arab-\nInternational-Festival-was-an-admission-of-defeat.html; Niraj Warikoo, ACLU Supports Free-Speech Rights of anti-\nIslam Group,DETRIOT FREE PRESS (Dec. 26, 2014, 9:37 AM), http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/way\nne/2014/12/26/aclu-supports-free-speech-rights-christian-group-hates-islam/20899957/.

Today’s holding provides a roadmap that\neffectively advises how to force the police to help disrupt a minority’s speech and assembly\nrights. It is as if we are advising as follows:\n\n               Yes, you can get the police to help you attack and disrupt something like a\n       minority cultural identity fair, even if the police are not inclined to do so. Tell the\n       police your plans ahead of time, and bring photographers. Get a determined\n       group of disrupters and go in with the most offensive and incendiary chants,\n       slogans, insults, and symbols—the more offensive the better. The object is to stir\n       up some physical response. Then, when things get rough (your goal), insist that\n       the police protect you, and (ironically) your First Amendment rights, by serving\n       as a protective guard. The peace officers cannot at that point tell you to leave,\n       even to avoid injury to you, because if the peace officers do that, they will have to\n       pay you damages. Faced with the choice of allowing you to be an injured martyr\n       (keep your cameras ready) or serving as a protective guard as the disruption\n       escalates, the peace officers will doubtless choose the latter and become your\n       phalanx.    It’s a win-win situation for you, and a lose-lose situation for the\n       minority group putting on the fair.\n\n                                                  ***\n\n       Only a formalistic application of First Amendment doctrines, from substantially different\ncases, could lead to a result so inconsistent with the core of the First Amendment. This is not a\ncase where the Bible Believers faced punishment or liability for their speech.             The only\npunishment threatened was a citation for refusing to move away from a physical altercation.\nThat fact distinguishes this case from most of the cases that the Bible Believers rely upon.\n\n       To disruptive hecklers, the irony of using a “heckler’s veto” doctrine to empower them in\ntheir heckling must be sweet. As demonstrated below, the great cases that admirably condemn a\n“heckler’s veto” are profoundly different from this case. They involve criminal prosecution of\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 61\n\nspeakers on the basis that the speech, itself, constituted a breach of the peace. In Edwards v.\nSouth Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963), for example, African-Americans gathered on the state-\nhouse grounds and some 200 to 300 curious onlookers gathered.               There was no traffic\nobstruction and nothing in the way of “threatening remarks, hostile gestures, or threatening\nlanguage.” Id. at 231. Police ordered the protestors to disperse, and when they did not, the\npolice arrested them and charged them with breaching the peace. Id. at 233. The Supreme Court\noverturned the protestors’ criminal convictions on the ground that the common-law crime of\nwhich the protestors had been convicted permitted punishment “upon evidence which showed no\nmore than that the opinions which [the protesters] were peaceably expressing were sufficiently\nopposed to the views of the majority of the community to attract a crowd and necessitate police\nprotection.” Id. at 237. In overturning the protestors’ convictions, the Court noted (1) that\n“nobody among the crowd actually caused or threatened any trouble,” id. at 231, (2) that\n“[p]olice protection at the scene was at all times sufficient to meet any foreseeable possibility of\ndisorder,” id. at 232–33, (3) that “[t]here was no violence or threat of violence on [the\nprotesters’] part, or on the part of any member of the crowd watching them,” id. at 236, and (4)\nthat “[p]olice protection was ‘ample,’” id. These facts, the Court explained,\n\n       [were] a far cry from the situation in Feiner v. New York, where two policemen\n       were faced with a crowd which was “pushing, shoving and milling around,”\n       where at least one member of the crowd “threatened violence if the police did not\n       act,” where “the crowd was pressing closer around petitioner and the officer,” and\n       where “the speaker passes the bounds of argument or persuasion and undertakes\n       incitement to riot.”\n\nId. at 236 (quoting Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S 315, 317–18, 321 (1949)). Nothing in Edwards\nis even close to the situation in this case. In Edwards there was no hint of an altercation or\ndisruption.\n\n       The same distinction applies to Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965), a landmark of the\nCivil Rights Movement of the 1960s. There, police arrested the speaker the day after a peaceful\nstudent protest in which the speaker advocated that his fellow protesters conduct sit-ins at certain\nlocal businesses. Id. at 542–44. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction for breaching the\npeace because the speaker had been punished “merely for peacefully expressing unpopular\nviews.” Id. at 551. That, the Court once more clarified, was different from punishing a speaker\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.         Page 62\n\nfor deliberately thwarting law enforcement’s legitimate efforts to pacify an altercation. Id. at\n550–51 (distinguishing Feiner). The evidence alleged to indicate potential violence was limited\nto purported grumbling, muttering, and jeering from a group of 100 to 300 white people across\nthe street. Id. In short, the Court held that the speaker could not be convicted of using words\nthat disturbed the peace merely because his words might have led to an altercation. This is\ncategorically different from holding that the police may not separate people who are involved in\nan altercation, and threaten a citation if one of the parties fails to separate.\n\n        Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), also involved the Court’s overturning\nthe conviction of a speaker for breaching the peace, where the ordinance on which the conviction\nrested “permitted conviction of [the speaker] if his speech stirred people to anger, invited public\ndispute, or brought about a condition of unrest.” Id. at 5. The decision addressed only whether\nthe speaker could be convicted of a crime based on his speech’s tendency to cause unrest. The\ndecision said nothing about what steps police could take to quell an altercation already\nunderway—which is to say, it said nothing about the actions of the police in this case.\n\n        Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940), involved a Jehovah’s Witness and his two\nsons who had gone door-to-door in a Catholic neighborhood distributing literature and requesting\npedestrians’ permission to play a phonograph record critical of the Roman Catholic Church,\nwhich offended the pedestrians. The Supreme Court overturned the convictions of the Jehovah’s\nWitnesses for breach of the peace, reasoning that the laws at issue criminalized the family\nmembers’ peaceful exercise of their First Amendment liberties. Id. at 310–11. The Court found\nthat there was “no assault or threatening of bodily harm, no truculent bearing, no intentional\ndiscourtesy, no personal abuse.” Id. at 310. The case did not deal with incitement to violence or\nbreach of the peace, much less an actual altercation.\n\n        Finally, the difference between these cases and the instant case is clearest in Gregory v.\nCity of Chicago, 394 U.S. 111 (1969). There, police ordered a group of peaceful protestors to\ndisperse after onlookers became unruly. “When [the officers’] command was not obeyed, [the\nprotestors] were arrested for disorderly conduct.” Id. at 112. The Supreme Court overturned the\nensuing criminal convictions. Id. at 112–13. As the Court made explicit, however, its ruling in\nthat case was based on its understanding that “[the protestors] were charged and convicted for\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 63\n\nholding a demonstration, not for a refusal to obey a police officer.” Id. In a footnote the Court\nadded that “[n]either the ordinance nor the charge defined disorderly conduct as the refusal to\nobey a police order.” Id. at n.*. Gregory is thus inapposite, because the Bible Believers were\nthreatened with a citation, not because of anything they said, but because they asked what would\nhappen if they disobeyed a police officer. Indeed, the video evidence in this case—supplied only\nby the Bible Believers—shows the reluctance of the police even to threaten citation. The police\nchief confirmed that the Bible Believers would be cited only after the Bible Believers repeatedly\ndemanded to know “what he would do” if they declined to depart.1\n\n       In sum, the Supreme Court has consistently distinguished between prosecuting a person\nfor exercising his First Amendment rights—which is unconstitutional—and insisting that a\nperson comply with a police officer’s order to leave the scene of an ongoing physical altercation\nso as to prevent further injury—which is constitutional. It cannot be that every police officer’s\ndirection to a citizen to do something requires strict scrutiny just because speech is also involved.\nStrict scrutiny does not apply, for example, to pulling over a truck for a traffic violation just\nbecause there was a message on the side of the truck. Nor could strict scrutiny reasonably be\napplied to telling two brawling teenagers to separate before they get hurt, even if the brawl\nstarted with a verbal argument about some issue. Police officers should not be made to pay\ndamages in such circumstances. This case is no different.\n\n\n       1\n           Here is an excerpt of the conversation between the police chief and one Bible Believer (“BB”):\n\n       BB: Let me ask you this: If we don’t leave, are we gonna get arrested?\n       CHIEF: Probably.\n       BB: I just need to know, yes or no.\n       CHIEF: Probably.\n       BB: That’s like me probably saying, “Yes, probably we’ll stay around.”\n       CHIEF: Probably we will cite you all, yes. I mean, if that’s what you want then, I mean, I don’t, I\n       don’t understand what good that does.\n       BB: I just need to know if I’m gonna be arrested or not or if you just thought it was a good idea\n       that we walk away. If you’re telling me that we’re gonna get arrested, that’s what I need to know.\n       Are you telling me that we’re gonna get arrested if we . . .\n       CHIEF: I’m not telling you that you’re going to get arrested, but, you know, you’re a danger to the\n       public safety. You’re disorderly.\n       BB: I would assume, you know, two hundred angry Muslim children throwing bottles would be\n       more of a threat than a few guys with signs.\n       [Brief interlude]\n       CHIEF: Alright, you need to leave.\n       BB: Again, I just want to make an ask, so, if we don’t leave, you’re saying . . .\n       CHIEF: If you don’t leave, we’re gonna cite you for disorderly.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 64\n\n       Strict scrutiny applies to rules about speech that allegedly could cause a brawl, not to\nefforts to control a brawl. The Bible Believers spoke loudly and freely throughout the festival\nfor over an hour. Indeed, for some of that time, the presence of police officers actually made it\npossible for the Bible Believers to speak without being accosted by the crowd. The officers’\ninstruction to leave, moreover, only occurred once there was an altercation that left one of the\nBible Believers bleeding from his head. This is not a case about “the mere possibility of\nviolence.” Ante at 34. The video evidence shows plastic bottles, rocks, and other hard objects\nsuch as a milk crate being thrown at the Bible Believers, and not just by children. Indeed, as the\nmajority describes the video, it shows that “a barrage of bottles, eggs, and other debris [was]\nhurled upon the Bible Believers” and “[a]t some point during the deluge, Israel was struck in the\nface.” Ante at 12–13. Violence had broken out when the police stepped in. The only question\nconfronting police at that time was how to handle it.\n\n       It cannot be that, in an altercation where one side is greatly outnumbered but wants to\nrisk injury by standing its ground, police officers are obligated to permit the risk—indeed, must\nput themselves at risk—in the name of the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not\ncompel police to stand by and ignore their duty to protect the public.\n\n       Cases like the one before us properly call for a balancing of the speakers’ First\nAmendment interests and the community’s need for safety and order. Of course, police should\nnot be allowed to treat every outbreak of violence as cover for suppressing speech, and where it\nis reasonably possible to vindicate a speaker’s First Amendment rights, police should do so. But\nit will not always be possible to do so, taking into account all of the factors peace officers must\nconsider, such as the nature of the crowd, the resources available to police at the time, and other\nfactors bearing on law enforcement’s ability to control the scene around a speaker. Drawing a\nrigid line based on abstract doctrinal principles robs police officers of the discretion and\njudgment that is essential to law enforcement. If the police may stop the altercation, they may do\nit in a reasonable way, under the circumstances as actually presented. If bringing in a larger\npolice force is not a then-available option in the reasoned view of the peace officer on the scene,\nseparating the parties is reasonable. In the context of this case, separating the parties meant\nescorting away the less numerous group. This was a practical and reasonable thing to do—not\nprohibited by the First Amendment unless the First Amendment rigidly requires peace officers to\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 65\n\ndetermine which side threw the first stones or punches, and thereafter to protect the other side as\nthe brawl continues.\n\n       When festivalgoers began attacking the Bible Believers, law enforcement officers at the\nArab Festival had a choice: attempt to restrain the large and physically abusive crowd, or ask the\nBible Believers to leave.    The record shows that the officers made efforts to restrain the\nfestivalgoers. Among other things, they ventured into the crowd to identify the individuals who\nwere throwing debris and rocks at the Bible Believers, and issued some warnings and citations.\nThis is not a situation, then, where law enforcement jumped at the first opportunity to evict an\nobnoxious group. To the contrary, it appears the officers tried to avoid having to evict the Bible\nBelievers.\n\n       Despite their efforts, however, the officers ultimately determined that they could not\neasily stop the altercation while the Bible Believers were present. The officers thus decided to\nremove the Bible Believers from the festival grounds. The First Amendment does not prohibit\nthat reasonable exercise of judgment, and this conclusion is consistent with Glasson v. City of\nLouisville, 518 F.2d 899 (6th Cir. 1975). In Glasson, police violated the First Amendment by\ntearing up a protester’s sign after hecklers began grumbling and muttering threats about it from\nacross the street. Id. at 901–02. There was no actual violence in Glasson or even a move toward\nactual violence. Glasson involved police conduct to preempt potential violence. In contrast,\nthere was nothing potential about the fracas at the Arab Festival.\n\n                                                   ***\n\n       It is unfortunately ironic for the Bible Believers to succeed in their tactics in this case\nbased on towering but distinguishable cases involving minority civil rights protests. In the\ngreater Detroit community, it is the minority’s cultural expression that loses from today’s\ndecision. The disrupters here came from a different part of a larger community to disrupt the\nFirst Amendment activity of Arab-Americans—a sometimes feared, misunderstood, or despised\nminority within that larger community. Realistically viewed, the Bible Believers were hecklers\nseeking to disrupt the cultural fair.     The police visibly attempted to reconcile the First\nAmendment rights of festivalgoers and the Bible Believers. There may have been much better\nways for the police to handle this situation, but there was no First Amendment violation.\n\f",

This diversity contributes to our capacity to hold a broad array of opinions on an\nincalculable number of topics. It is our freedom as Americans, particularly the freedom of\nspeech, which generally allows us to express our views without fear of government sanction.\n\n       Diversity, in viewpoints and among cultures, is not always easy.

But even when communication fails to bridge the gap in understanding, or when\nunderstanding fails to heal the divide between us, the First Amendment demands that we tolerate\nthe viewpoints of others with whom we may disagree.

The scenario presented by this case,\nknown as the “heckler’s veto,” occurs when police silence a speaker to appease the crowd and\nstave off a potentially violent altercation.1 The particular facts of this case involve a group of\nself-described Christian evangelists preaching hate and denigration to a crowd of Muslims, some\nof whom responded with threats of violence. The police thereafter removed the evangelists to\nrestore the peace.

We also delineate the obligations and duties of law enforcement personnel or public\nofficials who, in the exercise of the state’s police power, seek to extinguish any breaches of the\npeace that may arise when constitutionally protected speech has stirred people to anger, and even\nto violence.\n\n                                                     Facts\n\n        A.       Dearborn and the Arab International Festival\n\n        Dearborn—home of the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company—is a city\nlocated in Wayne County, Michigan, that borders Detroit and has a stable population of\napproximately 100,000 people.2 Dearborn is also home to one of the largest populations of Arab\n\n\n\n\n        1\n          The term “heckler’s veto” is ascribed to Harry Kalven, a constitutional scholar, who noted when writing\nabout free speech and angry crowds, “If the police can silence the speaker, the law in effect acknowledges a veto\npower in hecklers who can, by being hostile enough, get the law to silence any speaker of whom they do not\napprove.” Harry Kalven, Jr., The Negro and the First Amendment 140 (Ohio St. Univ.

The Festival, which was\nfree to the public, featured Middle Eastern food, music, artisan booths, cultural acts, and other\namusements, including carnival rides. A principal purpose of the Festival was to promote\ncultural exchange. Each year, the Festival took place on a stretch of Warren Avenue, covering\nseveral blocks temporarily closed to vehicular traffic.                The street became a pedestrian\nthoroughfare lined with vendors and information booths. The brick and mortar stores lining the\nWarren sidewalks also remained open. The Festival attracted people from around the world, and\nby 2012, it was the largest festival of its kind in the United States, annually drawing more than\n300,000 people over the course of three days.\n\n        Given the size of attendance and the Festival’s focus on cultural exchange, a diverse\narray of religious groups requested permission to set up information booths on the Festival\ngrounds.5     The Festival also had a history of attracting certain Christian evangelists who\npreferred to roam free among the crowd and proselytize to the large number of Muslims who\nwere typically in attendance each year.6 These evangelists would come from across the country\nto distribute leaflets up and down the sidewalks of Warren Avenue in the heart of the Festival.\nThis practice was disrupted in 2009 when the Dearborn police enforced an anti-leafletting policy\npromoted by the American Arab Chamber of Commerce—the Festival’s primary sponsor—and\n\n        3\n          G.

Wayne County, et al.                  Page 6\n\nratified by the City. A panel of this Court subsequently held that Dearborn’s anti-leafletting\npolicy unconstitutionally encroached on the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment\nbecause it failed to serve a substantial government interest and it was not narrowly tailored, as is\nrequired with respect to any time, place, or manner restriction on protected speech. See Saieg v.\nCity of Dearborn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217506\"><a href=\"/opinion/217506/saieg-v-city-of-dearborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2011). The City of Dearborn thereafter ceded to the\nWayne County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) primary responsibility over Festival security in future\nyears.\n\n         B.       The Bible Believers\n\n         The Bible Believers were among the self-described evangelical groups that attended the\nFestival for the purpose of spreading their Christian beliefs. The founder and leader of the Bible\nBelievers, known as “Israel,” testified that due to his sincerely held religious beliefs he was\nrequired “to try and convert non-believers, and call sinners to repent.” Therefore, Israel and his\nBible Believers regularly engaged in street preaching, which consisted of advocating for their\nChristian beliefs and parading around with banners, signs, and tee-shirts that displayed messages\nassociated with those beliefs. Many of the signs and messages displayed by the Bible Believers\ncommunicated overtly anti-Muslim sentiments.\n\n         In 2011, Israel attended the Festival with a number of Bible Believers to preach to the\ncrowd of Festival-goers. Upon their arrival at the Festival on Friday, June 17, 2011, the Bible\nBelievers were directed to a protected area on the Festival grounds referred to as a “free speech\nzone.” When they returned to the Festival on Sunday, June 19, the Bible Believers were\ninformed that the free speech zone had been removed and would not be made available again.\nThe Bible Believers therefore opted to walk the public streets and sidewalks, spreading their\nmessage to those who passed by. The quintessential attribute of the Bible Believers’ message\nwas intolerance, principally proclaiming that Mohammed was a false prophet who lied to them\nand that Muslims would be damned to hell if they failed to repent by rejecting Islam.7 This\nmessage was not well received by certain elements of the crowd. The Bible Believers allege that\nthey were assaulted by various members of the crowd and that the WCSO initially watched and\n\n\n         7\n          We presume that the character of the Bible Believers’ activities in 2011 was similar if not essentially the\nsame as their activities in 2012, although the record is devoid of a specific factual account of the 2011 Festival.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.        Page 7\n\ndid nothing, then eventually silenced the Bible Believers by kicking them out and requiring them\nto leave the Festival grounds. They also alleged that Deputy Chief Jaafar personally arrested one\nof the Bible Believers to the delight of the “violent Muslims.” No formal action was taken by\neither party as a result of this alleged incident.\n\n        C.      May 2012 Pre-Festival Letters and Preparation\n\n        Israel and his Bible Believers determined to return to Dearborn the following year for the\n2012 Arab International Festival.       Prior to the Festival, the Bible Believers, through their\ncounsel, sent a letter to Defendants Wayne County and Sheriff Napoleon recounting the Bible\nBelievers’ experience at the 2011 Festival. The letter also apprised Defendants of the Bible\nBelievers’ expectations for the group’s return visit:\n\n        In light of the past actions by the officers, I write to remind the Wayne County\n        Sheriff’s Department [sic] of two points. First, the officers have a duty to protect\n        speakers like Israel from the reactions of hostile audiences. See Glasson v. City of\n        Louisville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328640\"><a href=\"/opinion/328640/marjorie-glasson-v-city-of-louisville/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 906 (6th Cir. 1975) (“A police officer has the duty not to\n        ratify and effectuate a heckler’s veto nor may he join a moiling mob intent on\n        suppressing ideas. Instead, he must take reasonable action to protect from\n        violence persons exercising their constitutional rights.”). If the officers allow a\n        hostile audience to silence a speaker, the officers themselves effectively silence\n        the speaker and effectuate a “heckler’s veto.” The First Amendment simply does\n        not countenance this scenario. See, e.g., Forsyth County, 505 U.S. at 134; Boos v.\n        Barry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320-21 (1998).

Second, Israel has the First Amendment right to engage in\n        peaceful expression on streets and sidewalks during the Arab International\n        Festival. See, e.g., Saieg v. City of Dearborn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217506\"><a href=\"/opinion/217506/saieg-v-city-of-dearborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737-41 (6th Cir.\n        2011) (invaliding [sic] ban on literature distribution on public sidewalks open to\n        public during the Arab International Festival).\n\n(R. 13-7, May 9, 2012 Ctr. for Relig. Expression Ltr., PGID 110).\n\n        Wayne County, through its Corporation Counsel, responded by letter on June 14, 2012.\nThe letter indicated Wayne County’s disagreement with respect to both the characterization of\nevents at the 2011 Festival and with the Bible Believers’ interpretation of the law regarding the\nWCSO’s duties to the public and to the Bible Believers.            Corporation Counsel noted the\nWCSO’s intent to “maintain public order consistent with its legal obligations,” but specifically\ndisclaimed any “‘special relationship’ between the WCSO and Mr. Israel” to avoid the\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 8\n\npossibility that Israel would assert in subsequent litigation that the WCSO owed Bible Believers\na heightened measure of protection. (R. 13-8, Corp. Counsel Reply, PGID 112).\n\n        The letter went on to “remind [the Bible Believers] that, under state law and local\nordinances, individuals can be held criminally accountable for conduct which has the tendency to\nincite riotous behavior or otherwise disturb the peace.” (Id. at 113). In conclusion, Corporation\nCounsel likewise cited to Sixth Circuit precedent to support the County’s view that its\nobligations to protect the Bible Believers’ speechmaking had limitations:\n\n        [L]aw enforcement personnel are not required “to defend the right of a speaker to\n        address a hostile audience, however large and intemperate, when to do so would\n        unreasonably subject them to violent retaliation and physical injury.” Glasson v.\n        City of Louisville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328640\"><a href=\"/opinion/328640/marjorie-glasson-v-city-of-louisville/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 909 (6th Cir. 1975). Rather, “[i]n such\n        circumstances, they may discharge their duty of preserving the peace by\n        intercepting his message or by removing the speaker for his own protection\n        . . . [.]”\n\n(Id. at 113).\n\n        Earlier that month, Deputy Chief Jaafar circulated an Operations Plan memorandum,\naddressed to Sheriff Napoleon, which outlined the policies and procedures to be followed by the\nWCSO throughout the course of the 2012 Arab International Festival. The second item in the\nmemorandum addressed potential “situation[s]” that could lead to trouble at the Festival. Among\nthe purported situations was “a radical group calling themselves ‘The Bible Believers’” that had\nbeen attracted to the Festival in recent years, and that would “possibly show up at the festival\ntrying to provoke [the WCSO] in a negative manner and attempt to capture the negativity on\nvideo camera.” (13-5, Ops. Plan, PGID 100). Deputy Chief Jaafar instructed his officers “to be\nalert and professional at all times . . . [and to] [r]epeat as many times as necessary” the\nappropriate orders to any group causing trouble. (Id.) As an example, he suggested repeating\nthe following command: “Sir, you are causing a disturbance, please keep moving.” (Id.) He\nalso noted that the WCSO would “not abridge or deny anyone’s Freedom of Speech, unless\npublic safety becomes [a] paramount concern.” (Id.)\n\n        The WCSO decided to employ both regular and reserve officers “to ensure public safety,\nkeep the peace, and maintain order in the event there is a disturbance.” (Id. at 101). According\nto Deputy Chief Richardson, a greater number of WCSO personnel were “allocated to the\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 9\n\nFestival . . . than . . . to the World Series or to the President of the United States when he visits\nMichigan.” (R. 13-6, Richardson Aff., PGID 107). The number of personnel also exceeded the\nnumber “allocated to other large festivals in Michigan.” (Id.) The Operations Plan listed\n51 officers (excluding those in command), most of whom were assigned to one of six zones.\nAmong this group, there were also 19 officers (including 6 mounted units) who were not\nassigned to any one specific zone, allowing them to respond to changing needs and\ncircumstances.\n\n        D.        The 2012 Arab International Festival8\n\n        The Bible Believers returned to Dearborn in 2012, at approximately 5:00 p.m. on Friday,\nJune 15, for the 17th Annual Arab International Festival. As they had done the previous year,\nthe Bible Believers traveled to the Festival so that they could exercise their sincerely held\nreligious beliefs. Unfortunately for the Festival-goers, those beliefs compelled Israel and his\nfollowers to hurl words and display messages offensive to a predominantly Muslim crowd, many\nof whom were adolescents. These messages were written on their tee-shirts and on the banners\nand signs that they carried. The following is a sampling of the Bible Believers’ messages:\n\n                                “Islam Is A Religion of Blood and Murder”\n            “Jesus Is the Way, the Truth and the Life. All Others Are Thieves and Robbers”\n                                 “Prepare to Meet Thy God – Amos 4:12”\n   “Jesus Is the Judge, Therefore Repent, Be Converted That Your Sins May Be Blotted Out”\n                                “Trust Jesus, Repent and Believe in Jesus”\n                         “Only Jesus Christ Can Save You From Sin and Hell”\n                                                “Turn or Burn”\n                                                   “Fear God”\n\n(R. 20-2, Israel Decl., PGID 176–77). In addition to the signs, one of the Bible Believers carried\na severed pig’s head on a spike, because, in Israel’s own words, it would “ke[ep] [the Muslims]\nat bay” since “unfortunately, they are kind of petrified of that animal.” (R. 28-A, Raw Festival\nFootage, Time: 00:49:45).\n\n        8\n          Most of the facts regarding the 2012 Arab International Festival are derived from a video recording that\nthe Bible Believers made during the Festival in order to contemporaneously memorialize their free speech activities.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 10\n\n       Laden with this imagery, the Bible Believers entered the Festival and began their\npreaching. At first, few people paid attention other than to glance at what appeared to be an odd\nassembly. The first speaker told the crowd that they should not follow “a false prophet,” who\nwas nothing but an “unclean drawing” and “a pedophile.” (Id. at 00:01:40). He continued by\ntelling what was by then a group made up of approximately thirty teenagers that “[y]our religion\nwill send you to hell.” (Id. at 00:03:30). Tensions started to rise as a few youths became\nincensed after the speaker taunted, “You believe in a prophet who is a pervert. Your prophet who\nwants to molest a child,” and “God will reject you. God will put your religion into hellfire when\nyou die.” (Id. at 00:03:56, 00:04:38). This continued as a few of the teens became agitated, until\none youth simply told his friends to “quit giving them attention,” convincing some members of\nthe crowd to disperse. (Id. at 00:06:07).\n\n       After approximately seven minutes of proselytizing, some elements of the crowd began\nto express their anger by throwing plastic bottles and other debris at the Bible Believers. An\nofficer was captured on video observing the scene without intervening or reprimanding the\njuvenile offenders. The size of the crowd ebbed and flowed. At one point an officer approached\nthe Bible Believers and commanded that the speakers stop using a megaphone or be cited for\nviolating city ordinances. The Bible Believers relented, but also responded by noting that “these\nangry kids are a little bit more vicious than the megaphone.” (Id. at 00:16:16). A few minutes\nlater, an officer did ask the kids to back up and subsequently removed one of the teenagers who\nhe saw throwing a bottle. However, all police presence and intervention dissipated after this\nminimal and isolated intervention.\n\n       The Bible Believers continued preaching for another ten minutes without the megaphone,\nall while a growing group of teenagers jeered and heckled, some throwing bottles and others\nshouting profanities. At one point, a parent stepped in to reprimand his child for participating in\nthe assault. The onslaught reached its climax when a few kids began throwing larger items such\nas milk crates. By that time, the Bible Believers had stopped all speechmaking whatsoever.\n\n       A number of debates spawned between members of the crowd (which had continued to\nswell) and individual Bible Believers. A particularly emotional youth debated with a Bible\nBeliever the merits of his group’s bigoted views, noting that he had studied both the Quran and\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.          Page 11\n\nthe Bible, and that Muslims believe in the same First Testament as the followers of Christianity.\nThis brief moment of reasoned debated devolved into a shouting match, and ended when the\nyouth was pulled away by an unidentified individual.\n\n        A few minutes later, the crowd of youths became quiet after four mounted officers simply\nrode by, without making commands or pausing—even for a moment. The calm persisted while\nIsrael gave an interview to a local news crew. But once this interview ended, and the police and\ncamera crews left the scene, the Bible Believers again were assaulted with flying debris. The\nBible Believers turned away from the crowd and started moving through the Festival for a\nsecond time. A large contingent of children ran after them, and the relatively light cascade of\ndebris intensified into a barrage of bottles, eggs, and other debris being hurled upon the Bible\nBelievers. When the Bible Believers again resettled at a new location, and with their backs no\nlonger facing the crowd, the torrent died down. At some point during the deluge, Israel was\nstruck in the face, which resulted in him suffering a small laceration.\n\n        When an officer arrived on the scene a few minutes later, the children’s belligerence and\nthe assaultive behavior again ceased. The officer bellowed at a few youths to move out of the\nway; they complied immediately. He then told Israel, “you are a danger to public safety right\nnow,” and stated that the WCSO did not have the manpower to keep the Bible Believers safe.\n(Id. at 00:43:12). The officer then suggested that the Bible Believers always “have the option to\nleave,” while he simultaneously ignored Israel’s plea that some sort of police presence just\nremain in the general vicinity. The officer departed, and the bottle throwing resumed.\n\n        A few minutes later, a group of officers returned to the area and cut a path through the\ncrowd in order to approach Israel and his followers. Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar pulled\nIsrael aside for the purpose of telling him that the Bible Believers would be escorted out of the\nFestival. But Israel responded that he was unprepared to leave without having the opportunity to\nfinish walking his parade route while exercising his First Amendment rights.\n\n        Richardson explained to Israel, “We have the responsibility of policing the entire festival,\nand obviously your conduct especially is causing this disturbance and it is a direct threat to the\nsafety of everyone here.” (Id. at 00:48:30). He also noted that “part of the reason they throw this\nstuff . . . is that you tell them stuff that enrages them.” (Id. at 00:49:03). Israel protested, first by\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 12\n\nnoting that the disturbances only occurred in the absence of any police presence, and second, by\ncommenting that the Bible Believers had stopped preaching altogether during the previous\ntwenty minutes and were only carrying signs. Israel suggested that if the WCSO just assigned\ntwo officers to insure that the crowd of adolescents surrounding the Bible Believers’\ndemonstration remained nonviolent, all concerns about public safety would be resolved. Deputy\nChief Jaafar chimed in at this point by telling Israel that the WCSO could not provide individual\nofficers for every group that wanted to protest at the Festival, and that Israel’s group needed to\nleave because his group’s conduct was “attracting a crowd and . . . affecting public safety.” (Id.\nat 00:50:40). When Israel continued to protest that he was not speaking and his signs were\npermissible, Richardson, again, pointed to the Bible Believers’ speech as the cause for the unrest.\nHe stated, “ya know, apparently what you are saying to them and what they are saying back to\nyou is creating danger.” (Id. at 00:50:48). Richardson continued suggesting that Israel leave, but\nIsrael refused to do so unless the WCSO was prepared to threaten Israel with the prospect of\nbeing arrested. Richardson expressed fear that the situation was escalating and stated, “the\nproblem is that one of your people’s gonna get hurt, or one of the crowd is gonna get hurt, or one\nof my officers is gonna get hurt.” (Id. at 00:52:41). When Israel again inquired whether the\nBible Believers would be arrested if they did not leave the Festival, Richardson only committed\nto saying that they would “probably” be cited if they did not allow themselves to be escorted out.\nHe thereafter told Israel that the Bible Believers were being “disorderly,” to which Israel replied,\nincredulously, “I would assume 200 angry Muslim children throwing bottles is more of a threat\nthan a few guys with signs.” (Id. at 00:53:48).\n\n       Following this exchange, Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar conferred with\nCorporation Counsel. Another half dozen officers stood along the edge of the barricaded area to\nwhich the Bible Believers had been secluded. On the other side of the barricade, the Festival\ncontinued. Richardson returned to speak with Israel and confirmed that Israel and his Bible\nBelievers would be cited for disorderly conduct if they did not immediately leave the Festival.\n(Id. at 00:55:03) (“If you don’t leave we’re gonna cite you for disorderly.”). Israel complied, and\nthe Bible Believers were escorted out of the Festival by more than a dozen officers. Four\nmounted officers also surveyed the scene on the edge of the Festival where the Bible Believers\nwere being directed to exit.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.     Page 13\n\n       The Bible Believers loaded into a van and departed. However, two WCSO cruisers\nimmediately began following the van and pulled the Bible Believers over within only a few\nblocks of the Festival—a third cruiser pulled up shortly thereafter. Officers claimed that the\nBible Believers were stopped because they had removed the license plate from their vehicle prior\nto their departure. After waiting for nearly thirty minutes, they were issued a citation. By that\ntime, two additional officers had arrived on bicycles, bringing the total number of law\nenforcement personnel involved in this traffic stop to eight officers.\n\n       The WCSO made a post-operation report summarizing its version of the day’s events.\nThe report noted that the WCSO was “able to ke[ep] reasonable control of civil peace[, but] [a]s\nthe crowd progress[ed] around the protestors to an unsafe level, we suggested to the protestors to\nleave the area immediately because public safety was being jeopardized.” (R. 13-9, Post-Op.\nRpt., PGID 114). The report further noted that “[a]ny subjects that were seen throwing objects\n[were] immediately taken into custody.” (Id.). They apparently did not see very much. Only\none citation was issued to a 21-year old man who was caught throwing a bottle. The WCSO\nofficers also issued three verbal warnings and briefly detained three juveniles, ranging in age\nfrom twelve to seventeen, before ultimately releasing them to the custody of their respective\nparents.\n\n       In summary, the Bible Believers attended the 2012 Festival for the purpose of exercising\ntheir First Amendment rights by spreading their anti-Islam religious message. When a crowd of\nyouthful hecklers gathered around the Bible Believers, the police did nothing.          When the\nhecklers began throwing bottles and other garbage at the Bible Believers, a WCSO officer\nintervened only to demand that the Bible Believers stop utilizing their megaphone to amplify\ntheir speech. Virtually absent from the video in the record is any indication that the police\nattempted to quell the violence being directed toward the Bible Believers by the lawless crowd of\nadolescents. Despite this apparent lack of effort to maintain any semblance of order at the\nFestival, each time the police appeared on the video—to reprimand the use of the Bible\nBelievers’ megaphone, to suggest that the Bible Believers had the “option to leave” the Festival,\nto trot by on horseback while doing next to nothing, and to expel the Bible Believers from the\nFestival under threat of arrest—the agitated crowd became subdued and orderly simply due the\nauthoritative presence cast by the police officers who were then in close proximity.

Israel, when faced with the prospect\nof being arrested for disorderly conduct, observed, “and you would think we would be\ncomplaining, but we’re not.” (R. 28-A, Raw Festival Footage, Time: 00:55:16). The Bible\nBelievers were thereafter escorted from the Festival and ticketed by a large group of WCSO\nofficers for removing the license plate from their van.\n\n                                       Procedural History\n\n       On September 25, 2012, the Bible Believers initiated this suit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The complaint\nalleged that Defendants violated the Bible Believers’ rights of free speech and free exercise,\nprotected by the First Amendment, as well as their right to equal protection of the laws,\nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants answered, and then subsequently moved,\nsimultaneously, for summary judgment and dismissal of all of the Bible Believers’ claims. The\nBible Believers filed a response to Defendants’ motion, which included a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, and Defendants filed a reply. The district court issued an opinion granting\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, denying the Bible Believers’ cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, and dismissing the Bible Believers’ claims.\n\n       The Bible Believers thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal. The issues were briefed\nand the case was argued before a three-judge panel of this Court the following year. The panel,\nin a split decision, affirmed the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to\nWayne County and the individual Defendants. Bible Believers v.

Ultimately, we find that\nDefendants violated the Bible Believers’ First Amendment rights because there can be no\nlegitimate dispute based on this record that the WCSO effectuated a heckler’s veto by cutting off\nthe Bible Believers’ protected speech in response to a hostile crowd’s reaction.\n\n        We address the following items in turn: protected versus unprotected speech; the\nappropriate level of scrutiny to be applied in a public forum given the facts of this case; the\nprecedents upon which the heckler’s veto doctrine is built; the rule derived from those\nprecedents; and the rule’s application to this case. We then address whether the individual\n\n        9\n           Defendants ostensibly concede that the Bible Believers’ speech and expression were protected, but the\nthrust of their arguments belies their purported concession.

Finally, we consider whether Wayne County can be held liable for the actions of its\nlaw enforcement personnel.\n\n       A.      Protected Speech\n\n       The First Amendment offers sweeping protection that allows all manner of speech to\nenter the marketplace of ideas. This protection applies to loathsome and unpopular speech with\nthe same force as it does to speech that is celebrated and widely accepted. The protection would\nbe unnecessary if it only served to safeguard the majority views. In fact, it is the minority view,\nincluding expressive behavior that is deemed distasteful and highly offensive to the vast majority\nof people, that most often needs protection under the First Amendment.

Two areas of unprotected speech that\nhave particular relevance to the interaction between offensive speakers and hostile crowds are\n“incitement to violence” (also known as “incitement to riot”) and “fighting words.” Both classes\nof speech are discussed below.\n\n                 1.       Incitement\n\n        The right to freedom of speech provides that a state cannot “proscribe advocacy of the\nuse of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing\nimminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” Brandenburg, 395 U.S.\nat 447 (footnote omitted). Advocacy for the use of force or lawless behavior, intent, and\nimminence, are all absent from the record in this case. The doctrine of incitement has absolutely\nno application to these facts.\n\n        The Bible Believers’ speech advocated for their Christian beliefs and for harboring\ncontempt for Islam.        This advocacy was purportedly intended to convince Muslims at the\nFestival that they should convert to Christianity. Regardless of the wisdom or efficacy of this\nstrategy, or of the gross intolerance the speakers’ conduct epitomized, disparaging the views of\nanother to support one’s own cause is protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., Snyder,\n562 U.S. at 454 (placards reading “You’re Going to Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” and “God Hates\nFags,” “certainly convey[ed] . . .

Although it might be inferred that\nthe Bible Believers’ speech was intended to anger their target audience, the record is devoid of\nany indication that they intended imminent lawlessness to ensue. Quite to the contrary, the Bible\nBelievers contacted Wayne County prior to their visit, requesting that the WCSO keep the public\nat bay so that the Bible Believers could “engage in their peaceful expression.”\n\n       It is not an easy task to find that speech rises to such a dangerous level that it can be\ndeemed incitement to riot.

In Claiborne Hardware Co.,\na speaker explicitly proposed to a large crowd that anyone who failed to abide by the terms of an\nagreed upon boycott would have to be “disciplined.” 458 U.S. at 902. The speaker also stated,\n“If we catch any of you going in any of them racist stores, we’re gonna break your damn neck.”\nId. Nonetheless, this speech was not deemed by the Court to be incitement. Id. at 928–29.\n\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to Brandenburg—not Feiner—as establishing\nthe test for incitement. See, e.g., Whitcomb, 414 U.S. at 447–48 (“We most recently summarized\nthe constitutional principles that have evolved in this area[—incitement—]in Brandenburg.”);\nClaiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. at 928 (“The emotionally charged rhetoric of [the plaintiff’s]\nspeeches did not transcend the bounds of protected speech set forth in Brandenburg.”); see also\nJames v.

Wayne County, et al.             Page 20\n\nfor whether speech constitutes unprotected incitement to violence in Brandenburg.”).                       The\nBrandenburg test precludes speech from being sanctioned as incitement to riot unless (1) the\nspeech explicitly or implicitly encouraged the use of violence or lawless action,11 (2) the speaker\nintends that his speech will result in the use of violence or lawless action, and (3) the imminent\nuse of violence or lawless action is the likely result of his speech. 395 U.S. at 477. The Bible\nBelievers’ speech was not incitement to riot simply because they did not utter a single word that\ncan be perceived as encouraging violence or lawlessness. Moreover, there is absolutely no\nindication of the Bible Believers’ subjective intent to spur their audience to violence. The hostile\nreaction of a crowd does not transform protected speech into incitement.\n\n                 2.      Fighting Words\n\n        A second type of speech that is categorically excluded from First Amendment protection\nis known as “fighting words.” This category of unprotected speech encompasses words that\nwhen spoken aloud instantly “inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.”\nChaplinsky v.

Furthermore, the average individual attending the Festival did not react with\nviolence, and of the group made up of mostly adolescents, only a certain percentage engaged in\nbottle throwing when they heard the proselytizing.\n\n\n        11\n           Incitement requires, in the view of some constitutional scholars, that “the words used by the speaker\nobjectively encouraged and urged and provoked imminent action.” 5 Ronald D.

Therefore, we find that\nWayne County’s actions were decidedly content-based. It is indisputable that the WCSO acted\nagainst the Bible Believers in response to the crowd’s negative reaction.            Deputy Chief\nRichardson told Israel, “your conduct especially is causing this disturbance;” “part of the reason\nthey throw this stuff . . . is that you tell them stuff that enrages them;” “apparently what you are\nsaying to them and what they are saying back to you is creating danger;” and therefore, “[i]f you\ndon’t leave we’re gonna cite you for disorderly.”\n\n        The sum of Wayne County’s counter-argument to the charge that the Bible Believers’\nexpulsion was motivated by the views they espoused is merely that the WCSO Operations Plan\nwas content-neutral, and that the WCSO’s only consideration was maintaining the public safety.\nThis contention fails in the face of abundant evidence that the police have effectuated a heckler’s\nveto.   It is irrelevant whether the Operations Plan is content-neutral because the officers\nenforcing it are ordained with broad discretion to determine, based on listener reaction, that a\nparticular expressive activity is creating a public danger.

Early Cases: Clear and Present Danger\n\n        The “clear and present danger” test, first articulated by Justice Holmes in Schenck v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99296\"><a href=\"/opinion/99296/schenck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1919), is a flexible means to protect speech while recognizing that\nthe government might have legitimate reasons for imposing speech-restrictions due to exigent\ncircumstances:\n\n        The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such\n        circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that\n        they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It\n        is a question of proximity and degree.\n\n249 U.S. at 52.12 The Supreme Court in Cantwell v. Connecticut and in Terminiello v. City of\nChicago utilized the clear and present danger test to establish the rights of speakers not to be\nsilenced on account of listeners’ hostility toward their message.\n\n        In Cantwell, a Jehovah’s Witness was convicted for inciting a breach of the peace after\ngoing into a predominantly Catholic neighborhood and playing (to bypassers who were willing\nto listen) a phonograph recording that demonized Catholicism. 310 U.S. at 302–03, 309. Two\nlisteners of the recording were so offended that they threatened the Witness that he better leave\nor face violent retaliation. Id. at 309. The Court recognized that with religion and politics in\nparticular, “[t]o persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, as we know, at times,\nresorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or\nstate, and even to false statement.” Id. at 310. Invoking the now-familiar clear and present\ndanger test, the Court found that the expressive activity did not fall outside of the confines of free\nspeech protection and therefore it could not lawfully be penalized by the state. Id. at 310–11.\n\n\n        12\n           Although this test was first introduced by Justice Holmes to uphold convictions of wartime dissenters\nunder the speech-repressive Espionage and Sedition Acts, Holmes continued to invoke this language in dissent\nthroughout the 1920s as a means to protect political speech, until it became firmly established as the governing rule\nfollowing its use in Justice Brandeis’ famous concurrence in Whitney v.

David L. Hudson, Jr., Legal Almanac: The First\nAmendment: Freedom of Speech § 1:4 (Oct. 2012).\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 24\n\n        In Terminiello, the Supreme Court again applied the clear and present danger test to\noverturn a conviction based on a statute that allowed the state to punish speech based on crowd\nhostility—i.e. a heckler’s veto. 337 U.S. at 4–5. The hostility was quite real in that instance, as\nthe crowd had gathered outside the auditorium and begun throwing icepicks, bottles, and rocks,\nin response to the speaker’s remarks. Id. at 15 (Jackson, J., dissenting). Justice Douglas wrote\nfor the Court that “freedom of speech, though not absolute, is nevertheless protected against\ncensorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious\nsubstantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.” 337 U.S. at 4\n(citations omitted). He noted that constitutionally protected speech “may strike at prejudices and\npreconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.” Id.\nTherefore, the state cannot sanction speech, consistent with the Constitution, solely on the basis\nthat it “stirred people to anger, invited public dispute, or brought about a condition of unrest.”\nId. at 5.\n\n        Cantwell and Terminiello instruct that offensive religious proselytizing, as well as speech\nthat drives a crowd to extreme agitation, is not subject to sanction simply because of the violent\nreaction of offended listeners. Feiner came shortly after these cases, and it highlighted a\nsignificant flaw with the clear and present danger test in this context; chiefly, “it allows an\naudience reaction, if hostile enough, to be a basis for suppressing a speaker.”             Erwin\nChemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies 1041 (4th ed. 2011). The Supreme\nCourt recognized this flaw and eschewed any reliance on the clear and present danger test in the\ncivil-rights era cases involving hostile crowds. See, e.g., Gregory, 394 U.S. at 112–13. Those\ncases reasserted, as paramount, the right of the speaker to not be silenced.\n\n               2.      Civil-Rights Era: Protect the Speaker\n\n        In Edwards v. South Carolina, 187 black college and high school students were convicted\nfor breach of the peace following a peaceful protest, where, in small groups, the students\nmarched to the Columbia, South Carolina state house carrying placards bearing messages in\nsupport of equality and civil rights. 372 U.S. at 229–30. During the demonstration, between\n200 and 300 white observers gathered in a horseshoe around the students. Id. at 231. The police\nthreatened the students with arrest after “apprehend[ing] immin[ent] violence” by a number of\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 25\n\ntroublemakers in the crowd of onlookers. Id. at 245 (Clark, J., dissenting); id. at 231 & n.4\n(majority opinion). The Supreme Court reversed the convictions, distinguished Feiner as being a\ncase involving incitement, and reaffirmed Terminiello by recognizing that expressive activity\ncannot be proscribed merely because it “‘stirred people to anger, invited public dispute, or\nbrought about a condition of unrest.’” Id. at 238 (quoting Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 5).\n\n       Similarly, in Cox v. Louisiana, a student civil rights organizer led 2,000 fellow students\nin a peaceful protest outside of a courthouse in downtown Baton Rouge. 379 U.S. at 538–40.\nApproximately 100 to 300 white onlookers gathered to watch the protest. Id. at 541. When the\nstudent leader suggested to the protestors that they stage a sit-in at the segregated lunch counters\nin town, the crowd of onlookers reacted with jeers and became agitated. Id. at 550. Police\nfeared that “violence was about to erupt” from the crowd of onlookers and dispersed the student\nprotestors with a canister of tear gas, arresting the student leader the following day for breach of\nthe peace. Id. at 548, 550 n.12. The Supreme Court invoked Edwards, noting that the “evidence\nshowed no more than that the opinions which the students were peaceably expressing were\nsufficiently opposed to the views of the majority of the community to attract a crowd and\nnecessitate police protection,” and overturned the conviction because “constitutional rights may\nnot be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise.” Id. at 551 (citation,\nbrackets, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Finally, in Gregory v. City of Chicago, a group of civil rights protestors peacefully\nmarched around the Mayor of Chicago’s home to draw attention to and air their frustration with\nthe slow pace of integration in Chicago’s public schools. 394 U.S. at 111. The protestors were\nassaulted by onlookers with rocks and eggs, despite “a determined effort by the police to allow\nthe marchers to peacefully demonstrate.” Id. at 117 (Black, J., concurring). The protestors\nhurled invective back at their hecklers, but otherwise “maintained a decorum that sp[oke] well\nfor their determination simply to” exercise their constitutional rights. Id. The police determined\nthat the hecklers “were dangerously close to rioting,” and therefore ordered the protestors to\nleave. Id. at 120. They were charged with and convicted of breach of the peace for refusing to\nvacate. Id. The Court, in a plurality opinion, called it a “simple case” because due process does\nnot allow for a conviction for breach of the peace where there is no evidence that the protestors\nwere themselves disorderly.     Id. at 112.    Justice Black, joined by Justice Douglas in his\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.         Page 26\n\nconcurrence, reaffirmed Edwards and Cox as controlling, inasmuch as the state cannot punish a\nspeaker simply because his lawful speech has attracted an angry mob of hecklers. Id. at 123–24,\n124 n.8.\n\n       The civil-rights era cases tell us that police cannot punish a peaceful speaker as an easy\nalternative to dealing with a lawless crowd that is offended by what the speaker has to say.\nBecause the “right ‘peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of\ngrievances’ is specifically protected by the First Amendment,” Gregory, 394 U.S. at 119\n(Black, J., concurring), the espousal of views that are disagreeable to the majority of listeners\nmay at times “necessitate police protection,” Edwards, 372 U.S. at 237. “Liberty can only be\nexercised in a system of law which safeguards order.” Cox, 379 U.S. at 574. It is “a police\nofficer’s . . . duty . . . to enforce laws already enacted and to make arrests . . . for conduct already\nmade criminal.” Gregory, 394 U.S. at 120 (Black, J., concurring). Therefore, the natural order of\nlaw enforcement and crime mitigation are not upended simply because community hostility\nmakes it easier to act against the speaker rather than the individuals actually breaking the law;\nthis is true when it appears that a crowd may turn to rioting, Cox, 379 U.S. at 588, or even in the\nface of actual violence that was indiscriminately directed, Gregory, 394 U.S. at 129 (“The police\nwere dodging the rocks and eggs” along with the protestors) (Appendix to Opinion of Black, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n               3.       Sixth Circuit Precedent: Glasson and Damages Liability\n\n       In the decade following this string of Supreme Court precedents, a heckler’s veto case\ncame before the Sixth Circuit. See Glasson v. City of Louisville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328640\"><a href=\"/opinion/328640/marjorie-glasson-v-city-of-louisville/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1975).\nGlasson recognized, consistent with the aforementioned precedents, that “[a] police officer has\nthe duty not to ratify and effectuate a heckler’s veto nor may he join a moiling mob intent on\nsuppressing ideas.” Id. at 906.\n\n       The dispute in Glasson originated when a speaker intent on voicing her displeasure with\nthe Vietnam War, as well as the issues of racism and poverty in America, displayed a placard\nreflecting her grievances while waiting on a motorcade route for then-President Richard M.\nNixon. Id. at 901. One of the police officers responsible for crowd control noticed that a group\nof Nixon supporters on the opposite side of the street became agitated, started hollering, and\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 27\n\nwere likely to riot, after perceiving the poster.              Id. at 902.     Instead of reprimanding the\nrabble-rousing crowd, the officer destroyed the speaker’s poster after she refused to hide it from\nview. Id.\n\n        The police officer’s actions in Glasson were a patent violation of the speaker’s First\nAmendment rights, because the speaker did not “somehow forfeit[] the protection afforded her\nmessage by the Constitution because it unintentionally evoked a hostile reaction from others.”\nId. at 905. However, this Court’s inquiry in Glasson did not end there; the officers were entitled\nto seek shelter from damages by way of qualified immunity—then framed as a good faith\ndefense. Id. at 907. This defense was applicable if the officer acted reasonably under the\ncircumstances and in good faith. Id. With respect to reasonableness in the context of free speech\nand unruly hecklers, Glasson states:\n\n        Ideally, police officers will always protect to the extent of their ability the rights\n        of persons to engage in First Amendment activity. Yet, the law does not expect or\n        require them to defend the right of a speaker to address a hostile audience,\n        however large and intemperate, when to do so would unreasonably subject them\n        to violent retaliation and physical injury. In such circumstances, they may\n        discharge their duty of preserving the peace by intercepting his message or by\n        removing the speaker for his own protection without having to respond in\n        damages.\n\nId. at 909.13 Ultimately, the Glasson Court held that the officers could not claim the shelter of\nthe good-faith defense because (1) it was the hecklers who posed the threat, and not the speaker\n(if any threat existed at all); (2) a favorable number of other officers (relative to the size of the\ncrowd) were nearby and available to assist if called upon; and (3) had that number of officers\nbeen insufficient to accomplish the task, reinforcements should have been called before they\nchose to take action against the speaker. Id. at 910–11.\n\n                 4.       Constitutional Rule: No Heckler’s Veto\n\n        The Supreme Court, in Cantwell, Terminiello, Edwards, Cox, and Gregory, has\nrepeatedly affirmed the principle that “constitutional rights may not be denied simply because of\n\n\n        13\n           This rule allowing for police to be free from damages even when they silence the speaker so long as they\nacted reasonably is derived from Justice Frankfurter’s concurring opinion in Feiner.

If the speaker’s message does not fall into one of the recognized categories\nof unprotected speech,14 the message does not lose its protection under the First Amendment due\nto the lawless reaction of those who hear it. Simply stated, the First Amendment does not permit\na heckler’s veto.\n\n       In this Circuit, a modicum of confusion is understandable with respect to the prohibition\nagainst the heckler’s veto due to Glasson’s discussion of a good-faith affirmative defense.\nHowever, this defense is inconsistent with subsequent Supreme Court precedent, with the strict\nscrutiny that must be applied to content-based discrimination, and with the superseding\naffirmative defense to a § 1983 suit—qualified immunity.15                        Therefore, to the extent that\nGlasson’s good-faith defense may be interpreted as altering the substantive duties of a police\nofficer not to effectuate a heckler’s veto, it is overruled. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n819 (1982) (“By defining the limits of qualified immunity essentially in objective terms, we\nprovide no license to lawless conduct.”).\n\n       In a balance between two important interests—free speech on one hand, and the state’s\npower to maintain the peace on the other—the scale is heavily weighted in favor of the First\nAmendment. See, e.g., Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 4. Maintenance of the peace should not be\nachieved at the expense of the free speech. The freedom to espouse sincerely held religious,\npolitical, or philosophical beliefs, especially in the face of hostile opposition, is too important to\nour democratic institution for it to be abridged simply due to the hostility of reactionary listeners\nwho may be offended by a speaker’s message. If the mere possibility of violence were allowed\nto dictate whether our views, when spoken aloud, are safeguarded by the Constitution,\nsurely the myriad views that animate our discourse would be reduced to the “standardization of\nideas . . . by . . .

Comm. for Indus.

If the speaker, at his\nor her own risk, chooses to continue exercising the constitutional right to freedom of speech, he\nor she may do so without fear of retribution from the state, for the speaker is not the one\nthreatening to breach the peace or break the law. However, the Constitution does not require that\nthe officer “go down with the speaker.”16 If, in protecting the speaker or attempting to quash the\nlawless behavior, the officer must retreat due to risk of injury, then retreat would be warranted.\nThe rule to be followed is that when the police seek to enforce law and order, they must do so in\na way that does not unnecessarily infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.\nSee Gregory, 394 U.S. at 120 (“[A] police officer[’s] . . . duty is to enforce laws already enacted\nand to make arrests . . . for conduct already made criminal.”) (Black, J., concurring). The police\nmay go against the hecklers, cordon off the speakers, or attempt to disperse the entire crowd if\nthat becomes necessary. Moreover, they may take any appropriate action to maintain law and\norder that does not destroy the right to free speech by indefinitely silencing the speaker.\nFundamentally, no police action that hinders the speaker’s freedom of speech should be deemed\nlegitimate in the eyes of the Constitution unless it satisfies strict scrutiny, which requires the\npolice to achieve their ends by using only those means that are the least restrictive with respect to\nthe speaker’s First Amendment rights.\n\n       “[T]he Constitution demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed\ninvalid and that the [g]overnment bear the burden of showing their constitutionality.” Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2544 (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipses omitted). Wayne County has\nnot come close to meeting that burden in this case. There was a force of approximately fifty\nofficers at the Festival—nineteen of whom were purposely unassigned so that they could respond\nto changing circumstances. A crowd made up predominantly of adolescents began hurling\nplastic bottles and other trash at the Bible Believers. Law enforcement officers, despite their\n\n       16\n            Kalven, supra, The Negro and the First Amendment, at 140.\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                 Page 30\n\nnumbers, were virtually nowhere to be found, save for a few brief appearances. One of these\nappearances was solely for the purpose of telling the Bible Believers that they could no longer\nuse their megaphone.           At a later encounter, an officer came over not to reprimand the\ntroublemakers, but to inform the Bible Believers that they were free to leave the Festival. Each\ntime that an officer appeared, the adolescents’ lawless behavior relented, despite the lack of\nofficial reprimand.        Throughout the harassment and violence directed at them, the Bible\nBelievers remained calm and peaceful. While the Deputy Chiefs conferred with Corporation\nCounsel, and prior to the Bible Believers being forced to leave the Festival, there were\napproximately a dozen officers milling about in the background. Many of those officers were\nsufficiently unoccupied to follow the Bible Believers and observe their fellow officer ticket them\nfor driving a vehicle without a license plate. By the WCSO’s own admission in its post-\noperation report, the totality of the officers’ attempt to enforce the law constituted only a few\nverbal warnings being directed at the lawless adolescents and one individual being cited.\n\n         Wayne County disputes the sufficiency of their manpower to quell the crowd, but this\ncontention is specious. The video record evinces next to no attempt made by the officers to\nprotect the Bible Believers or prevent the lawless actions of the audience. The record also\nindicates a substantial police presence that went virtually unused. Wayne County claimed to\nhave assigned more law enforcement personnel to the Festival than had previously been assigned\nto crowd control when the President of the United States visited the area. We cannot justifiably\nset the bar so low for the police officers sworn to protect our communities (and occasionally the\nPresident) that there is any debate as to whether it is reasonable that the result of a purportedly\nsincere effort to maintain peace among a group of rowdy youths is few verbal warnings and a\nsingle arrest.17\n\n\n\n\n         17\n           Judge Gibbons’ dissent makes much of the presence of actual—as opposed to potential—violence\ndirected at the Bible Believers by the adolescent audience. Gibbons Dis. 53–54. However, the dissent’s\nunsupported, hyperbolic account of the Bible Believers as “bruised and bloodied,” Gibbons Dis. 54, ignores any\nresponsibility on the part of the WCSO to use some small part of its police force, and the aura of authority with\nwhich a sheriff’s office is imbued, to attempt to protect the Bible Believers from the lawless behavior of the crowd.\nSimilarly, because the WSCO made no genuine efforts to utilize its officers to prevent or punish the unlawful\nbehavior of the adolescents, it is unfair, on this record, to characterize the crowd’s conduct as “undeterred by police\npresence.” Gibbons Dis. 54.\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.                  Page 31\n\n         We do not presume to dictate to law enforcement precisely how it should maintain the\npublic order. But in this case, there were a number of easily identifiable measures that could\nhave been taken short of removing the speaker: e.g., increasing police presence in the immediate\nvicinity, as was requested; erecting a barricade for free speech, as was requested; arresting or\nthreatening to arrest more of the law breakers, as was also requested; or allowing the Bible\nBelievers to speak from the already constructed barricade to which they were eventually\nsecluded prior to being ejected from the Festival. If none of these measures were feasible or had\nbeen deemed unlikely to prevail, the WCSO officers could have called for backup—as they\nappear to have done when they decided to eject the Bible Believers from the Festival—prior to\nfinding that it was necessary to infringe on the group’s First Amendment rights. We simply\ncannot accept Defendants’ position that they were compelled to abridge constitutional rights for\nthe sake of public safety, when at the same time the lawless adolescents who caused the risk with\ntheir assaultive behavior were left unmolested.18\n\n         The Bible Believers attended the Festival to exercise their First Amendment rights and\nspread their religious message. The way they conveyed their message may have been vile and\noffensive to most every person who believes in the right of their fellow citizens to practice the\nfaith of his or her choosing; nonetheless, they had every right to espouse their views. See\nCantwell, 310 U.S. at 309 (“The record played . . . would offend not only persons of [the\nCatholic] persuasion, but all others who respect the honestly held religious faith of their\nfellows.”). When the message was ill-received, the police did next to nothing to protect the\nBible Believers or to contain the lawlessness of the hecklers in the crowd. Instead, the WCSO\naccused the Bible Believers of being disorderly and removed them from the Festival.19 On this\n\n\n         18\n           In his dissent, Judge Rogers maintains that when assessing whether to cut off speech being made to a\nhostile crowd, law enforcement should be permitted to “tak[e] into account all of the factors” they routinely consider\nin keeping the peace, including “the nature of the crowd, the resources available to police at the time, and other\nfactors bearing on law enforcement’s ability to control the scene around a speaker.” Rogers Dis. 64. We hold the\nsame. On this point, the difference between our view and that of Judge Rogers is that Judge Rogers believes that the\nWCSO chose a constitutional course of conduct after considering these factors, and we find that they did not.\n         19\n           Contrary to Judge Rogers’ assertion, Rogers Dis. 62–63, the video record indicates that the WCSO\nthreatened to cite the Bible Believers for disorderly conduct not due to any purported failure to obey a police order,\nbut based on the unrest created by their speech. (R. 28-A, Raw Festival Footage, Time: 00:53:41 (Officer\nRichardson: “I’m not telling you that you’re going to be arrested, but, you know, you are a danger to the public\nsafety. You’re disorderly.”); id. at 00:54:58 (“Alright, you need to leave . . . . If you don’t leave we’re going to cite\nyou for disorderly. You are creating a disturbance . . . I mean look at your people here . . . This is crazy.”).\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.   Page 32\n\nrecord, there can be no reasonable dispute that the WCSO effectuated a heckler’s veto, thereby\nviolating the Bible Believers’ First Amendment rights.\n\n        In his dissent from this part of our holding, Judge Griffin opines that although Cantwell\nand Terminiello clearly established that police officers may not effectuate a heckler’s veto on\nbehalf of an irate mob, “those precedents left unanswered whether the police effectuate a\nheckler’s veto when they remove a speaker for his own safety rather than because of the content\nof the speech or its supposed effect on the crowd.” Griffin Dis. at 46–47. Fortunately, Cantwell\nand Terminiello were not the last cases to speak on the issue of a heckler’s veto, and later cases\nhave made clear that excluding a speaker from a public forum, under most circumstances, will\nnot constitute the least restrictive means for coping with a crowd’s hostile reaction to her\nconstitutionally protected speech. See supra Part I.C. Such a result comports with the high\npremium this nation places on speech safeguarded by the First Amendment.\n\n        Notably, a heckler’s veto effectuated by the police will nearly always be susceptible to\nbeing reimagined and repackaged as a means for protecting the public, or the speaker himself,\nfrom actual or impending harm.           After all, if the audience is sufficiently incensed by the\nspeaker’s message and responds aggressively or even violently thereto, one method of quelling\nthat response would be to cut off the speech and eject the speaker whose words provoked the\ncrowd’s ire. Our point here is that before removing the speaker due to safety concerns, and\nthereby permanently cutting off his speech, the police must first make bona fide efforts to protect\nthe speaker from the crowd’s hostility by other, less restrictive means. Although Glasson made\nthat requirement clear, and framed the removal of the speaker for his own protection as a last\nresort to be used only when defending the speaker “would unreasonably subject [officers] to\nviolent retaliation and physical injury,” 518 F.2d at 909, the WCSO made no discernible efforts\nto fulfill this obligation.\n\nII.     The First Amendment and Free Exercise\n\n        We next consider the Bible Believers’ claim that Wayne County violated their right to the\nfree exercise of religion. The right to free exercise of religion includes the right to engage in\nconduct that is motivated by the religious beliefs held by the individual asserting the claim.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v.

See, e.g., Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y of N.Y., Inc. v. Vill.\nof Stratton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121151\"><a href=\"/opinion/121151/watchtower-bible-tract-soc-of-ny-inc-v-village-of-stratton/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002); Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 841. Defendants prevented the Bible\nBelievers from proselytizing based exclusively on the crowd’s hostile reaction to the religious\nviews that the Bible Believers were espousing. Therefore, the free exercise claim succeeds on\nthe same basis as the free speech claim. See Watchtower Bible, 536 U.S. at 150, 159 n.8.\n\nIII.   The Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection\n        The next inquiry is with respect to the Bible Believers’ equal protection claim.

To state an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must adequately plead that the\n        government treated the plaintiff disparately as compared to similarly situated\n        persons and that such disparate treatment . . . burdens a fundamental right, targets\n        a suspect class, or has no rational basis.\n\nCtr. for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v.

There are several distinctions between the Bible\nBelievers and these other groups. Mainly, the Bible Believers chose, as was their right, not to\nregister for an assigned table under the information tent. Instead, they paraded through the\nFestival and proselytized, as was also their right, while carrying signs and a severed pig’s head.\nAlthough these actions set them apart from the other speakers and religious organizations at the\nFestival, they do not do so in any relevant respect. Any speaker could have walked the Festival\ngrounds with or without signs if they chose to do so. The Bible Believers, like the other religious\norganizations at the Festival, sought to spread their faith and religious message. Although they\ndeclined to utilize the tent set aside for outside groups, their conduct was at all times peaceful\nwhile they passionately advocated for their cause, much like any other religious group. Wayne\nCounty did not threaten the Bible Believers based on their decision to march with signs and\nbanners, but based on the content of the messages displayed on the signs and banners. The\ncounty’s disparate treatment of the Bible Believers was based explicitly on the fact that the Bible\nBelievers’ speech was found to be objectionable by a number of people attending the Festival.\nWayne County therefore violated the Bible Believers’ right to equal protection by treating them\nin a manner different from other speakers, whose messages were not objectionable to\nFestival-goers, by burdening their First Amendment rights. See Napolitano, 648 F.3d at 379.\n\nIV.

The Deputy\nChiefs’ position is untenable and unsupported by the record. As is evident from the Supreme\nCourt opinions detailed above, and as explicitly stated in Glasson, “[a] police officer has the duty\nnot to ratify and effectuate a heckler’s veto . . . . Instead, he must take reasonable action to\nprotect from violence persons exercising their constitutional rights.”          518 F.2d at 906.\nDefendants were specifically put on notice of this requirement, insofar as the Bible Believers\nquoted this precise language in a letter that was sent to Wayne County.\n\n       To the extent that Glasson’s discussion of a good-faith defense confused the issue of\nwhether a heckler’s veto constitutes a constitutional violation, the facts and analysis in Glasson\nnonetheless alerted Defendants that removing a peaceful speaker, when the police have made no\nserious attempt to quell the lawless agitators, could subject them to liability. In Glasson, the\nCourt rejected the officers’ claims that the size of their force was insufficient to quell the\nhecklers that were purportedly “near to riot.” Id. at 910. The Court explicitly stated the\nrequirement that the police “take reasonable action to protect from violence persons exercising\ntheir constitutional rights,” id. at 906 (emphasis added), and found the officers’ actions\nunreasonable because they failed to call for reinforcements and failed to recognize the speaker’s\nright to be protected from violence. Id. at 910. These facts are substantially the same as those\nbefore us today.\n\n       Defendants emphasize the fact that Glasson involved an officer tearing up a sign in\nresponse to agitated hecklers, as opposed to officers removing a speaker in an attempt to quell an\nangry crowd that was actually engaged in violent retaliation. These distinctions are immaterial.\nThe violence here was not substantial, much less overwhelming, and speech, whether it be\noration or words written on a poster, is speech nonetheless. Moreover, this case was also about\nremoving from view signs that were considered offensive by a group of hecklers—as Israel\ninformed the Deputy Chiefs, his group was no longer preaching during the latter portion of the\nonslaught against them. Finally, it should be noted that Glasson involved a more compelling\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.

Comp. Laws § 750.167. The only provision of this statute that\nis at all remotely relevant to the Bible Believers’ conduct is subsection (l), which reads: “A person who is found\njostling or roughly crowding people unnecessarily in a public place.” As in Gregory:\n         The so-called ‘diversion tending to a breach of the peace’ . . . was limited entirely and exclusively\n         to the fact that when the policeman in charge of the special police detail concluded that the\n         hecklers observing the march were dangerously close to rioting and that the demonstrators and\n         others were likely to be engulfed in that riot, he ordered Gregory and his demonstrators to leave,\n         and Gregory—standing on what he deemed to be his constitutional rights—refused to do so. . . .\n         [T]he conduct involved here could become ‘disorderly’ only if the policeman’s command was a\n         law which the petitioners were bound to obey at their peril. But under our democratic system of\n         government, lawmaking is not entrusted to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on\n         his beat. . . . To let a policeman’s command become equivalent to a criminal statute comes\n         dangerously near making our government one of men rather than of laws. There are ample ways\n         to protect the domestic tranquility without subjecting First Amendment freedoms to such a clumsy\n         and unwieldy weapon.\nGregory, 394 U.S. at 120–21 (Black, J., concurring) (citations omitted).\n         22\n           Judge Gibbons’ dissent maintains that the clearly established right on which we base our holding is a\nspeaker’s “specific right . . . to be free from an effective removal when his safety and the safety of others have been\ncompromised by an unforeseen violent mob occasioning physical injury on both the speaker and innocent\nbystanders.” Gibbons Dis. 52. This statement both misapprehends our holding and mischaracterizes the record.\nWith regard to the factual inaccuracies, there is no indication that anyone other than the Bible Believers themselves,\nincluding any so-called “innocent bystanders,” suffered physical injury as a result of the audience’s hostile reaction\nto the group’s proselytizing. Further, after the first bottle was thrown, and the Bible Believers informed the officer\nobjecting to their use of the megaphone that they were being pelted with garbage by the adolescent crowd, there was\nnothing “unforesee[able]” about the risk of further aggression from this particular audience. In terms of legal\nmisconceptions, contorting our opinion to hold that a constitutional violation inevitably occurs when a speaker is\nremoved after his safety has been compromised by a lawless mob ignores our emphasis on law enforcement’s\nobligation to attempt to prevent violence occasioned by unruly crowds—as the law enforcement agency’s resources\npermit—before resorting to cutting off constitutionally protected speech. This order of operations, which first\nrequires officers to make sincere efforts to maintain order and protect the speaker, assures that law enforcement’s\nconduct is narrowly tailored to serve the compelling government purpose of assuring public safety.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v.

First, she may provide evidence of a formal\npolicy officially adopted by the county.          Monell, 436 U.S. at 690.       Second, a single\nunconstitutional act or decision, when taken by an authorized decisionmaker, may be considered\na policy and thus subject a county to liability. Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480\n(1986).\n\n          We conclude that Wayne County Corporation Counsel’s involvement in drafting a letter\nto the Bible Believers, and in sanctioning the Deputy Chiefs’ decision to remove the Bible\nBelievers from the Festival, easily resolves the matter of municipal liability. “Monell is a case\nabout responsibility.” Id. at 478. Therefore, with respect to a single decision, municipal liability\nis appropriate “where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish policy with respect\nto the action ordered.” Id. at 481 (footnote omitted). Corporation Counsel informed the Bible\nBelievers by way of letter that “under state law and local ordinances, individuals can be held\ncriminally accountable for conduct which has the tendency to incite riotous behavior or\notherwise disturb the peace.” Then the Deputy Chiefs consulted Corporation Counsel at the\nFestival to confirm that they could threaten the Bible Believers with arrest for disorderly conduct\nbecause the Bible Believers speech had attracted an unruly crowd of teenagers. As discussed at\nlength, speech cannot be proscribed simply because it has a “tendency” to cause unrest or\nbecause people reacted violently in response to the speech. Ashcroft, 535 U.S. at 253 (“[T]he\nmere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it.”).\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 39\n\nCorporation Counsel’s misstatement of the law in a letter may not constitute an official policy,\nbut her direction and authorization for the Deputy Chiefs to threaten the Bible Believers with\narrest based on the prevailing circumstances is certainly an action for which she “possesse[d]\nfinal authority to establish municipal policy.” See Wayne Cty. Muni. Code § 4.312 (Corporation\ncounsel is the chief legal advisor to the County CEO and “all County agencies,” including the\nSheriff’s Office). The relevant facts in this case bearing on municipal liability are substantially\nsimilar to the facts of Pembaur. See 475 U.S. at 484 (“The Deputy Sheriffs who attempted to\nserve the capiases at petitioner’s clinic found themselves in a difficult situation. Unsure of the\nproper course of action to follow, they sought instructions from their supervisors.             The\ninstructions they received were to follow the orders of the County Prosecutor. The Prosecutor\nmade a considered decision based on his understanding of the law and commanded the officers\nforcibly to enter petitioner’s clinic. That decision directly caused the violation of Petitioner’s\nFourth Amendment rights.”). Therefore, Wayne County is liable.\n\n                                             Summary\n\n       From a constitutional standpoint, this should be an easy case to resolve. However, it is\nalso easy to understand Dearborn’s desire to host a joyous Festival celebrating the city’s Arab\nheritage in an atmosphere that is free of hate and negative influences. But the answer to\ndisagreeable speech is not violent retaliation by offended listeners or ratification of the heckler’s\nveto through threat of arrest by the police. The adults who did not join in the assault on the Bible\nBelievers knew that violence was not the answer; the parents who pulled their children away\nlikewise recognized that the Bible Believers could simply be ignored; and a few adolescents,\ninstead of hurling bottles, engaged in debate regarding the validity of the Bible Believers’\nmessage.    Wayne County, however, through its Deputy Chiefs and Corporation Counsel,\neffectuated a constitutionally impermissible heckler’s veto by allowing an angry mob of riotous\nadolescents to dictate what religious beliefs and opinions could and could not be expressed.\nThis, the Constitution simply does not allow.\n\n       The chief flaw affecting the dissents of Judges Rogers and Gibbons is that they\nacknowledge law enforcement’s obligation to protect the public in general, and speakers\nexercising their First Amendment rights in particular, Rogers Dis. 64; Gibbons Dis. 53–55, but\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 40\n\nseek to avoid holding the WCSO accountable to this standard by distorting the factual record to\nreflect an out-of-control situation in which the officers were powerless to quell the violence or\nreign in the mob. The “mob” in this case was comprised mostly of children and teenagers. The\n“violence,” though not imaginary, involved little more than plastic bottle and garbage throwing.\nAs evidenced in the video record, the WCSO’s efforts to prevent this behavior were virtually\nnon-existent. Instead, the officers largely ignored the lawless conduct of the crowd and directed\nwhat little attention they paid to the Bible Believers’ situation—prior to ejecting the group—to\nquieting and then silencing their speech.\n\n       “Speech is often provocative and challenging.           It may strike at prejudices and\npreconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”\nTerminiello, 337 U.S. at 4. Excluding viewpoints and ideas from the marketplace damages us by\noccasioning the risk that we might subject ourselves to “tyrannies of governing majorities,”\nWhitney, 274 U.S. at 376 (Brandeis, J., concurring), and thereby forestall “the advancement of\ntruth, science, morality, and [the] arts,” 1 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789,\nLetter to the Inhabitants of Quebec, 108 (Aug. 26, 1774). These are but a few of the reasons that\nthe First Amendment is integral to the vitality and longevity of a free society. These are the\nreasons why we must accept our differences and allow our fellow citizens to express their views\nregardless of our distaste for what they have to say.\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the Wayne County Defendants impermissibly cut off the Bible Believers’\nprotected speech, placed an undue burden on their exercise of religion, and treated them\ndisparately from other speakers at the 2012 Arab International Festival, solely on the basis of the\nviews that they espoused, Wayne County Defendants violated the Bible Believers’ constitutional\nrights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Brandenburg v. Ohio held that obnoxious speech\ncannot be suppressed, even if the speaker is inciting listeners in favor of such speech, unless the\nspeech is likely to incite those listeners to imminent lawless action directed at others. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107965\"><a href=\"/opinion/107965/brandenburg-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (1969) (per curiam).

As Judge Clay amply demonstrates, everything that happened in this case\nfalls exactly within the above-mentioned cases. The Bible Believers were in a place they had a\nright to be—a public area—doing what they had a right to do—speaking about their religious\nbeliefs—when they were set upon and put in some degree of physical danger by those who\ndisagreed with their message.\n\n       Despite the colorful language in Judge Rogers’s dissent, the motivations of the Bible\nBelievers, and their status as a “majority” or “minority,” are of absolutely no importance as to\ntheir legal rights or the legality of the government’s actions. “[A] function of free speech under\nour system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it\ninduces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs\npeople to anger.” Terminiello v.

That may or may not be a fair\ncharacterization, but it is in no way different from most free-speech cases that arise in public.\nAll of the quotations above are from cases where the speakers upset other people. The Jehovah’s\nWitnesses in Cantwell, for example, played phonographs criticizing the Roman Catholic Church\nin a largely Catholic neighborhood, much like the Bible Believers criticized Islam at the Arab\nInternational Festival. They may do it out of love or out of hate, but it makes no difference to the\nFirst Amendment.\n\n       Judge Rogers appears to present a new theory of unprotected speech: speakers are not\nprotected from arrest if they have some subjective intent that violence should be visited upon\nthemselves. No hint of this appears in any previous cases, and Gregory certainly implicitly\nrejects it. Judge Rogers’s arguments are reminiscent of those in his earlier opinion in Defoe,\nwhich established as the doctrine in our circuit alone that public-school officials have broad\ndiscretion to restrict student speech depending on the nature, not the effect, of the speech.

In this dissent, that erroneous doctrine is extended beyond the school setting and\nexpanded to deny the applicability of past free-speech doctrine when a speaker is maliciously\nseeking publicity for certain religious views.\n\n       The fact that someone can come up with a novel method of attacking a clearly established\ndoctrine, which novel attack has not previously been specifically rejected, does not detract from\nthe doctrine’s being “clearly established.”      Otherwise, no doctrine could ever be clearly\nestablished, as our law schools exist in large part precisely to teach how to come up with new\ntheories. The one situation in which I might think that an issue of material fact remained would\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.        Page 44\n\nbe if the disorder created by the attackers threatened to spill out to the general public, or to create\na threat to general public safety. But the defendants here do not even make an effort to raise that\nas a factual argument, and an examination of the extensive video of the incident does not show a\nlikelihood of violence to anyone other than the plaintiffs in this case.\n\n        Judge Rogers defends the police actions as mere “direction[s] to a citizen.” Rogers\nDissent, at 63. Yet the police clearly infringed the liberty interests of the Bible Believers. The\nstandard definition of an arrest is when a person “is not free to go.” If an officer gives a\ncommand “stay or we will arrest you,” that person is not free to go and is surely arrested.\nSimilarly, here the police order was “leave, or we will arrest you.” The plaintiffs were not free\nto stay any more than you would be if the police came to your house and said, “come with us to\nour police car or we will arrest you”; you are not free to stay and are surely under arrest.\nSee California v. Hodari D., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (1991) (“An arrest requires either physical force\n. . . or, where that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority.”).\n\n        But, Judge Rogers argues, if the police cannot force speakers to leave, those speakers will\nbe able to “get the police to help [them] attack and disrupt something like a minority cultural\nidentity fair, even if the police are not inclined to do so.” Rogers Dissent, at 60. The pellucid\nflaw in Judge Rogers’s dystopian scenario is that there is no police obligation to assist speakers\nin communicating their message. The law simply requires the government to refrain from\nsilencing speakers. Requiring officers to refrain from interfering with speech can hardly be\nequated with affirmatively enlisting unwilling officers to “help” speakers.\n\n        Judge Rogers’s opinion also has the disturbing implication that courts should decide who\nis a majority and who is a minority, and accord lesser rights to those whom judges deem a\nmajority and greater rights to those whom they deem a minority. Rogers Dissent, at 60, 65. The\ndissent makes explicit what may be implicit in the views of some: that First Amendment rights\nonly belong to those who “speak truth to power” and not those who “speak power to truth”; to\nthose who “question authority” and not those who would “question those who question\nauthority.” This is wrong both as a matter of doctrine and of practice. Again, no Supreme Court\ncase indicates that your rights depend on whether you are “punching up” or “punching down,”\nand indeed virtually all of them hold to the contrary.\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 45\n\n       Further, in this specific circumstance it is highly dubious that the plaintiffs here,\nrepresentatives of what most would consider an extreme and ill-mannered evangelical group, are\nimposing themselves on a minority. They were outnumbered in the immediate area, in a political\njurisdiction (Dearborn) in which the “minority” is in a clear preponderance, and in a wider area\n(Wayne County) whose political leanings are clearly shown by the actions of the police both in\nthis circumstance and in the previous correspondence in the record. It is both dangerous as a\nmatter of doctrine and misleading on the facts to make anything at all in this case rest on the\nconcepts of “majority” and “minority.”\n\n       Judge Rogers concludes his dissent by observing that it is “unfortunately ironic” that the\nBible Believers could invoke “cases involving minority civil rights protests.” Rogers Dissent, at\n65. But the real irony is that the very principle he articulates to allow the suppression of speech\ncould just as easily be used against civil-rights protesters challenging racism or religious\nintolerance. The beauty of our First Amendment is that it affords the same protections to all\nspeakers, regardless of the content of their message. If we encroach on the free-speech rights of\ngroups that we dislike today, those same doctrines can be used in the future to suppress freedom\nof speech for groups that we like.       I would have thought that if anything was “clearly\nestablished” in First Amendment law, it is that our view of “irony” does not trump the\nConstitution.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v.

I agree with the\nmajority opinion that both the officers and Wayne County violated the Bible Believers’ First\nAmendment rights. However, I would hold that Deputy Chiefs Richardson and Jaafar are\nentitled to qualified immunity because the right at issue was not clearly established at the time of\nthe 2012 Arab International Festival. For this reason, I join the majority opinion except for Part\nIV and the final two paragraphs of Part I.C.4, from which I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The doctrine of qualified immunity “shields government officials from civil damages\nliability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established\nat the time of the challenged conduct.” Reichle v.

Put\nanother way, “existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question\nbeyond debate.” Id.\n\n       As Judge Clay correctly notes, when defining the scope of the right at issue, courts must\nbe cautious to define the right neither too narrowly nor too broadly. To that end, we must define\nthe right at issue “not as a broad general proposition, but in a particularized sense so that the\ncontours of the right are clear to a reasonable official.” Reichle, 132 S. Ct. at 2094 (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). Here, the right at issue is properly defined as the right to\nexercise one’s free speech rights in the face of a hostile crowd without the government\neffectuating a heckler’s veto by removing the speaker for his own safety.\n\n       At the time of the 2012 Arab International Festival, “existing precedent” had not placed\nthis constitutional question “beyond debate.” Ashcroft, 131 S.

Indeed, whether removing a\nspeaker for his own safety amounts to a heckler’s veto is the very question we resolve in this\ncase. And, though we answer that question in the affirmative, we had not done so at the time of\nthe 2012 Arab International Festival.\n\n       Contrary to the position of the majority opinion, precedent in fact confirms that at the\ntime of the 2012 Arab International Festival, the right at issue was debatable. In Glasson v. City\nof Louisville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328640\"><a href=\"/opinion/328640/marjorie-glasson-v-city-of-louisville/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1975)—decided well after Cantwell and Terminiello—this\ncourt opined that when police fear a violent crowd may inflict physical injury, “they may\ndischarge their duty of preserving the peace by intercepting his message or by removing the\nspeaker for his own protection without having to respond in damages.” Id. at 909. Though we\nnow correctly reject this part of Glasson as dicta and overrule this principle of law, we do so for\nthe first time. Indeed, Wayne County’s pre-festival letter to the Bible Believers—which forms a\nbasis for my conclusion that Wayne County is liable—explicitly relies on this passage from\nGlasson. The letter itself is evidence that the law in this area was not as clear as the majority\nopinion suggests as it relies on Glasson for the proposition that officers may constitutionally\nremove speakers for their own protection, and states that “[t]he law as announced in Glasson is\namong the laws [that Wayne County] is duty-bound to uphold.”\n\n       Nor does Glasson otherwise clearly establish the right at issue in this case. There, this\ncourt held that the police violated the plaintiff’s First Amendment rights when they destroyed the\nplaintiff’s anti-Nixon poster that had agitated a crowd of Nixon supporters. Glasson, 518 F.2d at\n902, 906. But, unlike this case, the crowd in Glasson was not actually violent towards the\nspeaker; they were merely “hollering” and “cheered” when the officers destroyed the poster. Id.\nat 902. Thus, Glasson did little more than reinforce the basic principle that the police may not\neffectuate a heckler’s veto. Glasson’s holding alone does not answer the question presented by\nthis case: whether the police effectuate a heckler’s veto by removing a speaker for his own\nsafety. In fact, Glasson suggests that they do not.\n\fNo. 13-1635              Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 48\n\n       Moreover, although numerous Supreme Court decisions opine generally regarding the\nconstitutional infirmity of a heckler’s veto, none answer the specific question posed by this case.\nSee, e.g., Reno v.

At the time of the 2012 Arab International Festival, reasonable\nminds could have differed whether the officers’ treatment of the Bible Believers violated clearly\nestablished federal law. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from Part IV and the final two\nparagraphs of Part I.C.4 of the majority opinion.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v.

I agree with the\nmajority that the Bible Believers engaged in protected speech in a traditional public forum. I\nagree with the majority that the defendants curtailed the Bible Believers’ speech on the basis of\nits content. And I agree with the majority that the defendants had other options short of\nremoving the Bible Believers from the festival to deal with the public-safety problems generated\nby their speech. For these reasons, I must conclude that strict scrutiny governs the defendants’\nactions and that they have not satisfied it. See Reed v. Town of Gilbert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2809763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2809763/reed-v-town-of-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In each of these respects, I therefore join Part I of the analysis in Judge Clay’s opinion.\nI part ways with this component of the majority opinion to the extent it draws the conclusion that\na “heckler’s veto” supplies a freestanding doctrinal basis for concluding that the defendants\nviolated the Bible Believers’ First Amendment rights.\n\n       That leaves (mainly) the question of qualified immunity. I agree with Judge Gibbons that\nthe obligations of the defendants in this unusual setting were not clearly established at the time of\nthe festival and accordingly join Parts II and III of her dissenting opinion. As Judge Gibbons’s\nopinion shows—and as the stark differences among the many opinions in this case confirm—the\nFirst Amendment requirements in this area did not provide the kind of clarity we normally\ndemand before imposing after-the-fact, money-damages liability on individual officers. Pity the\npolice officer then—and perhaps even now—tasked with identifying the lines of permissible and\nimpermissible peace-officer conduct in this non-peaceful area.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v.

As discussed below, however,\nBible Believers are not entitled to any of these remedies.          Even assuming, arguendo, the\nmajority’s position that a violation of the Bible Believers’ constitutional rights exists, qualified\nimmunity bars the suit against Officers Jaafar and Richardson in their individual capacities. The\nmunicipality is also not liable on the remaining damages claims because Bible Believers cannot\nestablish that the allegedly unconstitutional action was the result of a municipal policy. Lastly,\ndispensing with the remaining claims, the plaintiffs’ prayers for declaratory and injunctive relief\nare precluded by the absence of a credible threat or imminent injury.\n\n                                      A. Qualified Immunity\n\n          Bible Believers’ damages claim against the officers in their individual capacities should\nfail under qualified immunity because there was, and still remains, no clearly established law\npertaining to this specific right.\n\n          Qualified immunity affords a broad shield, ensuring “that those who serve the\ngovernment do so with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good.” Filarsky\nv.

The majority’s holding effectively strips the officers of\nthis broad protection, and instead of providing the officers with breathing room, all but\nsuffocates them.\n\n        To determine whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity, we must\nask whether “a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged” and, if so,\nwhether the right was “clearly established.” Saucier v.

In this case, “it is plain that [the] constitutional right is not clearly established,” leaving\nthe constitutional question as an “essentially academic exercise.” See id. at 236–37 (permitting\ncourts to avoid potentially “difficult constitutional questions”). My analysis therefore centers on\nwhether the constitutional right that the defendants purportedly violated was clearly established.1\n\n        In determining whether a right is clearly established, it is imperative to articulate the right\nat issue with the appropriate specificity. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (“The relevant, dispositive\ninquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a\nreasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.” (emphasis\nadded)). If the right is characterized at its most general level, the second prong in qualified\nimmunity analysis would serve no purpose.

A court has yet to find that there is such a right. Thus the determinative question is\nwhether the officers could reasonably have believed—based on pre-existing precedent—that the\nFirst Amendment did not preclude them from effectively removing the Bible Believers.

The closest the Court has come to the facts of this\ncase when using the term is in a footnote to a 1966 plurality opinion. See Brown v. Louisiana,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107167\"><a href=\"/opinion/107167/brown-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 n.1 (1966) (plurality opinion). Even then, that use of “heckler’s veto” does\nnot help us because the Court invoked the term in the context of potential as opposed to actual\nviolence, reasoning that it would be unfair to suppress peaceful protestors due to the danger that\ncritics “might” react with disorder or violence. Id. On a few other occasions, the Court has used\n“heckler’s veto” as shorthand for the undesirability of opponents being able to cut off some\ndisfavored speech, idea, or policy, but none of those cases has any bearing here. See, e.g.,\nZivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v.

In the last analysis, the Supreme\nCourt had not clearly established that the officers acted unconstitutionally in asking the Bible\nBelievers to leave in the face of ongoing violence, and the “heckler’s veto” does nothing to fill\nthat gap in authority.\n\n       Nor did Glasson—the only case that remotely mirrors the circumstances at issue—clearly\nestablish the law that controls this case. There, a police officer tore up the plaintiff’s sign\nbecause a group across the street, apparently angered by the sign’s message, began screaming at\nthe plaintiff and, as a result, the officer feared for the plaintiff’s safety. Glasson, 518 F.2d at\n902–03. The Sixth Circuit held that the police officers were liable for a First Amendment\nviolation. Id. at 912. The court found that “[t]he state may not rely on community hostility and\nthreats of violence to justify censorship.” Id. at 906. For “[t]o permit police officers . . . to\npunish for incitement or breach of the peace the peaceful communication of . . . messages\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 54\n\nbecause other persons are provoked and seek to take violent action against the speaker would\nsubvert the First Amendment.” Id. at 905.\n\n       According to the majority, Glasson put the officers on notice that removing the Bible\nBelievers in this circumstance could subject them to liability. (Op. at 36.) In so holding, the\nmajority again ignores the same factual difference—Glasson involved no violence and the case\nbefore us involved a violent mob inflicting physical harm on the speakers. In Glasson, the\nunruliness of the crowd was limited to muttered threats unaccompanied by action; it did not\ninvolve actual, physical violence. Id. Here, Bible Believers (and potentially other bystanders)\nwere showered with rocks, plastic bottles, garbage, and milk crates. (DE 1, Complaint, ¶ 46.)\nThe Bible Believers were bruised and bloodied, with one Bible Believer bleeding from his\nforehead. (Id. at 57). The majority attempts to mitigate the pointed difference between the two\nscenarios by proclaiming that the violence here was “much less overwhelming.” (Op. at 36.)\nWhile the majority’s tolerance for pain is certainly admirable, hundreds of teenaged children\nthrowing a deluge of objects—ranging from bottles to rocks to milk crates—can fairly be\ncharacterized as an overwhelming display of aggression and violence.\n\n       Glasson can be further distinguished from this case by the officers’ respective responses\nto the crowds. The officers in Glasson made absolutely no attempt to calm the crowd. Id. at\n905. In this case, although the majority faults the officers for not doing enough, neither party\ndisputes that the officers warned, detained, and cited several debris-throwers in an attempt to rein\nin the chaos.\n\n       While the holding in Glasson may clearly establish that an officer must refrain from\ninfringing on the right of a speaker when a crowd becomes angry and threatens violence, it does\nnot clearly establish an officer’s appropriate response to a physically violent and unruly mob of\nmostly children who are undeterred by police presence.\n\n       Moreover, despite Glasson’s ultimate conclusion, the court in Glasson made clear that\npolice officers “may discharge their duty of preserving the peace by . . . removing the speaker for\nhis own protection” when a hostile audience would unreasonably subject law enforcement to\nphysical injury. 518 F.2d at 909. Such a pronouncement echoes a recurrent principle: the First\nAmendment does not afford one an unfettered right to exercise free speech in the face of\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v.

And the\nSupreme Court has made plain that when a “clear and present danger” of disorder or other\n“immediate threat to public safety” appears, “the power of the state to prevent or punish is\nobvious.” Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103355\"><a href=\"/opinion/103355/cantwell-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (1940). No court has ever\nrecognized a First Amendment right that is so absolute that it can stymie police efforts to cope\nwith highly volatile situations. Markedly, this court has emphasized that police officers must\ntake the actions necessary to protect the physical safety of citizens and the overall public order.\nSee Grider, 180 F.3d at 752.\n\n        The majority, seemingly disapproving the ramifications of Glasson, overrules it “to the\nextent that Glasson’s good-faith defense may be interpreted as altering the substantive duties of a\npolice officer not to effectuate a heckler’s veto.” (Op. at 26.) The majority’s decision to\noverrule Glasson ought to tell us all we need to know about the clearly established inquiry. At\nthe time of the incident, it was not sufficiently clear to a reasonable officer that removing the\nBible Believers for their own protection violated the First Amendment. Otherwise, there would\nbe no need to overrule this part of Glasson. Implicit—in truth explicit—in the majority’s\ndecision is the recognition that officials could understand the law differently at the time of this\nincident.2\n\n        Even after today’s decision, officials could understand the law differently. “Heckler’s\nveto,” as the many separate writings in this case suggest and as the Supreme Court’s own cases\nconfirm, is more often used as a debater’s point rather than as a doctrinal tool. Even on its own\nterms, the “rule” does not mean that the government must invariably ignore an opponent’s\nreaction in deciding how to treat speech. The doctrines of “incitement to imminent lawless\naction,” Brandenburg v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107965\"><a href=\"/opinion/107965/brandenburg-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449 (1969) (per curiam), and “fighting words,”\n\n        2\n          Indeed, the tenets of Glasson and Cantwell, when viewed in tandem, could lead a reasonable officer to\nconclude that he may not punish a speaker for peaceful expression merely because the listeners seek to take violent\naction against the speaker; but, the officer may remove a speaker for his own protection if the audience becomes so\nviolent as to potentially harm—or, as was the case here, actually harm—the speaker, an officer, or a bystander.\nWhen viewed through this lens, a reasonable officer, aware of the material distinctions between this case and\nGlasson, could believe that the escalating violence at the Arab Festival presented an example of when police may\nremove the speaker for his own protection.\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v.

The majority seems to suggest that the “heckler’s veto” cases mean\nthat, once a speaker is outside these categories of “unprotected speech” and enters the field of\n“protected speech,” the listeners’ reactions to speech may never be the basis for government\nregulation. Surely that is not the law—and at least the Supreme Court has never said it is. “Such\na simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with\ncommon sense and with our jurisprudence as well.” R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384\n(1992).\n\n          Apparently recognizing as much, the majority suggests at one point that the police may\nlimit speech in order to protect the speaker from a violent reaction, but only as a last resort. (Op.\nat 22 (“Punishing, removing, or by other means silencing a speaker due to crowd hostility will\nseldom, if ever, constitute the least restrictive means available to serve a legitimate government\npurpose.”).) But at other points, the majority implies this is not the rule at all and that the police\nmay never limit speech in order to protect the speaker, even if doing so is the only way to protect\nthe speaker from serious injury or even death at the hands of an angry mob. (Op. at 28 (“Simply\nstated, the First Amendment does not permit a heckler’s veto.”); see also Op. at 44 (“The law\nsimply requires the government to refrain from silencing speakers.”) (Boggs, J., concurring).)\nGiven these mixed signals, it is not even obvious what has been clearly established by today’s\nopinion, much less clearly established what the law was when these officers were forced into\naction.\n\n          A situation where officers could understand the law in different ways, both at the time\nthey acted and after this court acts, is precisely the type of occasion in which police officers\nshould be shielded from personal damages liability. See Malley, 475 U.S. at 341 (finding that\nimmunity should be recognized in those instances where officers of reasonable competence\ncould disagree on the issue). The fact that reasonable officials can differ in their responses\nconfirms that it was not “plainly incompetent” for the police to believe they had a right to\neffectively remove the Bible Believers. Stanton, 134 S. Ct. at 5.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.     Page 57\n\n                                      B. Municipal Liability\n\n       As Monell has informed us, a municipality is only liable for constitutional violations\nresulting from official policies or customs. The “official policy” requirement “distinguish[es]\nthe acts of the municipality from the acts of employees of the municipality. Pembaur, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">479</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. An official policy commonly refers to “formal rules or understandings . . . that establish\nfixed plans of action to be followed under similar circumstances.” Id. at 480. In this regard, the\nmajority admits that Corporations Counsel misstatement of the law in the letter responding to\nBible Believers does not amount to an official policy. (Op. 38–39.) Nevertheless, because a\nsingle decision by “government authorized decisionmakers” can also denote official policy,\nPembaur, 475 U.S. at 481, the majority finds that liability attaches to the municipality through\nthe Corporation Counsel’s instruction advising the Deputy Chiefs to threaten to issue the Bible\nBelievers a citation. (Id.) I must respectfully disagree.\n\n       The Bible Believers have presented no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find\nthat Corporations Counsel, or the Deputy Chiefs for that matter, possessed final decision making\nauthority. Unlike in Pembaur, where the Deputy Sheriffs were instructed by their supervisors to\nfollow the orders of the County Prosecutor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, thus imbuing the Prosecutor with final\ndecisionmaking authority, here the evidence is devoid of any such instruction. Instead, the\nDeputy Chiefs merely conferred with Corporation Counsel because, after all, its duty is to\n“provide legal services” such as “advis[ing], consult[ing] or represent[ing]” Wayne County\nofficers. Wayne Cnty. Muni. Code § 4.312. Some advice to an officer, though perhaps ill-\nconceived, does not metamorphose Corporation Counsel into a decisionmaker with final\nauthority. Indeed, nothing in the municipal code vests Corporation Counsel with “final authority\nto establish policy.” Pembaur, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also id. at 483 (“Authority to make municipal\npolicy may be granted directly by a legislative enactment or may be delegated by an official who\npossess such authority[.]”). Nor does the evidence show that Corporation Counsel was bestowed\nwith such authority by a final decisionmaker.         Advice amounts to nothing more than a\nrecommendation, not a decision. Therefore, no genuine issues of material fact exist as to\nwhether the violation of the Bible Believers constitutional rights stemmed from Wayne County’s\npolicies or customs.\n\fNo. 13-1635                   Bible Believers, et al. v.

They are not; the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege standing to claim injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief. See Kusens v. Pascal Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794377\"><a href=\"/opinion/794377/gary-kusens-plaintiff-appellantcross-appellee-v-pascal-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n        That the plaintiffs have standing to pursue their damages claims has no bearing on\nwhether they have standing to request injunctive and declaratory relief.

The facts in record belie any contention that they will be exposed to the same\nor similar circumstances as present here. For the past seventeen years the Arab Festival has gone\non virtually without incident—let alone any event remotely similar to the one at issue. This is so\ndespite the annual presence of a multitude of Christian missionaries and evangelists from across\nthe country. (DE 1, Compliant, ¶ 17). Even the Bible Believers concede that during this time\n“there was little to no conflict between the Christians and the Muslims who attended the Arab\nFestival.” (Id. ¶ 24.) In fact, Bible Believers’ attendance at the festival—including the day\nbefore the incident in question—was largely uneventful.\n\n         Given that the Arab-American Festival is no longer an annual event in Dearborn,4 there\nare serious doubts surrounding the very existence of the Festival in the future. Thus, the prospect\nof a recurring problem is not only “highly conjectural” and indefinite, but also “rest[s] on a string\nof actions the occurrence of which is merely speculative.” Grendell, 252 F.3d at 833.

Even assuming a violation of the Bible Believers constitutional rights, they are\nnot entitled to any relief: qualified immunity defeats plaintiffs’ individual damages claims\nagainst the officers; the absence of a municipal policy responsible for the alleged constitutional\nviolations prevents the plaintiffs from holding Wayne County liable; and finally, the lack of an\nimminent and credible injury precludes standing for the plaintiffs’ prayers for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief.\n\n         4\n          Cancelling the Arab International Festival Was an Admission of Defeat, ARAB AMERICAN\nNEWS (Apr. 2, 2015, 9:51 AM), http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_10291/Canceling-the-Arab-\nInternational-Festival-was-an-admission-of-defeat.html; Niraj Warikoo, ACLU Supports Free-Speech Rights of anti-\nIslam Group,DETRIOT FREE PRESS (Dec. 26, 2014, 9:37 AM), http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/way\nne/2014/12/26/aclu-supports-free-speech-rights-christian-group-hates-islam/20899957/.

Today’s holding provides a roadmap that\neffectively advises how to force the police to help disrupt a minority’s speech and assembly\nrights. It is as if we are advising as follows:\n\n               Yes, you can get the police to help you attack and disrupt something like a\n       minority cultural identity fair, even if the police are not inclined to do so. Tell the\n       police your plans ahead of time, and bring photographers. Get a determined\n       group of disrupters and go in with the most offensive and incendiary chants,\n       slogans, insults, and symbols—the more offensive the better. The object is to stir\n       up some physical response. Then, when things get rough (your goal), insist that\n       the police protect you, and (ironically) your First Amendment rights, by serving\n       as a protective guard. The peace officers cannot at that point tell you to leave,\n       even to avoid injury to you, because if the peace officers do that, they will have to\n       pay you damages. Faced with the choice of allowing you to be an injured martyr\n       (keep your cameras ready) or serving as a protective guard as the disruption\n       escalates, the peace officers will doubtless choose the latter and become your\n       phalanx.    It’s a win-win situation for you, and a lose-lose situation for the\n       minority group putting on the fair.\n\n                                                  ***\n\n       Only a formalistic application of First Amendment doctrines, from substantially different\ncases, could lead to a result so inconsistent with the core of the First Amendment. This is not a\ncase where the Bible Believers faced punishment or liability for their speech.             The only\npunishment threatened was a citation for refusing to move away from a physical altercation.\nThat fact distinguishes this case from most of the cases that the Bible Believers rely upon.\n\n       To disruptive hecklers, the irony of using a “heckler’s veto” doctrine to empower them in\ntheir heckling must be sweet. As demonstrated below, the great cases that admirably condemn a\n“heckler’s veto” are profoundly different from this case. They involve criminal prosecution of\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.       Page 61\n\nspeakers on the basis that the speech, itself, constituted a breach of the peace. In Edwards v.\nSouth Carolina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106538\"><a href=\"/opinion/106538/edwards-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963), for example, African-Americans gathered on the state-\nhouse grounds and some 200 to 300 curious onlookers gathered.               There was no traffic\nobstruction and nothing in the way of “threatening remarks, hostile gestures, or threatening\nlanguage.” Id. at 231. Police ordered the protestors to disperse, and when they did not, the\npolice arrested them and charged them with breaching the peace. Id. at 233. The Supreme Court\noverturned the protestors’ criminal convictions on the ground that the common-law crime of\nwhich the protestors had been convicted permitted punishment “upon evidence which showed no\nmore than that the opinions which [the protesters] were peaceably expressing were sufficiently\nopposed to the views of the majority of the community to attract a crowd and necessitate police\nprotection.” Id. at 237. In overturning the protestors’ convictions, the Court noted (1) that\n“nobody among the crowd actually caused or threatened any trouble,” id. at 231, (2) that\n“[p]olice protection at the scene was at all times sufficient to meet any foreseeable possibility of\ndisorder,” id. at 232–33, (3) that “[t]here was no violence or threat of violence on [the\nprotesters’] part, or on the part of any member of the crowd watching them,” id. at 236, and (4)\nthat “[p]olice protection was ‘ample,’” id. These facts, the Court explained,\n\n       [were] a far cry from the situation in Feiner v. New York, where two policemen\n       were faced with a crowd which was “pushing, shoving and milling around,”\n       where at least one member of the crowd “threatened violence if the police did not\n       act,” where “the crowd was pressing closer around petitioner and the officer,” and\n       where “the speaker passes the bounds of argument or persuasion and undertakes\n       incitement to riot.”\n\nId. at 236 (quoting Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S 315, 317–18, 321 (1949)). Nothing in Edwards\nis even close to the situation in this case. In Edwards there was no hint of an altercation or\ndisruption.\n\n       The same distinction applies to Cox v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106967\"><a href=\"/opinion/106967/cox-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965), a landmark of the\nCivil Rights Movement of the 1960s. There, police arrested the speaker the day after a peaceful\nstudent protest in which the speaker advocated that his fellow protesters conduct sit-ins at certain\nlocal businesses. Id. at 542–44. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction for breaching the\npeace because the speaker had been punished “merely for peacefully expressing unpopular\nviews.” Id. at 551. That, the Court once more clarified, was different from punishing a speaker\n\fNo. 13-1635                Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.         Page 62\n\nfor deliberately thwarting law enforcement’s legitimate efforts to pacify an altercation. Id. at\n550–51 (distinguishing Feiner). The evidence alleged to indicate potential violence was limited\nto purported grumbling, muttering, and jeering from a group of 100 to 300 white people across\nthe street. Id. In short, the Court held that the speaker could not be convicted of using words\nthat disturbed the peace merely because his words might have led to an altercation. This is\ncategorically different from holding that the police may not separate people who are involved in\nan altercation, and threaten a citation if one of the parties fails to separate.\n\n        Terminiello v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104668\"><a href=\"/opinion/104668/terminiello-v-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1949), also involved the Court’s overturning\nthe conviction of a speaker for breaching the peace, where the ordinance on which the conviction\nrested “permitted conviction of [the speaker] if his speech stirred people to anger, invited public\ndispute, or brought about a condition of unrest.” Id. at 5. The decision addressed only whether\nthe speaker could be convicted of a crime based on his speech’s tendency to cause unrest. The\ndecision said nothing about what steps police could take to quell an altercation already\nunderway—which is to say, it said nothing about the actions of the police in this case.\n\n        Cantwell v. Connecticut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103355\"><a href=\"/opinion/103355/cantwell-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1940), involved a Jehovah’s Witness and his two\nsons who had gone door-to-door in a Catholic neighborhood distributing literature and requesting\npedestrians’ permission to play a phonograph record critical of the Roman Catholic Church,\nwhich offended the pedestrians. The Supreme Court overturned the convictions of the Jehovah’s\nWitnesses for breach of the peace, reasoning that the laws at issue criminalized the family\nmembers’ peaceful exercise of their First Amendment liberties. Id. at 310–11. The Court found\nthat there was “no assault or threatening of bodily harm, no truculent bearing, no intentional\ndiscourtesy, no personal abuse.” Id. at 310. The case did not deal with incitement to violence or\nbreach of the peace, much less an actual altercation.\n\n        Finally, the difference between these cases and the instant case is clearest in Gregory v.\nCity of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107869\"><a href=\"/opinion/107869/gregory-v-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1969). There, police ordered a group of peaceful protestors to\ndisperse after onlookers became unruly. “When [the officers’] command was not obeyed, [the\nprotestors] were arrested for disorderly conduct.” Id. at 112. The Supreme Court overturned the\nensuing criminal convictions. Id. at 112–13. As the Court made explicit, however, its ruling in\nthat case was based on its understanding that “[the protestors] were charged and convicted for\n\fNo. 13-1635                    Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.               Page 63\n\nholding a demonstration, not for a refusal to obey a police officer.” Id. In a footnote the Court\nadded that “[n]either the ordinance nor the charge defined disorderly conduct as the refusal to\nobey a police order.” Id. at n.*. Gregory is thus inapposite, because the Bible Believers were\nthreatened with a citation, not because of anything they said, but because they asked what would\nhappen if they disobeyed a police officer. Indeed, the video evidence in this case—supplied only\nby the Bible Believers—shows the reluctance of the police even to threaten citation. The police\nchief confirmed that the Bible Believers would be cited only after the Bible Believers repeatedly\ndemanded to know “what he would do” if they declined to depart.1\n\n       In sum, the Supreme Court has consistently distinguished between prosecuting a person\nfor exercising his First Amendment rights—which is unconstitutional—and insisting that a\nperson comply with a police officer’s order to leave the scene of an ongoing physical altercation\nso as to prevent further injury—which is constitutional. It cannot be that every police officer’s\ndirection to a citizen to do something requires strict scrutiny just because speech is also involved.\nStrict scrutiny does not apply, for example, to pulling over a truck for a traffic violation just\nbecause there was a message on the side of the truck. Nor could strict scrutiny reasonably be\napplied to telling two brawling teenagers to separate before they get hurt, even if the brawl\nstarted with a verbal argument about some issue. Police officers should not be made to pay\ndamages in such circumstances. This case is no different.\n\n\n       1\n           Here is an excerpt of the conversation between the police chief and one Bible Believer (“BB”):\n\n       BB: Let me ask you this: If we don’t leave, are we gonna get arrested?\n       CHIEF: Probably.\n       BB: I just need to know, yes or no.\n       CHIEF: Probably.\n       BB: That’s like me probably saying, “Yes, probably we’ll stay around.”\n       CHIEF: Probably we will cite you all, yes. I mean, if that’s what you want then, I mean, I don’t, I\n       don’t understand what good that does.\n       BB: I just need to know if I’m gonna be arrested or not or if you just thought it was a good idea\n       that we walk away. If you’re telling me that we’re gonna get arrested, that’s what I need to know.\n       Are you telling me that we’re gonna get arrested if we . . .\n       CHIEF: I’m not telling you that you’re going to get arrested, but, you know, you’re a danger to the\n       public safety. You’re disorderly.\n       BB: I would assume, you know, two hundred angry Muslim children throwing bottles would be\n       more of a threat than a few guys with signs.\n       [Brief interlude]\n       CHIEF: Alright, you need to leave.\n       BB: Again, I just want to make an ask, so, if we don’t leave, you’re saying . . .\n       CHIEF: If you don’t leave, we’re gonna cite you for disorderly.\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 64\n\n       Strict scrutiny applies to rules about speech that allegedly could cause a brawl, not to\nefforts to control a brawl. The Bible Believers spoke loudly and freely throughout the festival\nfor over an hour. Indeed, for some of that time, the presence of police officers actually made it\npossible for the Bible Believers to speak without being accosted by the crowd. The officers’\ninstruction to leave, moreover, only occurred once there was an altercation that left one of the\nBible Believers bleeding from his head. This is not a case about “the mere possibility of\nviolence.” Ante at 34. The video evidence shows plastic bottles, rocks, and other hard objects\nsuch as a milk crate being thrown at the Bible Believers, and not just by children. Indeed, as the\nmajority describes the video, it shows that “a barrage of bottles, eggs, and other debris [was]\nhurled upon the Bible Believers” and “[a]t some point during the deluge, Israel was struck in the\nface.” Ante at 12–13. Violence had broken out when the police stepped in. The only question\nconfronting police at that time was how to handle it.\n\n       It cannot be that, in an altercation where one side is greatly outnumbered but wants to\nrisk injury by standing its ground, police officers are obligated to permit the risk—indeed, must\nput themselves at risk—in the name of the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not\ncompel police to stand by and ignore their duty to protect the public.\n\n       Cases like the one before us properly call for a balancing of the speakers’ First\nAmendment interests and the community’s need for safety and order. Of course, police should\nnot be allowed to treat every outbreak of violence as cover for suppressing speech, and where it\nis reasonably possible to vindicate a speaker’s First Amendment rights, police should do so. But\nit will not always be possible to do so, taking into account all of the factors peace officers must\nconsider, such as the nature of the crowd, the resources available to police at the time, and other\nfactors bearing on law enforcement’s ability to control the scene around a speaker. Drawing a\nrigid line based on abstract doctrinal principles robs police officers of the discretion and\njudgment that is essential to law enforcement. If the police may stop the altercation, they may do\nit in a reasonable way, under the circumstances as actually presented. If bringing in a larger\npolice force is not a then-available option in the reasoned view of the peace officer on the scene,\nseparating the parties is reasonable. In the context of this case, separating the parties meant\nescorting away the less numerous group. This was a practical and reasonable thing to do—not\nprohibited by the First Amendment unless the First Amendment rigidly requires peace officers to\n\fNo. 13-1635               Bible Believers, et al. v. Wayne County, et al.      Page 65\n\ndetermine which side threw the first stones or punches, and thereafter to protect the other side as\nthe brawl continues.\n\n       When festivalgoers began attacking the Bible Believers, law enforcement officers at the\nArab Festival had a choice: attempt to restrain the large and physically abusive crowd, or ask the\nBible Believers to leave.    The record shows that the officers made efforts to restrain the\nfestivalgoers. Among other things, they ventured into the crowd to identify the individuals who\nwere throwing debris and rocks at the Bible Believers, and issued some warnings and citations.\nThis is not a situation, then, where law enforcement jumped at the first opportunity to evict an\nobnoxious group. To the contrary, it appears the officers tried to avoid having to evict the Bible\nBelievers.\n\n       Despite their efforts, however, the officers ultimately determined that they could not\neasily stop the altercation while the Bible Believers were present. The officers thus decided to\nremove the Bible Believers from the festival grounds. The First Amendment does not prohibit\nthat reasonable exercise of judgment, and this conclusion is consistent with Glasson v. City of\nLouisville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328640\"><a href=\"/opinion/328640/marjorie-glasson-v-city-of-louisville/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1975). In Glasson, police violated the First Amendment by\ntearing up a protester’s sign after hecklers began grumbling and muttering threats about it from\nacross the street. Id. at 901–02. There was no actual violence in Glasson or even a move toward\nactual violence. Glasson involved police conduct to preempt potential violence. In contrast,\nthere was nothing potential about the fracas at the Arab Festival.\n\n                                                   ***\n\n       It is unfortunately ironic for the Bible Believers to succeed in their tactics in this case\nbased on towering but distinguishable cases involving minority civil rights protests. In the\ngreater Detroit community, it is the minority’s cultural expression that loses from today’s\ndecision. The disrupters here came from a different part of a larger community to disrupt the\nFirst Amendment activity of Arab-Americans—a sometimes feared, misunderstood, or despised\nminority within that larger community. Realistically viewed, the Bible Believers were hecklers\nseeking to disrupt the cultural fair.     The police visibly attempted to reconcile the First\nAmendment rights of festivalgoers and the Bible Believers. There may have been much better\nways for the police to handle this situation, but there was no First Amendment violation.\n\f</pre>",
