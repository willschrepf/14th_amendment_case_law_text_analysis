App.—Waco 2003, pet. denied)).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>By their verdict, obviously, the jury\r\nbelieved Nieves and did not believe Cox, and it was not unreasonable for the\r\njury to do so, based on all the evidence.  The evidence is legally and\r\nfactually sufficient to support the jury’s assault and sexual assault findings. \r\nAnd by finding that Cox assaulted and sexually assaulted Nieves, the jury’s\r\nmalice finding against Cox is also supported by legally and factually\r\nsufficient evidence.  We overrule issues one, two, and five.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In issue four, Cox complains that the\r\nevidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s answer to\r\nQuestion 10, which awarded Nieves $750,000 in damages for past physical pain\r\nand mental anguish and $250,000 in future physical pain and mental anguish.  Cox\r\nasserts that Nieves did not offer any evidence that she was harmed by Cox’s\r\nassaults (as opposed to the sexual assault.)  As for the sexual assault, Nieves\r\ntestified that it made her feel “overwhelmed” and unable to answer the door\r\neven for her children.  She felt numb and empty and tried to repress the sexual\r\nassault.  She was afraid that if anyone heard about it, they would not be\r\nwilling to work with her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>She would not let anyone in her\r\napartment, see anyone, or get out of bed.  She felt anger, embarrassment, and\r\nhumiliation; she felt violated and still had a fear of letting a male other\r\nthan her husband or children into her house, including her father-in-law.  She\r\nsometimes kept her children home from school because of her fear of being\r\nalone.  Nieves said she has problems leaving the house, cannot be around\r\npeople, and avoids interaction.  She missed all of her son’s soccer games,\r\nexcept for one, and even then had to watch from the truck.  Nieves testified\r\nthat she is sad because she feels her fears cause her to shortchange her family\r\nand miss out on things.  She sometimes has feelings of worthlessness and\r\nflashbacks of the events, and she has nightmares and trouble sleeping.  When\r\nshe pictures in her mind the assault, she sometimes feels sick to her stomach\r\nand shakes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We find that the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually sufficient to support the jury’s damage findings.  Issue four is\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Issue three complains that because\r\nQuestion 10 was submitted in broad form as to Nieves’s two claims against Cox\r\nand her negligent retention and supervision claim against ETMC, the\r\ncompensatory damages cannot be upheld if the evidence for any one underlying\r\nclaim is legally or factually insufficient.  But we have held that sufficient\r\nevidence supports the assault and sexual assault claims, and the negligence\r\nclaim against ETMC is no longer before us.  Moreover, Cox did not object to the\r\nbroad-form submission of Question 10 and its lack of segregation as to the\r\nthree claims.  <i>See In re A.V.,</i> 113 S.W.3d 355, 362 (Tex. 2003); <i>Haskett\r\nv. Butts,</i> 83 S.W.3d 213, 219-20 (Tex. App.—Waco 2002, pet. denied); <i>Columbia/HCA\r\nHealthcare Corp. v. Cottey,</i> 72 S.W.3d 735, 747 (Tex. App.—Waco 2002, no\r\npet.).  Issue three is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The jury (and the judgment) awarded\r\nNieves $50,000 in exemplary damages against Cox.  In issue six, Cox asserts,\r\nsimilar to issue three, that because the exemplary damages question was not\r\nsegregated, if either the assault or sexual assault claim is overturned, the\r\nexemplary damages award must be reversed.  Again, we have held that sufficient\r\nevidence supports the assault and sexual assault claims, and Cox did not object\r\nto the lack of segregation in the exemplary damages question.  Issue six is\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Issue seven asserts that because the compensatory\r\ndamages question was not segregated between Cox and ETMC, a ratio analysis\r\ncannot be done to determine whether the exemplary damages award is excessive\r\nunder due-process concerns.  <i>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i>\r\n538 U.S. 408, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 1520, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003).  We note again\r\nthat Cox did not object to Question 10.  Furthermore, the $50,000 exemplary\r\ndamages award, compared to the $1 million in compensatory damages awarded to\r\nNieves against Cox (jointly and severally) for assault and sexual assault,\r\ncannot be said to violate due process.  Issue seven is overruled.  Having\r\noverruled all of Cox’s issues, we affirm the trial court’s judgment as to Cox.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>ETMC’s Appeal</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In an agreed motion by ETMC and Nieves, the\r\nparties informed the Court that they have resolved this matter, and they\r\njointly request this Court (1) to dismiss the appeal of ETMC, with each side\r\nbearing their own costs, (2) to set aside the trial court’s judgment as to ETMC\r\nwithout regard to the merits of Nieves’s claims, (3) to direct the trial court\r\nto dismiss with prejudice all claims brought against ETMC, with each party\r\nbearing their own costs, and (4) to order a discharge of all obligations of the\r\nsurety, SAFECO Insurance Company of America, and of ETMC on the supersedeas\r\nbond and the release of the supersedeas bond.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.
