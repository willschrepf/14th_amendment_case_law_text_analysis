AND JACK M. CLINE, Appellees\n\n\n                   On Appeal from the 122nd District Court\n                          Galveston County, Texas\n                      Trial Court Case No. 12-CV-0428\n\n\n                         MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n      Appellants, Bacon Tomsons, Ltd., BRL Oil and Gas, L.L.C., and Ferrell\n\nEdwin Munson (collectively “BTL”), sued appellees Chrisjo Energy, Inc. and Jack\n\nM. Cline (collectively “Chrisjo”) for various claims, including fraud, conversion,\n\nbreach of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“DTPA”), and violation of the\n\fTexas Theft Liability Act (“TTLA”), arising out of the parties’ investment in a\n\npipeline facility. At trial, BTL nonsuited its DTPA and TTLA claims, and the trial\n\ncourt granted a directed verdict on its remaining claims against Chrisjo, ordering\n\nthat BTL take nothing on those claims. The trial court then awarded Chrisjo\n\nattorney’s fees under the TTLA as a “prevailing party.” In four issues on appeal,\n\nBTL argues that (1) the trial court’s plenary power had expired before it entered\n\nthe order and judgment awarding Chrisjo’s attorney’s fees; (2) alternatively,\n\nChrisjo was not a “prevailing party” entitled to attorney’s fees under the TTLA;\n\n(3) alternatively, Chrisjo did not properly segregate its evidence of TTLA\n\nattorney’s fees; and (4) the trial court erred in concluding that BTL’s conversion\n\nclaim against Chrisjo was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In 2004, Chrisjo entered into an agreement with a third party, Mideast Gas\n\nSystems, to develop an existing oil and gas pipeline in Plaquemines Parish,\n\nLouisiana, and to construct an additional gas sales pipeline, a saltwater disposal\n\nwell, and metering stations (“Pipeline Facilities”). The Pipeline Facilities serviced\n\nthe Coquille Bay Field, which is located offshore along the coast of Louisiana.\n\nMideast retained a 25% interest in the Pipeline Facilities, and Chrisjo obtained a\n\n75% interest in the Pipeline Facilities in exchange for raising $700,000 in capital.\n\n\n                                          2\n\fBTL invested money through Chrisjo to purchase a portion of Chrisjo’s share in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities, obtaining an 8.75% ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities. Chrisjo and BTL memorialized their agreement in a Private Placement\n\nMemorandum (“PPM”), which provided that investors would be entitled to collect\n\na proportionate share of the fees paid for the transport of oil and gas through the\n\nPipeline Facilities. Chrisjo recorded an assignment of interest in the Plaquemines\n\nParish property records reflecting the investors’ ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, including those of BTL. Chrisjo sent its investors, including BTL,\n\npayments, statements, and tax documents reflecting the amount earned by each\n\ninvestor based on those fees until 2008, when various problems with operating the\n\npipeline arose.\n\n      The investment in the Pipeline Facilities was never very profitable, and the\n\nproject was plagued by damage to the Coquille Bay Field caused by numerous\n\nhurricanes and tropical storms in addition to other problems. In 2010, the operator\n\nof the Coquille Bay Field, Imperial Petroleum (“Imperial”), expressed an interest\n\nin purchasing the Pipeline Facilities to consolidate the ownership of the various\n\ninterests in the oil and gas field and to simplify its efforts to comply with certain\n\noperating requirements set out by the state of Louisiana. In December 2010, the\n\nmajority of the investors in the Pipeline Facilities—all of the owners except\n\nBTL—transferred their interests in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in exchange\n\n\n                                         3\n\ffor Imperial stock. Imperial made subsequent representations to the Securities and\n\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) that this sale gave it a 100% ownership interest in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities and then eventually sold all of its interests in the Coquille\n\nBay Field to a third party.\n\n      On March 15, 2012, BTL filed suit against Chrisjo, Jack M. Cline, and\n\nImperial Petroleum.1 BTL alleged causes of action for fraud, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty, and it alleged\n\nviolations of the DTPA, the TTLA, and the Texas Securities Act. BTL argued that\n\nChrisjo misrepresented the nature of the interest conveyed by the PPM and led the\n\ninvestors to believe that they were acquiring a property interest in the oil and gas\n\nwells and the production from those wells on the existing lease in the Coquille Bay\n\nField in addition to the Pipeline Facilities. BTL further alleged that Chrisjo then\n\nimproperly transferred its interest in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial Petroleum.\n\n      Specifically regarding the conversion claim, BTL alleged that “Defendant\n\nImperial has and continues to have wrongfully exercised dominion and control\n\nover [BTL’s] interest in the Pipeline Facilities” and that “[t]he conversion by\n\nDefendants Chrisjo, Cline and/or Imperial is, was and/or continues to be a\n\nproducing cause of Plaintiffs’ actual damages in excess of $140,000.”\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Imperial Petroleum is not a party to this appeal.\n                                            4\n\f        Chrisjo answered with a general denial and asserted various affirmative\n\ndefenses, including the defense of limitations. Chrisjo also sought attorney’s fees\n\nunder the TTLA—Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 134.005—in its\n\nsecond amended answer. Chrisjo later moved for leave to file a supplement to its\n\nsecond amended answer seeking to add a claim for attorney’s fees under the\n\nDTPA. The trial court did not immediately rule on this motion.\n\n        In August 2013, Chrisjo moved for summary judgment on the ground that\n\nall of BTL’s claims against Chrisjo were barred by the applicable statutes of\n\nlimitations. The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment in October\n\n2013.\n\n        The trial court conducted a bench trial on January 20 and 21, 2015. At the\n\nstart of the trial, the parties agreed on the record to submit the attorney’s fees\n\nclaims to the trial court based on affidavits and briefs at the conclusion of the trial.\n\nBTL then nonsuited its TTLA claim, and Chrisjo argued that it was still entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees. It reminded the trial court that it had sought leave to supplement its\n\npleadings with a claim for attorney’s fees under the DTPA, and it believed it was\n\nentitled to those fees because “these claims were always groundless from the very\n\nbeginning.” BTL then stated that it was nonsuiting its DTPA claims. The trial court\n\nstated that it would “take both issues under advisement” and rule at a later time.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fFinally, Imperial failed to appear at trial, so BTL requested a post-answer default\n\njudgment against Imperial.\n\n      At trial, Cline testified that Chrisjo obtained a 75% ownership interest in the\n\nPipeline Facilities in exchange for obtaining the necessary investment money, and\n\nMideast Gas Systems retained a 25% ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities.\n\nApproximately twenty investors, including BTL, invested money in the project.\n\nChrisjo filed an assignment of interests in the property records of Plaquemines\n\nParish reflecting that BTL held an 8.75% ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities. Cline testified that tropical storms and hurricanes damaged the field on\n\nvarious occasions throughout the relevant time period, halting production for\n\nextended periods of time.\n\n      Cline testified that on March 6, 2009, he received an email informing him\n\nthat Imperial, the then-operator of the Coquille Bay Field, was suspending\n\npayments of any and all pipeline fees due to problems that had arisen with the\n\nLouisiana State Mineral Board Audit Committee. Cline stated that he provided\n\ncopies of this email to other investors, including BTL, and that he communicated\n\nwith both Imperial and officials with the state of Louisiana regarding the operation\n\nof the Pipeline Facilities, but he was unable to obtain any kind of resolution.\n\n      Imperial expressed to Chrisjo and other investors an interest in purchasing\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities to consolidate the ownership and management of the\n\n\n                                          6\n\fCoquille Bay Field and the Pipeline Facilities. Accordingly, Cline testified that\n\nImperial and Chrisjo, along with other owners of the Pipeline Facilities, signed an\n\nagreement setting forth the terms of a stock transfer, allowing the owners to trade\n\ntheir interest in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in exchange for Imperial stock.\n\nThis agreement allowed each party to elect to join the transfer or decline.\n\n      According to Cline and to the documents admitted at trial, on November 30,\n\n2010, Chrisjo signed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) with Imperial, back-\n\ndated to be effective November 1, 2010, giving Chrisjo until December 31, 2010,\n\nto send out questionnaires to all of the investors to obtain their consent to convey\n\nthe 75% interest in the Pipeline Facilities controlled by Chrisjo and its fellow\n\ninvestors, including BTL’s 8.75% interest. Cline testified that Chrisjo sent out the\n\nnecessary information and questionnaires to investors, including BTL. Cline\n\ntestified that all of the investors, including Chrisjo and Mideast Gas Systems,\n\nparticipated in the sale except for BTL. Regarding the transfer of Chrisjo’s and its\n\nother investors’ interests, Cline testified that they transferred “[s]eventy-five\n\npercent minus [BTL’s] interest.” Cline testified that, as far as he was aware, BTL\n\nstill owned its interest in the Pipeline Facilities. He also stated that Chrisjo lost\n\nmoney on the Pipeline Facilities deal and never saw a return on its investment.\n\n      BTL’s attorney asked Cline whether the APA “conveyed” to Imperial a 75%\n\nownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities, which would necessarily have\n\n\n                                          7\n\fincluded BTL’s interest, and Cline testified that the APA was not “a closing\n\ninstrument.” Under the terms of the APA, the closing was to take place on\n\nDecember 31, 2010. Cline testified that Chrisjo and Imperial designated this\n\nclosing date because it “gave [Chrisjo] time to try to get the full 75 percent” and\n\nthat it had a verbal agreement with Imperial that Imperial would consummate the\n\ndeal even if Chrisjo could not get all of the investors to participate. Cline testified\n\nthat Chrisjo never represented to Imperial that it had obtained all of the investors’\n\nconsent to the sale, and Cline stated that he forwarded the questionnaires, including\n\nBTL’s refusal to join, to Imperial “because [Imperial] had to make SEC filings.”\n\nCline also testified that neither he nor Chrisjo ever filed any deed or title\n\ndocuments purporting to transfer BTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities to any\n\nother party.\n\n      Cline also testified that, at the time of trial, the SEC was investigating\n\nImperial for wrongdoing and that the president of Imperial had also been indicted.\n\nChrisjo also presented accounting documents demonstrating that the money\n\ninvested by BTL and other investors was spent in development of the Pipeline\n\nFacilities. Chrisjo also adduced evidence demonstrating that it had properly\n\ndisbursed all transportation fees owing to the owners of the Pipeline Facilities,\n\nincluding BTL.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       BTL did not present any documents at trial demonstrating the amount of\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities actually conveyed at the closing in December\n\n2010 between Chrisjo and Imperial. It did present a document, created by Imperial\n\nand filed by Imperial with the SEC, in which Imperial claimed to have acquired\n\nfrom Chrisjo its investors’ full 75% ownership in the Pipeline Facilities. This SEC\n\nfiling also contained some representations from a press release made by Imperial\n\nthat Imperial had sold its interest in the Coquille Bay Field, including the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, to a third party.\n\n       Tom Elkins testified on behalf of Bacon Tomsons, Ltd. He testified that\n\nBacon Tomsons had invested $70,000 in the Pipeline Facilities and had received\n\nless than $7,000 in return. Elkins testified that “early on” he understood that the\n\ndeal was to obtain an interest in the pipeline and did not include income from the\n\noil and gas production. Elkins testified that Bacon Tomsons did not receive any\n\ndistributions for transportation fees after 2008, and he did not know why the\n\ndistributions stopped. BTL presented evidence that the Coquille Bay Field had\n\nproduced oil and gas after that time, but Elkins also testified that he understood\n\nthat since 2009, “they barge it out of there rather than use[] a pipeline.” Elkins\n\nagreed that Bacon Tomsons was not entitled to any transportation fees under its\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities unless the pipeline was used to move the oil.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      Regarding the sale of the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial, Elkins testified that\n\nBacon Tomsons received the information and questionnaire from Chrisjo and\n\nelected not to participate in the sale. Elkins further testified that the third party\n\npurchaser of the Coquille Bay Field eventually recognized Bacon Tomsons’\n\nownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities and contacted Elkins regarding\n\n“litigation pending on the ownership of the pipeline that he had purchased from\n\nImperial. And he knew that I was one of the—or Bacon Tomsons was one of the\n\nowners.”\n\n      Regarding the ownership of the Pipeline Facilities at the time of trial, Elkins\n\ntestified: “I’m not sure what’s happened. I think they’ve swapped and traded and\n\nmoved and shoved and diluted and—until nobody knows what’s going on\n\nanymore.” Elkins testified that he understood the assignment of interest reflecting\n\nBacon Tomsons’ ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities had been filed in the\n\nPlaquemines Parish property records, that he had not examined the real property\n\nrecords to determine whether any subsequent assignment had been filed\n\ntransferring Bacon Tomsons’ interest to someone else, and that he had not hired a\n\nlandman or title company to perform a title search or otherwise give an opinion\n\nabout who owned the Pipeline Facilities as of the time of trial.\n\n      Larry Porter testified as a representative of BRL Oil and Gas. BRL invested\n\n$17,500 in the Pipeline Facilities after hearing of the opportunity from Elkins.\n\n\n                                         10\n\fPorter testified that BRL received distributions of fee revenue from Chrisjo\n\nthrough 2008, but that the total amount of money generated from the investment\n\nwas small—approximately $1,650. Porter also acknowledged that he would not be\n\nentitled to transportation fees for any oil and gas produced from the Coquille Bay\n\nField unless it was moved through the pipeline. He testified that, at the time BRL\n\nentered into the deal with Chrisjo, he did not consider the possibility that a barge\n\ncould be used to transport the oil and gas produced in the field.\n\n      BRL, like Bacon Tomsons, knew of Imperial’s proposed purchase of the\n\nPipeline Facilities and had elected not to participate. Porter testified that, as of\n\nNovember 2011, he still believed BRL owned an interest in the pipeline. Porter\n\ntestified that at the time of trial he was not sure whether BRL owned an interest in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities, but he could not affirmatively state that BRL did not own it.\n\nPorter had no contact with the third-party purchaser of Imperial’s interest in the\n\nPipeline Facilities and only learned of Imperial’s representations that it owned and\n\nsubsequently sold a 100% ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities as a result of\n\nthe underlying litigation. Porter testified that he had not performed a title search or\n\notherwise examined the property records in Plaquemines Parish to determine the\n\ncurrent ownership of the Pipeline Facilities because there was no oil or gas coming\n\nthrough the pipeline so it was not worth the money to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Ferrell Munson also testified at trial. Munson personally invested $35,000 in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities and received approximately $3,163.69 in return on his\n\ninvestment. Munson testified at trial that he did not currently own an interest in the\n\nPipeline Facilities because “Mr. Cline sold it.” Munson based his belief that\n\nChrisjo sold his ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities on the language in the\n\nAPA indicating that Chrisjo was transferring to Imperial a 75% ownership interest\n\nin the Pipeline Facilities, which would necessarily have included Munson’s\n\ninterest. However, Munson had no personal knowledge regarding whether\n\nImperial’s purchase of the Pipeline Facilities finally closed under the terms of the\n\nAPA. Like Elkins and Porter, Munson never checked the property records in\n\nPlaquemines Parish to identify the record owners of the Pipeline Facilities at the\n\ntime of trial. Munson did not know whether any oil or gas was being transported\n\nthrough the pipeline at the time of trial.\n\n      Chrisjo moved for a directed verdict on BTL’s claims. The trial court did not\n\nrule on the motion for directed verdict at that time. Chrisjo then presented its own\n\ncase, including the testimony of expert witness Charles Fife, who testified\n\nregarding the nature of the transactions between Chrisjo and its investors and\n\nbetween Chrisjo and Imperial.\n\n      At the close of trial on January 21, 2015, Chrisjo renewed its motion for\n\ndirected verdict and filed a bench brief on limitations, stating that it sought a\n\n\n                                             12\n\fdirected verdict on the basis that all of BTL’s claims against it were barred by the\n\nrespective statutes of limitations. Regarding BTL’s conversion claim, Chrisjo\n\nargued that BTL’s claim had accrued in 2004 when the investors entered into the\n\nPPM, and thus the two-year limitations period had run well in advance of BTL’s\n\nfiling suit in 2012. Regarding the claim of conversion arising out of the 2010\n\ntransfer of its interest in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial, Chrisjo argued in its\n\nsupplemental bench brief on its motion for directed verdict that\n\n      the parties involved in this transaction [Imperial and Chrisjo]\n      understood that Chrisjo did not yet own 75% of the Pipeline, but was\n      going to attempt to acquire the interest in the next 30 days. This fact is\n      clearly evidenced by the closing date in the Purchase Agreement. Id.\n      at § 1.01. Defendants’ expert, Charles Fife, testified this is common in\n      the oil and gas industry so that the seller can lock the buyer into a\n      fixed price for the maximum interest that is desired to be sold. When\n      the entire interest is not acquired (as in this case), the closing is\n      modified or does not happen. Defendants testified that is what\n      happened here.\n\n      Furthermore, Chrisjo argued that any misrepresentations in the APA were\n\nmade by it to Imperial, not to BTL. And Chrisjo argued that neither the 2010 APA\n\nnor the 2012 SEC filing supported BTL’s claim for conversion against Chrisjo\n\nbecause\n\n      [Cline] testified that Chrisjo and Imperial never closed on the sale of\n      [BTL’s] interest and that [its] interests were never sold. Whether\n      Imperial (who is currently under investigation by the SEC for making\n      fraudulent statements) misrepresented to the SEC that it owned the\n      Coquille Pipeline or not, that alleged misrepresentation did not\n      transfer title away from [BTL]. Indeed, [BTL] remain[s] the current\n      owners of record as nothing has ever been filed in the deed records\n\n                                         13\n\f       transferring [BTL’s] interest to any other party. [BTL] admit[s] that\n       [it has] never performed a title search . . . and [does] not know\n       whether [it] still own[s] [its] interest in the Pipeline.\n\n       On February 11, 2015, Chrisjo filed its post-trial brief in support of its\n\nrequest for a mandatory award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $52,353.95. It\n\nargued that it was a prevailing party because BTL nonsuited claims, including its\n\nDTPA and TTLA claims, to avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits. Chrisjo also\n\nattached evidence supporting its claim for attorney’s fees, including affidavits\n\nregarding attorney’s fees, billing statements, and excerpts from the depositions of\n\nFerrell Munson, Thomas Elkins in his capacity as a representative for Bacon\n\nTomsons, and J. Larry Porter in his capacity as a representative for BRL Oil and\n\nGas.\n\n       In an affidavit attached as evidence to Chrisjo’s brief seeking attorney’s\n\nfees, Chrisjo’s attorney averred that the $52,353.95 amount represented fees\n\nexpended in defending against BTL’s claims for breach of the DTPA and TTLA.\n\nHe stated that, “[t]o the extent possible, [Chrisjo has] properly segregated\n\nrecoverable from non-recoverable fees.” He further averred that all of the claims—\n\nincluding those for violation of the TTLA and DTPA, conversion, and fraud—all\n\ninvolved the same operative facts and shared common elements, stating,\n\n       As such, those discrete legal services that advance both recoverable\n       and non-recoverable claims are so intertwined that they cannot be\n       segregated. Similarly, to the extent services were rendered that were\n       necessary for all claims (e.g., requests for disclosures, proof of facts,\n\n                                          14\n\f      depositions of primary actors, and motions for summary judgment),\n      those services have been properly included as they are not disallowed\n      simply because they do double service.\n\n      The billing statements attached as evidence supporting Chrisjo’s claim for\n\nattorney’s fees included itemized billing showing the initials of the person\n\nperforming a particular service, a brief description of the service, the time spent,\n\nthe hourly rate, and the amount billed. These bills were redacted to protect\n\nconfidential information, and they also reflected that Chrisjo had deleted numerous\n\ndiscrete legal services that, according to the attorney’s affidavit, were not\n\napplicable to the recoverable claims. Chrisjo did not present any evidence of the\n\ntotal amount of attorney’s fees it incurred in defending against BTL’s suit.\n\n      On February 24, 2015, the trial court signed a post-answer default judgment\n\nawarding BTL damages from Imperial.\n\n      On March 4, 2015, the trial court denied Chrisjo leave to file its supplement\n\nto its second amended answer—the pleading which sought to add a claim for\n\nattorney’s fees under the DTPA. The trial court ordered the supplemental answer\n\nstricken, leaving Chrisjo’s claim for attorney’s fees under the TTLA as its only\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees.\n\n      Also on March 4, 2015, the trial court signed its “Order Granting [Chrisjo’s]\n\nMotion for Directed Verdict.” It stated,\n\n      It appears to the Court, having considered all the evidence and\n      subsequent briefing in the case, and the reasonable inferences flowing\n\n                                           15\n\f      from it, in the light most favorable to [BTL], that the evidence is\n      insufficient as a matter of law to entitle [BTL] to recover against\n      [Chrisjo], and the Court is of the opinion that judgment should be\n      rendered in favor of [Chrisjo] as a matter of law.\n\nIt ordered that BTL “take nothing by this action” against Chrisjo. This order did\n\nnot address Chrisjo’s claims for attorney’s fees under the TTLA, and it did not\n\npurport to be a final judgment.\n\n      On March 18, 2015, Chrisjo moved for entry of an award of attorney’s fees\n\nand for entry of final judgment in light of the order on its motion for directed\n\nverdict. The trial court held a hearing on that motion, in which BTL argued that no\n\nfurther rulings were necessary because the March 4 order disposed of all remaining\n\nissues.\n\n      On July 8, 2015, the trial court signed an order awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nChrisjo in the amount of $24,829.42 based on its finding that Chrisjo was a\n\nprevailing party under the TTLA because BTL “nonsuited [its] Theft Act claims to\n\navoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.” The trial court also awarded\n\nconditional attorney’s fees in the event of a subsequent appeal.\n\n      Also on July 8, 2015, Chrisjo filed an amended motion for entry of final\n\njudgment, and the trial court set a hearing to occur on August 5, 2015. On August\n\n5, 2015, BTL filed objections and a response to Chrisjo’s motion for entry of a\n\nfinal judgment again arguing, in part, that the March 4 order disposed of all\n\npending claims.\n\n                                         16\n\f      On August 7, 2015, the trial court signed its final judgment, incorporating\n\nthe post-answer default judgment against Imperial, the order granting a directed\n\nverdict in favor of Chrisjo, and its ruling on Chrisjo’s claim for attorney’s fees\n\nunder the TTLA.\n\n      On August 11, 2015, BTL requested that the trial court file findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law, which the trial court never signed.\n\n      This appeal followed. BTL does not challenge the trial court’s ruling on any\n\nof its causes of action except for its conversion claim against Chrisjo. BTL also\n\nchallenges the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to Chrisjo as a prevailing party\n\nunder the TTLA.\n\n                     Directed Verdict on Conversion Claim\n\n      In its fourth issue, BTL argues that the trial court erred in ruling that its\n\nconversion claim was barred by limitations. We construe this as a complaint that\n\nthe trial court erred in granting Chrisjo’s motion for directed verdict on BTL’s\n\nconversion claim.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review directed verdicts under the same legal-sufficiency standard that\n\napplies to no-evidence summary judgments. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d\n\n802, 823–24 (Tex. 2005); see Merriman v. XTO Energy, Inc., 407 S.W.3d 244, 248\n\n(Tex. 2013) (citing King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 750 (Tex.\n\n\n                                         17\n\f2003)). We sustain a legal-sufficiency point when (1) there is a complete absence\n\nof evidence regarding a vital fact, (2) rules of law or evidence preclude giving\n\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered to\n\nprove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla, or (4) the evidence conclusively\n\nestablishes the opposite of the vital fact. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d at 810. We consider\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting evidence a\n\nreasonable jury could credit and disregarding contrary evidence and inferences\n\nunless a reasonable jury could not. Id. at 826. The nonmovant bears the burden to\n\nidentify evidence before the trial court that raises a genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to each challenged element of its cause of action. See Johnson v. Brewer &\n\nPritchard, P.C., 73 S.W.3d 193, 206–07 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      A directed verdict is proper if a party “fails to present evidence raising a fact\n\nissue essential to [its] right of recovery,” or if the party “admits or the evidence\n\nconclusively establishes a defense to [its] cause of action.” Prudential Ins. Co. of\n\nAm. v. Fin. Rev. Servs., Inc., 29 S.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex. 2000). We may affirm a\n\ndirected verdict on any ground that supports it. Exxon Corp. v. Breezevale Ltd., 82\n\nS.W.3d 429, 443 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2002, pet. denied). However, if there is\n\nevidence that raises a material fact issue on any theory of recovery, a directed\n\nverdict is improper and the case must be reversed and remanded. See Cox v. S.\n\nGarrett, L.L.C., 245 S.W.3d 574, 578 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no\n\n\n                                          18\n\fpet.) (citing Szczepanik v. First S. Tr. Co., 883 S.W.2d 648, 649 (Tex. 1994) (per\n\ncuriam)).\n\n      Conversion is the unauthorized and unlawful assumption and exercise of\n\ndominion and control over the personal property of another to the exclusion of, or\n\ninconsistent with, the owner’s rights. Freezia v. IS Storage Venture, LLC, 474\n\nS.W.3d 379, 386 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.) (citing Waisath\n\nv. Lack’s Stores, Inc., 474 S.W.2d 444, 446 (Tex. 1971)). The elements of a\n\nconversion cause of action are that: (1) the plaintiff owned, had legal possession of,\n\nor was entitled to possession of the property; (2) the defendant assumed and\n\nexercised dominion and control over the property in an unlawful and unauthorized\n\nmanner, to the exclusion of and inconsistent with the plaintiff’s rights; (3) the\n\nplaintiff made a demand for the property; and (4) the defendant refused to return\n\nthe property.

A\n\nplaintiff can recover for the conversion of personal property such as rental income.\n\nSee Freezia, 474 S.W.3d at 387 (citing Hoenig v. Tex. Commerce Bank, N.A., 939\n\nS.W.2d 656, 664 (Tex.

App.—Dallas 2011, pet.\n\ndenied) (“[A]n action will lie for conversion of money when its identification is\n\n\n                                         19\n\fpossible and there is an obligation to deliver the specific money in question or\n\notherwise particularly treat specific money.”) (quoting Houston Nat’l Bank v.\n\nBiber, 613 S.W.2d 771, 774 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1981, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.)). However, Texas does not recognize conversion claims for real\n\nproperty. See Freezia, 474 S.W.3d at 386 (stating that conversion involves\n\nunlawful exercise of control over personal property); Lucio v. John G. & Marie\n\nStella Kennedy Mem’l Found., 298 S.W.3d 663, 672 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2009, pet. denied) (observing that Texas law does not recognize cause of action for\n\nconversion of real property).\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      Although Chrisjo stated that its motion for directed verdict was based on\n\narguments that all of BTL’s claims were barred by the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations, its motion also addressed the sufficiency of BTL’s evidence on its\n\nconversion claim. It is unclear from BTL’s pleadings and evidence at trial whether\n\nits conversion claim was based on an alleged conversion of BTL’s money invested\n\nin the Pipeline Facilities, conversion of BTL’s ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, or conversion of the transportation fees that owners of the Pipeline\n\nFacilities were entitled to collect. Assuming without deciding that these property\n\ninterests are property that can be converted, we agree with Chrisjo that BTL failed\n\nto provide any evidence of conversion.\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      Chrisjo argued that the only evidence presented by BTL to support the\n\nconversion claim is insufficient because it did not demonstrate that BTL’s property\n\nwas ever actually transferred to Imperial or that Chrisjo otherwise assumed and\n\nexercised dominion and control over the property in an unlawful and unauthorized\n\nmanner. Chrisjo also argued that BTL failed to provide any evidence, in the form\n\nof a title search or other investigation of the real property records, identifying the\n\nrecord owners of the Pipeline Facilities at the time of trial. The trial court granted\n\nthe motion for directed verdict, stating that it had considered all of the evidence\n\nand briefing in the case and that it had determined “that the evidence is insufficient\n\nas a matter of law.”\n\n      At trial, BTL presented no evidence that Chrisjo had assumed and exercised\n\ndominion and control over the money invested in the Pipeline Facilities, its interest\n\nin the Pipeline Facilities, or the transportation fees owing to it as owners of the\n\nPipeline Facilities in an unlawful and unauthorized manner, to the exclusion of and\n\ninconsistent with BTL’s rights. See Alan Reuber Chevrolet, 287 S.W.3d at 888\n\n(setting out elements of conversion). BTL presented no evidence that the money it\n\ninvested in the Pipeline Facilities was misused, and it provided no evidence\n\nrebutting Chrisjo’s evidence accounting for all of the funds that were invested in\n\nthe project. In fact, BTL representatives testified that, as far as they were aware,\n\nthey still owned an interest in the Pipeline Facilities at the time of trial, and they\n\n\n                                         21\n\facknowledged that they never performed a title search or other examination of the\n\nreal property records to determine whether their ownership interest had ever been\n\ntransferred to Imperial. Elkins, Porter, and Munson each testified that they were\n\naware at or near the time of their 2004 investment that they were receiving only an\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities; that they in fact received the only disbursements\n\nof fees that they were entitled to under the terms of their assignment of interests;\n\nand that, as far as they were aware, they still remained the record owners of their\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities even though the Coquille Bay Field operators had\n\nceased using the pipeline in 2008. Elkins, Porter, and Munson all testified that they\n\nreceived disbursements of transportation fees through 2008. Elkins testified that he\n\nwas aware that, after 2008, the Coquille Bay Field operator had been using barges\n\nrather than the pipeline to move the oil and gas, and he agreed that the owners of\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities were not entitled to transportation fees unless the operator\n\nused the pipeline.\n\n      Although the 2010 APA states that Chrisjo offered Imperial a 75%\n\nownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities, this document was not a title\n\ninstrument and did not serve to actually transfer any rights to the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, and thus, necessarily, Chrisjo did not misappropriate any funds or fees\n\nrelated to the Pipeline Facilities. The agreements between Chrisjo and Imperial\n\nallowed for each investor to consider the terms of the offer and elect whether it\n\n\n                                         22\n\fwanted to participate in the transaction. Cline testified that when BTL refused to\n\nparticipate in the sale, under the terms of the APA the remaining owners\n\ntransferred their interests in the Pipeline Facilities and left BTL’s interests\n\nundisturbed. Cline stated that Chrisjo never filed any documents transferring\n\nBTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities. BTL presented no evidence contradicting\n\nthis testimony, nor did it present any evidence establishing that Chrisjo actually\n\ntransferred its ownership interest. Furthermore, any representations by Imperial in\n\nits SEC filing that it owned a 100% ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities are\n\nirrelevant to BTL’s conversion claim against Chrisjo. Because BTL failed to\n\npresent any evidence raising a fact issue regarding whether Chrisjo had assumed\n\nand exercised dominion and control over any personal property of BTL’s in an\n\nunlawful and unauthorized manner, to the exclusion of and inconsistent with\n\nBTL’s rights, the trial court’s directed verdict on the conversion claim was proper.\n\nSee Prudential Ins. Co., 29 S.W.3d at 77; see also Exxon Corp., 82 S.W.3d at 443\n\n(holding that we may affirm directed verdict on any ground that supports it).\n\n      We overrule BTL’s fourth issue on appeal.\n\n         Jurisdiction of Trial Court to Enter August 7, 2015 Judgment\n\n      In its first issue, BTL argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to render\n\nits July 8, 2015 order awarding attorney’s fees to Chrisjo and its August 7, 2015\n\nfinal judgment because its plenary power had expired. BTL argues that the trial\n\n\n                                          23\n\fcourt’s March 4, 2015 order granting Chrisjo’s motion for directed verdict was\n\n“presumed final despite the pending request for attorneys’ fees as sanctions made\n\nin [Chrisjo’s] post-trial brief filed before the judgment was signed.”\n\nA.    Legal Standard\n\n      There can be only one final judgment in this cause. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301.\n\nGenerally, a judgment is final when it “actually disposes of all claims and parties\n\nthen before the court, regardless of its language, or it states with unmistakable\n\nclarity that it is a final judgment as to all claims and all parties.” Lehmann v. Har–\n\nCon Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 192–93 (Tex. 2001). An appellate court determines the\n\nfinality of a judgment by the language of the judgment. Id. at 199.\n\n      In the absence of a contrary showing in the record, a judgment rendered after\n\na conventional trial on the merits carries a presumption of finality. See Houston\n\nHealth Clubs, Inc. v. First Court of Appeals, 722 S.W.2d 692, 693 (Tex. 1986)\n\n(orig. proceeding); N. E. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d 893, 897–98\n\n(Tex. 1966) (“When a judgment, not intrinsically interlocutory in character, is\n\nrendered and entered in a case regularly set for a conventional trial on the merits,\n\nno order for a separate trial of issues having been entered . . . it will be presumed\n\nfor appeal purposes that the Court intended to, and did, dispose of all parties\n\nlegally before it and of all issues made by the pleadings between such parties.”).\n\nOtherwise, no such presumption arises. Lehmann, 39 S.W.3d at 199–200; see also\n\n\n                                          24\n\fAldridge, 400 S.W.2d at 898 (concluding, “in the absence of a contrary showing in\n\nthe record,” that judgment entered after case was set for conventional trial on the\n\nmerits was presumed final for purposes of appeal); Exxon Corp. v. Garza, 981\n\nS.W.2d 415, 419 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied) (stating that\n\npresumption of finality recognized in Aldridge “only applies . . . in the absence of a\n\ncontrary showing in the record”). “If there is any doubt as to the judgment’s\n\nfinality, then finality must be resolved by a determination of the intention of the\n\ncourt as gathered from the language of the decree and the record as a whole, aided\n\non occasion by the conduct of the parties.” Vaughn v. Drennon, 324 S.W.3d 560,\n\n563 (Tex. 2010) (per curiam) (quoting Lehmann, 39 S.W.3d at 203) (internal\n\nquotation marks, bracketing, and capitalization omitted).\n\n      BTL argues, in part, that its nonsuit of its TTLA claim against Chrisjo\n\nresolved Chrisjo’s related claim for attorney’s fees under the TTLA. Texas Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 162 provides:\n\n      At any time before the plaintiff has introduced all of his evidence\n      other than rebuttal evidence, the plaintiff may dismiss a case, or take a\n      non-suit, which shall be entered in the minutes. . . .\n             Any dismissal pursuant to this rule shall not prejudice the right\n      of an adverse party to be heard on a pending claim for affirmative\n      relief or excuse the payment of all costs taxed by the clerk. A\n      dismissal under this rule shall have no effect on any motion for\n      sanctions, attorney’s fees or other costs, pending at the time of\n      dismissal, as determined by the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\fTEX. R. CIV. P. 162. A plaintiff’s decision about which of its claims to pursue or\n\nabandon does not control the fate of a nonmoving party’s independent claims for\n\naffirmative relief. Villafani v. Trejo, 251 S.W.3d 466, 469 (Tex. 2008); Alan\n\nReuber Chevrolet, 287 S.W.3d at 887. Specifically, a plaintiff’s nonsuit cannot\n\nextinguish a defendant’s counterclaim for costs and attorney’s fees. Villafani, 251\n\nS.W.3d at 469; Alan Reuber Chevrolet, 287 S.W.3d at 887; see also Referente v.\n\nCity View Courtyard, L.P., 477 S.W.3d 882, 886 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2015, no pet.) (holding that nonsuit “has no effect on any motion for attorney’s\n\nfees or other costs pending at the time of dismissal”); Dean Foods Co. v. Anderson,\n\n178 S.W.3d 449, 453 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2005, pet. denied) (“A request for\n\nattorney’s fees is a claim for affirmative relief.”).\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      Here, Chrisjo’s request for attorney’s fees was not, as BTL suggests, based\n\non a motion for sanctions. BTL pleaded a cause of action for violations of the\n\nTTLA, and Chrisjo filed an answer denying the claim and asserting a claim for\n\nattorney’s fees pursuant to the TTLA. On the day of trial, prior to presenting its\n\ncase-in-chief, BTL nonsuited its TTLA claim, and Chrisjo argued at trial and in a\n\npost-trial motion and briefing that it was entitled to “prevailing party” attorney’s\n\nfees because BTL had nonsuited the TTLA claim to avoid an unfavorable ruling on\n\nthe merits. At the beginning and close of evidence at trial, the parties agreed on the\n\n\n                                           26\n\frecord that they would submit evidence and briefing on the issue of attorney’s fees\n\nto the trial court post-trial. Thus, at the time BTL non-suited its TTLA claim,\n\nChrisjo had a pending claim for attorney’s fees. See Villafani, 251 S.W.3d at 469.\n\n      BTL argues that Chrisjo’s pending “request for sanctions” was not a claim\n\nfor affirmative relief that was independent of BTL’s nonsuited claim; however,\n\nTexas courts have held that “[a]n affirmative claim, stated in an answer, for\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees for preparation and prosecution of a defense constitutes\n\na counterclaim.” In re C.A.S., 128 S.W.3d 681, 686 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no\n\npet.); In re Frost Nat’l Bank, 103 S.W.3d 647, 650 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2003, no pet.); see also Villafani, 251 S.W.3d at 469 (holding that “a plaintiff’s\n\nnonsuit cannot extinguish a defendant’s counterclaim for costs and attorney’s\n\nfees”); Nolte v. Flournoy, 348 S.W.3d 262, 267 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2011, pet.\n\ndenied) (claim for attorney’s fees included in defendant’s answer was considered\n\nto be counterclaim seeking affirmative relief). A defendant’s claim for attorney’s\n\nfees under the TTLA is one that can survive past the resolution of the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim. See, e.g., Epps v. Fowler, 351 S.W.3d 862, 866 (Tex. 2011) (stating that\n\n“prevailing party” may include defendant who successfully defends against claim\n\nand that defendant may still be “prevailing party” after plaintiff’s nonsuit under\n\nsome circumstances); Arrow Marble, LLC v. Estate of Killion, 441 S.W.3d 702,\n\n706 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (recognizing that “[c]ourts\n\n\n                                        27\n\fhave held that the phrase ‘prevailing party’ in section 134.005(b) of the TTLA\n\nincludes both a plaintiff successfully prosecuting a theft suit and a defendant\n\nsuccessfully defending against one” and analyzing effect of dismissal of plaintiff’s\n\nclaim on defendant’s status as “prevailing party”). We conclude that Chrisjo’s\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees here was a claim for affirmative relief that was not\n\ndisturbed by BTL’s nonsuit.\n\n      BTL also argues that even if the request for attorney’s fees was an\n\nindependent claim for affirmative relief, the March 4 order was still final under the\n\nAldridge presumption. See Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d at 898 (holding that judgments\n\nrendered after conventional trial on merits carry presumption of finality). However,\n\nthe record here rebuts any presumption of finality. See, e.g., Vaughn, 324 S.W.3d\n\nat 563 (stating that presumption of finality applies “unless a trial court orders a\n\nseparate trial to resolve a specific issue”); Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d at 898 (presuming\n\njudgment following setting for trial on merits is final “in the absence of a contrary\n\nshowing in the record”).\n\n      The trial court’s March 4 order does not purport to be a judgment—much\n\nless a final judgment—and it does not contain any language demonstrating that it\n\nwas intended to be final: it does not state that it is a final judgment or intended to\n\nbe appealable; it does not incorporate the trial court’s previous post-answer default\n\njudgment against Imperial Petroleum; and it does not contain a “Mother Hubbard”\n\n\n                                         28\n\fclause disposing of claims not specifically mentioned. Rather, the March 4 order is\n\nstyled as an “Order Granting Defendant’s Motion for Directed Verdict,” and the\n\nlanguage of the order granted Chrisjo’s motion for directed verdict and disposed\n\nonly of the issues addressed in that motion. It does not address or dispose of\n\nChrisjo’s pending claim for attorney’s fees or award costs. Accordingly, it was not\n\nfinal. See Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 868 (holding that nonsuit does not affect any\n\npending claim for affirmative relief or motion for attorney’s fees or sanctions);\n\nLehmann, 39 S.W.3d at 192–93 (holding that judgment is final for purposes of\n\nappeal “if and only if either it . . . actually disposes of all claims and parties then\n\nbefore the court, regardless of its language, or it states with unmistakable clarity\n\nthat it is a final judgment as to all claims and all parties”).2 The trial court\n\ncontinued to accept briefing from the parties and enter orders until it rendered its\n\nAugust 7, 2015 judgment, entitled “Final Judgment,” that incorporated all of its\n\nprevious rulings and finally disposed of all of the claims of all of the parties.\n\n      We conclude that the March 4 order was not a final judgment. That order\n\ngranted Chrisjo’s motion for a directed verdict, but did not address the pending\n2\n      BTL also argues that any agreement by the parties to try attorney’s fees after\n      March 4, 2015 could not extend the trial court’s jurisdiction beyond the limits\n      provided by Rule of Civil Procedure 329b and that Chrisjo’s post-judgment\n      motions would not have extended the trial court’s plenary power to encompass the\n      July 8, 2015 order awarding attorney’s fees and the August 7, 2015 final\n      judgment. Because we conclude that the March 4, 2015 order was not final and\n      that the final judgment was rendered on August 7, 2015, when the trial court\n      finally disposed of all claims and all parties, we need not address these\n      contentions.\n                                           29\n\fclaim for attorney’s fees. The trial court rendered its final judgment on August 7,\n\n2015, as that was a judgment that finally disposed of all claims and parties.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court retained jurisdiction to render its order granting\n\nattorney’s fees and its August 7 judgment.\n\n      We overrule BTL’s first issue.\n\n                            Award of Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In its second and third issues, BTL argues that the trial court erred in\n\nawarding Chrisjo attorney’s fees under the TTLA.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      The availability of attorney’s fees under a particular statute is a question of\n\nlaw that we review de novo. Arrow Marble, 441 S.W.3d at 705. TTLA section\n\n134.005(b) provides that “[e]ach person who prevails in a suit under this chapter\n\nshall be awarded court costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees.” TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 134.005(b) (West Supp. 2015); Arrow Marble,\n\n441 S.W.3d at 705. The award of fees to a prevailing party in a TTLA action is\n\nmandatory. Arrow Marble, 441 S.W.3d at 705 (citing Bocquet v. Herring, 972\n\nS.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex. 1998)). Although the TTLA does not define the phrase\n\n“prevailing party,” Texas courts, including this Court, have held that both a\n\nplaintiff successfully prosecuting a theft suit and a defendant successfully\n\ndefending against one can be considered prevailing parties under the TTLA. Arrow\n\n\n                                         30\n\fMarble, 441 S.W.3d at 706; see Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 866–70 (construing written\n\ncontract to give meaning to term “prevailed” and setting out circumstances under\n\nwhich defendant may be considered to have prevailed).\n\n      A defendant is generally not a prevailing party when the plaintiff nonsuits its\n\nclaims without prejudice. Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 869; BBP Sub I LP v. DiTucci, No.\n\n05-12-01523-CV, 2014 WL 3743669, at *3 (Tex. App.—Dallas July 29, 2014, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.) (applying reasoning in Epps to claim for attorney’s fees under\n\nTTLA). However, the supreme court in Epps looked with disfavor upon “nonsuits\n\nthat are filed to circumvent unfavorable legal restrictions or rulings” and held that\n\n“a defendant may be a prevailing party when a plaintiff nonsuits without prejudice\n\nif the trial court determines, on the defendant’s motion, that the nonsuit was taken\n\nto avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.” 351 S.W.3d at 870; Referente, 477\n\nS.W.3d at 886; DiTucci, 2014 WL 3743669, at *3.\n\n      Courts make the determination of whether a plaintiff nonsuited in order to\n\navoid an unfavorable ruling “based upon inferences drawn from the course of\n\nevents in the lawsuit.” Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 870 (“[C]ourts should rely as far as\n\npossible on the existing record and affidavits, and resort to live testimony only in\n\nrare instances.”). “A number of factors may support an inference that a plaintiff has\n\nnonsuited in order to avoid an unfavorable ruling,” including the timing of the\n\nnonsuit, the plaintiff’s unexcused failure to obtain discovery of evidence that might\n\n\n                                         31\n\fdisprove its claim, or the existence of other procedural obstacles, such as the\n\ninability to join necessary parties. Id. at 870–71; Referente, 477 S.W.3d at 886. The\n\nsupreme court also stated:\n\n      On the other hand, as we have noted, it is reasonable to presume that\n      the parties did not intend to encourage continued litigation when\n      discovery reveals previously unknown flaws in the plaintiff’s claims.\n      Accordingly, evidence that the suit was not without merit when filed\n      may indicate that the defendant has not prevailed and is therefore not\n      entitled to attorney’s fees.\n\nEpps, 351 S.W.3d at 871.\n\n      “[W]hether a party nonsuited to avoid an unfavorable ruling is a question of\n\nfact,” and “the trial court’s finding on that issue may be challenged on the ground\n\nthat it is not supported by sufficient evidence.” Referente, 477 S.W.3d at 885.\n\n“Accordingly, we will review the trial court’s determination under Epps for an\n\nabuse of discretion, deferring to factual findings that are supported by some\n\nevidence, but reviewing legal questions de novo.” Id. at 886.\n\nB.    Prevailing Party\n\n      In its second issue, BTL argues that the trial court erred in awarding Chrisjo\n\nattorney’s fees because Chrisjo was not a prevailing party under the TTLA.\n\nSpecifically, it argues that it nonsuited its TTLA claim without prejudice and that\n\nthe evidence was legally and factually insufficient to establish that it nonsuited to\n\navoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits. Chrisjo argues that the timing of the\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fnonsuit and the evidence adduced at trial support a conclusion that BTL nonsuited\n\nits TTLA claim to avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.\n\n      Here, the trial court found that BTL took the nonsuit to avoid an unfavorable\n\nruling on the merits. The record indicates that BTL filed its TTLA claim in March\n\n2012 and nonsuited it at trial in January 2015, thereby requiring Chrisjo to expend\n\neffort and attorney’s fees in defending against that claim for nearly three years.\n\nBTL took its nonsuit on the day the bench trial began, but it did not nonsuit its\n\nrelated claim for conversion, which does not allow for the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees. When Chrisjo reminded the trial court that it still had pending claims for\n\nattorney’s fees under the DTPA as well, BTL nonsuited its DTPA claim, but did\n\nnot nonsuit its related fraud claims, which did not allow for the recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees. BTL provided no explanation for its decision to nonsuit the TTLA\n\nand DTPA claims but not the related conversion and fraud claims.\n\n      Furthermore, the evidence at trial demonstrated that BTL failed to procure\n\nevidence   that   would   have   demonstrated    whether       Chrisjo   misused   or\n\nmisappropriated any funds or other property interests. The TTLA “permits a civil\n\ncause of action for damages against a party who commits theft via any of the\n\nnumerous methods defined under the Texas Penal Code.” Cluck v. Mecom, 401\n\nS.W.3d 110, 117 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied); see TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 134.003 (“A person who commits theft is liable\n\n\n                                        33\n\ffor the damages resulting from the theft.”); id. § 134.002(2) (defining “theft” as\n\nunlawful appropriation of property or unlawfully obtaining services as defined in\n\nTexas Penal Code chapter 31).\n\n      As with BTL’s claim for conversion, neither the pleadings nor the evidence\n\nclearly states whether BTL’s theft claim was based on Chrisjo’s alleged theft of\n\nBTL’s money invested in the Pipeline Facilities, theft of the transportation fees, or\n\ntheft of some other interest in the Pipeline Facilities. Assuming, without deciding,\n\nthat these complaints can properly form the basis of a TTLA claim, BTL failed to\n\nobtain any of the evidence necessary to support its claim that Chrisjo committed\n\ntheft of BTL’s funds or other interest in the Pipeline Facilities. According to\n\nCline’s testimony and other evidence adduced by Chrisjo, the money invested by\n\nBTL was used according to its agreed purpose in developing the Pipeline Facilities\n\nand Chrisjo properly recorded BTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities in the\n\nPlaquemines Parish property records. Chrisjo also presented evidence that all\n\ntransportation fees were properly dispersed and that no documents that transferred\n\nBTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities were ever executed or recorded. BTL\n\noffered no explanation for this failure to obtain actual proof of the ownership of the\n\nPipeline Facilities, other than Munson’s testimony that he did not believe hiring a\n\ntitle company was worth the money. None of the BTL representatives explained\n\nwhy they were unable to review the property records themselves. Thus, the record\n\n\n                                         34\n\fcontains evidence of BTL’s unexcused failure to complete discovery of evidence\n\nthat could support entry of an adverse judgment—i.e., evidence from the property\n\nrecords demonstrating that BTL still owned property that was the subject of its\n\ntheft claim. See Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 871. Accordingly, the timing of the nonsuit\n\nand other inferences drawn from the course of events in the lawsuit support the\n\ntrial court’s finding. See id. at 870.\n\n       BTL also argues that Chrisjo failed to establish that the TTLA claim was\n\nmeritless when filed and, thus, did not establish that BTL nonsuited to avoid an\n\nunfavorable ruling on the merits. BTL relies on the fact that its claim survived\n\nChrisjo’s motion for summary judgment on limitations grounds. However, BTL’s\n\nargument that its TTLA claim was not time barred is not the equivalent of evidence\n\nthat its suit was “not without merit when filed” but was subsequently revealed to\n\nhave unknown flaws. See id. at 871. BTL presented no evidence or argument\n\ndemonstrating that it conducted appropriate discovery of the TTLA claim that\n\nrevealed flaws in its suit. On the contrary, the evidence in the record demonstrates\n\nthat BTL’s TTLA claim against Chrisjo was meritless and that BTL had in its\n\npossession—prior to its filing of suit—the information it needed to determine that\n\nChrisjo did not commit theft.\n\n       BTL asserted that Chrisjo committed civil theft or conversion by misusing\n\nits investment in the Pipeline Facilities and by selling its interest in the Pipeline\n\n\n                                         35\n\fFacilities to Imperial, but BTL presented no evidence that such misuse or improper\n\nsale ever occurred. Elkins, Porter, and Munson each testified that they were aware\n\nat or near the time of their 2004 investment that they were receiving only an\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities; that they in fact received the only disbursements\n\nof fees that they were entitled to under the terms of their assignment of interests;\n\nand that, as far as they were aware, they still remained the record owners of their\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities even though the Coquille Bay Field operators had\n\nceased using the pipeline in 2008. Elkins, Porter, and Munson all testified that they\n\nreceived disbursements of transportation fees through 2008. Elkins testified that he\n\nwas aware that since 2008 the Coquille Bay Field operator had been using barges\n\nrather than the pipeline to move the oil and gas, and he agreed that the owners of\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities were not entitled to transportation fees unless the operator\n\nused the pipeline facilities. As discussed above, BTL presented no evidence to\n\nsupport its conversion claim against Chrisjo, and it does not challenge the trial\n\ncourt’s take-nothing judgment on all of its remaining claims.\n\n       Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nconcluding that Chrisjo was a prevailing party under the TTLA. See Referente, 477\n\nS.W.3d at 885–86.\n\n      We overrule BTL’s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\fC.    Segregation of Fees\n\n      In its third issue, BTL argues, in the alternative, that Chrisjo did not properly\n\nsegregate its attorney’s fees for defending against the TTLA claim.\n\n      A prevailing party entitled to attorney’s fees is required to “segregate fees\n\nbetween claims for which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.”\n\nTony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006); Arrow\n\nMarble, 441 S.W.3d at 709. “The need to segregate attorneys’ fees is a question of\n\nlaw, while the extent to which claims can or cannot be segregated is a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact.” Penhollow Custom Homes, L.L.C. v. Kim, 320 S.W.3d\n\n366, 374 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, no pet.). “The award of attorney’s fees\n\ngenerally rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.” El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas,\n\n370 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2012) (citing Ragsdale v. Progressive Voters League,\n\n801 S.W.2d 880, 881 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam)).\n\n      BTL argues that Chrisjo “failed to properly segregate recoverable from non-\n\nrecoverable attorney’s fees” because the affidavits and billing statements “fail to\n\nadequately segregate the fees attributable to defense of [BTL’s] TTLA claims,\n\nwhich were based entirely on the sale of the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in\n\nNovember 2010, from fees incurred in defending [BTL’s] fraud, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, DTPA, Texas Securities Act, statutory stock fraud, conversion\n\nand breach of fiduciary duty claims.” BTL asserts that “many of the time records\n\n\n                                          37\n\fincluded in the fee affidavit pertain to claims based on misrepresentations made at\n\nthe time of [BTL’s] original investment and the interpretation of the PPM, which\n\nare not relevant in the least to the TTLA claims.”\n\n      Chrisjo argues that it properly segregated its attorney’s fees incurred in\n\ndefending against the TTLA claim. When it submitted its evidence on attorney’s\n\nfees to the trial court, Chrisjo was seeking attorney’s fees under both the DTPA\n\nand the TTLA. Chrisjo submitted billing statements that showed only certain\n\ndiscrete legal services were included in its calculation of recoverable attorney’s\n\nfees. Its attorney presented an affidavit in which he averred that, “[t]o the extent\n\npossible, [Chrisjo has] properly segregated recoverable from non-recoverable fees”\n\nand that Chrisjo’s defense against the TTLA and DTPA claims involved the same\n\noperative facts and essentially identical analysis as its defense against the related\n\nconversion and fraud claims.\n\n      Chrisjo disagrees with BTL’s argument that its TTLA claim was “based\n\nentirely on the sale of the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in November 2010,” and\n\nthus none of Chrisjo’s attorney’s fees incurred in addressing any theft allegations\n\narising out the original 2004 investment were proper. We agree with Chrisjo that\n\nBTL’s pleadings and the other record evidence indicate that BTL accused Chrisjo\n\ngenerally of theft and conversion, among other causes of action, relating to\n\nChrisjo’s conduct beginning in 2004 and continuing until 2010.\n\n\n                                         38\n\f      BTL further complains that Chrisjo could not reasonably claim that discrete\n\nlegal services contained in the attorney’s fees calculation were all necessary to\n\naddress the TTLA claim. Chrisjo stated that “those discrete legal services that\n\nadvance both recoverable and non-recoverable claims are so intertwined that they\n\ncannot be segregated” and that those identified legal services “were necessary for\n\nall claims (e.g., requests for disclosures, proof of facts, depositions of primary\n\nactors, and motions for summary judgment),” and so were included in its request\n\nfor fees because “they are not disallowed simply because they do double service.”\n\nSee Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313 (“Requests for standard disclosures, proof of\n\nbackground facts, depositions of the primary actors, discovery motions and\n\nhearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services may be necessary\n\nwhether a claim is filed alone or with others. To the extent such services would\n\nhave been incurred on a recoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply\n\nbecause they do double service.”). However, the court in Chapa stated that while\n\nattorneys do not “have to keep separate time records” when they draft petitions or\n\nprovide other services that advance both recoverable and nonrecoverable claims, it\n\nis still appropriate to provide “an opinion . . . that, for example, 95 percent of their\n\ndrafting time would have been necessary even if there had been no\n\n[nonrecoverable] claim.” Id. at 314. Chrisjo provided no such evidence regarding\n\nthe percentage of its attorney’s work that would have been necessary for certain\n\n\n                                          39\n\fdiscrete legal services even if no nonrecoverable claims had been advanced,\n\narguing instead that all of those remaining services would have been necessary to\n\naddress the recoverable claims.\n\n      However, BTL’s argument that Chrisjo failed to identify the percentage of\n\nthose discrete legal services that were attributable solely to the TTLA claim\n\nignores the role of the trial court as a fact finder here and the standard of review for\n\nevaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence. See id. (“But when, as here, it cannot\n\nbe denied that at least some of the attorney’s fees are attributable only to claims for\n\nwhich fees are not recoverable, segregation of fees ought to be required and the\n\njury ought to decide the rest.”); Kim, 320 S.W.3d at 374 (holding that extent to\n\nwhich claims can or cannot be segregated is mixed question of law and fact); see\n\nalso El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763–64 (holding that evidence is sufficient to support\n\namount of attorney’s fees awarded when claimant presented evidence of services\n\nperformed, who performed them and at what hourly rate, when they were\n\npreformed, and how much time work required). The appropriate question here is\n\nwhether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court’s award of\n\n$24,829.42 as TTLA attorney’s fees.\n\n      Chrisjo did segregate its attorney’s fees by eliminating from its claim the\n\nfees attributable to services rendered on nonrecoverable claims, and it sought\n\n$52,353.95, based on its attorney’s affidavit that the remaining services were\n\n\n                                          40\n\fessentially all necessary to defend against the TTLA and DTPA claims. The trial\n\ncourt considered this evidence—including detailed, itemized billing statements that\n\nset out the exact tasks performed, the people who performed the tasks and their\n\nhourly rates, and the amount of time involved—and, after determining that Chrisjo\n\nwas not entitled to any fees under the DTPA because of the stricken supplemental\n\npleading, awarded Chrisjo less than half of the fees its sought, or $24,829.42. Thus,\n\nthe trial court impliedly found not credible the attorney’s testimony that “those\n\ndiscrete legal services that advance both recoverable and non-recoverable claims\n\nare so intertwined that they cannot be segregated,” and awarded less than the full\n\nrequested amount of fees. See El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763–64; see also Messier v.\n\nMessier, 458 S.W.3d 155, 166–67 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.)\n\n(holding that, in determining amount of attorney’s fees, trial court “can consider\n\nthe entire record, the evidence presented on reasonableness, the amount in\n\ncontroversy, the common knowledge of the participants as lawyers and judges, and\n\nthe relative success of the parties”).\n\n      Accordingly, we conclude that Chrisjo presented segregated evidence of its\n\nattorney’s fees, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the\n\nrecord and determining the amount of the award here.

Cline (collectively “Chrisjo”) for various claims, including fraud, conversion,\n\nbreach of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“DTPA”), and violation of the\n\fTexas Theft Liability Act (“TTLA”), arising out of the parties’ investment in a\n\npipeline facility. At trial, BTL nonsuited its DTPA and TTLA claims, and the trial\n\ncourt granted a directed verdict on its remaining claims against Chrisjo, ordering\n\nthat BTL take nothing on those claims. The trial court then awarded Chrisjo\n\nattorney’s fees under the TTLA as a “prevailing party.” In four issues on appeal,\n\nBTL argues that (1) the trial court’s plenary power had expired before it entered\n\nthe order and judgment awarding Chrisjo’s attorney’s fees; (2) alternatively,\n\nChrisjo was not a “prevailing party” entitled to attorney’s fees under the TTLA;\n\n(3) alternatively, Chrisjo did not properly segregate its evidence of TTLA\n\nattorney’s fees; and (4) the trial court erred in concluding that BTL’s conversion\n\nclaim against Chrisjo was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In 2004, Chrisjo entered into an agreement with a third party, Mideast Gas\n\nSystems, to develop an existing oil and gas pipeline in Plaquemines Parish,\n\nLouisiana, and to construct an additional gas sales pipeline, a saltwater disposal\n\nwell, and metering stations (“Pipeline Facilities”). The Pipeline Facilities serviced\n\nthe Coquille Bay Field, which is located offshore along the coast of Louisiana.\n\nMideast retained a 25% interest in the Pipeline Facilities, and Chrisjo obtained a\n\n75% interest in the Pipeline Facilities in exchange for raising $700,000 in capital.\n\n\n                                          2\n\fBTL invested money through Chrisjo to purchase a portion of Chrisjo’s share in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities, obtaining an 8.75% ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities. Chrisjo and BTL memorialized their agreement in a Private Placement\n\nMemorandum (“PPM”), which provided that investors would be entitled to collect\n\na proportionate share of the fees paid for the transport of oil and gas through the\n\nPipeline Facilities. Chrisjo recorded an assignment of interest in the Plaquemines\n\nParish property records reflecting the investors’ ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, including those of BTL. Chrisjo sent its investors, including BTL,\n\npayments, statements, and tax documents reflecting the amount earned by each\n\ninvestor based on those fees until 2008, when various problems with operating the\n\npipeline arose.\n\n      The investment in the Pipeline Facilities was never very profitable, and the\n\nproject was plagued by damage to the Coquille Bay Field caused by numerous\n\nhurricanes and tropical storms in addition to other problems. In 2010, the operator\n\nof the Coquille Bay Field, Imperial Petroleum (“Imperial”), expressed an interest\n\nin purchasing the Pipeline Facilities to consolidate the ownership of the various\n\ninterests in the oil and gas field and to simplify its efforts to comply with certain\n\noperating requirements set out by the state of Louisiana. In December 2010, the\n\nmajority of the investors in the Pipeline Facilities—all of the owners except\n\nBTL—transferred their interests in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in exchange\n\n\n                                         3\n\ffor Imperial stock. Imperial made subsequent representations to the Securities and\n\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) that this sale gave it a 100% ownership interest in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities and then eventually sold all of its interests in the Coquille\n\nBay Field to a third party.\n\n      On March 15, 2012, BTL filed suit against Chrisjo, Jack M. Cline, and\n\nImperial Petroleum.1 BTL alleged causes of action for fraud, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty, and it alleged\n\nviolations of the DTPA, the TTLA, and the Texas Securities Act. BTL argued that\n\nChrisjo misrepresented the nature of the interest conveyed by the PPM and led the\n\ninvestors to believe that they were acquiring a property interest in the oil and gas\n\nwells and the production from those wells on the existing lease in the Coquille Bay\n\nField in addition to the Pipeline Facilities. BTL further alleged that Chrisjo then\n\nimproperly transferred its interest in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial Petroleum.\n\n      Specifically regarding the conversion claim, BTL alleged that “Defendant\n\nImperial has and continues to have wrongfully exercised dominion and control\n\nover [BTL’s] interest in the Pipeline Facilities” and that “[t]he conversion by\n\nDefendants Chrisjo, Cline and/or Imperial is, was and/or continues to be a\n\nproducing cause of Plaintiffs’ actual damages in excess of $140,000.”\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Imperial Petroleum is not a party to this appeal.\n                                            4\n\f        Chrisjo answered with a general denial and asserted various affirmative\n\ndefenses, including the defense of limitations. Chrisjo also sought attorney’s fees\n\nunder the TTLA—Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 134.005—in its\n\nsecond amended answer. Chrisjo later moved for leave to file a supplement to its\n\nsecond amended answer seeking to add a claim for attorney’s fees under the\n\nDTPA. The trial court did not immediately rule on this motion.\n\n        In August 2013, Chrisjo moved for summary judgment on the ground that\n\nall of BTL’s claims against Chrisjo were barred by the applicable statutes of\n\nlimitations. The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment in October\n\n2013.\n\n        The trial court conducted a bench trial on January 20 and 21, 2015. At the\n\nstart of the trial, the parties agreed on the record to submit the attorney’s fees\n\nclaims to the trial court based on affidavits and briefs at the conclusion of the trial.\n\nBTL then nonsuited its TTLA claim, and Chrisjo argued that it was still entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees. It reminded the trial court that it had sought leave to supplement its\n\npleadings with a claim for attorney’s fees under the DTPA, and it believed it was\n\nentitled to those fees because “these claims were always groundless from the very\n\nbeginning.” BTL then stated that it was nonsuiting its DTPA claims. The trial court\n\nstated that it would “take both issues under advisement” and rule at a later time.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fFinally, Imperial failed to appear at trial, so BTL requested a post-answer default\n\njudgment against Imperial.\n\n      At trial, Cline testified that Chrisjo obtained a 75% ownership interest in the\n\nPipeline Facilities in exchange for obtaining the necessary investment money, and\n\nMideast Gas Systems retained a 25% ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities.\n\nApproximately twenty investors, including BTL, invested money in the project.\n\nChrisjo filed an assignment of interests in the property records of Plaquemines\n\nParish reflecting that BTL held an 8.75% ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities. Cline testified that tropical storms and hurricanes damaged the field on\n\nvarious occasions throughout the relevant time period, halting production for\n\nextended periods of time.\n\n      Cline testified that on March 6, 2009, he received an email informing him\n\nthat Imperial, the then-operator of the Coquille Bay Field, was suspending\n\npayments of any and all pipeline fees due to problems that had arisen with the\n\nLouisiana State Mineral Board Audit Committee. Cline stated that he provided\n\ncopies of this email to other investors, including BTL, and that he communicated\n\nwith both Imperial and officials with the state of Louisiana regarding the operation\n\nof the Pipeline Facilities, but he was unable to obtain any kind of resolution.\n\n      Imperial expressed to Chrisjo and other investors an interest in purchasing\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities to consolidate the ownership and management of the\n\n\n                                          6\n\fCoquille Bay Field and the Pipeline Facilities. Accordingly, Cline testified that\n\nImperial and Chrisjo, along with other owners of the Pipeline Facilities, signed an\n\nagreement setting forth the terms of a stock transfer, allowing the owners to trade\n\ntheir interest in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in exchange for Imperial stock.\n\nThis agreement allowed each party to elect to join the transfer or decline.\n\n      According to Cline and to the documents admitted at trial, on November 30,\n\n2010, Chrisjo signed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) with Imperial, back-\n\ndated to be effective November 1, 2010, giving Chrisjo until December 31, 2010,\n\nto send out questionnaires to all of the investors to obtain their consent to convey\n\nthe 75% interest in the Pipeline Facilities controlled by Chrisjo and its fellow\n\ninvestors, including BTL’s 8.75% interest. Cline testified that Chrisjo sent out the\n\nnecessary information and questionnaires to investors, including BTL. Cline\n\ntestified that all of the investors, including Chrisjo and Mideast Gas Systems,\n\nparticipated in the sale except for BTL. Regarding the transfer of Chrisjo’s and its\n\nother investors’ interests, Cline testified that they transferred “[s]eventy-five\n\npercent minus [BTL’s] interest.” Cline testified that, as far as he was aware, BTL\n\nstill owned its interest in the Pipeline Facilities. He also stated that Chrisjo lost\n\nmoney on the Pipeline Facilities deal and never saw a return on its investment.\n\n      BTL’s attorney asked Cline whether the APA “conveyed” to Imperial a 75%\n\nownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities, which would necessarily have\n\n\n                                          7\n\fincluded BTL’s interest, and Cline testified that the APA was not “a closing\n\ninstrument.” Under the terms of the APA, the closing was to take place on\n\nDecember 31, 2010. Cline testified that Chrisjo and Imperial designated this\n\nclosing date because it “gave [Chrisjo] time to try to get the full 75 percent” and\n\nthat it had a verbal agreement with Imperial that Imperial would consummate the\n\ndeal even if Chrisjo could not get all of the investors to participate. Cline testified\n\nthat Chrisjo never represented to Imperial that it had obtained all of the investors’\n\nconsent to the sale, and Cline stated that he forwarded the questionnaires, including\n\nBTL’s refusal to join, to Imperial “because [Imperial] had to make SEC filings.”\n\nCline also testified that neither he nor Chrisjo ever filed any deed or title\n\ndocuments purporting to transfer BTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities to any\n\nother party.\n\n      Cline also testified that, at the time of trial, the SEC was investigating\n\nImperial for wrongdoing and that the president of Imperial had also been indicted.\n\nChrisjo also presented accounting documents demonstrating that the money\n\ninvested by BTL and other investors was spent in development of the Pipeline\n\nFacilities. Chrisjo also adduced evidence demonstrating that it had properly\n\ndisbursed all transportation fees owing to the owners of the Pipeline Facilities,\n\nincluding BTL.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       BTL did not present any documents at trial demonstrating the amount of\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities actually conveyed at the closing in December\n\n2010 between Chrisjo and Imperial. It did present a document, created by Imperial\n\nand filed by Imperial with the SEC, in which Imperial claimed to have acquired\n\nfrom Chrisjo its investors’ full 75% ownership in the Pipeline Facilities. This SEC\n\nfiling also contained some representations from a press release made by Imperial\n\nthat Imperial had sold its interest in the Coquille Bay Field, including the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, to a third party.\n\n       Tom Elkins testified on behalf of Bacon Tomsons, Ltd. He testified that\n\nBacon Tomsons had invested $70,000 in the Pipeline Facilities and had received\n\nless than $7,000 in return. Elkins testified that “early on” he understood that the\n\ndeal was to obtain an interest in the pipeline and did not include income from the\n\noil and gas production. Elkins testified that Bacon Tomsons did not receive any\n\ndistributions for transportation fees after 2008, and he did not know why the\n\ndistributions stopped. BTL presented evidence that the Coquille Bay Field had\n\nproduced oil and gas after that time, but Elkins also testified that he understood\n\nthat since 2009, “they barge it out of there rather than use[] a pipeline.” Elkins\n\nagreed that Bacon Tomsons was not entitled to any transportation fees under its\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities unless the pipeline was used to move the oil.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      Regarding the sale of the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial, Elkins testified that\n\nBacon Tomsons received the information and questionnaire from Chrisjo and\n\nelected not to participate in the sale. Elkins further testified that the third party\n\npurchaser of the Coquille Bay Field eventually recognized Bacon Tomsons’\n\nownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities and contacted Elkins regarding\n\n“litigation pending on the ownership of the pipeline that he had purchased from\n\nImperial. And he knew that I was one of the—or Bacon Tomsons was one of the\n\nowners.”\n\n      Regarding the ownership of the Pipeline Facilities at the time of trial, Elkins\n\ntestified: “I’m not sure what’s happened. I think they’ve swapped and traded and\n\nmoved and shoved and diluted and—until nobody knows what’s going on\n\nanymore.” Elkins testified that he understood the assignment of interest reflecting\n\nBacon Tomsons’ ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities had been filed in the\n\nPlaquemines Parish property records, that he had not examined the real property\n\nrecords to determine whether any subsequent assignment had been filed\n\ntransferring Bacon Tomsons’ interest to someone else, and that he had not hired a\n\nlandman or title company to perform a title search or otherwise give an opinion\n\nabout who owned the Pipeline Facilities as of the time of trial.\n\n      Larry Porter testified as a representative of BRL Oil and Gas. BRL invested\n\n$17,500 in the Pipeline Facilities after hearing of the opportunity from Elkins.\n\n\n                                         10\n\fPorter testified that BRL received distributions of fee revenue from Chrisjo\n\nthrough 2008, but that the total amount of money generated from the investment\n\nwas small—approximately $1,650. Porter also acknowledged that he would not be\n\nentitled to transportation fees for any oil and gas produced from the Coquille Bay\n\nField unless it was moved through the pipeline. He testified that, at the time BRL\n\nentered into the deal with Chrisjo, he did not consider the possibility that a barge\n\ncould be used to transport the oil and gas produced in the field.\n\n      BRL, like Bacon Tomsons, knew of Imperial’s proposed purchase of the\n\nPipeline Facilities and had elected not to participate. Porter testified that, as of\n\nNovember 2011, he still believed BRL owned an interest in the pipeline. Porter\n\ntestified that at the time of trial he was not sure whether BRL owned an interest in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities, but he could not affirmatively state that BRL did not own it.\n\nPorter had no contact with the third-party purchaser of Imperial’s interest in the\n\nPipeline Facilities and only learned of Imperial’s representations that it owned and\n\nsubsequently sold a 100% ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities as a result of\n\nthe underlying litigation. Porter testified that he had not performed a title search or\n\notherwise examined the property records in Plaquemines Parish to determine the\n\ncurrent ownership of the Pipeline Facilities because there was no oil or gas coming\n\nthrough the pipeline so it was not worth the money to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Ferrell Munson also testified at trial. Munson personally invested $35,000 in\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities and received approximately $3,163.69 in return on his\n\ninvestment. Munson testified at trial that he did not currently own an interest in the\n\nPipeline Facilities because “Mr. Cline sold it.” Munson based his belief that\n\nChrisjo sold his ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities on the language in the\n\nAPA indicating that Chrisjo was transferring to Imperial a 75% ownership interest\n\nin the Pipeline Facilities, which would necessarily have included Munson’s\n\ninterest. However, Munson had no personal knowledge regarding whether\n\nImperial’s purchase of the Pipeline Facilities finally closed under the terms of the\n\nAPA. Like Elkins and Porter, Munson never checked the property records in\n\nPlaquemines Parish to identify the record owners of the Pipeline Facilities at the\n\ntime of trial. Munson did not know whether any oil or gas was being transported\n\nthrough the pipeline at the time of trial.\n\n      Chrisjo moved for a directed verdict on BTL’s claims. The trial court did not\n\nrule on the motion for directed verdict at that time. Chrisjo then presented its own\n\ncase, including the testimony of expert witness Charles Fife, who testified\n\nregarding the nature of the transactions between Chrisjo and its investors and\n\nbetween Chrisjo and Imperial.\n\n      At the close of trial on January 21, 2015, Chrisjo renewed its motion for\n\ndirected verdict and filed a bench brief on limitations, stating that it sought a\n\n\n                                             12\n\fdirected verdict on the basis that all of BTL’s claims against it were barred by the\n\nrespective statutes of limitations. Regarding BTL’s conversion claim, Chrisjo\n\nargued that BTL’s claim had accrued in 2004 when the investors entered into the\n\nPPM, and thus the two-year limitations period had run well in advance of BTL’s\n\nfiling suit in 2012. Regarding the claim of conversion arising out of the 2010\n\ntransfer of its interest in the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial, Chrisjo argued in its\n\nsupplemental bench brief on its motion for directed verdict that\n\n      the parties involved in this transaction [Imperial and Chrisjo]\n      understood that Chrisjo did not yet own 75% of the Pipeline, but was\n      going to attempt to acquire the interest in the next 30 days. This fact is\n      clearly evidenced by the closing date in the Purchase Agreement. Id.\n      at § 1.01. Defendants’ expert, Charles Fife, testified this is common in\n      the oil and gas industry so that the seller can lock the buyer into a\n      fixed price for the maximum interest that is desired to be sold. When\n      the entire interest is not acquired (as in this case), the closing is\n      modified or does not happen. Defendants testified that is what\n      happened here.\n\n      Furthermore, Chrisjo argued that any misrepresentations in the APA were\n\nmade by it to Imperial, not to BTL. And Chrisjo argued that neither the 2010 APA\n\nnor the 2012 SEC filing supported BTL’s claim for conversion against Chrisjo\n\nbecause\n\n      [Cline] testified that Chrisjo and Imperial never closed on the sale of\n      [BTL’s] interest and that [its] interests were never sold. Whether\n      Imperial (who is currently under investigation by the SEC for making\n      fraudulent statements) misrepresented to the SEC that it owned the\n      Coquille Pipeline or not, that alleged misrepresentation did not\n      transfer title away from [BTL]. Indeed, [BTL] remain[s] the current\n      owners of record as nothing has ever been filed in the deed records\n\n                                         13\n\f       transferring [BTL’s] interest to any other party. [BTL] admit[s] that\n       [it has] never performed a title search . . . and [does] not know\n       whether [it] still own[s] [its] interest in the Pipeline.\n\n       On February 11, 2015, Chrisjo filed its post-trial brief in support of its\n\nrequest for a mandatory award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $52,353.95. It\n\nargued that it was a prevailing party because BTL nonsuited claims, including its\n\nDTPA and TTLA claims, to avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits. Chrisjo also\n\nattached evidence supporting its claim for attorney’s fees, including affidavits\n\nregarding attorney’s fees, billing statements, and excerpts from the depositions of\n\nFerrell Munson, Thomas Elkins in his capacity as a representative for Bacon\n\nTomsons, and J. Larry Porter in his capacity as a representative for BRL Oil and\n\nGas.\n\n       In an affidavit attached as evidence to Chrisjo’s brief seeking attorney’s\n\nfees, Chrisjo’s attorney averred that the $52,353.95 amount represented fees\n\nexpended in defending against BTL’s claims for breach of the DTPA and TTLA.\n\nHe stated that, “[t]o the extent possible, [Chrisjo has] properly segregated\n\nrecoverable from non-recoverable fees.” He further averred that all of the claims—\n\nincluding those for violation of the TTLA and DTPA, conversion, and fraud—all\n\ninvolved the same operative facts and shared common elements, stating,\n\n       As such, those discrete legal services that advance both recoverable\n       and non-recoverable claims are so intertwined that they cannot be\n       segregated. Similarly, to the extent services were rendered that were\n       necessary for all claims (e.g., requests for disclosures, proof of facts,\n\n                                          14\n\f      depositions of primary actors, and motions for summary judgment),\n      those services have been properly included as they are not disallowed\n      simply because they do double service.\n\n      The billing statements attached as evidence supporting Chrisjo’s claim for\n\nattorney’s fees included itemized billing showing the initials of the person\n\nperforming a particular service, a brief description of the service, the time spent,\n\nthe hourly rate, and the amount billed. These bills were redacted to protect\n\nconfidential information, and they also reflected that Chrisjo had deleted numerous\n\ndiscrete legal services that, according to the attorney’s affidavit, were not\n\napplicable to the recoverable claims. Chrisjo did not present any evidence of the\n\ntotal amount of attorney’s fees it incurred in defending against BTL’s suit.\n\n      On February 24, 2015, the trial court signed a post-answer default judgment\n\nawarding BTL damages from Imperial.\n\n      On March 4, 2015, the trial court denied Chrisjo leave to file its supplement\n\nto its second amended answer—the pleading which sought to add a claim for\n\nattorney’s fees under the DTPA. The trial court ordered the supplemental answer\n\nstricken, leaving Chrisjo’s claim for attorney’s fees under the TTLA as its only\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees.\n\n      Also on March 4, 2015, the trial court signed its “Order Granting [Chrisjo’s]\n\nMotion for Directed Verdict.” It stated,\n\n      It appears to the Court, having considered all the evidence and\n      subsequent briefing in the case, and the reasonable inferences flowing\n\n                                           15\n\f      from it, in the light most favorable to [BTL], that the evidence is\n      insufficient as a matter of law to entitle [BTL] to recover against\n      [Chrisjo], and the Court is of the opinion that judgment should be\n      rendered in favor of [Chrisjo] as a matter of law.\n\nIt ordered that BTL “take nothing by this action” against Chrisjo. This order did\n\nnot address Chrisjo’s claims for attorney’s fees under the TTLA, and it did not\n\npurport to be a final judgment.\n\n      On March 18, 2015, Chrisjo moved for entry of an award of attorney’s fees\n\nand for entry of final judgment in light of the order on its motion for directed\n\nverdict. The trial court held a hearing on that motion, in which BTL argued that no\n\nfurther rulings were necessary because the March 4 order disposed of all remaining\n\nissues.\n\n      On July 8, 2015, the trial court signed an order awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nChrisjo in the amount of $24,829.42 based on its finding that Chrisjo was a\n\nprevailing party under the TTLA because BTL “nonsuited [its] Theft Act claims to\n\navoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.” The trial court also awarded\n\nconditional attorney’s fees in the event of a subsequent appeal.\n\n      Also on July 8, 2015, Chrisjo filed an amended motion for entry of final\n\njudgment, and the trial court set a hearing to occur on August 5, 2015. On August\n\n5, 2015, BTL filed objections and a response to Chrisjo’s motion for entry of a\n\nfinal judgment again arguing, in part, that the March 4 order disposed of all\n\npending claims.\n\n                                         16\n\f      On August 7, 2015, the trial court signed its final judgment, incorporating\n\nthe post-answer default judgment against Imperial, the order granting a directed\n\nverdict in favor of Chrisjo, and its ruling on Chrisjo’s claim for attorney’s fees\n\nunder the TTLA.\n\n      On August 11, 2015, BTL requested that the trial court file findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law, which the trial court never signed.\n\n      This appeal followed. BTL does not challenge the trial court’s ruling on any\n\nof its causes of action except for its conversion claim against Chrisjo. BTL also\n\nchallenges the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to Chrisjo as a prevailing party\n\nunder the TTLA.\n\n                     Directed Verdict on Conversion Claim\n\n      In its fourth issue, BTL argues that the trial court erred in ruling that its\n\nconversion claim was barred by limitations. We construe this as a complaint that\n\nthe trial court erred in granting Chrisjo’s motion for directed verdict on BTL’s\n\nconversion claim.\n\nA.

Analysis\n\n      Although Chrisjo stated that its motion for directed verdict was based on\n\narguments that all of BTL’s claims were barred by the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations, its motion also addressed the sufficiency of BTL’s evidence on its\n\nconversion claim. It is unclear from BTL’s pleadings and evidence at trial whether\n\nits conversion claim was based on an alleged conversion of BTL’s money invested\n\nin the Pipeline Facilities, conversion of BTL’s ownership interest in the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, or conversion of the transportation fees that owners of the Pipeline\n\nFacilities were entitled to collect. Assuming without deciding that these property\n\ninterests are property that can be converted, we agree with Chrisjo that BTL failed\n\nto provide any evidence of conversion.\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      Chrisjo argued that the only evidence presented by BTL to support the\n\nconversion claim is insufficient because it did not demonstrate that BTL’s property\n\nwas ever actually transferred to Imperial or that Chrisjo otherwise assumed and\n\nexercised dominion and control over the property in an unlawful and unauthorized\n\nmanner. Chrisjo also argued that BTL failed to provide any evidence, in the form\n\nof a title search or other investigation of the real property records, identifying the\n\nrecord owners of the Pipeline Facilities at the time of trial. The trial court granted\n\nthe motion for directed verdict, stating that it had considered all of the evidence\n\nand briefing in the case and that it had determined “that the evidence is insufficient\n\nas a matter of law.”\n\n      At trial, BTL presented no evidence that Chrisjo had assumed and exercised\n\ndominion and control over the money invested in the Pipeline Facilities, its interest\n\nin the Pipeline Facilities, or the transportation fees owing to it as owners of the\n\nPipeline Facilities in an unlawful and unauthorized manner, to the exclusion of and\n\ninconsistent with BTL’s rights. See Alan Reuber Chevrolet, 287 S.W.3d at 888\n\n(setting out elements of conversion). BTL presented no evidence that the money it\n\ninvested in the Pipeline Facilities was misused, and it provided no evidence\n\nrebutting Chrisjo’s evidence accounting for all of the funds that were invested in\n\nthe project. In fact, BTL representatives testified that, as far as they were aware,\n\nthey still owned an interest in the Pipeline Facilities at the time of trial, and they\n\n\n                                         21\n\facknowledged that they never performed a title search or other examination of the\n\nreal property records to determine whether their ownership interest had ever been\n\ntransferred to Imperial. Elkins, Porter, and Munson each testified that they were\n\naware at or near the time of their 2004 investment that they were receiving only an\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities; that they in fact received the only disbursements\n\nof fees that they were entitled to under the terms of their assignment of interests;\n\nand that, as far as they were aware, they still remained the record owners of their\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities even though the Coquille Bay Field operators had\n\nceased using the pipeline in 2008. Elkins, Porter, and Munson all testified that they\n\nreceived disbursements of transportation fees through 2008. Elkins testified that he\n\nwas aware that, after 2008, the Coquille Bay Field operator had been using barges\n\nrather than the pipeline to move the oil and gas, and he agreed that the owners of\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities were not entitled to transportation fees unless the operator\n\nused the pipeline.\n\n      Although the 2010 APA states that Chrisjo offered Imperial a 75%\n\nownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities, this document was not a title\n\ninstrument and did not serve to actually transfer any rights to the Pipeline\n\nFacilities, and thus, necessarily, Chrisjo did not misappropriate any funds or fees\n\nrelated to the Pipeline Facilities. The agreements between Chrisjo and Imperial\n\nallowed for each investor to consider the terms of the offer and elect whether it\n\n\n                                         22\n\fwanted to participate in the transaction. Cline testified that when BTL refused to\n\nparticipate in the sale, under the terms of the APA the remaining owners\n\ntransferred their interests in the Pipeline Facilities and left BTL’s interests\n\nundisturbed. Cline stated that Chrisjo never filed any documents transferring\n\nBTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities. BTL presented no evidence contradicting\n\nthis testimony, nor did it present any evidence establishing that Chrisjo actually\n\ntransferred its ownership interest. Furthermore, any representations by Imperial in\n\nits SEC filing that it owned a 100% ownership interest in the Pipeline Facilities are\n\nirrelevant to BTL’s conversion claim against Chrisjo. Because BTL failed to\n\npresent any evidence raising a fact issue regarding whether Chrisjo had assumed\n\nand exercised dominion and control over any personal property of BTL’s in an\n\nunlawful and unauthorized manner, to the exclusion of and inconsistent with\n\nBTL’s rights, the trial court’s directed verdict on the conversion claim was proper.\n\nSee Prudential Ins. Co., 29 S.W.3d at 77; see also Exxon Corp., 82 S.W.3d at 443\n\n(holding that we may affirm directed verdict on any ground that supports it).\n\n      We overrule BTL’s fourth issue on appeal.\n\n         Jurisdiction of Trial Court to Enter August 7, 2015 Judgment\n\n      In its first issue, BTL argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to render\n\nits July 8, 2015 order awarding attorney’s fees to Chrisjo and its August 7, 2015\n\nfinal judgment because its plenary power had expired. BTL argues that the trial\n\n\n                                          23\n\fcourt’s March 4, 2015 order granting Chrisjo’s motion for directed verdict was\n\n“presumed final despite the pending request for attorneys’ fees as sanctions made\n\nin [Chrisjo’s] post-trial brief filed before the judgment was signed.”\n\nA.

Analysis\n\n      Here, Chrisjo’s request for attorney’s fees was not, as BTL suggests, based\n\non a motion for sanctions. BTL pleaded a cause of action for violations of the\n\nTTLA, and Chrisjo filed an answer denying the claim and asserting a claim for\n\nattorney’s fees pursuant to the TTLA. On the day of trial, prior to presenting its\n\ncase-in-chief, BTL nonsuited its TTLA claim, and Chrisjo argued at trial and in a\n\npost-trial motion and briefing that it was entitled to “prevailing party” attorney’s\n\nfees because BTL had nonsuited the TTLA claim to avoid an unfavorable ruling on\n\nthe merits. At the beginning and close of evidence at trial, the parties agreed on the\n\n\n                                           26\n\frecord that they would submit evidence and briefing on the issue of attorney’s fees\n\nto the trial court post-trial. Thus, at the time BTL non-suited its TTLA claim,\n\nChrisjo had a pending claim for attorney’s fees. See Villafani, 251 S.W.3d at 469.\n\n      BTL argues that Chrisjo’s pending “request for sanctions” was not a claim\n\nfor affirmative relief that was independent of BTL’s nonsuited claim; however,\n\nTexas courts have held that “[a]n affirmative claim, stated in an answer, for\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees for preparation and prosecution of a defense constitutes\n\na counterclaim.” In re C.A.S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2003235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2003235/in-re-cas/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 686 (Tex.

We conclude that Chrisjo’s\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees here was a claim for affirmative relief that was not\n\ndisturbed by BTL’s nonsuit.\n\n      BTL also argues that even if the request for attorney’s fees was an\n\nindependent claim for affirmative relief, the March 4 order was still final under the\n\nAldridge presumption. See Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d at 898 (holding that judgments\n\nrendered after conventional trial on merits carry presumption of finality). However,\n\nthe record here rebuts any presumption of finality. See, e.g., Vaughn, 324 S.W.3d\n\nat 563 (stating that presumption of finality applies “unless a trial court orders a\n\nseparate trial to resolve a specific issue”); Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d at 898 (presuming\n\njudgment following setting for trial on merits is final “in the absence of a contrary\n\nshowing in the record”).\n\n      The trial court’s March 4 order does not purport to be a judgment—much\n\nless a final judgment—and it does not contain any language demonstrating that it\n\nwas intended to be final: it does not state that it is a final judgment or intended to\n\nbe appealable; it does not incorporate the trial court’s previous post-answer default\n\njudgment against Imperial Petroleum; and it does not contain a “Mother Hubbard”\n\n\n                                         28\n\fclause disposing of claims not specifically mentioned. Rather, the March 4 order is\n\nstyled as an “Order Granting Defendant’s Motion for Directed Verdict,” and the\n\nlanguage of the order granted Chrisjo’s motion for directed verdict and disposed\n\nonly of the issues addressed in that motion. It does not address or dispose of\n\nChrisjo’s pending claim for attorney’s fees or award costs. Accordingly, it was not\n\nfinal. See Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 868 (holding that nonsuit does not affect any\n\npending claim for affirmative relief or motion for attorney’s fees or sanctions);\n\nLehmann, 39 S.W.3d at 192–93 (holding that judgment is final for purposes of\n\nappeal “if and only if either it . . . actually disposes of all claims and parties then\n\nbefore the court, regardless of its language, or it states with unmistakable clarity\n\nthat it is a final judgment as to all claims and all parties”).2 The trial court\n\ncontinued to accept briefing from the parties and enter orders until it rendered its\n\nAugust 7, 2015 judgment, entitled “Final Judgment,” that incorporated all of its\n\nprevious rulings and finally disposed of all of the claims of all of the parties.\n\n      We conclude that the March 4 order was not a final judgment.

Prevailing Party\n\n      In its second issue, BTL argues that the trial court erred in awarding Chrisjo\n\nattorney’s fees because Chrisjo was not a prevailing party under the TTLA.\n\nSpecifically, it argues that it nonsuited its TTLA claim without prejudice and that\n\nthe evidence was legally and factually insufficient to establish that it nonsuited to\n\navoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits. Chrisjo argues that the timing of the\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fnonsuit and the evidence adduced at trial support a conclusion that BTL nonsuited\n\nits TTLA claim to avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.\n\n      Here, the trial court found that BTL took the nonsuit to avoid an unfavorable\n\nruling on the merits. The record indicates that BTL filed its TTLA claim in March\n\n2012 and nonsuited it at trial in January 2015, thereby requiring Chrisjo to expend\n\neffort and attorney’s fees in defending against that claim for nearly three years.\n\nBTL took its nonsuit on the day the bench trial began, but it did not nonsuit its\n\nrelated claim for conversion, which does not allow for the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees. When Chrisjo reminded the trial court that it still had pending claims for\n\nattorney’s fees under the DTPA as well, BTL nonsuited its DTPA claim, but did\n\nnot nonsuit its related fraud claims, which did not allow for the recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees. BTL provided no explanation for its decision to nonsuit the TTLA\n\nand DTPA claims but not the related conversion and fraud claims.\n\n      Furthermore, the evidence at trial demonstrated that BTL failed to procure\n\nevidence   that   would   have   demonstrated    whether       Chrisjo   misused   or\n\nmisappropriated any funds or other property interests. The TTLA “permits a civil\n\ncause of action for damages against a party who commits theft via any of the\n\nnumerous methods defined under the Texas Penal Code.” Cluck v. Mecom, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied); see TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 134.003 (“A person who commits theft is liable\n\n\n                                        33\n\ffor the damages resulting from the theft.”); id. § 134.002(2) (defining “theft” as\n\nunlawful appropriation of property or unlawfully obtaining services as defined in\n\nTexas Penal Code chapter 31).\n\n      As with BTL’s claim for conversion, neither the pleadings nor the evidence\n\nclearly states whether BTL’s theft claim was based on Chrisjo’s alleged theft of\n\nBTL’s money invested in the Pipeline Facilities, theft of the transportation fees, or\n\ntheft of some other interest in the Pipeline Facilities. Assuming, without deciding,\n\nthat these complaints can properly form the basis of a TTLA claim, BTL failed to\n\nobtain any of the evidence necessary to support its claim that Chrisjo committed\n\ntheft of BTL’s funds or other interest in the Pipeline Facilities. According to\n\nCline’s testimony and other evidence adduced by Chrisjo, the money invested by\n\nBTL was used according to its agreed purpose in developing the Pipeline Facilities\n\nand Chrisjo properly recorded BTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities in the\n\nPlaquemines Parish property records. Chrisjo also presented evidence that all\n\ntransportation fees were properly dispersed and that no documents that transferred\n\nBTL’s interest in the Pipeline Facilities were ever executed or recorded. BTL\n\noffered no explanation for this failure to obtain actual proof of the ownership of the\n\nPipeline Facilities, other than Munson’s testimony that he did not believe hiring a\n\ntitle company was worth the money. None of the BTL representatives explained\n\nwhy they were unable to review the property records themselves. Thus, the record\n\n\n                                         34\n\fcontains evidence of BTL’s unexcused failure to complete discovery of evidence\n\nthat could support entry of an adverse judgment—i.e., evidence from the property\n\nrecords demonstrating that BTL still owned property that was the subject of its\n\ntheft claim. See Epps, 351 S.W.3d at 871. Accordingly, the timing of the nonsuit\n\nand other inferences drawn from the course of events in the lawsuit support the\n\ntrial court’s finding. See id. at 870.\n\n       BTL also argues that Chrisjo failed to establish that the TTLA claim was\n\nmeritless when filed and, thus, did not establish that BTL nonsuited to avoid an\n\nunfavorable ruling on the merits. BTL relies on the fact that its claim survived\n\nChrisjo’s motion for summary judgment on limitations grounds. However, BTL’s\n\nargument that its TTLA claim was not time barred is not the equivalent of evidence\n\nthat its suit was “not without merit when filed” but was subsequently revealed to\n\nhave unknown flaws. See id. at 871. BTL presented no evidence or argument\n\ndemonstrating that it conducted appropriate discovery of the TTLA claim that\n\nrevealed flaws in its suit. On the contrary, the evidence in the record demonstrates\n\nthat BTL’s TTLA claim against Chrisjo was meritless and that BTL had in its\n\npossession—prior to its filing of suit—the information it needed to determine that\n\nChrisjo did not commit theft.\n\n       BTL asserted that Chrisjo committed civil theft or conversion by misusing\n\nits investment in the Pipeline Facilities and by selling its interest in the Pipeline\n\n\n                                         35\n\fFacilities to Imperial, but BTL presented no evidence that such misuse or improper\n\nsale ever occurred. Elkins, Porter, and Munson each testified that they were aware\n\nat or near the time of their 2004 investment that they were receiving only an\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities; that they in fact received the only disbursements\n\nof fees that they were entitled to under the terms of their assignment of interests;\n\nand that, as far as they were aware, they still remained the record owners of their\n\ninterest in the Pipeline Facilities even though the Coquille Bay Field operators had\n\nceased using the pipeline in 2008. Elkins, Porter, and Munson all testified that they\n\nreceived disbursements of transportation fees through 2008. Elkins testified that he\n\nwas aware that since 2008 the Coquille Bay Field operator had been using barges\n\nrather than the pipeline to move the oil and gas, and he agreed that the owners of\n\nthe Pipeline Facilities were not entitled to transportation fees unless the operator\n\nused the pipeline facilities. As discussed above, BTL presented no evidence to\n\nsupport its conversion claim against Chrisjo, and it does not challenge the trial\n\ncourt’s take-nothing judgment on all of its remaining claims.\n\n       Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nconcluding that Chrisjo was a prevailing party under the TTLA. See Referente, 477\n\nS.W.3d at 885–86.\n\n      We overrule BTL’s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\fC.    Segregation of Fees\n\n      In its third issue, BTL argues, in the alternative, that Chrisjo did not properly\n\nsegregate its attorney’s fees for defending against the TTLA claim.\n\n      A prevailing party entitled to attorney’s fees is required to “segregate fees\n\nbetween claims for which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.”\n\nTony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.

When it submitted its evidence on attorney’s\n\nfees to the trial court, Chrisjo was seeking attorney’s fees under both the DTPA\n\nand the TTLA. Chrisjo submitted billing statements that showed only certain\n\ndiscrete legal services were included in its calculation of recoverable attorney’s\n\nfees. Its attorney presented an affidavit in which he averred that, “[t]o the extent\n\npossible, [Chrisjo has] properly segregated recoverable from non-recoverable fees”\n\nand that Chrisjo’s defense against the TTLA and DTPA claims involved the same\n\noperative facts and essentially identical analysis as its defense against the related\n\nconversion and fraud claims.\n\n      Chrisjo disagrees with BTL’s argument that its TTLA claim was “based\n\nentirely on the sale of the Pipeline Facilities to Imperial in November 2010,” and\n\nthus none of Chrisjo’s attorney’s fees incurred in addressing any theft allegations\n\narising out the original 2004 investment were proper. We agree with Chrisjo that\n\nBTL’s pleadings and the other record evidence indicate that BTL accused Chrisjo\n\ngenerally of theft and conversion, among other causes of action, relating to\n\nChrisjo’s conduct beginning in 2004 and continuing until 2010.\n\n\n                                         38\n\f      BTL further complains that Chrisjo could not reasonably claim that discrete\n\nlegal services contained in the attorney’s fees calculation were all necessary to\n\naddress the TTLA claim. Chrisjo stated that “those discrete legal services that\n\nadvance both recoverable and non-recoverable claims are so intertwined that they\n\ncannot be segregated” and that those identified legal services “were necessary for\n\nall claims (e.g., requests for disclosures, proof of facts, depositions of primary\n\nactors, and motions for summary judgment),” and so were included in its request\n\nfor fees because “they are not disallowed simply because they do double service.”\n\nSee Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313 (“Requests for standard disclosures, proof of\n\nbackground facts, depositions of the primary actors, discovery motions and\n\nhearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services may be necessary\n\nwhether a claim is filed alone or with others. To the extent such services would\n\nhave been incurred on a recoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply\n\nbecause they do double service.”). However, the court in Chapa stated that while\n\nattorneys do not “have to keep separate time records” when they draft petitions or\n\nprovide other services that advance both recoverable and nonrecoverable claims, it\n\nis still appropriate to provide “an opinion . . . that, for example, 95 percent of their\n\ndrafting time would have been necessary even if there had been no\n\n[nonrecoverable] claim.” Id. at 314. Chrisjo provided no such evidence regarding\n\nthe percentage of its attorney’s work that would have been necessary for certain\n\n\n                                          39\n\fdiscrete legal services even if no nonrecoverable claims had been advanced,\n\narguing instead that all of those remaining services would have been necessary to\n\naddress the recoverable claims.\n\n      However, BTL’s argument that Chrisjo failed to identify the percentage of\n\nthose discrete legal services that were attributable solely to the TTLA claim\n\nignores the role of the trial court as a fact finder here and the standard of review for\n\nevaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence. See id. (“But when, as here, it cannot\n\nbe denied that at least some of the attorney’s fees are attributable only to claims for\n\nwhich fees are not recoverable, segregation of fees ought to be required and the\n\njury ought to decide the rest.”); Kim, 320 S.W.3d at 374 (holding that extent to\n\nwhich claims can or cannot be segregated is mixed question of law and fact); see\n\nalso El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763–64 (holding that evidence is sufficient to support\n\namount of attorney’s fees awarded when claimant presented evidence of services\n\nperformed, who performed them and at what hourly rate, when they were\n\npreformed, and how much time work required). The appropriate question here is\n\nwhether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court’s award of\n\n$24,829.42 as TTLA attorney’s fees.\n\n      Chrisjo did segregate its attorney’s fees by eliminating from its claim the\n\nfees attributable to services rendered on nonrecoverable claims, and it sought\n\n$52,353.95, based on its attorney’s affidavit that the remaining services were\n\n\n                                          40\n\fessentially all necessary to defend against the TTLA and DTPA claims. The trial\n\ncourt considered this evidence—including detailed, itemized billing statements that\n\nset out the exact tasks performed, the people who performed the tasks and their\n\nhourly rates, and the amount of time involved—and, after determining that Chrisjo\n\nwas not entitled to any fees under the DTPA because of the stricken supplemental\n\npleading, awarded Chrisjo less than half of the fees its sought, or $24,829.42. Thus,\n\nthe trial court impliedly found not credible the attorney’s testimony that “those\n\ndiscrete legal services that advance both recoverable and non-recoverable claims\n\nare so intertwined that they cannot be segregated,” and awarded less than the full\n\nrequested amount of fees.
