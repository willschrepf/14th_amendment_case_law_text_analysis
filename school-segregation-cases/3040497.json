JONES, Chief Justice\n        This case involves a second set of appeals arising from an action challenging the bidding\nprocess for the Idaho Education Network (“IEN”). Syringa Networks, LLC, sued Qwest\nCommunications, LLC, ENA Services, LLC, and the Idaho Department of Administration\n(“DOA”) and certain DOA employees, alleging injury arising from contract awards and\namendments that DOA issued to Qwest and ENA related to the IEN. The district court dismissed\nall of Syringa’s claims. On appeal we held that Syringa had standing to pursue Count Three,\nwhich alleged that DOA violated Idaho Code section 67-5718A. Count Three was remanded to\nthe district court for further proceedings.\n        On remand, the district court entered partial summary judgment for Syringa on Count\nThree, holding that the amendments and the underlying contracts were void for violating state\nprocurement law. The district court denied Syringa’s motion to order DOA to demand repayment\nof money advanced under the void contracts. The district court also awarded Syringa attorney\nfees.\n        Syringa, Qwest, ENA, and DOA each timely appealed. Syringa appeals the district\ncourt’s denial of its request to order DOA to demand repayment from Qwest and ENA. The other\nparties appeal the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment to Syringa, arguing that the\ndistrict court’s conclusions were procedurally improper and substantively incorrect for a variety\nof reasons. DOA also challenges the district court’s award of attorney fees to Syringa. Syringa,\nENA, and DOA request attorney fees on appeal.\n                                        I.\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n        The IEN was to be “a high-bandwidth telecommunications distribution system for\ndistance learning” in public schools, libraries, and state agencies. Syringa Networks, LLC v.\nIdaho Dep’t of Admin., 155 Idaho 55, 58, 305 P.3d 499, 502 (2013) [hereinafter “Syringa I”].\nDOA     was    given    administrative    oversight   of   the   IEN,   including   “[p]rocur[ing]\ntelecommunications services and equipment for the IEN through an open and competitive\nbidding process.” Id. (citing I.C. § 67-5745D(5)(h) (subsection repealed 2010)). In 2008, DOA\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fissued a request for proposals (“RFP”) for work on the IEN, seeking only comprehensive, end-\nto-end bids. Syringa could not provide end-to-end services so it agreed to be a subcontractor on\nthe bid submitted by ENA. In January 2009, DOA issued substantially identical Statewide\nBlanket Purchase Orders (“SBPOs”) to Qwest and ENA as a “multiple award” under Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A. In February 2009, DOA unilaterally amended both SBPOs to assign some\nportions of the IEN work exclusively to ENA and other portions exclusively to Qwest. Under the\namendments, Qwest was to provide all IEN technical network services and ENA was to be the\nservice provider listed on the State’s federal E-Rate form. The amendments assigned to Qwest all\nof the work that Syringa had planned to do as ENA’s subcontractor.\n       Syringa brought suit against Qwest, ENA, DOA, and certain DOA employees. Syringa\nalleged that DOA violated Idaho Code section 67-5718A, a multiple award procurement statute,\nwhen it amended Qwest’s SBPO. Among other claims, Syringa also alleged breach of contract\nagainst ENA. The district court dismissed all of Syringa’s claims. On appeal in Syringa I, we\nreinstated Count Three of Syringa’s original complaint, regarding DOA’s alleged violation of the\nmultiple award procurement statute. Id. at 60–62, 305 P.3d at 504–506.\n       In Syringa I, after reviewing the facts alleged, we vacated the district court’s summary\njudgment holding that Syringa had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and held that\nSyringa had standing to bring Count Three “when the amendments to the contracts are viewed in\nthe context of the entire bidding process.” Id. at 61, 305 P.3d at 505. We then concluded that\n“Syringa has alleged a distinct and palpable injury . . . that is alleged to have been caused by the\nchallenged conduct and that can be redressed by judicial relief.” Id. at 62, 305 P.3d at 506. We\nremanded Count Three for further proceedings. Id. at 68, 305 P.3d at 512.\n       On remand, the district court permitted Syringa to amend its claim in Count Three: (1) to\nadd specific references to Idaho Code section 67-5718, the statute this Court considered in\nSyringa I; (2) to make a specific reference to the amended awards to Qwest and ENA; and (3) to\nseek a ruling that the awards are void as a matter of law. On reconsideration, the district court\nvacated its prior ruling to the extent that it had granted “leave for Syringa to challenge the\noriginal SBPOs.” The court found that Syringa had previously conceded that the original SBPOs\nwere lawful, and it concluded that judicial estoppel precluded Syringa from subsequently\nchallenging them.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f        The district court found that ENA and Qwest were necessary parties, although it also\nfound that ENA was no longer a party on remand because all claims against it in the original\ncomplaint had been fully resolved. The court further concluded that ENA must be made a party\nand that Qwest remained a party. The court ordered Syringa to serve ENA with an amended\npleading, which Syringa did.\n        Syringa filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a determination that the\nSBPOs were void. ENA filed a motion to dismiss in which it argued the court lacked jurisdiction\nover it. DOA also filed a motion for summary judgment in which Qwest joined, arguing that the\ncase was moot because DOA, Qwest, and ENA had rescinded the SBPO amendments. Following\nbriefing, the district court took up these motions on October 10, 2014. The court treated ENA’s\nmotion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment because it concluded that the motion\ninvolved consideration of matters outside the pleadings. After determining that all necessary\nparties had been joined and the court had jurisdiction, and despite its prior holding that Syringa\nwas estopped from challenging the original SBPOs, the district court nonetheless ultimately\nconcluded that the SBPOs, as amended, were void. In granting partial summary judgment to\nSyringa, the district court relied on the law of the case doctrine and the doctrine that Idaho courts\nhave an affirmative duty to raise the issue of contract illegality regardless of whether any party\nhad pled the issue. The district court held that our statements in Syringa I that DOA violated state\nprocurement law were the law of the case and were binding upon the parties and the district\ncourt. Referring to its perceived duty to raise the issue of illegality, the district court held that it\nmay not ignore the issue or countenance the continuation of contracts that resulted from violation\nof state procurement law. The court also found that because the SBPOs were void, DOA’s\nattempt to moot the case by rescinding the amendments was futile. The court rejected ENA’s\narguments that res judicata or judicial estoppel precluded a holding that the SBPOs are void.\n        The district court later denied, both initially and on reconsideration, Syringa’s request for\nan order requiring DOA to seek repayment of monies advanced under the SBPOs. Syringa\nsought and the district court awarded Syringa attorney fees totaling over $930,000, under Idaho\nCode sections 12-117, 12-120(3), and 12-121. The parties timely appealed.\n        On appeal here, ENA argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over ENA after\nremand and that Syringa’s challenge to ENA’s SBPO was precluded by res judicata and judicial\nestoppel. ENA also argues that the district court erred in treating ENA’s motion to dismiss as a\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fmotion for summary judgment. DOA and Qwest argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction\nto grant Syringa’s requested relief. DOA, Qwest, and ENA all argue that the district court erred\nin concluding that the SBPOs, as amended, are void. Syringa argues that the district court erred\nby not ordering DOA to demand repayment of monies advanced under the void SBPOs. DOA\nargues that the district court erred by granting attorney fees and costs to Syringa on remand.\nSyringa, ENA, and DOA each request attorney fees on appeal.\n                                          II.\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n1. Whether the district court’s holding that the ENA and Qwest SBPOs were void was\n   procedurally proper.\n\n2. Whether the district court’s holding that the ENA and Qwest SBPOs were void was\n   substantively correct.\n\n3. Whether the district court erred or abused its discretion in denying Syringa’s motion to order\n   DOA to demand repayment of money advanced under the SBPOs.\n\n4. Whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Syringa.\n\n5. Whether Syringa, ENA, or DOA are entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n                                          III.\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       The issues raised on appeal have a variety of standards of review. Accordingly, the\napplicable standard of review is discussed within the analysis for each issue.\n                                              IV.\n                                           ANALYSIS\nA. The district court’s order concluding that the ENA and Qwest SBPOs were void was\n   procedurally proper.\n       DOA, ENA, and Qwest assert that, for a variety of reasons, the district court’s order\nvoiding the SBPOs was not procedurally proper. ENA argues that the district court lacked\njurisdiction over ENA on remand and that the district court erred in treating ENA’s motion to\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Qwest likewise argues the district court lacked\njurisdiction over it on remand. DOA and Qwest argue that the case became moot after DOA\nrescinded the amendments. DOA argues that the district court erred in holding that it had an\nindependent duty to invalidate illegal contracts, and ENA similarly argues that the district court’s\nduty to address the validity of a contract does not take priority over the law of the case or basic\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fjurisdictional principles. Finally, DOA and Qwest argue that the district court erred in permitting\nSyringa to challenge the SBPOs after having accepted benefits from them.1 ENA similarly\nargues that Syringa must be judicially estopped from challenging the SBPOs because it\npreviously conceded their lawfulness. None of these arguments have merit.\n        1. The district court had jurisdiction over ENA and Qwest on remand.\n        ENA and Qwest both argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction to void their\nrespective SBPOs on remand for two reasons. First, each argues that it was no longer party to the\naction after the dismissals of the claims “directly” against them were affirmed in Syringa I.\nSecond, each argues that it was impermissible for Syringa to amend Count Three on remand to\nadd ENA as a party and to challenge the original SBPOs, when the original challenge was only\nto the Qwest SBPO.2\n        Count Three of Syringa’s pre-appeal complaint alleged that DOA violated Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A by unlawfully granting a multiple award to Qwest and ENA when it should\nhave granted a single award to ENA.3 The complaint challenged the Qwest purchase order but\ndid not purport to challenge the ENA purchase order.4 DOA contends that Syringa’s litigation\nstrategy was to void Qwest’s SBPO but preserve ENA’s SBPO so that ENA would be the only\nremaining contract awardee, and Syringa would then perform a large portion of the contract\nwork as ENA’s subcontractor. On remand, Syringa moved to amend Count Three to allege a\nviolation of Idaho Code section 67-5718 in addition to the already-alleged violation of section\n67-5718A and to challenge ENA’s SBPO and amendment in addition to the already-challenged\nQwest SBPO and amendment. The district court granted Syringa’s motion to amend.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  DOA also asserts in its reply brief that allowing Syringa to challenge the original SBPOs would be “absurd and\nincongruous” because Syringa was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies with respect to the original\nSBPOs. However, this argument was not raised in DOA’s opening brief and, therefore, will not be considered.\nPatterson v. State Dep’t of Health and Welfare, 151 Idaho 310, 321, 256 P.3d 718, 729 (2011).\n2\n  The plain language of the original complaint appears to challenge the Qwest SBPO, not just the amendment.\nHowever, in the prior appeal Syringa apparently conceded that the SBPOs were lawful and focused its challenge on\nthe Qwest amendment.\n3\n  Syringa and ENA purported to enter a teaming agreement through which they would fulfill the ENA purchase\norder together, but this Court found the agreement unenforceable for failure to state the material term of price.\nSyringa I, 155 Idaho at 62–64, 305 P.3d at 506–508.\n4\n  Paragraph 94 of the complaint states: “Syringa seeks a declaratory judgment against the DOA, Division of\nPurchasing declaring its award of the IEN Purchase Order to Qwest void, null, and of no effect pursuant to Idaho\nCode § 67-5725 and/or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the State and Qwest from performing under the lEN\nPurchase Order.”\n\n\n                                                       7\n\f       The district court later vacated this ruling to the extent that it had permitted Syringa to\nchallenge the original SBPOs, holding that judicial estoppel precluded Syringa from asserting\nthat the original SBPOs were illegal after having previously conceded that they were lawful. At\nthe same time, the district court found that ENA and Qwest were necessary parties, but that ENA\nwas no longer a party because each claim against ENA in the original complaint had been fully\nresolved. The district court found, however, that ENA must be made a party. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court directed Syringa to amend its complaint again and serve the amended pleading on\nDOA, Qwest, and ENA. Syringa complied. Ultimately, after finding that all necessary parties\nhad been joined and that it had jurisdiction, the district court concluded that the SBPOs, as\namended, were void. Accordingly, the judge granted Syringa partial summary judgment.\n       The parties cite Idaho Code section 10-1211, part of the Idaho Uniform Declaratory\nJudgment Act, which provides in relevant part that “[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all\npersons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the\ndeclaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the\nproceeding.” Qwest asserts that Syringa’s failure to name Qwest and ENA as defendants in\nCount Three meant that after all the claims “against” Qwest and ENA had been dismissed and,\nwith those dismissals affirmed in Syringa I, no additional claims could be brought against Qwest\nor ENA on remand. DOA interprets section 10-1211 as apparently requiring that each claim be\nasserted against each defendant in order to provide sufficient notice to the defendants.\n       ENA asserts that it was not a party to Count Three and that when the Supreme Court\naffirmed the dismissal of the counts to which it was a party, it was entitled to enjoy the benefits\nof a final adjudication on the merits and it was no longer subject to the district court’s\njurisdiction. ENA insists that it was fully and finally dismissed from the case. Qwest advances\nthe same argument. Qwest also argues that as parties to the contracts that Syringa sought to void,\nQwest and ENA were necessary and indispensable parties to the claims Syringa sought to add in\nCount Three.\n       “Jurisdiction is . . . a question of law and is reviewed de novo.” State v. Lute, 150 Idaho\n837, 839, 252 P.3d 1255, 1257 (2011).\n       The arguments DOA, ENA, and Qwest raise are without merit. The fact that neither ENA\nnor Qwest was named as a defendant in Count Three is irrelevant. Neither party could have or\nshould have been a named defendant in Count Three because the cause of action alleged a breach\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fof a public duty by DOA, the governmental entity subject to the procurement statutes at issue.\nNeither ENA nor Qwest had or could have had any duty to comply with the statute because they\nare not governmental entities. Accordingly, there could be no claim “against” them under Count\nThree. Syringa did not need to name them within Count Three for jurisdiction to be proper. Both\nENA and Qwest were, however, interested and necessary parties under Idaho Code section 10-\n1211. There is no dispute that Syringa’s original complaint did join ENA and Qwest as parties.\n         This Court’s opinion in Syringa I did not dismiss ENA or Qwest from the case, nor was it\nnecessary on remand to amend Count Three to directly challenge ENA’s SBPO. Because Count\nThree alleged that DOA violated a multiple award procurement statute, it was implicit that each\ncontract could be found void due to illegality. Even at the time Syringa filed its original\ncomplaint, it was evident that if Syringa prevailed on its claim, the necessary result was that both\npublic contracts would be declared void. See I.C. § 67-5725. It would be logically inconsistent\nfor only one contract of a multiple award to be declared illegal and void where the alleged\nstatutory violation, as here, relates to the process of granting the multiple award. Thus, regardless\nof whether Syringa I would otherwise have resulted in the dismissal of ENA or Qwest, neither\nparty could be or was dismissed while it remained a necessary party based on Count Three. The\ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion that ENA was no longer a party was in error. Both ENA and\nQwest remained parties on remand because they were necessary parties on the pending Count\nThree. Syringa’s motion to amend its complaint was unnecessary because the original complaint\nsufficed to put all interested and necessary parties on notice of the basic allegations and likely\nremedies. Accordingly, the district court had jurisdiction over ENA and Qwest at all relevant\ntimes.\n         2. The district court did not commit error when it concluded it had an affirmative\n            duty to raise the issue of illegality of the SBPOs.\n         The district court held that a court has an affirmative duty to raise the issue of illegality at\nany stage in the litigation, regardless of whether the issue was pleaded by a party. The court\nquoted Quiring v. Quiring:\n                  A party to a contract, void as against public policy, cannot waive its\n         illegality by failure to specially plead the defense or otherwise, but whenever the\n         same is made to appear at any stage of the case, it becomes the duty of a court to\n         refuse to enforce it; again, a court of equity will not knowingly aid in the\n         furtherance of an illegal transaction; in harmony with this principle, it does not\n         concern itself as to the manner in which the illegality of a matter before it is\n         brought to its attention.\n\n\n                                                    9\n\f130 Idaho 560, 567, 944 P.2d 695, 702 (1997). The district court perceived that it was “not free\nto ignore this issue or to countenance the continuation of contracts that resulted from violation of\nstate procurement law.”\n       DOA argues that the district court had no such independent duty to invalidate the SBPOs.\nDOA contends Quiring holds that a party to a contract cannot waive the illegality of a contract\nthat is void as against public policy and thereby require the Court to knowingly enforce the\ncontract. DOA insists that Quiring is inapplicable because Syringa was not a party to the SBPOs\nand none of the parties to the SBPOs are seeking judicial enforcement of the agreements.\n       DOA asserts that the more recent case of City of Meridian v. Petra Inc. applies instead of\nQuiring. In Petra, this Court rejected Meridian’s contention that a contract between Meridian\nand Petra was illegal and unenforceable due to Petra’s failure to post a payment and performance\nbond as required by Idaho Code section 54-4512. 154 Idaho 425, 444–445, 299 P.3d 232, 251–\n252 (2013). We held that the contract was not illegal, despite the violation of the bonding statute,\nbecause the contract itself was neither made for the purpose of furthering anything illegal nor\nfounded on something illegal. Id. at 446, 299 P.3d at 253.\n       In its analysis of Petra, DOA makes two incorrect statements. First, DOA represents that\nthis Court stated in Petra that a contract is only illegal if it cannot be performed without violating\napplicable law. There was no such holding in Petra. Rather, Petra acknowledged that a contract\nmay be illegal if it cannot be performed without violating the law, but did not hold that illegal\nperformance is the only way a contract may be illegal. Indeed, the language in Petra immediately\nfollowing DOA’s quote demonstrates the inaccuracy of DOA’s assertion:\n               This Court has similarly found that “[a]n illegal contract is one that rests\n       on illegal consideration consisting of any act or forbearance which is contrary to\n       law or public policy.” Quiring v. Quiring, 130 Idaho 560, 566, 944 P.2d 695, 701\n       (1997). Furthermore, contracts prohibited by law are illegal “and hence\n       unenforceable.” Id. This Court has also held that contracts that are “made for the\n       purpose of furthering any matter or thing prohibited by statute ... [are] void. This\n       rule applies to every contract which is founded on a transaction malum in se, or\n       which is prohibited by statute, on the ground of public policy.” Porter v. Canyon\n       Cnty. Farmers’ Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 45 Idaho 522, 525, 263 P. 632, 633 (1928).\n\nId. at 445, 299 P.3d at 252. Of particular note is the fact that this excerpt quotes with approval\nthe very proposition in Quiring that DOA seeks to attack.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       DOA also incorrectly states that, similar to the valid underlying contract in Petra, the\nSBPOs in this case have been declared valid by this Court and by the district court. DOA quotes\nSyringa I and the district court, but none of the quoted material is a declaration or legal\nconclusion by either court that the SBPOs were valid. They merely recite underlying facts or\nprocedural history. It is simply not true that either court has ever declared the SBPOs valid.\n       This Court exercises free review over the trial court’s conclusions of law. Quiring, 130\nIdaho at 563, 944 P.2d at 698. The district court’s determination that it was obligated to raise the\nissue of illegality was a legal conclusion, which will, therefore, be reviewed de novo.\n       The district court correctly concluded that Quiring imposed on it a duty to invalidate the\nSBPOs if they were unlawful. If the SBPOs were void for violating state procurement laws, as\nthe district court ultimately concluded, then it was proper for the district court to find that it had\nan independent duty to invalidate them. We affirm the district court’s holding that it had a duty\nto raise the issue of illegality of the SBPOs, regardless of whether Syringa could raise that issue\non remand.\n       3. The district court did not err in treating ENA’s motion to dismiss as a motion\n          for summary judgment.\n       On remand, Syringa moved for summary judgment. ENA moved for dismissal on judicial\nestoppel and res judicata grounds. The district court treated ENA’s motion to dismiss as a\nmotion under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), alleging failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted. Because the district court found that the motion involved\nconsideration of matters outside the pleadings, it treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for\nsummary judgment. The district court found that it need not address the merits of ENA’s motion\nto dismiss prior to Syringa’s motion for summary judgment.\n       ENA alleges that the district court “decided to ignore the issues” raised in its motion to\ndismiss, which denied ENA due process of law, the ability to conduct discovery and\ninvestigation, and the opportunity to develop facts that would support its defenses. ENA asserts\nthat Rule 12(b) does not permit a district court to convert a motion to dismiss where the motion\noffers no disputed issues of fact.\n       “When this Court reviews an order dismissing an action pursuant to I.R.C.P. 12(b)(6), we\napply the same standard of review we apply to a motion for summary judgment.” Losser v.\nBradstreet, 145 Idaho 670, 672−73, 183 P.3d 758, 760−61 (2008). “This Court reviews an\nappeal from an order of summary judgment de novo, and this Court’s standard of review is the\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fsame as the standard used by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.” Curlee\nv. Kootenai Cnty. Fire & Rescue, 148 Idaho 391, 394, 224 P.3d 458, 461 (2008). The Court has\nnot directly addressed the precise issue of whether a district court errs when treating a motion to\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Because the Court reviews trial court decisions on\nboth motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment under the de novo standard, and\nbecause the decision was a conclusion of law, the Court will apply de novo review to the district\ncourt’s decision.\n       If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the\n       pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the\n       pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be\n       treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and\n       all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made\n       pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\nI.R.C.P. 12(b). “Where a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted is supported by information outside of the pleadings, the motion is treated as a motion\nfor summary judgment.” McCann v. McCann, 152 Idaho 809, 814, 275 P.3d 824, 829 (2012).\nENA misconstrues the standard by focusing on whether there were disputed facts rather than on\nwhether matters outside the pleading were presented. In addition to citing to two filed versions of\nSyringa’s complaint, ENA also cited to Syringa I and to two of the district court’s previously\nfiled decisions. Thus, ENA presented matters outside the pleadings and it was, therefore, not\nerror for the district court to treat the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.\n       ENA further argues that the district court violated Rule 12(b) by not giving ENA\nadequate notice that its motion to dismiss would be treated as a motion for summary judgment.\nThe language in Rule 12(b) is mandatory rather than discretionary, requiring that “the motion\nshall be treated as one for summary judgment.” I.R.C.P. 12(b) (emphasis added). ENA should\nhave known that the court would treat its motion as a motion for summary judgment because\nENA presented matters beyond the pleadings. The rule requires that when a motion to dismiss is\ntreated as a motion for summary judgment, “all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to\npresent all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.” I.R.C.P. 12(b). ENA had a\nreasonable opportunity to present all pertinent material—its own conduct necessitated the\ntreatment of its motion under Rule 56 instead of Rule 12. Indeed, it leveraged that opportunity\nprecisely by including in its motion matters outside the pleadings. There is no legal remedy\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\favailable to it now for its decision not to include more or different materials in support of its\nmotion.\n       ENA suggests that the rule requires advance actual notice to the moving party that the\ncourt will treat the motion as one for summary judgment, so that it has the opportunity to present\nmaterial made pertinent by Rule 56. This does not conform to the rule or its purpose. Any notice\nrequirement in Rule 12(b) presumably exists so that non-moving parties might adequately\nprepare to defend against summary judgment rather than dismissal. The moving party is\nnecessarily already on notice of that fact. ENA cites to Federal Practice and Procedure for the\nproposition that the notice requirement consists of providing “an adequate opportunity to\ndemonstrate why summary judgment should not be granted” to the party against whom judgment\nis entered. 10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 2720, at 27 (3d ed. 1998). That does not suggest that the moving party is also\nentitled to independent notice; it merely acknowledges the necessity of informing adverse parties\nso that they may prepare to defend against the motion. This is in accord with how the equivalent\nfederal rules have been interpreted.\n       In Capital Partners Int’l Ventures, Inc. v. Danzas Corp., a federal trial court held that\n       [i]f matters outside the pleadings are presented to the court, the motion for\n       judgment on the pleadings is converted into a summary judgment motion under\n       Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Before summary judgment may\n       be entered, the non-moving party must be given notice and an opportunity to\n       respond. Notice occurs when a represented party has reason to know the court will\n       look outside of the pleadings.\n309 F. Supp. 2d 1138, 1143 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). This Court has\nexpressed a “preference for interpreting the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure in conformance with\nthe interpretation placed upon the same language in the federal rules.” Obendorf v. Terra Hug\nSpray Co., Inc., 145 Idaho 892, 897, 188 P.3d 834, 839 (2008). Both the Idaho rule and the\nfederal rule use identical language requiring that motions to dismiss and motions for judgment on\nthe pleadings be treated as summary judgment motions when matters outside the pleadings are\npresented. I.R.C.P. 12(b), 12(c); F.R.C.P. 12(c), 12(d). Here, even if ENA required notice, it had\nadequate notice because it had reason to know the court would look outside of the pleadings—\nENA itself asked the court to do so by referencing additional materials.\n       ENA also argues that it was improperly denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard on\nits motion to dismiss. In support of this line of argument, it claims that the district court ruled\n\n\n                                                13\n\fthat ENA’s SBPO was void before finding it had jurisdiction over ENA, that Syringa’s motion\nfor partial summary judgment was untimely as against ENA, and that it lacked adequate notice of\nSyringa’s motion.\n       First, ENA asserts without citation that “the district court found against ENA on the\nmerits without formally holding that ENA was a party!” and that “the District Court ruled ENA’s\ncontract with the State void before it found it had jurisdiction over ENA.” The record does not\nsupport these claims. The district court found that all necessary parties, including ENA, had been\njoined and that the Court had jurisdiction. In the same memorandum decision and order, the\ncourt then found that the SBPOs, as amended to divide the work between Qwest and ENA, were\nvoid. ENA has not shown that the district court ruled ENA’s SBPO void before finding it had\njurisdiction over ENA. Even if ENA had made such a showing, our conclusion that ENA\nremained a party on remand renders the point irrelevant.\n       Second, ENA asserts that Syringa’s motion for partial summary judgment was untimely\nas against ENA because it was not filed in compliance with Rule 56(a), which requires filing\n“after the expiration of twenty (20) days from the service of process upon the adverse party or\nthat party’s appearance in the action.” ENA was originally served process in this action in\nDecember 2009 and appeared repeatedly in 2010 and thereafter. Syringa filed its motion for\npartial summary judgment on March 20, 2014 and served it on ENA on April 25, 2014. At the\ndistrict court’s order, Syringa also served ENA again on July 3, 2014. The district court presided\nover a hearing on the motion on October 10, 2014.\n       The timing requirement in I.R.C.P. 56(a) was not violated in this case, despite the fact\nthat Syringa filed its motion before, rather than at least twenty days after, ENA was re-served\nprocess. ENA apparently believes that if Syringa I operated to dismiss it from the case then the\ntwenty-day period specified in I.R.C.P. 56(a) would not begin to run until it were re-served or\nonce again appeared in the action. But there is no support in the language of the rule for this\ninterpretation. The plain language of the rule allows a party seeking a declaratory judgment to\nmove for summary judgment any time after the expiration of twenty days from the service of\nprocess upon the adverse party or that party’s appearance in the action. I.R.C.P. 56(a). ENA was\nserved process in 2009 and appeared in the action by 2010. Syringa’s March 20, 2014 motion\nwas at least four years beyond the rule’s twenty day requirement. ENA’s invocation of Rule\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f56(a) does not help its case. Even if ENA’s argument were convincing, the point is irrelevant in\nlight of our conclusion that ENA remained a party on remand.\n       Further, Rule 61 provides in relevant part that “[t]he court at every stage of the\nproceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the\nsubstantial rights of the parties.” I.R.C.P. 61. The purpose of the twenty-day requirement in Rule\n56(a) is presumably to ensure that defendants have adequate notice and opportunity to prepare to\ndefend against summary judgment. Here, even if the rule applied, ENA has not shown that any\nrelated procedural error or defect affected its substantial rights. Indeed, it cannot do so. ENA was\nserved with the motion on April 25, 2014 and the hearing took place October 10, 2014, over five\nmonths later. ENA had more than adequate notice and opportunity to prepare to defend the\nmotion. This same reasoning applies to ENA’s separate argument that it lacked adequate notice\nof Syringa’s motion.\n       ENA also argues that it lacked notice because Syringa’s motion specifically listed only\nDOA as a party against which it sought relief. This argument fails for the same reason that ENA\nremained a party on remand: ENA knew or should have known that judgment in Syringa’s favor\nwould be adverse to ENA’s interests because the necessary consequence of a holding for Syringa\nwas that ENA’s contract would be void. It was logically impossible for the district court to grant\nSyringa’s requested relief without also harming ENA’s interests, and it is entirely consistent—\neven necessary—to charge ENA with knowledge of this fact.\n       Moreover, no fewer than six individuals involved in ENA’s defense were served on\nAugust 21, 2014 with Syringa’s notice of hearing indicating that Syringa’s motion for partial\nsummary judgment would be argued on October 10, 2014 at 1:00 P.M. The record of actions\nmakes clear that as of August 20, 2014, ENA’s own motion to dismiss was scheduled for\nargument at the same day and time. For ENA to argue that it lacked notice or an opportunity to\nrespond to Syringa’s motion for partial summary judgment is simply inaccurate. ENA knew of\nthe motion, knew it would be argued at the same time as its own motion, and had several months\nin which it could have developed a merits argument opposing Syringa’s motion. ENA could have\nfiled a responsive brief in opposition up to October 3, 2014, seven days prior to the hearing.\nI.R.C.P. 7(b)(3)(E). It did not do so.\n       Finally, ENA argues that its rights were violated when the district court deprived it of the\nbenefits of its contract without an opportunity to protect its interests. ENA asserts that it should\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fhave had the opportunity to submit additional materials to the court and would have done so if\nproper procedure had been followed. ENA fails to suggest what additional materials it might\nhave submitted. Following entry of the district court’s decision on the dispositive motions, ENA\nfiled a motion for reconsideration, which would have been an opportunity to present new or\nadditional facts or materials but ENA chose not to do so. In any event, as addressed above, ENA\nhad a “reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent.” I.R.C.P. 12(b).\n       It appears that ENA made a strategic gamble not to argue the merits of whether its SBPO\nwas void in order to preserve its numerous procedural arguments. ENA lost that gamble. It\ncannot now win an argument that it is procedurally unjust to void its illegal contract merely\nbecause it failed to defend on the merits. ENA cannot avoid an adverse judgment here by\nclaiming it had no opportunity to plead its case when it is clear that it did in fact have ample\nopportunity.\n       Finally, the district court did not ignore the arguments in ENA’s motion to dismiss, as\nENA argues. ENA asserted in its motion that judicial estoppel and res judicata precluded\nSyringa from amending its complaint to challenge ENA’s SBPO. The district court expressly\nacknowledged ENA’s arguments and rejected them. The district court determined that it had an\nindependent and affirmative duty to raise the issue of illegality. This ruling rendered it irrelevant\nwhether Syringa, as a party, could be precluded or estopped from challenging ENA’s SBPO.\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s treatment of ENA’s motion to dismiss as a motion for\nsummary judgment.\n       4. The district court did not err in holding that the case was not moot.\n       DOA and Qwest argue that the case became moot when DOA, ENA, and Qwest mutually\npurported to rescind the amendments to the original SBPOs in July 2014. They assert that the\nrescission was effective and that thereafter there was no longer a justiciable controversy and,\ntherefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Syringa argues that\nthe amended contracts were void, that void contracts cannot be rescinded and, therefore, the\nattempted rescission was futile. The district court found that “DOA’s efforts to salvage these\nvoid contracts were futile and of no effect. An agreement made in violation of the state’s\nprocurement law cannot be fixed or cured.”\n       “Justiciability issues, such as mootness, are freely reviewed.” State v. Barclay, 149 Idaho\n6, 8, 232 P.3d 327, 329 (2010).\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f       This Court has not previously addressed whether a void contract can be rescinded, but\nhas held that “[Void] contracts are deemed never to have existed in the eyes of the law.”\nThompson v. Ebbert, 144 Idaho 315, 318, 160 P.3d 754, 757 (brackets in original). This is\nconsistent with the Black’s Law Dictionary definition of a void contract as “[a] contract that is of\nno legal effect, so that there is really no contract in existence at all.” Black’s Law Dictionary 374\n(9th ed. 2009). We now hold that void contracts may not be rescinded because they are deemed\nnever to have existed. A purported rescission of a void contract is, therefore, necessarily a\nnullity. Accordingly, there was nothing to rescind if the contracts were void. The purported\nrescission of the amendments could have no legal effect and could not moot the case.\n       5. The district court did not err in ruling that the SBPOs were not saved by a\n          severability clause.\n       Qwest and DOA argue that a severability clause in the original SBPOs requires that the\namendments, if invalid, must be severed from the original SBPOs. According to affidavit\ntestimony, severability clauses incorporated by reference into the SBPOs provide language\nmaterially similar to the following: “[i]n the event any term of the Contract is held to be invalid\nor unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining terms of the Contract will\nremain in force.”\n       The district court rejected this severability argument, holding that because the original\nawards were part of a process used to make an illegal award, the process itself was flawed. This\nwas correct. By its plain language, the severability clause existed to save the enforceable terms\nwithin the SBPOs if any term were held invalid or unenforceable. The district court did not\nconclude that the SBPOs included an unenforceable term. Rather, the district court concluded,\ncorrectly, that DOA violated state procurement law in purporting to make the contracts, and that\nthe contracts were, therefore, necessarily void ab initio. Because void contracts are deemed never\nto have existed in the eyes of the law, there was no contract from which illegal terms could be\nsevered. Thompson, 144 Idaho at 318, 160 P.3d at 757. The contracts were void in their entirety\nand could not be saved by severing any particular clauses.\n       6. The district court did not commit reversible error in permitting Syringa to\n          amend its complaint or challenge the SBPOs on remand.\n       DOA and Qwest argue that the district court erred in permitting Syringa to challenge a\ncontract under which it reaped substantial financial benefit. Both parties also argue that the\ndistrict court erred in failing to bar Syringa from challenging the original SBPOs on remand.\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fENA argues that res judicata and judicial estoppel precluded Syringa from challenging the\noriginal SBPOs on remand.\n       “[I]t is well-settled that where an order of a lower court is correct, but based on an\nerroneous theory, the order will be affirmed upon the correct theory.” Grabicki v. City of\nLewiston, 154 Idaho 686, 692, 302 P.3d 26, 32 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Court “will uphold the decision of a trial court if any alternative legal basis can be\nfound to support it.” Daleiden v. Jefferson Cty. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 251, 139 Idaho 466, 470–\n471, 80 P.3d 1067, 1071–1072 (2003).\n       Because the district court had an independent affirmative duty to address the issue of\nillegality, none of these arguments are relevant. The district court had the authority to declare the\nSBPOs void regardless of whether Syringa had properly challenged them. Even if the district\ncourt had erred in determining whether Syringa could challenge the SBPOs, that error was\nharmless in light of its duty to independently declare the SBPOs void if it found them to be\nunlawful. The Court need not and does not undertake further analysis of these issues.\nB. The district court’s order concluding the SBPOs were void was substantively correct.\n       On summary judgment, the district court concluded that the SBPOs, as amended, were\nmade in violation of Idaho Code section 67-5718(2), IDAPA 38.05.01.052 and Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A and that, as such, the agreements were void. The district court held that in\nSyringa I this Court ruled that DOA violated state procurement law and that the ruling\nestablished the law of the case, binding the parties and the district court.\n       DOA and Qwest appealed the district court’s order declaring that the SBPOs were void,\nin part by challenging the district court’s conclusion that the law of the case doctrine applies.\nThey argue that with respect to Count Three, Syringa I addressed only the threshold issue of\nwhether Syringa had standing to pursue the claim and that the Court’s comments regarding any\nalleged violation are necessarily dicta. In response, Syringa refers to language in Syringa I that\nappears to unambiguously state that DOA violated the law.\n       Because this challenge is to the district court’s grant of summary judgment, we review\nthis issue de novo. Curlee v. Kootenai Cnty. Fire & Rescue, 148 Idaho at 391, 394, 224 P.3d 458,\n461 (2008). “When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, disputed facts are construed in\nfavor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record\nare drawn in favor of the non-moving party.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       The law of the case doctrine does not apply to this issue, and the district court erred in\nholding otherwise. In Syringa I, we stated:\n       To satisfy the requirement of standing, litigants generally must allege or\n       demonstrate an injury in fact and a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief\n       requested will prevent or redress the claimed injury. . . .\n       . . . [W]hen the amendments to the contracts are viewed in the context of the\n       entire bidding process, Syringa does have standing.\n       ....\n               Syringa has alleged a distinct and palpable injury, not suffered by all\n       Idaho citizens, that is alleged to have been caused by the challenged conduct and\n       that can be redressed by judicial relief.\n155 Idaho at 55, 60–62, 305 P.3d 499, 504–506 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). There is admittedly strong and direct language in Syringa I that would appear to\nconclusively establish that DOA violated the law. However, we ultimately concluded that\n“Syringa has alleged,” rather than demonstrated, an injury sufficient to confer standing. Id. at 62,\n305 P.3d at 506 (emphasis added). Further, we did not order entry of judgment in Syringa’s\nfavor; we merely held that “Syringa has standing to challenge the amended contract to Qwest.”\nId. Finally, in Syringa I, Syringa had appealed the entry of summary judgment against it. Id. at\n59, 305 P.3d at 503. As the non-moving party at the district court, we were obligated both to\nconstrue disputed facts and to draw reasonable inferences in Syringa’s favor. Curlee, 148 Idaho\nat 394, 224 P.3d at 461. The fact that the Court did not choose in drafting its opinion in Syringa I\nto repeatedly use hedging language such as “Syringa alleges that . . .” or “As Syringa claims, . .\n.” does not somehow cause its ruling on the threshold issue of standing to become authoritative\non the merits. Accordingly, the district court erred in applying the law of the case doctrine to\nhold that we conclusively determined in Syringa I that the SBPOs, as amended, were void.\n       However, the Court “will uphold the decision of a trial court if any alternative legal basis\ncan be found to support it.” Daleiden, 139 Idaho at 470–471, 80 P.3d at 1071–1072. “Summary\njudgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Curlee, 148 Idaho at 394, 224 P.3d at 461. “If\nthe evidence presented shows no disputed issues of material fact, then all that remains are\nquestions of law, over which this Court exercises free review.” State ex rel. Wasden v. Maybee,\n148 Idaho 520, 527, 224 P.3d 1109, 1116 (2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\f       Here, there are only two material facts and there is no genuine issue or dispute as to\neither. First, DOA granted SBPOs to Qwest and ENA as a multiple award under Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A. Second, less than one month later, DOA amended the SBPOs to assign to\nQwest “all IEN technical network services” and to constitute ENA as “the Service Provider listed\non the State’s Federal E-rate Form 471.”\n       Idaho Code section 67-5718A(1) permits “an award of a contract to two (2) or more\nbidders to furnish the same or similar property where more than one (1) contractor is necessary”\nunder certain circumstances. Section 67-5718A(3) provides that “[w]here a contract for property\nhas been awarded to two (2) or more bidders in accordance with this section, a state agency shall\nmake purchases from the contractor whose terms and conditions regarding price, availability,\nsupport services and delivery are most advantageous to the agency.” Section 67-5718(2) requires\nthat requests for proposals “shall describe the property to be acquired in sufficient detail to\napprise a bidder of the exact nature or functionality of the property required.” Section 67-5725\nprovides that “[a]ll contracts or agreements made in violation of the provisions of this chapter\nshall be void.”\n       Under these facts, summary judgment for Syringa is proper. We now specifically hold\nwhat we said in the context of standing in Syringa I:\n               The amendments to the purchase orders issued to ENA and Qwest were, in\n       effect, changing the RFP after the bids were opened. The RFP solicited proposals\n       from bidders who were able to perform the entire contract which, under the\n       wording of the RFP, would be a “total end-to-end service support solution.” . . .\n       The RFP did not seek bids for one contract to provide the backbone and a separate\n       contract to be the E-rate service provider. . . .\n\n       By amending the contracts so that Qwest and ENA were no longer furnishing the\n       same or similar property, the State has, in effect, changed the RFP after the bids\n       had been opened in violation of I.C. § 67-5718(2) and IDAPA 38.05.01.052. The\n       separate contracts as amended no longer conform to the RFP’s description of the\n       property to be acquired. The description of property to be provided by Qwest\n       under its amended contract is not a minor deviation from the property to be\n       provided by the successful bidder under the RFP, nor is the property to be\n       provided by ENA under its amended contract. “[M]ere schemes to evade law,\n       once their true character is established, are impotent for the purpose intended.\n       Courts sweep them aside as so much rubbish.” O’Bryant, 78 Idaho at 325, 303\n       P.2d at 678.\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f155 Idaho at 61−62, 305 P.3d at 505−06. What were supposed to have been side-by-side, end-to-\nend competing contracts turned into a non-competitive blended arrangement that left State users\nwith no lower cost choice.\n       DOA argues that the SBPOs themselves were lawful and that if the amendments were\nillegal the proper remedy is to void the amendments while upholding the SBPOs. Qwest echoes\nthis argument, also asserting that portions of the SBPOs unrelated to the IEN should be upheld\nbecause they were unrelated to the illegal amendments. In response, Syringa argues that material\namendments to competitively bid public contracts are impermissible and illegal amendments can\nrender both the amendment and the underlying contract void. Although Idaho law has not\npreviously addressed this precise issue, McQuillin on Municipal Corporations provides that a\npublic contract will “be set aside where specifications are changed after the bidding has been\nclosed.” 10 McQuillin Mun. Corp. § 29:69 (3d ed.). Additionally, “[w]here there is deviation\nfrom the requirements of public bidding, the proper procedure is to readvertise, and secure\nanother open competitive bidding so that all of the bidders would be on an equal footing.” Id. at\n§ 29:35. The Court will adopt and apply these rules in this case.\n       Here, DOA’s amendments rendered the SBPOs unlawful in that they changed “the\nproperty to be acquired” under each SBPO, in violation of Idaho Code section 67-5718(2). The\nchanges were material in that they changed the scope of the work to be performed under each\nSBPO of the multiple award. The amendments occurred less than one month after bidding had\nbeen closed. This tainted the public procurement process and permanently invalidated the\nSBPOs. The Appellants essentially seek to close the barn door after substantial funds had been\nadvanced by the State under the unlawfully amended SBPOs. As performed, the SBPOs and their\nrespective amendments became inseparable. The district court’s entry of summary judgment on\ngrounds of illegality was therefore proper because there was no genuine issue or dispute as to a\nmaterial fact. We affirm the district court’s order holding that both the ENA SBPO and the\nQwest SBPO are void.\nC. The district court did not commit error or abuse its discretion in denying Syringa’s\n   motion to include in its judgment an order directing DOA, under Idaho Code section\n   67-5725, to demand repayment of money advanced under the SBPOs.\n       After summary judgment was granted in its favor, Syringa submitted a proposed form of\njudgment that would have required the Administrator of the Division of Purchasing within DOA\nto demand repayment of all sums of money advanced by the State of Idaho in consideration of\n\n\n                                                21\n\fthe SBPOs, as required by Idaho Code section 67-5725.5 The district court did not include\nSyringa’s proposed language in its judgment. Syringa subsequently filed a motion to amend the\njudgment or, in the alternative, for partial reconsideration and/or clarification of the district\ncourt’s relevant memorandum decision and order. The district court again rejected Syringa’s\nproposed language, explaining that the application of Idaho Code section 67-5725 involved\ndevelopment of factual and legal issues that had not been presented. Syringa cross-appealed the\ndistrict court’s refusal to include the proposed form of judgment.\n           Syringa argues that section 67-5725 sets forth mandatory consequences that apply as a\nresult of the district court’s ruling that the SBPOs are void. Syringa asserts that the district court\nerred or abused its discretion by excluding the proposed paragraph from its judgment. Syringa\ndoes not articulate why or how the district court was obligated to include the requested language.\n           This Court reviews an order denying a motion to alter or amend a judgment for an abuse\nof discretion. Slaathaug v. Allstate Ins. Co., 132 Idaho 705, 707, 979 P.2d 107, 109 (1999). “So\nlong as the trial court recognized the matter as discretionary, acted within the outer boundaries of\nthe court’s discretion, and reached its conclusion through an exercise of reason, this Court will\nnot disturb the decision on appeal.” Id. However, “when the district court grants summary\njudgment and then denies a motion for reconsideration, this Court must determine whether the\nevidence presented a genuine issue of material fact to defeat summary judgment. This means the\nCourt reviews the district court’s denial of a motion for reconsideration de novo.” Massey v.\nConagra Foods, Inc., 156 Idaho 476, 480, 328 P.3d 456, 460 (2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because Syringa’s motion was a “motion to amend judgment, or in the alternative, for\npartial reconsideration” both standards of review are implicated.\n           The outcome is the same under both standards. Syringa is correct that the statute provides\nmandatory consequences. However, it was not the district court’s duty in this circumstance to\ninclude the requested order in its judgment. Section 67-5725 does impose an obligation on the\nproper officer “of the state of Idaho” to seek repayment of money advanced under the void\n\n\n5\n    Section 67-5725 provides in relevant part:\n           All contracts or agreements made in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be void and\n           any sum of money advanced by the state of Idaho in consideration of any such contract or\n           agreement shall be repaid forthwith. In the event of refusal or delay when repayment is demanded\n           by the proper officer of the state of Idaho, under whose authority such contract or agreement shall\n           have been made or entered into, every person so refusing or delaying, together with his surety or\n           sureties, shall be forthwith prosecuted at law for the recovery of such sum of money so advanced.\n\n\n                                                           22\n\fSBPOs, if repayment is refused or delayed. But it imposes no obligation on the district court to\npreemptively order that DOA comply with this obligation. If the appropriate State officer fails to\nperform this statutory obligation, the State’s chief legal officer can step forward to make the\nState whole for these unfortunate violations of State law.\n       Because Syringa has not shown that the district court had a duty to order DOA to comply\nwith the statutory obligation imposed by Idaho Code section 67-5725, it cannot have been error\nor an abuse of discretion for the district court to refuse to include such an order in its judgment.\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s denial of Syringa’s combined motion to amend\njudgment or to reconsider.\nD. The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Syringa.\n       The district court found that on remand Syringa was the prevailing party and it awarded\nSyringa attorney fees under Idaho Code sections 12-117, 12-120(3), and 12-121. The district\ncourt stated that “from the overall view, while Syringa lost a number of preliminary battles, in\nthe end Syringa won the war that mattered decisively, after a lengthy and expensive challenge to\na state agency willing and able to devote significant resources defending its conduct.”\n       DOA challenges these determinations, arguing that Syringa was not the prevailing party\nand that a fee award under section 12-117 is improper because the case deals with an issue of\nfirst impression. DOA also challenges the propriety of the award under sections 12-120(3) and\n12-121.\n       “The district court’s determination of prevailing party status for the purpose of awarding\nattorney fees and costs is within the court’s sound discretion, and will not be disturbed on appeal\nunless there is an abuse of discretion.” Hobson Fabricating Corp. v. SE/Z Const., LLC, 154\nIdaho 45, 49, 294 P.3d 171, 175 (2012). This Court also reviews a district court’s decision\ngranting attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-117 under the abuse of discretion standard.\nCity of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 908, 277 P.3d 353, 355 (2012). Under the abuse of\ndiscretion standard, “[s]o long as the trial court recognized the matter as discretionary, acted\nwithin the outer boundaries of the court’s discretion, and reached its conclusion through an\nexercise of reason, this Court will not disturb the decision on appeal.” Slaathaug, 132 Idaho at\n707, 979 P.2d at 109.\n       1. The district court did not err in determining that Syringa was the prevailing\n          party.\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\f       Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(B) guides the prevailing party analysis: “In\ndetermining which party to an action is a prevailing party and entitled to costs, the trial court\nshall in its sound discretion consider the final judgment or result of the action in relation to the\nrelief sought by the respective parties.” We stated in Hobson that “the issue . . . is not who\nsucceeded on more individual claims, but rather who succeeded on the main issue of the action.”\n154 Idaho at 49, 294 P.3d at 175.\n       “In determining which party prevailed in an action where there are claims and\ncounterclaims between opposing parties, the court determines who prevailed ‘in the action.’ That\nis, the prevailing party question is examined and determined from an overall view, not a claim-\nby-claim analysis.” Eighteen Mile Ranch, LLC v. Nord Excavating & Paving, Inc., 141 Idaho\n716, 719, 117 P.3d 130, 133 (2005). Although this case is not one where there are “claims and\ncounterclaims between opposing parties,” we nonetheless adopt and apply the “overall view”\nhere because that approach is equally appropriate in an action involving multiple claims.\n       In Idaho Military Historical Soc’y, Inc. v. Maslen, the plaintiff was deemed the\nprevailing party after having been awarded equitable relief despite not succeeding on a variety of\nsecondary issues. 156 Idaho 624, 630–631, 329 P.3d 1072, 1078–1079 (2014). In that case, we\nupheld the district court’s conclusion that in determining the prevailing party the court could\nconsider the conduct that “primarily precipitated” the lawsuit. Id. at 630, 329 P.3d at 1078. The\ninstant case is similar to Maslen in that each of Syringa’s claims, including those on which it did\nnot prevail, was primarily precipitated by the conduct challenged in Count Three—DOA’s\nviolation of the procurement statutes in awarding the SBPOs.\n       DOA has failed to show, in light of applicable case law, that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in determining that Syringa was the prevailing party. Accordingly, we affirm the\ndistrict court’s holding that Syringa was the prevailing party.\n       2. The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Syringa fees under\n          Idaho Code section 12-117.\n       Under Idaho Code section 12-117(1), “in any proceeding involving as adverse parties a\nstate agency . . . and a person, . . . the court hearing the proceeding, . . . shall award the\nprevailing party reasonable attorney’s fees, witness fees and other reasonable expenses, if it finds\nthat the nonprevailing party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.” “Where an agency\nhas no authority to take a particular action, it acts without a reasonable basis in fact or law.”\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fFischer v. City of Ketchum, 141 Idaho 349, 356, 109 P.3d 1091, 1098 (2005) overruled on other\ngrounds by City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d 353 (2012).\n        In granting Syringa fees under Idaho Code section 12-117, the district court held that\n               Idaho Code § 12-117 has two purposes: “(1) to serve as a deterrent to\n        groundless or arbitrary agency action; and (2) to provide a remedy for persons\n        who have borne an unfair and unjustified financial burden attempting to correct\n        mistakes agencies should never have made.” Ralph Naylor Farms, LLC v. Latah\n        Cnty., 144 Idaho 806, 809, 172 P.3d 1081, 1084 (2007) (overruled as to the\n        standard of review only by City of Osburn v. Randel, 152 Idaho 906, 277 P.3d\n        353 (2012) (quoting Rincover v. State of Idaho, Dep’t. of Finance, 132 Idaho 547,\n        549, 976 P.2d 473 (1999)). If an agency acts without any authority, it is acting\n        without a reasonable basis in law or fact. Id.\nThe district court held that DOA’s continued defense of the legality of the SBPOs after Syringa I\nlacked a reasonable basis in law or fact.\n        DOA argues that, as a matter of law, “[a] party did not act without a reasonable basis in\nfact or law if it raised an issue of first impression in Idaho or presented a legitimate question for\nthis Court to address.” Hobson Fabricating, 154 Idaho at 53, 294 P.3d at 179. DOA points out\nthat its defense of Count Three before Syringa I was so successful that the district court\ndismissed the claim, and that this dismissal demonstrates the reasonableness of DOA’s defense.\nAdditionally, DOA argues that Syringa has conceded the case involved novel, difficult legal\nquestions that required extensive effort.\n        Syringa argues that DOA acted without basis in law because it violated Idaho Code\nsections 67-5718(2) and 67-5718A. It further argues that the district court’s award of fees\nsquarely vindicates both purposes served by section 12-117: serving as a deterrent to future\nunlawful action and providing some relief to Syringa, which bore a significant financial burden\nattempting to correct DOA’s actions.\n        Finally, DOA argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding Syringa\nattorney fees because Syringa failed to distinguish between time spent litigating Count Three and\ntime spent litigating its other claims. Syringa disputes this allegation, claiming that the district\ncourt expressly recognized, based on its review of Syringa’s materials in support of its fee\nrequest, that Syringa segregated and sought only reasonable fees related to Count Three. Indeed,\nthe district court stated that it\n        has concluded that Syringa’s fee request from and after March 29, 2013 is\n        reasonable. The Court has reviewed all of the entries and fees requested prior to\n        March 29, 2013. The description of the work is detailed. It appears that Plaintiff is\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f        not seeking any fees related to the appeal. It also appears that Syringa is seeking\n        only fees related to its pursuit of Count Three, on which Syringa prevailed.\nDOA specifically references time entries related to researching the Idaho Tort Claims Act, a 42\nUSC § 1983 claim, a qui tam action, sovereign immunity, and other issues. But as to each entry,\nDOA’s reasoning why it was unrelated to Count Three is either absent or conclusory. DOA\nasserts that if any of the awarded fees were unwarranted, the entire award must be reversed. See\nRockefeller v. Grabow, 136 Idaho 637, 645, 39 P.3d 577, 585 (2001). Whether Rockefeller\napplies or controls here is irrelevant.\n        DOA has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in granting Syringa\nattorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-117. The court recognized the issue of awarding\nattorney fees as one of discretion and it acted within the outer bounds of its discretion and by\nexercising reason when it cited mandatory precedent holding that an agency acts without a\nreasonable basis in fact or law when it acts without authority. DOA lacked the authority to\nviolate Idaho Code sections 67-5718 and 67-5718A. Rather than recognizing that the actions of\nformer director Gwartney corrupted the procurement process, DOA doggedly defended that\nprocess to the bitter end. The district court was within its discretion to find that nothing in the\nprotracted proceedings subsequently rendered DOA’s defense reasonable. Further, DOA has not\nshown that any time entries, including the ones it expressly mentions, were unrelated to Count\nThree. Some of the entries do, on their face, seem unrelated to the allegations in Count Three.\nHowever, in this multi-year, multi-party litigation it is conceivable that any number of ancillary\nissues might arise and be related, if only tangentially, to the main issue. Because DOA has not\nmade a specific showing that any particular time entries cannot possibly have been related to\nCount Three, we affirm the district court’s exercise of discretion in awarding attorney fees in the\nspecified amount. In light of this holding, we need not review the correctness of the district\ncourt’s alternative grounds for awarding Syringa attorney fees under Idaho Code sections 12-\n120(3) and 12-121.\nE. No party is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n        ENA seeks attorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code section 12-120(3). Syringa seeks\nattorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code sections 12-117, 12-120(3), and 12-121. DOA seeks\nattorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code sections 12-117 and 12-121. For a party to recover\nfees under any of these provisions, it must be the prevailing party. Where adverse parties have\neach prevailed in part on appeal, neither is the prevailing party. Wright v. Bd. of Psychological\n\n\n                                                26\n\fExam’rs (In re Bd. of Psychologist Exam’rs’ Final Order), 148 Idaho 542, 548, 224 P.3d 1131,\n1137 (2010). ENA is not the prevailing party because it lost its appeal, and neither Syringa nor\nDOA are the prevailing party because they each successfully defended against the other’s appeal\nbut lost their own appeal. Accordingly, there is no prevailing party and, therefore, no party is\nentitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n                                           V.\n                                       CONCLUSION\n       We affirm the judgment of the district court. No party is granted attorney fees on appeal.\nCosts to Syringa.\n\n\n       Justices EISMANN, BURDICK, W. JONES, and HORTON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                               27\n\f",

JONES, Chief Justice\n        This case involves a second set of appeals arising from an action challenging the bidding\nprocess for the Idaho Education Network (“IEN”). Syringa Networks, LLC, sued Qwest\nCommunications, LLC, ENA Services, LLC, and the Idaho Department of Administration\n(“DOA”) and certain DOA employees, alleging injury arising from contract awards and\namendments that DOA issued to Qwest and ENA related to the IEN. The district court dismissed\nall of Syringa’s claims. On appeal we held that Syringa had standing to pursue Count Three,\nwhich alleged that DOA violated Idaho Code section 67-5718A. Count Three was remanded to\nthe district court for further proceedings.\n        On remand, the district court entered partial summary judgment for Syringa on Count\nThree, holding that the amendments and the underlying contracts were void for violating state\nprocurement law. The district court denied Syringa’s motion to order DOA to demand repayment\nof money advanced under the void contracts. The district court also awarded Syringa attorney\nfees.\n        Syringa, Qwest, ENA, and DOA each timely appealed. Syringa appeals the district\ncourt’s denial of its request to order DOA to demand repayment from Qwest and ENA. The other\nparties appeal the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment to Syringa, arguing that the\ndistrict court’s conclusions were procedurally improper and substantively incorrect for a variety\nof reasons. DOA also challenges the district court’s award of attorney fees to Syringa. Syringa,\nENA, and DOA request attorney fees on appeal.\n                                        I.\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n        The IEN was to be “a high-bandwidth telecommunications distribution system for\ndistance learning” in public schools, libraries, and state agencies. Syringa Networks, LLC v.\nIdaho Dep’t of Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (2013) [hereinafter “Syringa I”].\nDOA     was    given    administrative    oversight   of   the   IEN,   including   “[p]rocur[ing]\ntelecommunications services and equipment for the IEN through an open and competitive\nbidding process.” Id. (citing I.C. § 67-5745D(5)(h) (subsection repealed 2010)). In 2008, DOA\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fissued a request for proposals (“RFP”) for work on the IEN, seeking only comprehensive, end-\nto-end bids. Syringa could not provide end-to-end services so it agreed to be a subcontractor on\nthe bid submitted by ENA. In January 2009, DOA issued substantially identical Statewide\nBlanket Purchase Orders (“SBPOs”) to Qwest and ENA as a “multiple award” under Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A. In February 2009, DOA unilaterally amended both SBPOs to assign some\nportions of the IEN work exclusively to ENA and other portions exclusively to Qwest. Under the\namendments, Qwest was to provide all IEN technical network services and ENA was to be the\nservice provider listed on the State’s federal E-Rate form. The amendments assigned to Qwest all\nof the work that Syringa had planned to do as ENA’s subcontractor.\n       Syringa brought suit against Qwest, ENA, DOA, and certain DOA employees. Syringa\nalleged that DOA violated Idaho Code section 67-5718A, a multiple award procurement statute,\nwhen it amended Qwest’s SBPO. Among other claims, Syringa also alleged breach of contract\nagainst ENA. The district court dismissed all of Syringa’s claims. On appeal in Syringa I, we\nreinstated Count Three of Syringa’s original complaint, regarding DOA’s alleged violation of the\nmultiple award procurement statute. Id. at 60–62, 305 P.3d at 504–506.\n       In Syringa I, after reviewing the facts alleged, we vacated the district court’s summary\njudgment holding that Syringa had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and held that\nSyringa had standing to bring Count Three “when the amendments to the contracts are viewed in\nthe context of the entire bidding process.” Id. at 61, 305 P.3d at 505. We then concluded that\n“Syringa has alleged a distinct and palpable injury . . . that is alleged to have been caused by the\nchallenged conduct and that can be redressed by judicial relief.” Id. at 62, 305 P.3d at 506. We\nremanded Count Three for further proceedings. Id. at 68, 305 P.3d at 512.\n       On remand, the district court permitted Syringa to amend its claim in Count Three: (1) to\nadd specific references to Idaho Code section 67-5718, the statute this Court considered in\nSyringa I; (2) to make a specific reference to the amended awards to Qwest and ENA; and (3) to\nseek a ruling that the awards are void as a matter of law. On reconsideration, the district court\nvacated its prior ruling to the extent that it had granted “leave for Syringa to challenge the\noriginal SBPOs.” The court found that Syringa had previously conceded that the original SBPOs\nwere lawful, and it concluded that judicial estoppel precluded Syringa from subsequently\nchallenging them.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f        The district court found that ENA and Qwest were necessary parties, although it also\nfound that ENA was no longer a party on remand because all claims against it in the original\ncomplaint had been fully resolved. The court further concluded that ENA must be made a party\nand that Qwest remained a party. The court ordered Syringa to serve ENA with an amended\npleading, which Syringa did.\n        Syringa filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a determination that the\nSBPOs were void. ENA filed a motion to dismiss in which it argued the court lacked jurisdiction\nover it. DOA also filed a motion for summary judgment in which Qwest joined, arguing that the\ncase was moot because DOA, Qwest, and ENA had rescinded the SBPO amendments. Following\nbriefing, the district court took up these motions on October 10, 2014. The court treated ENA’s\nmotion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment because it concluded that the motion\ninvolved consideration of matters outside the pleadings. After determining that all necessary\nparties had been joined and the court had jurisdiction, and despite its prior holding that Syringa\nwas estopped from challenging the original SBPOs, the district court nonetheless ultimately\nconcluded that the SBPOs, as amended, were void. In granting partial summary judgment to\nSyringa, the district court relied on the law of the case doctrine and the doctrine that Idaho courts\nhave an affirmative duty to raise the issue of contract illegality regardless of whether any party\nhad pled the issue. The district court held that our statements in Syringa I that DOA violated state\nprocurement law were the law of the case and were binding upon the parties and the district\ncourt. Referring to its perceived duty to raise the issue of illegality, the district court held that it\nmay not ignore the issue or countenance the continuation of contracts that resulted from violation\nof state procurement law. The court also found that because the SBPOs were void, DOA’s\nattempt to moot the case by rescinding the amendments was futile. The court rejected ENA’s\narguments that res judicata or judicial estoppel precluded a holding that the SBPOs are void.\n        The district court later denied, both initially and on reconsideration, Syringa’s request for\nan order requiring DOA to seek repayment of monies advanced under the SBPOs. Syringa\nsought and the district court awarded Syringa attorney fees totaling over $930,000, under Idaho\nCode sections 12-117, 12-120(3), and 12-121. The parties timely appealed.\n        On appeal here, ENA argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over ENA after\nremand and that Syringa’s challenge to ENA’s SBPO was precluded by res judicata and judicial\nestoppel. ENA also argues that the district court erred in treating ENA’s motion to dismiss as a\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fmotion for summary judgment. DOA and Qwest argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction\nto grant Syringa’s requested relief. DOA, Qwest, and ENA all argue that the district court erred\nin concluding that the SBPOs, as amended, are void. Syringa argues that the district court erred\nby not ordering DOA to demand repayment of monies advanced under the void SBPOs. DOA\nargues that the district court erred by granting attorney fees and costs to Syringa on remand.\nSyringa, ENA, and DOA each request attorney fees on appeal.\n                                          II.\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n1.

Whether Syringa, ENA, or DOA are entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n                                          III.\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       The issues raised on appeal have a variety of standards of review. Accordingly, the\napplicable standard of review is discussed within the analysis for each issue.\n                                              IV.\n                                           ANALYSIS\nA. The district court’s order concluding that the ENA and Qwest SBPOs were void was\n   procedurally proper.\n       DOA, ENA, and Qwest assert that, for a variety of reasons, the district court’s order\nvoiding the SBPOs was not procedurally proper. ENA argues that the district court lacked\njurisdiction over ENA on remand and that the district court erred in treating ENA’s motion to\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Qwest likewise argues the district court lacked\njurisdiction over it on remand. DOA and Qwest argue that the case became moot after DOA\nrescinded the amendments. DOA argues that the district court erred in holding that it had an\nindependent duty to invalidate illegal contracts, and ENA similarly argues that the district court’s\nduty to address the validity of a contract does not take priority over the law of the case or basic\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fjurisdictional principles. Finally, DOA and Qwest argue that the district court erred in permitting\nSyringa to challenge the SBPOs after having accepted benefits from them.1 ENA similarly\nargues that Syringa must be judicially estopped from challenging the SBPOs because it\npreviously conceded their lawfulness. None of these arguments have merit.\n        1. The district court had jurisdiction over ENA and Qwest on remand.\n        ENA and Qwest both argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction to void their\nrespective SBPOs on remand for two reasons. First, each argues that it was no longer party to the\naction after the dismissals of the claims “directly” against them were affirmed in Syringa I.\nSecond, each argues that it was impermissible for Syringa to amend Count Three on remand to\nadd ENA as a party and to challenge the original SBPOs, when the original challenge was only\nto the Qwest SBPO.2\n        Count Three of Syringa’s pre-appeal complaint alleged that DOA violated Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A by unlawfully granting a multiple award to Qwest and ENA when it should\nhave granted a single award to ENA.3 The complaint challenged the Qwest purchase order but\ndid not purport to challenge the ENA purchase order.4 DOA contends that Syringa’s litigation\nstrategy was to void Qwest’s SBPO but preserve ENA’s SBPO so that ENA would be the only\nremaining contract awardee, and Syringa would then perform a large portion of the contract\nwork as ENA’s subcontractor. On remand, Syringa moved to amend Count Three to allege a\nviolation of Idaho Code section 67-5718 in addition to the already-alleged violation of section\n67-5718A and to challenge ENA’s SBPO and amendment in addition to the already-challenged\nQwest SBPO and amendment. The district court granted Syringa’s motion to amend.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  DOA also asserts in its reply brief that allowing Syringa to challenge the original SBPOs would be “absurd and\nincongruous” because Syringa was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies with respect to the original\nSBPOs. However, this argument was not raised in DOA’s opening brief and, therefore, will not be considered.\nPatterson v. State Dep’t of Health and Welfare, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874118\"><a href=\"/opinion/874118/patterson-v-state-dept-of-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729 (2011).\n2\n  The plain language of the original complaint appears to challenge the Qwest SBPO, not just the amendment.\nHowever, in the prior appeal Syringa apparently conceded that the SBPOs were lawful and focused its challenge on\nthe Qwest amendment.\n3\n  Syringa and ENA purported to enter a teaming agreement through which they would fulfill the ENA purchase\norder together, but this Court found the agreement unenforceable for failure to state the material term of price.\nSyringa I, 155 Idaho at 62–64, 305 P.3d at 506–508.\n4\n  Paragraph 94 of the complaint states: “Syringa seeks a declaratory judgment against the DOA, Division of\nPurchasing declaring its award of the IEN Purchase Order to Qwest void, null, and of no effect pursuant to Idaho\nCode § 67-5725 and/or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the State and Qwest from performing under the lEN\nPurchase Order.”\n\n\n                                                       7\n\f       The district court later vacated this ruling to the extent that it had permitted Syringa to\nchallenge the original SBPOs, holding that judicial estoppel precluded Syringa from asserting\nthat the original SBPOs were illegal after having previously conceded that they were lawful. At\nthe same time, the district court found that ENA and Qwest were necessary parties, but that ENA\nwas no longer a party because each claim against ENA in the original complaint had been fully\nresolved. The district court found, however, that ENA must be made a party. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court directed Syringa to amend its complaint again and serve the amended pleading on\nDOA, Qwest, and ENA. Syringa complied. Ultimately, after finding that all necessary parties\nhad been joined and that it had jurisdiction, the district court concluded that the SBPOs, as\namended, were void. Accordingly, the judge granted Syringa partial summary judgment.\n       The parties cite Idaho Code section 10-1211, part of the Idaho Uniform Declaratory\nJudgment Act, which provides in relevant part that “[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all\npersons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the\ndeclaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the\nproceeding.” Qwest asserts that Syringa’s failure to name Qwest and ENA as defendants in\nCount Three meant that after all the claims “against” Qwest and ENA had been dismissed and,\nwith those dismissals affirmed in Syringa I, no additional claims could be brought against Qwest\nor ENA on remand. DOA interprets section 10-1211 as apparently requiring that each claim be\nasserted against each defendant in order to provide sufficient notice to the defendants.\n       ENA asserts that it was not a party to Count Three and that when the Supreme Court\naffirmed the dismissal of the counts to which it was a party, it was entitled to enjoy the benefits\nof a final adjudication on the merits and it was no longer subject to the district court’s\njurisdiction. ENA insists that it was fully and finally dismissed from the case. Qwest advances\nthe same argument. Qwest also argues that as parties to the contracts that Syringa sought to void,\nQwest and ENA were necessary and indispensable parties to the claims Syringa sought to add in\nCount Three.\n       “Jurisdiction is . . . a question of law and is reviewed de novo.” State v. Lute, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span>\n<span class=\"page\">837</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874774\"><a href=\"/opinion/874774/state-v-lute/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1257 (2011).\n       The arguments DOA, ENA, and Qwest raise are without merit. The fact that neither ENA\nnor Qwest was named as a defendant in Count Three is irrelevant. Neither party could have or\nshould have been a named defendant in Count Three because the cause of action alleged a breach\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fof a public duty by DOA, the governmental entity subject to the procurement statutes at issue.\nNeither ENA nor Qwest had or could have had any duty to comply with the statute because they\nare not governmental entities. Accordingly, there could be no claim “against” them under Count\nThree. Syringa did not need to name them within Count Three for jurisdiction to be proper. Both\nENA and Qwest were, however, interested and necessary parties under Idaho Code section 10-\n1211. There is no dispute that Syringa’s original complaint did join ENA and Qwest as parties.\n         This Court’s opinion in Syringa I did not dismiss ENA or Qwest from the case, nor was it\nnecessary on remand to amend Count Three to directly challenge ENA’s SBPO. Because Count\nThree alleged that DOA violated a multiple award procurement statute, it was implicit that each\ncontract could be found void due to illegality. Even at the time Syringa filed its original\ncomplaint, it was evident that if Syringa prevailed on its claim, the necessary result was that both\npublic contracts would be declared void. See I.C. § 67-5725. It would be logically inconsistent\nfor only one contract of a multiple award to be declared illegal and void where the alleged\nstatutory violation, as here, relates to the process of granting the multiple award. Thus, regardless\nof whether Syringa I would otherwise have resulted in the dismissal of ENA or Qwest, neither\nparty could be or was dismissed while it remained a necessary party based on Count Three. The\ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion that ENA was no longer a party was in error. Both ENA and\nQwest remained parties on remand because they were necessary parties on the pending Count\nThree. Syringa’s motion to amend its complaint was unnecessary because the original complaint\nsufficed to put all interested and necessary parties on notice of the basic allegations and likely\nremedies. Accordingly, the district court had jurisdiction over ENA and Qwest at all relevant\ntimes.\n         2. The district court did not commit error when it concluded it had an affirmative\n            duty to raise the issue of illegality of the SBPOs.\n         The district court held that a court has an affirmative duty to raise the issue of illegality at\nany stage in the litigation, regardless of whether the issue was pleaded by a party. The court\nquoted Quiring v. Quiring:\n                  A party to a contract, void as against public policy, cannot waive its\n         illegality by failure to specially plead the defense or otherwise, but whenever the\n         same is made to appear at any stage of the case, it becomes the duty of a court to\n         refuse to enforce it; again, a court of equity will not knowingly aid in the\n         furtherance of an illegal transaction; in harmony with this principle, it does not\n         concern itself as to the manner in which the illegality of a matter before it is\n         brought to its attention.\n\n\n                                                    9\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1223772\"><a href=\"/opinion/1223772/quiring-v-quiring/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1223772\"><a href=\"/opinion/1223772/quiring-v-quiring/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (1997). The district court perceived that it was “not free\nto ignore this issue or to countenance the continuation of contracts that resulted from violation of\nstate procurement law.”\n       DOA argues that the district court had no such independent duty to invalidate the SBPOs.\nDOA contends Quiring holds that a party to a contract cannot waive the illegality of a contract\nthat is void as against public policy and thereby require the Court to knowingly enforce the\ncontract. DOA insists that Quiring is inapplicable because Syringa was not a party to the SBPOs\nand none of the parties to the SBPOs are seeking judicial enforcement of the agreements.\n       DOA asserts that the more recent case of City of Meridian v. Petra Inc. applies instead of\nQuiring. In Petra, this Court rejected Meridian’s contention that a contract between Meridian\nand Petra was illegal and unenforceable due to Petra’s failure to post a payment and performance\nbond as required by Idaho Code section 54-4512. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444–445, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251–\n252 (2013). We held that the contract was not illegal, despite the violation of the bonding statute,\nbecause the contract itself was neither made for the purpose of furthering anything illegal nor\nfounded on something illegal. Id. at 446, 299 P.3d at 253.\n       In its analysis of Petra, DOA makes two incorrect statements. First, DOA represents that\nthis Court stated in Petra that a contract is only illegal if it cannot be performed without violating\napplicable law. There was no such holding in Petra. Rather, Petra acknowledged that a contract\nmay be illegal if it cannot be performed without violating the law, but did not hold that illegal\nperformance is the only way a contract may be illegal. Indeed, the language in Petra immediately\nfollowing DOA’s quote demonstrates the inaccuracy of DOA’s assertion:\n               This Court has similarly found that “[a]n illegal contract is one that rests\n       on illegal consideration consisting of any act or forbearance which is contrary to\n       law or public policy.” Quiring v. Quiring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1223772\"><a href=\"/opinion/1223772/quiring-v-quiring/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1223772\"><a href=\"/opinion/1223772/quiring-v-quiring/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 701\n       (1997). Furthermore, contracts prohibited by law are illegal “and hence\n       unenforceable.” Id. This Court has also held that contracts that are “made for the\n       purpose of furthering any matter or thing prohibited by statute ... [are] void.

DOA quotes\nSyringa I and the district court, but none of the quoted material is a declaration or legal\nconclusion by either court that the SBPOs were valid. They merely recite underlying facts or\nprocedural history. It is simply not true that either court has ever declared the SBPOs valid.\n       This Court exercises free review over the trial court’s conclusions of law. Quiring, 130\nIdaho at 563, 944 P.2d at 698. The district court’s determination that it was obligated to raise the\nissue of illegality was a legal conclusion, which will, therefore, be reviewed de novo.\n       The district court correctly concluded that Quiring imposed on it a duty to invalidate the\nSBPOs if they were unlawful. If the SBPOs were void for violating state procurement laws, as\nthe district court ultimately concluded, then it was proper for the district court to find that it had\nan independent duty to invalidate them. We affirm the district court’s holding that it had a duty\nto raise the issue of illegality of the SBPOs, regardless of whether Syringa could raise that issue\non remand.\n       3. The district court did not err in treating ENA’s motion to dismiss as a motion\n          for summary judgment.\n       On remand, Syringa moved for summary judgment. ENA moved for dismissal on judicial\nestoppel and res judicata grounds. The district court treated ENA’s motion to dismiss as a\nmotion under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), alleging failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted. Because the district court found that the motion involved\nconsideration of matters outside the pleadings, it treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for\nsummary judgment. The district court found that it need not address the merits of ENA’s motion\nto dismiss prior to Syringa’s motion for summary judgment.\n       ENA alleges that the district court “decided to ignore the issues” raised in its motion to\ndismiss, which denied ENA due process of law, the ability to conduct discovery and\ninvestigation, and the opportunity to develop facts that would support its defenses. ENA asserts\nthat Rule 12(b) does not permit a district court to convert a motion to dismiss where the motion\noffers no disputed issues of fact.\n       “When this Court reviews an order dismissing an action pursuant to I.R.C.P. 12(b)(6), we\napply the same standard of review we apply to a motion for summary judgment.” Losser v.\nBradstreet, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672−73, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581193/losser-v-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760−61 (2008). “This Court reviews an\nappeal from an order of summary judgment de novo, and this Court’s standard of review is the\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fsame as the standard used by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.” Curlee\nv.

The Court has\nnot directly addressed the precise issue of whether a district court errs when treating a motion to\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Because the Court reviews trial court decisions on\nboth motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment under the de novo standard, and\nbecause the decision was a conclusion of law, the Court will apply de novo review to the district\ncourt’s decision.\n       If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the\n       pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the\n       pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be\n       treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and\n       all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made\n       pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\nI.R.C.P. 12(b). “Where a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted is supported by information outside of the pleadings, the motion is treated as a motion\nfor summary judgment.” McCann v. McCann, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874028\"><a href=\"/opinion/874028/mccann-v-mccann/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829 (2012).\nENA misconstrues the standard by focusing on whether there were disputed facts rather than on\nwhether matters outside the pleading were presented. In addition to citing to two filed versions of\nSyringa’s complaint, ENA also cited to Syringa I and to two of the district court’s previously\nfiled decisions. Thus, ENA presented matters outside the pleadings and it was, therefore, not\nerror for the district court to treat the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.\n       ENA further argues that the district court violated Rule 12(b) by not giving ENA\nadequate notice that its motion to dismiss would be treated as a motion for summary judgment.\nThe language in Rule 12(b) is mandatory rather than discretionary, requiring that “the motion\nshall be treated as one for summary judgment.” I.R.C.P. 12(b) (emphasis added). ENA should\nhave known that the court would treat its motion as a motion for summary judgment because\nENA presented matters beyond the pleadings. The rule requires that when a motion to dismiss is\ntreated as a motion for summary judgment, “all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to\npresent all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.” I.R.C.P. 12(b). ENA had a\nreasonable opportunity to present all pertinent material—its own conduct necessitated the\ntreatment of its motion under Rule 56 instead of Rule 12. Indeed, it leveraged that opportunity\nprecisely by including in its motion matters outside the pleadings. There is no legal remedy\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\favailable to it now for its decision not to include more or different materials in support of its\nmotion.\n       ENA suggests that the rule requires advance actual notice to the moving party that the\ncourt will treat the motion as one for summary judgment, so that it has the opportunity to present\nmaterial made pertinent by Rule 56. This does not conform to the rule or its purpose. Any notice\nrequirement in Rule 12(b) presumably exists so that non-moving parties might adequately\nprepare to defend against summary judgment rather than dismissal. The moving party is\nnecessarily already on notice of that fact. ENA cites to Federal Practice and Procedure for the\nproposition that the notice requirement consists of providing “an adequate opportunity to\ndemonstrate why summary judgment should not be granted” to the party against whom judgment\nis entered. 10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 2720, at 27 (3d ed. 1998). That does not suggest that the moving party is also\nentitled to independent notice; it merely acknowledges the necessity of informing adverse parties\nso that they may prepare to defend against the motion. This is in accord with how the equivalent\nfederal rules have been interpreted.\n       In Capital Partners Int’l Ventures, Inc. v. Danzas Corp., a federal trial court held that\n       [i]f matters outside the pleadings are presented to the court, the motion for\n       judgment on the pleadings is converted into a summary judgment motion under\n       Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Before summary judgment may\n       be entered, the non-moving party must be given notice and an opportunity to\n       respond. Notice occurs when a represented party has reason to know the court will\n       look outside of the pleadings.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310942\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310942/capital-partners-intern-ventures-inc-v-danzas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This Court has\nexpressed a “preference for interpreting the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure in conformance with\nthe interpretation placed upon the same language in the federal rules.” Obendorf v. Terra Hug\nSpray Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569993\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569993/obendorf-v-terra-hug-spray-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (2008). Both the Idaho rule and the\nfederal rule use identical language requiring that motions to dismiss and motions for judgment on\nthe pleadings be treated as summary judgment motions when matters outside the pleadings are\npresented. I.R.C.P. 12(b), 12(c); F.R.C.P. 12(c), 12(d). Here, even if ENA required notice, it had\nadequate notice because it had reason to know the court would look outside of the pleadings—\nENA itself asked the court to do so by referencing additional materials.\n       ENA also argues that it was improperly denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard on\nits motion to dismiss. In support of this line of argument, it claims that the district court ruled\n\n\n                                                13\n\fthat ENA’s SBPO was void before finding it had jurisdiction over ENA, that Syringa’s motion\nfor partial summary judgment was untimely as against ENA, and that it lacked adequate notice of\nSyringa’s motion.\n       First, ENA asserts without citation that “the district court found against ENA on the\nmerits without formally holding that ENA was a party!” and that “the District Court ruled ENA’s\ncontract with the State void before it found it had jurisdiction over ENA.” The record does not\nsupport these claims. The district court found that all necessary parties, including ENA, had been\njoined and that the Court had jurisdiction. In the same memorandum decision and order, the\ncourt then found that the SBPOs, as amended to divide the work between Qwest and ENA, were\nvoid. ENA has not shown that the district court ruled ENA’s SBPO void before finding it had\njurisdiction over ENA. Even if ENA had made such a showing, our conclusion that ENA\nremained a party on remand renders the point irrelevant.\n       Second, ENA asserts that Syringa’s motion for partial summary judgment was untimely\nas against ENA because it was not filed in compliance with Rule 56(a), which requires filing\n“after the expiration of twenty (20) days from the service of process upon the adverse party or\nthat party’s appearance in the action.” ENA was originally served process in this action in\nDecember 2009 and appeared repeatedly in 2010 and thereafter. Syringa filed its motion for\npartial summary judgment on March 20, 2014 and served it on ENA on April 25, 2014. At the\ndistrict court’s order, Syringa also served ENA again on July 3, 2014. The district court presided\nover a hearing on the motion on October 10, 2014.\n       The timing requirement in I.R.C.P. 56(a) was not violated in this case, despite the fact\nthat Syringa filed its motion before, rather than at least twenty days after, ENA was re-served\nprocess. ENA apparently believes that if Syringa I operated to dismiss it from the case then the\ntwenty-day period specified in I.R.C.P. 56(a) would not begin to run until it were re-served or\nonce again appeared in the action. But there is no support in the language of the rule for this\ninterpretation. The plain language of the rule allows a party seeking a declaratory judgment to\nmove for summary judgment any time after the expiration of twenty days from the service of\nprocess upon the adverse party or that party’s appearance in the action. I.R.C.P. 56(a). ENA was\nserved process in 2009 and appeared in the action by 2010. Syringa’s March 20, 2014 motion\nwas at least four years beyond the rule’s twenty day requirement. ENA’s invocation of Rule\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f56(a) does not help its case. Even if ENA’s argument were convincing, the point is irrelevant in\nlight of our conclusion that ENA remained a party on remand.\n       Further, Rule 61 provides in relevant part that “[t]he court at every stage of the\nproceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the\nsubstantial rights of the parties.” I.R.C.P. 61. The purpose of the twenty-day requirement in Rule\n56(a) is presumably to ensure that defendants have adequate notice and opportunity to prepare to\ndefend against summary judgment. Here, even if the rule applied, ENA has not shown that any\nrelated procedural error or defect affected its substantial rights. Indeed, it cannot do so. ENA was\nserved with the motion on April 25, 2014 and the hearing took place October 10, 2014, over five\nmonths later. ENA had more than adequate notice and opportunity to prepare to defend the\nmotion. This same reasoning applies to ENA’s separate argument that it lacked adequate notice\nof Syringa’s motion.\n       ENA also argues that it lacked notice because Syringa’s motion specifically listed only\nDOA as a party against which it sought relief. This argument fails for the same reason that ENA\nremained a party on remand: ENA knew or should have known that judgment in Syringa’s favor\nwould be adverse to ENA’s interests because the necessary consequence of a holding for Syringa\nwas that ENA’s contract would be void. It was logically impossible for the district court to grant\nSyringa’s requested relief without also harming ENA’s interests, and it is entirely consistent—\neven necessary—to charge ENA with knowledge of this fact.\n       Moreover, no fewer than six individuals involved in ENA’s defense were served on\nAugust 21, 2014 with Syringa’s notice of hearing indicating that Syringa’s motion for partial\nsummary judgment would be argued on October 10, 2014 at 1:00 P.M. The record of actions\nmakes clear that as of August 20, 2014, ENA’s own motion to dismiss was scheduled for\nargument at the same day and time. For ENA to argue that it lacked notice or an opportunity to\nrespond to Syringa’s motion for partial summary judgment is simply inaccurate. ENA knew of\nthe motion, knew it would be argued at the same time as its own motion, and had several months\nin which it could have developed a merits argument opposing Syringa’s motion. ENA could have\nfiled a responsive brief in opposition up to October 3, 2014, seven days prior to the hearing.\nI.R.C.P. 7(b)(3)(E). It did not do so.\n       Finally, ENA argues that its rights were violated when the district court deprived it of the\nbenefits of its contract without an opportunity to protect its interests. ENA asserts that it should\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fhave had the opportunity to submit additional materials to the court and would have done so if\nproper procedure had been followed. ENA fails to suggest what additional materials it might\nhave submitted. Following entry of the district court’s decision on the dispositive motions, ENA\nfiled a motion for reconsideration, which would have been an opportunity to present new or\nadditional facts or materials but ENA chose not to do so. In any event, as addressed above, ENA\nhad a “reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent.” I.R.C.P. 12(b).\n       It appears that ENA made a strategic gamble not to argue the merits of whether its SBPO\nwas void in order to preserve its numerous procedural arguments. ENA lost that gamble. It\ncannot now win an argument that it is procedurally unjust to void its illegal contract merely\nbecause it failed to defend on the merits. ENA cannot avoid an adverse judgment here by\nclaiming it had no opportunity to plead its case when it is clear that it did in fact have ample\nopportunity.\n       Finally, the district court did not ignore the arguments in ENA’s motion to dismiss, as\nENA argues. ENA asserted in its motion that judicial estoppel and res judicata precluded\nSyringa from amending its complaint to challenge ENA’s SBPO. The district court expressly\nacknowledged ENA’s arguments and rejected them. The district court determined that it had an\nindependent and affirmative duty to raise the issue of illegality. This ruling rendered it irrelevant\nwhether Syringa, as a party, could be precluded or estopped from challenging ENA’s SBPO.\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s treatment of ENA’s motion to dismiss as a motion for\nsummary judgment.\n       4. The district court did not err in holding that the case was not moot.\n       DOA and Qwest argue that the case became moot when DOA, ENA, and Qwest mutually\npurported to rescind the amendments to the original SBPOs in July 2014. They assert that the\nrescission was effective and that thereafter there was no longer a justiciable controversy and,\ntherefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Syringa argues that\nthe amended contracts were void, that void contracts cannot be rescinded and, therefore, the\nattempted rescission was futile. The district court found that “DOA’s efforts to salvage these\nvoid contracts were futile and of no effect. An agreement made in violation of the state’s\nprocurement law cannot be fixed or cured.”\n       “Justiciability issues, such as mootness, are freely reviewed.” State v.

This is\nconsistent with the Black’s Law Dictionary definition of a void contract as “[a] contract that is of\nno legal effect, so that there is really no contract in existence at all.” Black’s Law Dictionary 374\n(9th ed. 2009). We now hold that void contracts may not be rescinded because they are deemed\nnever to have existed. A purported rescission of a void contract is, therefore, necessarily a\nnullity. Accordingly, there was nothing to rescind if the contracts were void. The purported\nrescission of the amendments could have no legal effect and could not moot the case.\n       5. The district court did not err in ruling that the SBPOs were not saved by a\n          severability clause.\n       Qwest and DOA argue that a severability clause in the original SBPOs requires that the\namendments, if invalid, must be severed from the original SBPOs. According to affidavit\ntestimony, severability clauses incorporated by reference into the SBPOs provide language\nmaterially similar to the following: “[i]n the event any term of the Contract is held to be invalid\nor unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining terms of the Contract will\nremain in force.”\n       The district court rejected this severability argument, holding that because the original\nawards were part of a process used to make an illegal award, the process itself was flawed. This\nwas correct. By its plain language, the severability clause existed to save the enforceable terms\nwithin the SBPOs if any term were held invalid or unenforceable. The district court did not\nconclude that the SBPOs included an unenforceable term. Rather, the district court concluded,\ncorrectly, that DOA violated state procurement law in purporting to make the contracts, and that\nthe contracts were, therefore, necessarily void ab initio. Because void contracts are deemed never\nto have existed in the eyes of the law, there was no contract from which illegal terms could be\nsevered. Thompson, 144 Idaho at 318, 160 P.3d at 757. The contracts were void in their entirety\nand could not be saved by severing any particular clauses.\n       6. The district court did not commit reversible error in permitting Syringa to\n          amend its complaint or challenge the SBPOs on remand.\n       DOA and Qwest argue that the district court erred in permitting Syringa to challenge a\ncontract under which it reaped substantial financial benefit. Both parties also argue that the\ndistrict court erred in failing to bar Syringa from challenging the original SBPOs on remand.\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fENA argues that res judicata and judicial estoppel precluded Syringa from challenging the\noriginal SBPOs on remand.\n       “[I]t is well-settled that where an order of a lower court is correct, but based on an\nerroneous theory, the order will be affirmed upon the correct theory.” Grabicki v.

The district court had the authority to declare the\nSBPOs void regardless of whether Syringa had properly challenged them. Even if the district\ncourt had erred in determining whether Syringa could challenge the SBPOs, that error was\nharmless in light of its duty to independently declare the SBPOs void if it found them to be\nunlawful. The Court need not and does not undertake further analysis of these issues.\nB. The district court’s order concluding the SBPOs were void was substantively correct.\n       On summary judgment, the district court concluded that the SBPOs, as amended, were\nmade in violation of Idaho Code section 67-5718(2), IDAPA 38.05.01.052 and Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A and that, as such, the agreements were void. The district court held that in\nSyringa I this Court ruled that DOA violated state procurement law and that the ruling\nestablished the law of the case, binding the parties and the district court.\n       DOA and Qwest appealed the district court’s order declaring that the SBPOs were void,\nin part by challenging the district court’s conclusion that the law of the case doctrine applies.\nThey argue that with respect to Count Three, Syringa I addressed only the threshold issue of\nwhether Syringa had standing to pursue the claim and that the Court’s comments regarding any\nalleged violation are necessarily dicta. In response, Syringa refers to language in Syringa I that\nappears to unambiguously state that DOA violated the law.\n       Because this challenge is to the district court’s grant of summary judgment, we review\nthis issue de novo. Curlee v. Kootenai Cnty. Fire & Rescue, 148 Idaho at 391, 394, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637797\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637797/curlee-v-kootenai-county-fire-rescue/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n461 (2008). “When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, disputed facts are construed in\nfavor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record\nare drawn in favor of the non-moving party.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       The law of the case doctrine does not apply to this issue, and the district court erred in\nholding otherwise.

There is admittedly strong and direct language in Syringa I that would appear to\nconclusively establish that DOA violated the law. However, we ultimately concluded that\n“Syringa has alleged,” rather than demonstrated, an injury sufficient to confer standing. Id. at 62,\n305 P.3d at 506 (emphasis added). Further, we did not order entry of judgment in Syringa’s\nfavor; we merely held that “Syringa has standing to challenge the amended contract to Qwest.”\nId. Finally, in Syringa I, Syringa had appealed the entry of summary judgment against it. Id. at\n59, 305 P.3d at 503. As the non-moving party at the district court, we were obligated both to\nconstrue disputed facts and to draw reasonable inferences in Syringa’s favor. Curlee, 148 Idaho\nat 394, 224 P.3d at 461. The fact that the Court did not choose in drafting its opinion in Syringa I\nto repeatedly use hedging language such as “Syringa alleges that . . .” or “As Syringa claims, . .\n.” does not somehow cause its ruling on the threshold issue of standing to become authoritative\non the merits. Accordingly, the district court erred in applying the law of the case doctrine to\nhold that we conclusively determined in Syringa I that the SBPOs, as amended, were void.\n       However, the Court “will uphold the decision of a trial court if any alternative legal basis\ncan be found to support it.” Daleiden, 139 Idaho at 470–471, 80 P.3d at 1071–1072. “Summary\njudgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Curlee, 148 Idaho at 394, 224 P.3d at 461. “If\nthe evidence presented shows no disputed issues of material fact, then all that remains are\nquestions of law, over which this Court exercises free review.” State ex rel.

First, DOA granted SBPOs to Qwest and ENA as a multiple award under Idaho Code\nsection 67-5718A. Second, less than one month later, DOA amended the SBPOs to assign to\nQwest “all IEN technical network services” and to constitute ENA as “the Service Provider listed\non the State’s Federal E-rate Form 471.”\n       Idaho Code section 67-5718A(1) permits “an award of a contract to two (2) or more\nbidders to furnish the same or similar property where more than one (1) contractor is necessary”\nunder certain circumstances. Section 67-5718A(3) provides that “[w]here a contract for property\nhas been awarded to two (2) or more bidders in accordance with this section, a state agency shall\nmake purchases from the contractor whose terms and conditions regarding price, availability,\nsupport services and delivery are most advantageous to the agency.” Section 67-5718(2) requires\nthat requests for proposals “shall describe the property to be acquired in sufficient detail to\napprise a bidder of the exact nature or functionality of the property required.” Section 67-5725\nprovides that “[a]ll contracts or agreements made in violation of the provisions of this chapter\nshall be void.”\n       Under these facts, summary judgment for Syringa is proper. We now specifically hold\nwhat we said in the context of standing in Syringa I:\n               The amendments to the purchase orders issued to ENA and Qwest were, in\n       effect, changing the RFP after the bids were opened. The RFP solicited proposals\n       from bidders who were able to perform the entire contract which, under the\n       wording of the RFP, would be a “total end-to-end service support solution.” . . .\n       The RFP did not seek bids for one contract to provide the backbone and a separate\n       contract to be the E-rate service provider. . . .\n\n       By amending the contracts so that Qwest and ENA were no longer furnishing the\n       same or similar property, the State has, in effect, changed the RFP after the bids\n       had been opened in violation of I.C. § 67-5718(2) and IDAPA 38.05.01.052. The\n       separate contracts as amended no longer conform to the RFP’s description of the\n       property to be acquired. The description of property to be provided by Qwest\n       under its amended contract is not a minor deviation from the property to be\n       provided by the successful bidder under the RFP, nor is the property to be\n       provided by ENA under its amended contract. “[M]ere schemes to evade law,\n       once their true character is established, are impotent for the purpose intended.\n       Courts sweep them aside as so much rubbish.” O’Bryant, 78 Idaho at 325, 303\n       P.2d at 678.\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f155 Idaho at 61−62, 305 P.3d at 505−06. What were supposed to have been side-by-side, end-to-\nend competing contracts turned into a non-competitive blended arrangement that left State users\nwith no lower cost choice.\n       DOA argues that the SBPOs themselves were lawful and that if the amendments were\nillegal the proper remedy is to void the amendments while upholding the SBPOs. Qwest echoes\nthis argument, also asserting that portions of the SBPOs unrelated to the IEN should be upheld\nbecause they were unrelated to the illegal amendments. In response, Syringa argues that material\namendments to competitively bid public contracts are impermissible and illegal amendments can\nrender both the amendment and the underlying contract void. Although Idaho law has not\npreviously addressed this precise issue, McQuillin on Municipal Corporations provides that a\npublic contract will “be set aside where specifications are changed after the bidding has been\nclosed.” 10 McQuillin Mun. Corp. § 29:69 (3d ed.). Additionally, “[w]here there is deviation\nfrom the requirements of public bidding, the proper procedure is to readvertise, and secure\nanother open competitive bidding so that all of the bidders would be on an equal footing.” Id. at\n§ 29:35. The Court will adopt and apply these rules in this case.\n       Here, DOA’s amendments rendered the SBPOs unlawful in that they changed “the\nproperty to be acquired” under each SBPO, in violation of Idaho Code section 67-5718(2). The\nchanges were material in that they changed the scope of the work to be performed under each\nSBPO of the multiple award. The amendments occurred less than one month after bidding had\nbeen closed. This tainted the public procurement process and permanently invalidated the\nSBPOs. The Appellants essentially seek to close the barn door after substantial funds had been\nadvanced by the State under the unlawfully amended SBPOs. As performed, the SBPOs and their\nrespective amendments became inseparable. The district court’s entry of summary judgment on\ngrounds of illegality was therefore proper because there was no genuine issue or dispute as to a\nmaterial fact. We affirm the district court’s order holding that both the ENA SBPO and the\nQwest SBPO are void.\nC. The district court did not commit error or abuse its discretion in denying Syringa’s\n   motion to include in its judgment an order directing DOA, under Idaho Code section\n   67-5725, to demand repayment of money advanced under the SBPOs.\n       After summary judgment was granted in its favor, Syringa submitted a proposed form of\njudgment that would have required the Administrator of the Division of Purchasing within DOA\nto demand repayment of all sums of money advanced by the State of Idaho in consideration of\n\n\n                                                21\n\fthe SBPOs, as required by Idaho Code section 67-5725.5 The district court did not include\nSyringa’s proposed language in its judgment. Syringa subsequently filed a motion to amend the\njudgment or, in the alternative, for partial reconsideration and/or clarification of the district\ncourt’s relevant memorandum decision and order. The district court again rejected Syringa’s\nproposed language, explaining that the application of Idaho Code section 67-5725 involved\ndevelopment of factual and legal issues that had not been presented. Syringa cross-appealed the\ndistrict court’s refusal to include the proposed form of judgment.\n           Syringa argues that section 67-5725 sets forth mandatory consequences that apply as a\nresult of the district court’s ruling that the SBPOs are void. Syringa asserts that the district court\nerred or abused its discretion by excluding the proposed paragraph from its judgment. Syringa\ndoes not articulate why or how the district court was obligated to include the requested language.\n           This Court reviews an order denying a motion to alter or amend a judgment for an abuse\nof discretion.

Because Syringa’s motion was a “motion to amend judgment, or in the alternative, for\npartial reconsideration” both standards of review are implicated.\n           The outcome is the same under both standards. Syringa is correct that the statute provides\nmandatory consequences. However, it was not the district court’s duty in this circumstance to\ninclude the requested order in its judgment. Section 67-5725 does impose an obligation on the\nproper officer “of the state of Idaho” to seek repayment of money advanced under the void\n\n\n5\n    Section 67-5725 provides in relevant part:\n           All contracts or agreements made in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be void and\n           any sum of money advanced by the state of Idaho in consideration of any such contract or\n           agreement shall be repaid forthwith. In the event of refusal or delay when repayment is demanded\n           by the proper officer of the state of Idaho, under whose authority such contract or agreement shall\n           have been made or entered into, every person so refusing or delaying, together with his surety or\n           sureties, shall be forthwith prosecuted at law for the recovery of such sum of money so advanced.\n\n\n                                                           22\n\fSBPOs, if repayment is refused or delayed. But it imposes no obligation on the district court to\npreemptively order that DOA comply with this obligation. If the appropriate State officer fails to\nperform this statutory obligation, the State’s chief legal officer can step forward to make the\nState whole for these unfortunate violations of State law.\n       Because Syringa has not shown that the district court had a duty to order DOA to comply\nwith the statutory obligation imposed by Idaho Code section 67-5725, it cannot have been error\nor an abuse of discretion for the district court to refuse to include such an order in its judgment.\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s denial of Syringa’s combined motion to amend\njudgment or to reconsider.\nD. The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Syringa.\n       The district court found that on remand Syringa was the prevailing party and it awarded\nSyringa attorney fees under Idaho Code sections 12-117, 12-120(3), and 12-121. The district\ncourt stated that “from the overall view, while Syringa lost a number of preliminary battles, in\nthe end Syringa won the war that mattered decisively, after a lengthy and expensive challenge to\na state agency willing and able to devote significant resources defending its conduct.”\n       DOA challenges these determinations, arguing that Syringa was not the prevailing party\nand that a fee award under section 12-117 is improper because the case deals with an issue of\nfirst impression. DOA also challenges the propriety of the award under sections 12-120(3) and\n12-121.\n       “The district court’s determination of prevailing party status for the purpose of awarding\nattorney fees and costs is within the court’s sound discretion, and will not be disturbed on appeal\nunless there is an abuse of discretion.” Hobson Fabricating Corp. v.

Under the abuse of\ndiscretion standard, “[s]o long as the trial court recognized the matter as discretionary, acted\nwithin the outer boundaries of the court’s discretion, and reached its conclusion through an\nexercise of reason, this Court will not disturb the decision on appeal.” Slaathaug, 132 Idaho at\n707, 979 P.2d at 109.\n       1. The district court did not err in determining that Syringa was the prevailing\n          party.\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\f       Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(B) guides the prevailing party analysis: “In\ndetermining which party to an action is a prevailing party and entitled to costs, the trial court\nshall in its sound discretion consider the final judgment or result of the action in relation to the\nrelief sought by the respective parties.” We stated in Hobson that “the issue . . . is not who\nsucceeded on more individual claims, but rather who succeeded on the main issue of the action.”\n154 Idaho at 49, 294 P.3d at 175.\n       “In determining which party prevailed in an action where there are claims and\ncounterclaims between opposing parties, the court determines who prevailed ‘in the action.’ That\nis, the prevailing party question is examined and determined from an overall view, not a claim-\nby-claim analysis.” Eighteen Mile Ranch, LLC v.

Although this case is not one where there are “claims and\ncounterclaims between opposing parties,” we nonetheless adopt and apply the “overall view”\nhere because that approach is equally appropriate in an action involving multiple claims.\n       In Idaho Military Historical Soc’y, Inc. v. Maslen, the plaintiff was deemed the\nprevailing party after having been awarded equitable relief despite not succeeding on a variety of\nsecondary issues. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630–631, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1072</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1078–1079 (2014). In that case, we\nupheld the district court’s conclusion that in determining the prevailing party the court could\nconsider the conduct that “primarily precipitated” the lawsuit. Id. at 630, 329 P.3d at 1078. The\ninstant case is similar to Maslen in that each of Syringa’s claims, including those on which it did\nnot prevail, was primarily precipitated by the conduct challenged in Count Three—DOA’s\nviolation of the procurement statutes in awarding the SBPOs.\n       DOA has failed to show, in light of applicable case law, that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in determining that Syringa was the prevailing party. Accordingly, we affirm the\ndistrict court’s holding that Syringa was the prevailing party.\n       2. The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Syringa fees under\n          Idaho Code section 12-117.\n       Under Idaho Code section 12-117(1), “in any proceeding involving as adverse parties a\nstate agency . . . and a person, . . . the court hearing the proceeding, . . . shall award the\nprevailing party reasonable attorney’s fees, witness fees and other reasonable expenses, if it finds\nthat the nonprevailing party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.” “Where an agency\nhas no authority to take a particular action, it acts without a reasonable basis in fact or law.”\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fFischer v.

If an agency acts without any authority, it is acting\n        without a reasonable basis in law or fact. Id.\nThe district court held that DOA’s continued defense of the legality of the SBPOs after Syringa I\nlacked a reasonable basis in law or fact.\n        DOA argues that, as a matter of law, “[a] party did not act without a reasonable basis in\nfact or law if it raised an issue of first impression in Idaho or presented a legitimate question for\nthis Court to address.” Hobson Fabricating, 154 Idaho at 53, 294 P.3d at 179. DOA points out\nthat its defense of Count Three before Syringa I was so successful that the district court\ndismissed the claim, and that this dismissal demonstrates the reasonableness of DOA’s defense.\nAdditionally, DOA argues that Syringa has conceded the case involved novel, difficult legal\nquestions that required extensive effort.\n        Syringa argues that DOA acted without basis in law because it violated Idaho Code\nsections 67-5718(2) and 67-5718A. It further argues that the district court’s award of fees\nsquarely vindicates both purposes served by section 12-117: serving as a deterrent to future\nunlawful action and providing some relief to Syringa, which bore a significant financial burden\nattempting to correct DOA’s actions.\n        Finally, DOA argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding Syringa\nattorney fees because Syringa failed to distinguish between time spent litigating Count Three and\ntime spent litigating its other claims. Syringa disputes this allegation, claiming that the district\ncourt expressly recognized, based on its review of Syringa’s materials in support of its fee\nrequest, that Syringa segregated and sought only reasonable fees related to Count Three. Indeed,\nthe district court stated that it\n        has concluded that Syringa’s fee request from and after March 29, 2013 is\n        reasonable. The Court has reviewed all of the entries and fees requested prior to\n        March 29, 2013. The description of the work is detailed. It appears that Plaintiff is\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f        not seeking any fees related to the appeal. It also appears that Syringa is seeking\n        only fees related to its pursuit of Count Three, on which Syringa prevailed.\nDOA specifically references time entries related to researching the Idaho Tort Claims Act, a 42\nUSC § 1983 claim, a qui tam action, sovereign immunity, and other issues. But as to each entry,\nDOA’s reasoning why it was unrelated to Count Three is either absent or conclusory. DOA\nasserts that if any of the awarded fees were unwarranted, the entire award must be reversed. See\nRockefeller v. Grabow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581320/rockefeller-v-grabow/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581320/rockefeller-v-grabow/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 (2001). Whether Rockefeller\napplies or controls here is irrelevant.\n        DOA has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in granting Syringa\nattorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-117. The court recognized the issue of awarding\nattorney fees as one of discretion and it acted within the outer bounds of its discretion and by\nexercising reason when it cited mandatory precedent holding that an agency acts without a\nreasonable basis in fact or law when it acts without authority. DOA lacked the authority to\nviolate Idaho Code sections 67-5718 and 67-5718A. Rather than recognizing that the actions of\nformer director Gwartney corrupted the procurement process, DOA doggedly defended that\nprocess to the bitter end. The district court was within its discretion to find that nothing in the\nprotracted proceedings subsequently rendered DOA’s defense reasonable. Further, DOA has not\nshown that any time entries, including the ones it expressly mentions, were unrelated to Count\nThree. Some of the entries do, on their face, seem unrelated to the allegations in Count Three.\nHowever, in this multi-year, multi-party litigation it is conceivable that any number of ancillary\nissues might arise and be related, if only tangentially, to the main issue. Because DOA has not\nmade a specific showing that any particular time entries cannot possibly have been related to\nCount Three, we affirm the district court’s exercise of discretion in awarding attorney fees in the\nspecified amount. In light of this holding, we need not review the correctness of the district\ncourt’s alternative grounds for awarding Syringa attorney fees under Idaho Code sections 12-\n120(3) and 12-121.\nE. No party is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n        ENA seeks attorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code section 12-120(3). Syringa seeks\nattorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code sections 12-117, 12-120(3), and 12-121. DOA seeks\nattorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code sections 12-117 and 12-121. For a party to recover\nfees under any of these provisions, it must be the prevailing party. Where adverse parties have\neach prevailed in part on appeal, neither is the prevailing party. Wright v. Bd. of Psychological\n\n\n                                                26\n\fExam’rs (In re Bd. of Psychologist Exam’rs’ Final Order), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874297\"><a href=\"/opinion/874297/in-re-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1137 (2010). ENA is not the prevailing party because it lost its appeal, and neither Syringa nor\nDOA are the prevailing party because they each successfully defended against the other’s appeal\nbut lost their own appeal. Accordingly, there is no prevailing party and, therefore, no party is\nentitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n                                           V.\n                                       CONCLUSION\n       We affirm the judgment of the district court.
