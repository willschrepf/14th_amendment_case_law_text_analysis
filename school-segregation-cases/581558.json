(“State Bank”) sued defendant-\n\nappellant First State Bank of Texas (“Bank of Texas”) to recover, under Texas\n\nlaw, the amount of a cashier’s check issued by Bank of Texas and two\n\ndocumentary drafts issued by Bank of Texas customer Buzz Speer. Bank of\n\nTexas counterclaimed to recover, under Oklahoma law, the face amount of a\n\ncashier’s check issued by State Bank and seven documentary drafts that appeared\n\n\n      *\n        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\fon their face to be issued by State Bank customer Ventura Classics. The trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to State Bank on its claims and in a non-jury\n\ntrial held that State Bank was not liable on any of Bank of Texas’s counterclaims.\n\nIn the appeal on the merits, only Bank of Texas’s counterclaims are at issue. The\n\nother appeal and cross-appeal concern the trial court’s award of costs and\n\nattorneys’ fees to State Bank.\n\n       These related appeals raise state law issues under Oklahoma and Texas law.\n\nExercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion   .\n\n                                             I\n\n       The banks’ customers, Speer and Ventura Classics, sold used automobiles\n\nto one another. Typically, payment was accomplished by means of a documentary\n\ndraft. The buyer of an automobile would prepare a documentary draft consisting\n\nof an envelope displaying payment information. The buyer would then send the\n\ndraft to the seller who would place the title documents for the automobile being\n\npurchased inside the envelope and deposit the documentary draft with his own\n\nbank. The seller’s bank would forward the draft and title document to the buyer’s\n\nbank for payment or collection. Once a draft was received by the buyer’s bank,\n\nthe bank would call the buyer and ask him to inspect the draft. The buyer was\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\frequired to verify the draft, determine whether the title documentation was in\n\norder, and instruct the bank either to pay the draft or to return the draft unpaid.\n\n      At issue in this appeal are seven documentary drafts drawn on Ventura’s\n\naccount and presented by Bank of Texas to State Bank for payment (“State Bank\n\ndrafts”). On receipt of the first five drafts, totaling $87,750, Bank of Texas gave\n\nSpeer immediate credit and Speer withdrew the funds before the drafts were\n\npresented to State Bank for payment or collection. When State Bank received the\n\nforwarded drafts, it called Ventura’s representative, Goss, to verify the drafts.\n\nGoss did not authorize payment. Accordingly, State Bank returned the drafts to\n\nBank of Texas unpaid. However, it did not do so until several days after the\n\nperiod stated on the drafts for payment or return.\n\n      On receipt of the returned drafts, Bank of Texas resubmitted the drafts to\n\nState Bank along with a handwritten note from Judy Massey, a vice president at\n\nBank of Texas, stating “Dispute of Date of Return.” The note was accompanied\n\nby several photocopied sections of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”)\n\nconcerning a bank’s payment deadlines. In response to the second receipt of the\n\ndrafts, an employee of State Bank, Teresa Bray, issued a cashier’s check in the\n\namount of $87,750 to pay for the drafts. The check was mailed to Bank of Texas\n\nbefore the State Bank employee responsible for Ventura’s account, Vice President\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fCoy Gallatin, was made aware of the issuance of the check. He was thus\n\nprevented from retrieving the check from the mail.\n\n      The following day, State Bank informed Bank of Texas that the cashier’s\n\ncheck had been issued mistakenly and sent without authorization and,\n\nconsequently, that a stop payment order was being placed on the check. Bank of\n\nTexas claimed to have received the check and submitted it for payment prior to\n\nreceipt of notice of the stop payment order. After receipt of the first five\n\ndocumentary drafts at issue, Bank of Texas received two additional drafts,\n\ntotaling $36,800, for which it gave immediate credit to Speer’s account followed\n\nby Speer’s immediate withdrawal of the funds.\n\n       After a bench trial, the district court ruled that State Bank was not liable\n\non Bank of Texas’s claims. See State Bank & Trust, N.A. v. First State Bank of\n\nTexas, No. 97-CV-277-B (N.D. Okla. Oct. 21, 1998) (“State Bank I”) (findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law). Bank of Texas appeals the district court’s ruling on\n\nits counterclaims.\n\n      The district court awarded State Bank $77,335.76 in attorneys’ fees and\n\n$14,250.24 in costs. See State Bank & Trust, N.A. v. First State Bank of Texas,\n\nNo. 97-CV-277-B, at *11-13 (N.D. Okla. Jun 21, 1999) (“State Bank III”). The\n\ncourt also awarded interest at the rate of 4.879% per annum. See id. Bank of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fTexas appealed these awards and State Bank cross-appealed arguing that the\n\ndistrict court improperly denied the award of certain costs and fees. 1\n\n                         II. State Bank’s Counter Claims\n\n      On appeal from a bench trial we review factual findings by the district\n\ncourt for clear error and the district court’s determinations of law de novo. See\n\nSanpete Water Conservancy Dist. v. Carbon Water Conservancy Dist., 226 F.3d\n\n1170, 1177-78 (10th Cir. 2000). A district court’s decision to admit or to exclude\n\nevidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Pierce v. Shorty Small’s of\n\nBranson, Inc., 137 F.3d 1190 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n                            A. Collecting v. Payor Bank\n\n      The trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that State Bank was not a\n\npayor bank under Oklahoma law with respect to the State Bank Drafts, but rather\n\nwas a collecting bank. Bank of Texas contests this finding and asserts that as a\n\npayor bank State Bank should be subject to strict liability for failure to pay the\n\ndrafts within the time allotted by statute. 2\n\n      1\n         Citations to the briefs and record in No. 98-5243, the appeal on the\nmerits, are to “[Party’s] Br. A” or “[Party’s] App. A.” Citations to the briefs and\nrecord in 99-5131, the appeal on the award of attorneys’ fees, are to “[Party’s] Br.\nB” or “[Party’s] App. B.”\n      2\n        Bank of Texas, citing the statement of undisputed facts in its own\nSummary Judgment Motion, claims that “State Bank admitted it is a payor bank\nwith respect to the Drafts.” (Appellant’s Br. A at 16). This claim is spurious.\nState Bank, in its response to Bank of Texas’s motion for summary judgment,\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      Under Oklahoma law, a payor bank is defined as “a bank that is the drawee\n\nof a draft,” Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-105(3), 3 and a drawee is the “person\n\nordered in a draft to make payment,” § 4-104(a)(8). A collecting bank is “a bank\n\nhandling an item for collection except the payor bank.” § 4-105(5). Section 4-106\n\ndetails when a bank is a collecting bank:\n\n          (a) If an item states that it is “payable through” a bank identified\n      in the item, (i) the item designates the bank as a collecting bank and\n      does not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item\n      may be presented for payment only by or through the bank.\n          (b) If an item states that it is “payable at” a bank identified in the\n      item, (i) the item designates the bank as a collecting bank and does\n      not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item may\n      be presented for payment only by or through the bank.\n          (c) If a draft names a nonbank drawee and it is unclear whether a\n      bank named in the draft is a co-drawee or a collecting bank, the bank\n      is a collecting bank.\n\n      In determining whether State Bank was a payor bank or a collecting bank, it\n\nis necessary to keep in mind the spirit of these terms of art. To the lay person\n\nunfamiliar with the UCC, it would seem that a collecting bank collects money\n\nfrom a payor bank. In fact, these terms do not describe a relationship between\n\ntwo banks, but rather characterize the type of relationship a bank has with its\n\n\n      2\n       (...continued)\nmade clear that it considered itself a collecting bank with regard to the drafts and\ndisagreed with Bank of Texas’s assertion of the so-called “undisputed fact” that\nState Bank was a payor bank. (I Appellant’s App. A at 208-210.)\n      3\n        Unless otherwise specified, all references to code sections in this opinion\nare to Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fcustomer. In South Carolina National Bank v. First Union National Bank, 427\n\nS.E.2d 169, 170 (S.C. 1993), the court distinguished a collecting bank from a\n\npayor bank in the following manner:\n\n      The receiving bank . . . either forwards payment from the buyer’s\n      account to the seller’s bank, or collects the payment from the buyer\n      and forwards it to the seller’s bank. The bank is a “payor bank”\n      when the draft is paid in the first way and is a “collecting bank”\n      when payment is made in the second manner.\n\nAt the outset, we note that because State Bank could not pay drafts drawn on\n\nVentura’s account unless authorized by Ventura, the relationship between State\n\nBank and its customer was in the nature of one between a collecting bank and its\n\ncustomer.\n\n      It is undisputed that when there is ambiguity as to whether the named bank\n\nin a draft is the co-drawee or the collecting bank, the named bank will be deemed\n\na collecting bank. See § 4-106(c). In the instant case, the parties disagree\n\nwhether the particular drafts at issue were ambiguous. Bank of Texas claims “the\n\nDrafts quite clearly show, as a matter of law, that State Bank is a payor bank.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. A at 17.)\n\n      The drafts contain Speer’s name on the “Pay to the order of” line. (See,\n\ne.g., II Appellant’s App. A at 412.) On the bottom left hand corner, the drafts are\n\ndesignated “To” State Bank and Trust; immediately next to State Bank’s address\n\nis written “Ventura Classic, Brian Goss.” (Id.) Notably, there is no account\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fnumber written on the drafts. Accompanying each draft was a “collection letter”\n\nstating, among other things, the amount to be collected, the number of days of\n\n“sight” (i.e., the number of business days in which the bank of the buyer had to\n\nreturn the drafts; the default is one day), and the words “Drawn on: Ventura\n\nClassics.” (See, e.g., id. at 413.)\n\n      Relying on Great Western Bank v. Steve James Ford, Inc., 915 F. Supp. 392\n\n(S.D. Ga. 1996), the trial court found that State Bank was a collecting bank with\n\nregard to the drafts at issue. Great Western Bank involved a check-kiting scheme\n\ngone bad. The facts were similar to the facts in this case. On receipt of the drafts\n\nat issue in Great Western, the plaintiff bank gave its customer immediate credit.\n\nSee id. at 394. The defendant bank’s customer did not authorize payment of the\n\ndrafts; thus, the defendant bank returned the drafts to the plaintiff bank. The\n\ndefendant bank did not, however, return the drafts within the period provided for\n\non the drafts, and so the plaintiff bank brought suit. See id. The defendant\n\nbank’s name appeared on the lower right side of the draft immediately next to the\n\nbank customer’s name and address. See id. at 395. As in the current case, the\n\ndrafts contained no account number. See id.\n\n      Applying Florida law, which is substantially similar to Oklahoma law in\n\nthis field, the court in Great Western found that it was “clear from looking at the\n\nsurrounding circumstances that [the defendant bank] was a collecting bank.” Id.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fThe key factors leading the court to this conclusion were the collection item sent\n\nand addressed to the defendant bank and “most importantly” the fact that the\n\ndefendant bank was not authorized to pay the drafts without its customer’s\n\napproval. Id. Because the drafts were ambiguous as to whether the defendant\n\nbank was a drawee/payor bank or a collecting bank, Florida’s adoption of the\n\nRevised UCC required the court to find the defendant bank was a collecting bank.\n\nSee id. at 396 (citing UCC § 4-106).\n\n      The current case is almost identical to Great Western. Not only were the\n\ndrafts accompanied by collection letters and was State Bank not authorized to pay\n\nthe drafts without Ventura’s approval, but the status of State Bank as a payor or\n\ncollecting bank was ambiguous from the face of the drafts due to the location of\n\nState Bank’s name and address on the face of the drafts. As such, the trial court\n\nproperly found that State Bank was a collecting bank. 4\n\n\n      4\n         Bank of Texas mistakenly relies on Reynolds-Wilson Lumber Co. v.\nPeople’s National Bank, 699 P.2d 146 (Okla. 1985) (per curiam), for the\nproposition that the drafts at issue in this case unambiguously establish State\nBank was a payor bank. Reynolds-Wilson was decided before the 1991 revisions\nto Oklahoma’s Commercial Code and relied on the prior default rule that a draft\nmust contain “an express statement on [its] face . . . indicating it is to be paid ‘at’\nor ‘through’ a bank, before that bank is to be treated as a mere conduit [i.e., a\ncollecting bank] and not a payor.” Id. at 151 (citations omitted). The 1991\nrevisions expressly reverse the presumption that a bank is a payor bank unless\nindicated otherwise. The revisions do this by providing that if a draft is\nambiguous as to whether a bank is a payor bank or a collecting bank, the bank is a\ncollecting bank. See § 4-106(c). It may be true that where a draft contains the\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Because we find the drafts at issue in this case ambiguous as to the status\n\nof State Bank and because Bank of Texas has not shown that the drafts were\n\nactually unambiguous, we affirm the district court’s finding that State Bank was a\n\ncollecting bank. Consequently, State Bank was not liable as a matter of law under\n\n§ 4-302(a)(2) for returning the drafts outside the allotted time. 5\n\n                              B. Transfer Warranties\n\n      Section 4-207(a) provides that a “collecting bank that transfers an item and\n\nreceives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any\n\nsubsequent collecting bank that . . . [a]ll signatures on the item are authentic and\n\n\n      (...continued)\n      4\n\nmagic words “at” or “through,” the bank to which the words refer is a collecting\nbank. However, it is no longer true, as the court held in Reynolds-Wilson, that\nwithout those words a bank is not a collecting bank. In fact, the official\ncommentary to Article 4 directly addresses this issue. The comment states:\n\n      Often a draft will show that it is drawn on a business drawee . . .\n      with the name of a bank appearing under the name of the business\n      drawee. Under current Oklahoma law, any ambiguity may cause the\n      bank to be deemed a co-drawee and payor bank along with the\n      company. Reynolds-Wilson Lumber Co.[, 699 P.2d at 149]. The\n      revisions will reverse that conclusion. Under Rev. Sec. 4-106(c),\n      where it is unclear whether the bank named in the draft is a co-\n      drawee or a collecting bank, the bank will be a collecting bank only.\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, Commentary on Revised Uniform Commercial Code\nArticles 3 and 4–Negotiable Instruments and Bank Deposits and Collections, as\nenacted in Oklahoma, Article 4, Co-Drawee v. Collecting Bank.\n      5\n         Because we affirm the district court’s holding that State Bank was a\ncollecting bank, we need not reach Bank of Texas’s argument that the trial court\nerred in finding that, even if State Bank was a payor bank, it had a valid defense\nto payment of the drafts under § 4-302(b).\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fauthorized.” Section 4-207(c) directs that “[a] person to whom [such] warranties\n\n. . . are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor\n\nas damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result\n\nof the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of\n\ninterest incurred as a result of the breach.” Article 4 of the Oklahoma\n\nCommercial Code takes its definition of “good faith” from section 3-103.      See §\n\n4-104(c). Section 3-103(a)(4) defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the\n\nobservance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.”\n\n       The trial court concluded that as a collecting bank State Bank was entitled\n\nto transfer warranties from Bank of Texas under § 4-207(a)(2) and      that Bank of\n\nTexas breached its warranty to State Bank that Goss’s signatures on the drafts\n\nwere authentic and authorized.\n\n       Bank of Texas argues it did not “transfer” the drafts to State Bank in\n\nexchange for the cashier’s check as required by the code for transfer warranties to\n\napply. In support of this contention, Bank of Texas claims the “undisputed\n\nevidence” shows that the cashier’s check was issued in response to Bank of\n\nTexas’s valid claim of late return rather than as a “settlement or other\n\nconsideration” for the drafts. (Appellant’s Br. A at 27.) Thus, Bank of Texas’s\n\nargument continues, transfer warranties do not apply because Bank of Texas\n\nreceived payment in satisfaction of its late return claim.\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\f       Bank of Texas’s assertion that the undisputed evidence shows the cashier’s\n\ncheck was issued in payment of its valid claim of late return, and not in payment\n\nof the drafts, is unsupported by the record and contradicted by Bank of Texas’s\n\nown admissions. The lower court’s determination of the reason motivating State\n\nBank’s issuance of the cashier’s check is a finding of fact. This finding of fact is\n\nof utmost importance to the conclusion of law concerning whether transfer\n\nwarranties applied and whether such warranties were breached by Bank of Texas.\n\nWe conclude that Bank of Texas has waived its right to challenge the factual\n\nfinding that the cashier’s check was issued in payment of the drafts and not in\n\npayment of its claim of late return because in the pretrial order it stipulated and\n\nadmitted to the fact that “State Bank issued the State Bank Cashier’s Check . . . to\n\npay the five state Bank Drafts.” (II Appellant’s App. A at 375.) Moreover, the\n\nevidence at trial gathered from both parties’ witnesses demonstrates that the\n\ncashier’s check was issued to pay for the drafts.\n\n       Even if Bank of Texas had not waived its arguments concerning the\n\nmotivation for issuing the cashier’s check, we would still affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court. Where a case is submitted with stipulated facts, we still review\n\nthe district court’s findings for clear error.            See Adair State Bank v. Am. Cas.\n\nCo. , 949 F.2d 1067, 1072 (10th Cir. 1991). Under this standard of review, we\n\nwill not disturb the district court’s decision to credit those witnesses offered by\n\n\n                                                 - 12 -\n\fboth parties. See Pabst v. Oklahoma Gas & Elec. Co.         , 228 F.3d 1128, 1135 (10th\n\nCir. 2000) (finding no clear error in the district court’s decision to credit the\n\nplaintiff’s witness rather than the defendant’s witness);     see also Anderson v. City\n\nof Bessemer City , 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985) (discussing the clearly erroneous\n\nstandard).\n\n       In the alternative, Bank of Texas argues that even if transfer warranties\n\napplied to the drafts, State Bank cannot recover on an alleged breach of such\n\nwarranties because it did not take them in good faith as is required by § 4-207(c).       6\n\n\n\nBank of Texas argues that State Bank did not “take” the drafts for purposes of the\n\ncode the first time it received them because State Bank returned them to Bank of\n\nTexas. Moreover, when State Bank did take the drafts the second time they were\n\nsent, State Bank took them because of the claim of late return and issued the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Bank of Texas also argues that the good faith requirement of § 3-416(b)\napplies. This Court, however, will not consider arguments made under Article 3.\nThe trial court expressly held the documentary drafts were not negotiable\ninstruments and thus not subject to Article 3. We cannot find in appellant’s brief\nany argument that the trial court erred in this conclusion, nor that the\ndocumentary drafts were actually negotiable instruments. Since any such claims\nwere not raised on appeal, they are waived.\n      Because Article 3 does not apply to the documentary drafts, we also reject\nappellant’s argument that State Bank waived the issue of signature authorization\nor authenticity under § 3-308 and thus was not entitled to transfer warranties.\nNotably, this argument borders on the frivolous even if § 3-308 did apply. State\nBank explicitly denied the authenticity of Ventura’s signature in the pleadings.\n\n                                            - 13 -\n\fcashier’s check in satisfaction of that claim and not in response to the actual\n\ndrafts.\n\n          Bank of Texas’s argument hinges on whether or not State Bank took the\n\ndrafts in good faith because when State Bank did finally “take” the drafts, it\n\nissued the cashier’s check in satisfaction of the drafts and not in satisfaction of\n\nthe claim of late return. Bank of Texas’s only argument that State Bank did not\n\ntake the drafts in good faith relies on the implication that State Bank knew the\n\nsignatures on the drafts were unauthorized but issued the cashier’s check anyway;\n\ntherefore, State Bank did not act in good faith.    After reviewing the record, we\n\nfind the evidence supports the inference that State Bank took the drafts and issued\n\nthe cashier’s check in good faith, i.e., with “honesty in fact and [in] the\n\nobservance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.” § 3-103(a)(4).        7\n\n\n\n          In sum, we affirm the district court’s conclusion that State Bank was\n\nentitled to transfer warranties because it was a collecting bank and acted in good\n\nfaith. We further affirm the district court’s finding that Bank of Texas breached\n\nits transfer warranties to State Bank that Goss’s signatures on the drafts were\n\nauthentic and authorized.   8\n\n\n\n\n        We note that Article 4 refers to the Article 3 definition of “good faith.”\n          7\n\nSee § 4-104(c).\n\n        Because it is not necessary to the outcome of this appeal, we decline to\n          8\n\nreach State Bank’s assertion that “[b]reach of warranty under the UCC is an\n                                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                           - 14 -\n\f                            C. Admission of Evidence\n\n      The district court admitted into evidence a chart created by Brenda\n\nPlowman, a State Bank employee, given to Bank of Texas’s counsel only ten\n\nminutes before the commencement of the second day of trial. Bank of Texas,\n\nciting no legal authority and making no legal arguments, argues the trial court\n\nerred in admitting the chart.\n\n      We affirm the district court’s admission of the second Plowman chart\n\nbecause the trial court did not abuse its discretion. “[Evidentiary] rulings\n\ngenerally are committed to the very broad discretion of the trial judge, and they\n\nmay constitute an abuse of discretion only if based on an erroneous conclusion of\n\nlaw, a clearly erroneous finding of fact or a manifest error in judgment.” Webb v.\n\nABF Freight Sys., Inc., 155 F.3d 1230, 1246 (10th Cir. 1998). Moreover, a party\n\nis “entitled to a new trial only when the error affected the party's substantial\n\nrights.” Id. (citation omitted). The ten minutes that Bank of Texas’s counsel had\n\nto consider the chart and its supporting documentation was undoubtedly\n\ninsufficient; however, the trial court took that circumstance into consideration in\n\nallowing the admission of the second Plowman chart. The court granted extra\n\ntime to Bank of Texas’s counsel to review the new information so that counsel\n\n\n      8\n       (...continued)\nabsolute defense to and defeats a claim of late return of an item.” (Appellee’s Br.\nA at 32 (emphasis in the original).)\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\fcould sufficiently prepare for cross-examining Plowman. In its cross-examination\n\nof Plowman, Bank of Texas was able to point out the errors it believed were in\n\nthe chart. As such, Bank of Texas’s substantial rights have not been affected.\n\n                                D. Ordinary Care\n\n      A collecting bank must exercise ordinary care in presenting an item or in\n\nsending an item for presentment. See § 4-202(a)(1). Section 3-103(a)(7) defines\n\n“ordinary care” as “observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in\n\nthe area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in which the\n\nperson is engaged.” 9 Section 4-202(b) states that a “collecting bank exercises\n\nordinary care . . . by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following\n\nreceipt of an item.” However, “[t]aking proper action within a reasonably longer\n\ntime may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of\n\nestablishing timeliness.” § 4-202(b).\n\n      The trial court, in its findings of fact, concluded that “[n]either State Bank\n\n[n]or Bank of Texas consistently followed the collection letter instructions\n\naccompanying documentary drafts or notations on the drafts so as to strictly\n\ncomply with the time limitations set forth and both banks had a pattern and\n\npractice of late returns beyond the time specified by some additional days.” State\n\n\n\n      9\n         Section 4-104(c) of the Oklahoma Commercial Code refers to § 3-103 for\nthe definition of “ordinary care.”\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\fBank I, at *14. The court further found that State Bank had returned the seven\n\ndrafts now at issue “within a reasonable time.” Id.\n\n      Bank of Texas argues the district court erred in holding State Bank did not\n\nviolate its duty of ordinary care by returning the drafts outside the stated sight\n\nperiods. It asserts that State Bank failed to establish a course of dealing showing\n\nthe parties regularly returned drafts outside the designated sight periods. Bank of\n\nTexas properly notes that State Bank bore the burden of proving that it exercised\n\nordinary care and acted in a timely manner because State Bank did not meet the\n\n“midnight deadline” of § 4-202(b).\n\n      We affirm the district court’s finding of fact that the parties had a custom\n\nof returning documentary drafts outside of the designated sight period and its\n\nresulting conclusion that therefore State Bank’s late return of the drafts was, as a\n\nmatter of law, performed with ordinary care. We stress, however, that our\n\naffirmation rests largely on the deferential clearly erroneous standard of review\n\nwe are obliged to employ with regard to the district court’s findings of fact. 10\n\nUnless, after reviewing the record and the arguments on appeal, we are\n\n\n\n      10\n          We note there was evidence in the record that might have caused us, if\nwe had been the finder of fact, to rule differently. For example, the cross-\nexamination of Plowman concerning her second chart, Bank of Texas’s arguments\nthat the Plowman Chart did not establish a course of dealing for returns, as\nopposed to payments, and Plowman’s testimony that the late return of the drafts\nwould have violated State Bank’s policies.\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fcompletely unconvinced by the factfinder’s conclusions, we must generally defer\n\nto the factfinder’s experience with the mainsprings of human conduct as applied\n\nto the entirety of the case at hand. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496\n\nU.S. 384, 400 (1990) (“In practice, the ‘clearly erroneous’ standard requires the\n\nappellate court to uphold any district court determination that falls within a broad\n\nrange of permissible conclusions.”).\n\n      After careful review of Plowman’s testimony at trial, upon which both\n\nparties seem to rely entirely for establishing their arguments on the course of\n\nconduct issue, and after careful review of the charts Plowman offered as\n\nevidence, we do not have a “definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\nmade.” Sanpete Water Conservancy Dist., 226 F.3d at 1170. The drafts at issue\n\nwere returned between one and six days late. Even a narrow reading of the\n\nPlowman chart establishes Bank of Texas had a custom of returning payment on\n\ndrafts to State Bank between one and eight days late. Because State Bank’s one\n\nto six day late returns of the drafts fell within the one to eight day custom, we\n\naffirm the district court’s holding that State Bank exercised ordinary care in\n\nreturning the drafts outside of the designated sight periods. Furthermore, because\n\nwe affirm the district court’s holding that State Bank did not breach its duty of\n\nordinary care, we reject Bank of Texas’s arguments that it is entitled to actual and\n\nconsequential damages as a result of the alleged breach.\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\f                              E. The Cashier’s Check\n\n      1. State Bank’s Obligation to Pay the Cashier’s Check\n\n      Upon receipt of the drafts for the second time, State Bank, through its\n\nemployee Teresa Bray, issued a cashier’s check in payment of the drafts. When\n\nanother employee of State Bank realized the cashier’s check had been issued\n\nmistakenly, State Bank attempted, but failed, to retrieve the check from the mail.\n\nConsequently, the following day State Bank contacted Bank of Texas to inform\n\nBank of Texas that the cashier’s check had been issued mistakenly, without\n\nauthorization, and thus a stop payment order had been placed on the check.\n\n      The trial court found State Bank was justified in issuing the stop payment\n\nunder § 3-411(c)(ii) 11 because the drafts were forged and Speer was attempting to\n\nperpetrate fraud. Section 3-411(c) provides, in relevant part, that damages are not\n\nallowed under the section “if the refusal of the obligated bank to pay occurs\n\nbecause . . . the obligated bank asserts a claim or defense of the bank that it has\n\nreasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to enforce\n\nthe instrument.”\n\n      Bank of Texas argues that § 3-411(c) only allows the issuer of a cashier’s\n\ncheck to avoid damages, not to avoid payment of the check. This argument\n\ncompletely ignores § 3-305(a) which details general defenses an obliged party can\n\n\n      11\n           Under Article 3, a cashier’s check is an instrument. See § 3-104.\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fassert to the payment of an instrument. Specifically, that section allows the\n\nobligated party to assert\n\n      a defense . . . stated in another section of this article or a defense . . .\n      that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the\n      instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple\n      contract.\n\n§ 3-305(a)(2).\n\n      In support of the trial court’s holding that State Bank was justified in\n\nstopping payment on the cashier’s check, State Bank raises four arguments on\n\nappeal. First, State Bank claims Bank of Texas misrepresented material facts in\n\nits letter accompanying the drafts on their second return to State Bank. Second,\n\nState Bank argues it properly stopped payment due to the fact the check was\n\nissued by mistake. Third, it argues Bank of Texas did not give valid\n\nconsideration for the cashier’s check. Finally, State Bank argues Speer’s\n\nunderlying fraud vitiated the contracts, i.e., the drafts, and thus provided a\n\ndefense to the enforcement of the contracts. Because we find State Bank’s second\n\ndefense to payment of the cashier’s check sufficient to affirm the trial court’s\n\nholding, we need not reach the other three arguments raised on appeal.\n\n      As discussed above, § 3-305(a)(2) allows an obliged party to assert\n\ndefenses to payment of an instrument otherwise available under Article 3 of the\n\nOklahoma Commercial Code. Section 3-418(b) provides “if an instrument has\n\nbeen paid or accepted by mistake . . . the person paying or accepting may, to the\n\n                                          - 20 -\n\fextent permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution . . . revoke the\n\nacceptance.” Section 3-409 defines “acceptance” as the “drawee’s signed\n\nagreement to pay a draft as presented.” Thus, in the case at issue, State Bank had\n\naccepted the cashier’s check.\n\n      Under Oklahoma law, mistake of fact\n\n      is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of\n      the person making the mistake, and consisting in:\n\n             1. An unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact past or\n             present, material to the contract; or,\n             2. Belief in the present existence of a thing material to the\n             contract, which does not exist, or in the past existence of such\n             a thing, which has not existed.\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 63. The commentary to Article 3 of the Oklahoma\n\nCommercial Code states that:\n\n      [I]f money is paid under a mistake of fact—that is, on the mistaken\n      supposition that a specific fact exists which would entitle the payee\n      to the money—and when the money would not have been paid if the\n      payor had known the fact was otherwise, then the money generally\n      can be recovered. The basis for the rule is that money paid through\n      misapprehension of facts belongs, in equity and good conscience, to\n      the person who paid it.\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, Commentary on Revised Uniform Commercial Code\n\nArticles 3 and 4–Negotiable Instruments and Bank Deposits and Collections, as\n\nEnacted in Oklahoma, Article 3, Recovery of Payment by Mistake (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\f      In the instant case, State Bank employee Bray mistakenly believed State\n\nBank was authorized by its customer to issue the cashier’s check, and thus she\n\nmistakenly issued the check. At trial, she testified she would not have issued the\n\ncheck had she known Goss had told State Bank not to pay for the drafts.\n\nMoreover, State Bank’s behavior following the issuance of the cashier’s check,\n\ni.e., the attempt to retrieve the check from the mail and the immediate placement\n\nof a stop order on the check, supports the conclusion that the bank mistakenly\n\nissued the check. Because of this mistake, State Bank had a viable defense to\n\npayment of the check and was able to revoke its acceptance under § 3-418(b). On\n\nthis alternative ground, we affirm the district court’s holding that State Bank was\n\njustified in stopping payment on the cashier’s check.\n\n      2. Bank of Texas’s Immunity from State Bank’s Defenses to Payment\n         of the Cashier’s Check\n\n      According to § 3-418(c), State Bank cannot successfully invoke mistake as\n\na defense to payment of the cashier’s check if Bank of Texas “took the [cashier’s\n\ncheck] in good faith and for value.” Under §§ 3-305(a) and (b), State Bank\n\ncannot successfully assert a common law contract defense or other defense listed\n\nin Article 3 of the Oklahoma Commercial Code if Bank of Texas was a holder in\n\ndue course. Section § 3-302(a)(2) defines a holder in due course as one who took\n\nan instrument “(i) for value, (ii) in good faith, . . . and (vi) without notice that any\n\nparty has a defense or claim in recoupment described in subsection (a) of Section\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\f3-305 of this title.” Section 3-303(a)(3) states that an instrument is taken for\n\nvalue if it is “issued . . . as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim\n\nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due.”\n\n      Bank of Texas argues that State Bank issued the cashier’s check in payment\n\nof Bank of Texas’s valid claim of late return. Therefore, under § 3-302(a)(2), the\n\nclaim of late return was “value” transferred for the cashier’s check. 12\n\n      Earlier in this opinion, we affirmed the trial court’s finding of fact that\n\nState Bank issued the cashier’s check to pay for the drafts and not in response to\n\nBank of Texas’s claim of late return. Because State Bank issued the cashier’s\n\ncheck to pay for the drafts—which were worthless because Ventura refused to\n\nauthorize payment—rather than to pay for Bank of Texas’s claim of late return,\n\nBank of Texas transferred no value for the cashier’s check. For this reason, Bank\n\nof Texas is not immune under § 3-418 to State Bank’s defense of mistaken\n\npayment of the check.\n\n      As with the issue of whether State Bank was justified in stopping payment\n\nof the cashier’s check, the parties raise numerous arguments on appeal to support\n\n\n      12\n         Bank of Texas also argues it gave value for the underlying drafts which\nshould be considered as giving value for the cashier’s check. In support of this\nproposition it cites “Case #2” to comment four in the UCC Comment, 1991\nAmendment to § 3-302. It is unclear how the comment cited supports the\nproposition of transferred value, i.e., that because Bank of Texas gave value to\nSpeer for the documentary drafts, Bank of Texas therefore gave value to State\nBank by transferring the documentary drafts to it.\n\n                                         - 23 -\n\ftheir positions concerning whether Bank of Texas was immune to State Bank’s\n\ndefense to payment of the check. Because we conclude Bank of Texas did not\n\ntake the cashier’s check for value, we affirm, albeit on alternate grounds, the\n\ndistrict court’s holdings that State Bank could stop payment on the cashier’s\n\ncheck and that Bank of Texas was not a holder in due course. Our reasoning\n\nmakes it unnecessary to consider the parties’ other arguments.\n\n                                 III. Costs and Fees\n\n         The second set of appeals concerns the district court’s award of costs and\n\nfees to State Bank. We review the decision to award attorneys’ fees, and the\n\namount awarded, for abuse of discretion. See Case v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 233,\n\n157 F.3d 1243, 1249 (10th Cir. 1998); Bishop v. Equinox Int’l Corp., 154 F.3d\n\n1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1998). “Underlying factual findings will only be upset\n\nwhen clearly erroneous. However, a district court’s statutory interpretation or\n\nlegal analysis which provides the basis for the fee award is reviewable de novo.”\n\nBishop, 154 F.3d at 1224 (citations omitted).\n\n         The parties agree that Texas law applies to State Bank’s primary claims and\n\nthat Oklahoma law applies to Bank of Texas’s counterclaims. The parties are also\n\nin accord concerning State Bank’s entitlement under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, §\n\n936 to attorneys’ fees for its successful defense to payment of the cashier’s\n\ncheck.\n\n\n                                         - 24 -\n\f      The trial court found that State Bank was not entitled to attorneys’ fees on\n\nits primary claims under Texas law. The court further found that State Bank was\n\nnot entitled to attorneys’ fees under UCC 13 §§ 3-411(b) or 4-103(e) or under Okla.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207(c). However, because the court found the issues in\n\nState Bank’s Texas law claims “inextricably intertwined” with the issues in Bank\n\nof Texas’s Oklahoma law counterclaims, the court premised an award of fees\n\nunder Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936 on the unsegregated bills of State Bank’s\n\nattorneys. Notably, the court awarded State Bank one-third less than it requested\n\ndue to the fact that the “Texas law phase of the case . . . [did] not support an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees.” State Bank III, at *11.\n\n                          A. State Bank’s Cross-Appeal\n\n      1. Attorneys’ Fees Under Texas Law\n\n      Because our determination of the issues raised in State Bank’s cross-appeal\n\naffects the outcome of Bank of Texas’s appeal, we address the issues presented in\n\nState Bank’s cross-appeal first. State Bank argues the district court erred in\n\nholding that it could not recover attorneys’ fees on its primary claims under Texas\n\nlaw. Specifically, State Bank claims it can recover attorneys’ fees under Tex.\n\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 4.103(e)\n\n\n      13\n         Because the trial court found that Oklahoma and Texas law are\nsubstantially the same as the UCC, the trial court, in its opinion, referred to the\nrelevant UCC sections. See State Bank III at 4-5.\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fand Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 3.411(b). We address these arguments in\n\nturn.\n\n              a. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001\n\n        Under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 38.001, a “person may\n\nrecover reasonable attorney’s fees . . . if the claim is for . . . an oral or written\n\ncontract.” The district court denied State Bank’s claim for attorneys’ fees on the\n\ngrounds of § 38.001 because it held that the section does not apply to conversion\n\nactions and the drafts were not “contracts” because the contracting parties were\n\nthe customers of the banks, not the banks themselves.\n\n        State Bank brings to our attention Guardian Bank v. San Jacinto Savings\n\nAssociation, 593 S.W.2d 860 (Tex. App. 1980). In that case, the court expressly\n\nheld that a “cashier’s check is a written contract with the maker impliedly\n\nagreeing to pay to any authorized holder the face value stated therein.” Id. at 863.\n\nAt summary judgment in this case, the district court ruled that State Bank was\n\nable to recover the value of the cashier’s check. Because a cashier’s check is a\n\n“contract” under Texas law, we hold that State Bank could properly have been\n\nallowed attorneys’ fees for its recovery of the value of the cashier’s check under §\n\n38.001(8). 14 Accordingly, insofar as the district court implicitly held, as a matter\n\n\n        14\n          The cashier’s check was issued to pay for three of the five drafts at issue\nin State Bank’s primary suit against Bank of Texas. See State Bank & Trust,\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fof law, that attorneys’ fees were not available under Texas law for recovery on\n\nthe cashier’s check, we reverse. 15\n\n      Citing First National Bank of Missouri City v. Gittelman, 788 S.W.2d 165\n\n(Tex. App. 1990), State Bank also argues the district court erred in not allowing\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees on its successful conversion claim under § 38.001.\n\nGittelman involved a bank’s foreclosure on a car that served as collateral for a\n\nloan. See 788 S.W.2d at 166-67. The court noted that although a conversion\n\nclaim does not support an award of attorneys’ fees under § 38.001(8), a contract\n\nclaim does. See Gittelman, 788 S.W.2d at 171. The trial court’s finding that the\n\nbank converted Gittelman’s car implied the bank did not have authority to sell the\n\ncar. See id. This, in turn, supported a finding of breach of contract and thus an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees under a breach of contract theory. See id.\n\n      State Bank’s reliance on Gittelman is misplaced. Gittelman does not hold\n\nthat facts supporting a conversion claim always support a breach of contract\n\n      14\n        (...continued)\nN.A. v. First State Bank of Texas, No. 97-CV-277-B, at *4-5 (N.D. Okla. June 10,\n1998) (“State Bank II”).\n      15\n         We find unconvincing State Bank’s novel state law claim that the\ndocumentary drafts somehow created contractual relationships between the banks,\nand we affirm the denial of attorneys’ fees as to the claims regarding the Bank of\nTexas documentary drafts. Also, although we find State Bank’s argument that\n§ 38.001 “does not necessarily require that the party seeking fees on the contract\nclaim be a party to that contract” interesting, we can find no precedent for this\nposition under Texas law, nor has State Bank cited any. We decline to create any\nsuch precedent.\n\n                                       - 27 -\n\fclaim. In Gittelman, there were actual written contracts between the bank and its\n\ncustomer. See id. at 167 (noting that the trial court found the bank had breached\n\nthe relevant written contracts). Although the opinion is not explicit as to the\n\nterms of those contracts, it seems likely that the contracts at issue were loan\n\ndocuments signed at the time Gittelman designated her car as collateral. Thus,\n\nwhen the bank converted Gittelman’s car, it breached the terms of the contract\n\ndealing with collateral placed on the loan.\n\n      In State Bank’s case, the conversion claim, as stated in the complaint, was\n\nthat “Bank of Texas improperly exercised dominion and control over the titles to\n\nthe automobiles that corresponded to each of the Bank of Texas Drafts . . . and\n\nthereafter improperly transferred and converted some or all of those titles to Speer\n\nwithout paying State Bank the funds due.” (I Appellant’s App. A at 5.) The facts\n\nsupporting the conversion claim do not support a breach of contract claim\n\nbetween the two banks because, as discussed above, the documentary drafts do\n\nnot establish a contract between the banks. Thus, we hold that the trial court\n\nproperly denied State Bank’s request for attorneys’ fees under § 38.001 for its\n\nsuccess on the conversion claim.\n\n             b. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 4.103(e)\n\n      Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 4.103(e) allows damages, other than actual\n\ndamages, if there is “bad faith.” We reject State Bank’s argument that it is\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fentitled to recover attorneys’ fees under this section because the trial court\n\nexplicitly noted that “no . . . finding [of bad faith] was entered in this case.”\n\nState Bank III, at *7. Given the trial court was presented with the same\n\narguments we are under § 4.103(e), we think the foregoing statement implicitly\n\ndemonstrates that the trial court affirmatively did not find bad faith on the part of\n\nBank of Texas. We therefore affirm the trial court’s holding that State Bank\n\ncould not recover attorneys’ fees under § 4.103(e).\n\n             c. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 3.411(b)\n\n      Section 3.411(b) provides that a person who enforces a right to a check “is\n\nentitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from . . .\n\nnonpayment and may recover consequential damages.” Section 3.411(c) provides\n\nthat expenses or consequential damages are not recoverable if the obligated bank\n\nrefused to pay because it had “reasonable grounds to believe [it had a claim or\n\ndefense] . . . available against the person entitled to enforce the instrument.”\n\n      The trial court denied recovery of attorneys’ fees to State Bank under\n\n§ 3.411 because it found that it “did not and [could not] . . . conclude that Bank\n\nof Texas had no reasonable basis for asserting the positions taken.” State Bank\n\nIII, at *7. We affirm the trial court and reject as frivolous State Bank’s assertion\n\nthat the trial court’s finding “was inconsistent with the court’s earlier finding that\n\nBank of Texas had no viable defense to payment of that check under § 3-411(c).”\n\n\n                                          - 29 -\n\f(Appellee’s Br. B at 39.) Although the court ultimately found Bank of Texas had\n\nno viable defense, that determination did not preclude the court from finding that\n\nBank of Texas had a reasonable basis for asserting defenses to payment.\n\n       2. Attorneys’ Fees Under Oklahoma Law\n\n      In its cross-appeal, State Bank also asserts the trial court erred in denying\n\nattorneys’ fees under Oklahoma law for Bank of Texas’s counterclaims.\n\nSpecifically, State Bank asserts it was entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936 and under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207(c).\n\n             a. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936\n\n      Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936 provides as follows:\n\n      In any civil action to recover on an open account, a statement of\n      account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument, or contract\n      relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, or merchandise, or\n      for labor or services, unless otherwise provided by law or the\n      contract which is the subject [of] the action, the prevailing party\n      shall be allowed a reasonable attorney fee to be set by the court, to be\n      taxed and collected as costs.\n\nAlthough the district court awarded State Bank attorneys’ fees under § 936 for its\n\nsuccessful defense to payment of the cashier’s check, it did not award fees under\n\nthat section for State Bank’s defense to payment of the documentary drafts. On\n\nappeal, State Bank claims “documentary drafts logically fall within the litany of\n\nmonetary obligations set forth by § 936.” (I Appellee’s Br. B at 40.) Notably,\n\nevery one of the “litany of monetary obligations” set forth in § 936 involves some\n\n\n                                        - 30 -\n\fsort of instrument on which suit would be brought because of a direct obligation\n\nestablished by the instrument between a plaintiff and a defendant. Here, Bank of\n\nTexas’s counterclaims under Oklahoma law were based on the claim that State\n\nBank was required to compensate Bank of Texas for the value of the drafts\n\nbecause State Bank returned the documentary drafts to Bank of Texas in an\n\nuntimely manner. The counterclaims were not brought for payment of the drafts\n\nthemselves.\n\n      Although State Bank properly prevailed on the counterclaims, the\n\ncounterclaims did not involve a suit on a contract, a note, a bill, etc., as is\n\nrequired under § 936. We therefore hold that the trial court did not err in failing\n\nto grant State Bank attorneys’ fees for its successful defense against the Bank of\n\nTexas counterclaims.\n\n              b. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207\n\n      The trial court held, and we affirm, that Bank of Texas breached the\n\ntransfer warranties it owed to State Bank on the State Bank drafts. Okla. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 12A, § 4-207(c) provides recovery “equal to the loss suffered . . . , but\n\nnot more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest” to one\n\nwho took an item in good faith and who experienced a breach of transfer\n\nwarranties. On appeal, State Bank argues the trial court erred by not allowing it\n\nto recover attorneys’ fees as a measure of “expenses” under § 4-207(c).\n\n\n                                          - 31 -\n\f      We have carefully considered the arguments raised on appeal by both State\n\nBank and Bank of Texas. Because we agree with the district court’s thorough\n\ndiscussion of the availability of attorneys’ fees as expenses under § 4-207, we\n\naffirm the denial of attorneys’ fees pursuant to that section. 16\n\n                            B. Bank of Texas’s Appeal\n\n      1. Inextricably Intertwined Doctrine\n\n      Although the district court did not find an independent justification for\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees for State Bank’s primary claims under Texas law or for\n\nthe counterclaim concerning the documentary drafts under Oklahoma law, the\n\ncourt found the claims and counterclaims “inextricably intertwined” for purposes\n\nof awarding attorneys’ fees.\n\n             [T]he Court finds the issues surrounding the cashier’s check\n      could not be adequately addressed without a thorough understanding\n      of the transactions involving the documentary drafts which led to the\n      issuance of the cashier’s check and the stop payment.\n\n\n      16\n          We decline to consider State Bank’s claim—made in its Reply Brief on\ncross-appeal—that it is entitled to fees incurred enforcing subpoenas. State\nBank’s opening brief on cross-appeal states “the trial court did err in concluding\nthat attorneys’ fees may not be recovered under UCC §§ 4-207(c), 4-103(e) and 3-\n411(b), and fee statutes set forth under Texas and Oklahoma law. State Bank\nurges that only to this extent should the trial court’s Order and Judgment be\nreversed.” (Appellee’s Br. B at 8.) We have reviewed State Bank’s opening brief\non cross-appeal and can find no mention of the subpoena fees issue. Since State\nBank did not argue the subpoena fees issue in its opening brief, Bank of Texas\nwas not given the chance to properly respond to the argument and we decline to\nconsider the issue. See, e.g., State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Mhoon, 31 F.3d 979,\n984 n.7 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\f             The Court observes that this was a complex case in which the\n      similarity of the claims, defenses, amount of the cashier’s checks and\n      the underlying transactions required considerable concentration in\n      order to keep the primary claims and the counterclaims straight. The\n      legal research necessarily overlapped so that a finding that the claims\n      and defenses and underlying facts are, to an extent, “inextricably\n      intertwined” is supportable by the record.\n\nState Bank III, at *10. The court found that State Bank’s principal claims were\n\ngoverned by Texas law which, the court held, did not support an award of\n\nattorneys’ fees. Therefore, the court reduced the award by one third. See id., at\n\n*10-11.\n\n      As discussed, there is no question that State Bank was entitled to attorneys’\n\nfees under Oklahoma law for its successful defense to payment of the cashier’s\n\ncheck. Bank of Texas’s challenge on appeal to the award of attorneys’ fees under\n\nOklahoma law concerns the trial court’s application of the “inextricably\n\nintertwined” doctrine. Specifically, Bank of Texas argues that (1) the claims\n\ninvolved in these appeals are not intertwined, (2) the “inextricably intertwined”\n\ndoctrine does not apply to this case, and (3) State Bank was required, under\n\nOklahoma law, to segregate its requests for fees.\n\n      In RJB Gas Pipeline Co. v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 813 P.2d 1, 12-14\n\n(Okla. App. 1990), the court reviewed a trial court’s grant of attorneys’ fees to\n\nthe prevailing party in an action that primarily concerned contractual obligations.\n\nThe trial court awarded attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party without requiring\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\fthat party to segregate out the fees incurred in support of the unsuccessful claims.\n\nSee id. at 13. Citing the Supreme Court’s decision in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n\nU.S. 424 (1983), a civil rights case, the court noted that “in some instances it is\n\nunnecessary to apportion attorney fees between successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims.” RJB Gas Pipeline, 813 P.2d at 14. Ultimately, the court held that a party\n\nis “not allowed attorney fees on claims unless permitted by statute.” Id.; see also\n\nTibbetts v. Sight ‘N Sound Appliance Ctrs., Inc., 6 P.3d 1064, 1066 (Okla. App.\n\n1999) (“Oklahoma continues to stand firmly committed to the American Rule,\n\nunder which a prevailing party may not recover a counsel-fee award absent an\n\nauthorizing statute or contract.” (citing Morgan v. Galilean Health Enters., 977\n\nP.2d 357, 362 (Okla. 1998)). Because the prevailing party’s punitive damages\n\nclaims were tort claims and no Oklahoma statute supports an award of fees on tort\n\nclaims, the court reversed and remanded to the trial court to hold a new hearing\n\non the proper amount of fees. See RJB Gas Pipeline, 813 P.2d at 14.\n\n      Although we are sympathetic to the difficulty of segregating attorneys’ fees\n\nbetween claims that are so closely related, we can find no support for an\n\n“inextricably intertwined” exception to the general Oklahoma rule that attorneys’\n\nfees can only be awarded where there is an independent statutory basis. We\n\ndecline to affirm an unsupported legal conclusion of state law. We reverse the\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 34 -\n\fdistrict court’s award of attorneys’ fees to the extent it awards fees under\n\nOklahoma law pursuant to the inapplicable “inextricably intertwined” doctrine.\n\n      We note, however, that Texas law does support an exception to the general\n\nrequirement of segregating attorneys’ fees. The exception applies “when the\n\nattorney’s fees rendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same\n\ntransaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof\n\nor denial of essentially the same facts.” Panizo v. Young Men’s Christian Ass’n,\n\n938 S.W.2d 163, 170 (Tex. App. 1996) (citations omitted); see also Keeper v.\n\nFirst Care, Inc., 794 S.W.2d 879, 882 (Tex. App. 1990); Flint & Assocs. v.\n\nIntercontinental Pipe & Steel, Inc., 739 S.W.2d 622, 624-25 (Tex. App. 1987).\n\nWe leave to the trial court the task of determining what impact, if any, the cited\n\nTexas authority should have on a fee award to State Bank.\n\n      2. Costs and Fees Related to Denton Texas Suit\n\n      Bank of Texas originally filed a lawsuit against State Bank in Denton,\n\nTexas, on the claims that ultimately became the counterclaims in the instant suit.\n\nThat suit was dismissed. State Bank sought recovery for the costs and attorneys’\n\nfees associated with that case (i.e., fees incurred for the removal petition and\n\nfiling a motion to transfer) in the instant suit. Citing absolutely no legal\n\nauthority, Bank of Texas asserts that recovery of those costs and fees in this suit\n\nis improper because State Bank “at least [should have] attempted to seek such\n\n\n                                         - 35 -\n\frecovery from the Denton judge.” (Appellant’s Br. B at 20.) We reject this\n\nargument as wholly unsupported by legal authority as well as unpersuasive. The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees arising out of the\n\nDenton suit except to the extent such fees were premised on the application of the\n\ninextricably intertwined doctrine under Oklahoma law.\n\n      Bank of Texas also claims the district court erred in awarding fees to State\n\nBank for State Bank’s unsuccessful attempt to recover punitive damages and for\n\nState Bank’s unsuccessful motion for summary judgment on Bank of Texas’s\n\ncounterclaims. Bank of Texas cites RJB Gas Pipeline Co. for the proposition that\n\nan unsuccessful claim for punitive damages related to a successful breach of\n\ncontract claim does not support an award of fees under Oklahoma law. State\n\nBank attempts to distinguish that case on the ground that the underlying claim for\n\nthe punitive damages was a tort claim. We do not find this distinction persuasive\n\nbecause State Bank premised its claim for punitive damages on its conversion\n\nclaim–i.e., a tort claim. State Bank also attempts to argue the district court’s\n\naward of fees for the unsuccessful summary judgment motion and for the punitive\n\ndamages claims were appropriate because of the district court’s proper application\n\nof the inextricably intertwined doctrine. Pursuant to our holding above, we\n\nreverse the district court’s award of attorneys’ fees for the unsuccessful summary\n\njudgment motion and for the punitive damages claim.\n\n\n                                         - 36 -\n\f      3. Paralegal Fees\n\n      Under Texas law, a party may include in its request for attorneys’ fees\n\namounts for work performed by legal assistants if the “assistant perform[ed] work\n\ntraditionally done by an attorney.” Multi-Moto Corp. v. ITT Commercial Fin.\n\nCorp., 806 S.W.2d 560, 570 (Tex. App. 1990). The evidence presented must\n\nestablish:\n\n      (1) the qualifications of the legal assistant to perform substantive\n      legal work; (2) that the legal assistant performed substantive legal\n      work under the direction and supervision of an attorney; (3) the\n      nature of the legal work performed; (4) the legal assistant’s hourly\n      rate; and (5) the number of hours expended by the legal assistant.\n\nId. (citation omitted).\n\n      Oklahoma law also permits a party to recover charges for work performed\n\nby paralegals as an award of attorneys’ fees. See, e.g., Taylor v. Chubb Group of\n\nIns. Cos., 874 P.2d 806, 808-09 (Okla. 1994). Such charges are only appropriate\n\nif they are “clearly shown to have been made (1) for the delegated performance of\n\nsubstantive legal work, that (2) would otherwise have to be performed by a\n\nlawyer, (3) at a rate higher than that charged for the nonlawyers’ time.” Id. at\n\n809. A party seeking an award of attorneys’ fees “must plead and prove that the\n\ncharges made for non-lawyer’s time covered work that a lawyer would have had\n\nto perform but for the performance of such services by a legal assistant.” Id.\n\nAlso, the “total charges made for the legal assistant’s services must be less than\n\n\n                                        - 37 -\n\fthe total charges would have been, had a lawyer performed the services.” Id. In\n\nTaylor the court specified tasks which a legal assistant may perform, including\n\ninterviewing clients, drafting pleadings and other documents, conducting legal\n\nresearch, scheduling depositions, coordinating and managing document\n\nproduction, locating and interviewing witnesses, organizing pleadings, trial\n\nexhibits, and other documents, preparing witness and exhibit lists, and assisting\n\nlawyers at trial. See id.\n\n      In its appeal, Bank of Texas claims that the award of attorneys’ fees to\n\nState Bank included charges for work performed by paralegals that was not\n\n“perfected” for purposes of either Texas or Oklahoma law. Specifically, Bank of\n\nTexas claims the charges were inappropriate under Texas law because there was\n\nno indication as to the qualifications of the paralegals and the billing summaries\n\ninclude billing for “clerical services” that are not “substantive legal services.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. B at 21.) The stated failure under Oklahoma law is that the trial\n\ntestimony did not demonstrate the work performed by the paralegals would\n\notherwise have been performed by an attorney and the billing inappropriately\n\nincluded charges for clerical duties performed by the paralegals.\n\n      After careful review of the record, we hold that insofar as the trial court\n\nproperly awarded attorneys’ fees, it did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees\n\nfor work performed by paralegals under either Oklahoma or Texas law. The\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fqualifications of the paralegals and their performance of “substantive legal work”\n\nwere substantiated in the fee application or testified to at trial. Although we\n\nagree with appellant that Oklahoma law places the burden of proof and pleading\n\non the party requesting fees, after careful review of the fee application we\n\nconclude the work performed by paralegals for which fees were sought was all\n\nwork that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma listed as proper for a legal assistant in\n\nTaylor, 874 P.2d at 809.\n\n         4. Section 1920 Costs\n\n         We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s order upholding the\n\nclerk’s taxation of costs. See Munoz v. St. Mary-Corwin Hosp., 221 F.3d 1160,\n\n1170 (10th Cir. 2000). “We will reverse subsidiary factual findings only if they\n\nare clearly erroneous.” Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F.3d 1505, 1509 (10th Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n         The district court affirmed the clerk’s award to State Bank of $3,401.71 in\n\ncosts made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920, concluding that the amount taxed as\n\ncosts for copies was justified. We have reviewed the record and the parties’\n\narguments and can find nothing to suggest the district court abused its discretion.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the court’s award of costs for copies. See, e.g., Tilton v.\n\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc., 115 F.3d 1471, 1476 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n         5. Oklahoma Commercial Code Costs\n\n\n                                         - 39 -\n\f      The clerk declined to award State Bank costs under the Oklahoma\n\nCommercial Code. Upon review of the clerk’s suggested taxation of costs, the\n\ntrial court awarded State Bank an additional $10,848.53 in costs as damages under\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207. This additional award included costs incurred\n\nfor telephone use, postage, computer research, faxes, Federal Express, binding, a\n\nprivate investigator, courier services, staff overtime, mileage incurred for\n\nattorneys to take depositions of Bank of Texas employees, and expert witnesses.\n\nHowever, the court denied State Bank costs for meals under any theory of\n\nrecovery.\n\n      As an initial matter, we affirm the district court’s denial of costs pursuant\n\nto Okla. Stat. Ann. tit 12A, § 3-411 and § 4-103 for the reasons stated in the\n\ndiscussion above concerning the award of attorneys’ fees. However, because we\n\nfind that the district court properly awarded State Bank costs as an element of\n\ndamages for breach of transfer warranties under § 4-207, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s award of other costs. Although the official comments to § 4-207 indicate\n\na reluctance to grant attorneys’ fees as expenses, they do not demonstrate similar\n\nreluctance with regard to other expenses incurred in litigation as a result of\n\nbreach of transfer warranties. We decline to reach whether any of the\n\nindividually contested costs were properly awarded under § 1920 because we find\n\nthat they were properly awarded under § 4-207.\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\f                                        IV\n\n      The judgment of the district court is REVERSED insofar as it found that\n\nattorneys’ fees are not available under Texas law for State Bank’s successful\n\nrecovery on the cashier’s check and insofar as it applied the inextricably\n\nintertwined doctrine to allow recovery of attorneys’ fees under Oklahoma law.\n\nThe judgment is AFFIRMED as to all other issues and this matter is\n\nREMANDED to the district court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n\n\n                                      ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                      Carlos F.

The trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to State Bank on its claims and in a non-jury\n\ntrial held that State Bank was not liable on any of Bank of Texas’s counterclaims.\n\nIn the appeal on the merits, only Bank of Texas’s counterclaims are at issue. The\n\nother appeal and cross-appeal concern the trial court’s award of costs and\n\nattorneys’ fees to State Bank.\n\n       These related appeals raise state law issues under Oklahoma and Texas law.\n\nExercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion   .\n\n                                             I\n\n       The banks’ customers, Speer and Ventura Classics, sold used automobiles\n\nto one another. Typically, payment was accomplished by means of a documentary\n\ndraft. The buyer of an automobile would prepare a documentary draft consisting\n\nof an envelope displaying payment information. The buyer would then send the\n\ndraft to the seller who would place the title documents for the automobile being\n\npurchased inside the envelope and deposit the documentary draft with his own\n\nbank. The seller’s bank would forward the draft and title document to the buyer’s\n\nbank for payment or collection. Once a draft was received by the buyer’s bank,\n\nthe bank would call the buyer and ask him to inspect the draft. The buyer was\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\frequired to verify the draft, determine whether the title documentation was in\n\norder, and instruct the bank either to pay the draft or to return the draft unpaid.\n\n      At issue in this appeal are seven documentary drafts drawn on Ventura’s\n\naccount and presented by Bank of Texas to State Bank for payment (“State Bank\n\ndrafts”). On receipt of the first five drafts, totaling $87,750, Bank of Texas gave\n\nSpeer immediate credit and Speer withdrew the funds before the drafts were\n\npresented to State Bank for payment or collection. When State Bank received the\n\nforwarded drafts, it called Ventura’s representative, Goss, to verify the drafts.\n\nGoss did not authorize payment. Accordingly, State Bank returned the drafts to\n\nBank of Texas unpaid. However, it did not do so until several days after the\n\nperiod stated on the drafts for payment or return.\n\n      On receipt of the returned drafts, Bank of Texas resubmitted the drafts to\n\nState Bank along with a handwritten note from Judy Massey, a vice president at\n\nBank of Texas, stating “Dispute of Date of Return.” The note was accompanied\n\nby several photocopied sections of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”)\n\nconcerning a bank’s payment deadlines. In response to the second receipt of the\n\ndrafts, an employee of State Bank, Teresa Bray, issued a cashier’s check in the\n\namount of $87,750 to pay for the drafts. The check was mailed to Bank of Texas\n\nbefore the State Bank employee responsible for Ventura’s account, Vice President\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fCoy Gallatin, was made aware of the issuance of the check. He was thus\n\nprevented from retrieving the check from the mail.\n\n      The following day, State Bank informed Bank of Texas that the cashier’s\n\ncheck had been issued mistakenly and sent without authorization and,\n\nconsequently, that a stop payment order was being placed on the check. Bank of\n\nTexas claimed to have received the check and submitted it for payment prior to\n\nreceipt of notice of the stop payment order. After receipt of the first five\n\ndocumentary drafts at issue, Bank of Texas received two additional drafts,\n\ntotaling $36,800, for which it gave immediate credit to Speer’s account followed\n\nby Speer’s immediate withdrawal of the funds.\n\n       After a bench trial, the district court ruled that State Bank was not liable\n\non Bank of Texas’s claims. See State Bank & Trust, N.A. v. First State Bank of\n\nTexas, No. 97-CV-277-B (N.D. Okla. Oct. 21, 1998) (“State Bank I”) (findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law). Bank of Texas appeals the district court’s ruling on\n\nits counterclaims.\n\n      The district court awarded State Bank $77,335.76 in attorneys’ fees and\n\n$14,250.24 in costs.

Collecting v. Payor Bank\n\n      The trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that State Bank was not a\n\npayor bank under Oklahoma law with respect to the State Bank Drafts, but rather\n\nwas a collecting bank. Bank of Texas contests this finding and asserts that as a\n\npayor bank State Bank should be subject to strict liability for failure to pay the\n\ndrafts within the time allotted by statute. 2\n\n      1\n         Citations to the briefs and record in No. 98-5243, the appeal on the\nmerits, are to “[Party’s] Br.

A at 16). This claim is spurious.\nState Bank, in its response to Bank of Texas’s motion for summary judgment,\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      Under Oklahoma law, a payor bank is defined as “a bank that is the drawee\n\nof a draft,” Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-105(3), 3 and a drawee is the “person\n\nordered in a draft to make payment,” § 4-104(a)(8). A collecting bank is “a bank\n\nhandling an item for collection except the payor bank.” § 4-105(5). Section 4-106\n\ndetails when a bank is a collecting bank:\n\n          (a) If an item states that it is “payable through” a bank identified\n      in the item, (i) the item designates the bank as a collecting bank and\n      does not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item\n      may be presented for payment only by or through the bank.\n          (b) If an item states that it is “payable at” a bank identified in the\n      item, (i) the item designates the bank as a collecting bank and does\n      not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item may\n      be presented for payment only by or through the bank.\n          (c) If a draft names a nonbank drawee and it is unclear whether a\n      bank named in the draft is a co-drawee or a collecting bank, the bank\n      is a collecting bank.\n\n      In determining whether State Bank was a payor bank or a collecting bank, it\n\nis necessary to keep in mind the spirit of these terms of art. To the lay person\n\nunfamiliar with the UCC, it would seem that a collecting bank collects money\n\nfrom a payor bank. In fact, these terms do not describe a relationship between\n\ntwo banks, but rather characterize the type of relationship a bank has with its\n\n\n      2\n       (...continued)\nmade clear that it considered itself a collecting bank with regard to the drafts and\ndisagreed with Bank of Texas’s assertion of the so-called “undisputed fact” that\nState Bank was a payor bank.

The bank is a “payor bank”\n      when the draft is paid in the first way and is a “collecting bank”\n      when payment is made in the second manner.\n\nAt the outset, we note that because State Bank could not pay drafts drawn on\n\nVentura’s account unless authorized by Ventura, the relationship between State\n\nBank and its customer was in the nature of one between a collecting bank and its\n\ncustomer.\n\n      It is undisputed that when there is ambiguity as to whether the named bank\n\nin a draft is the co-drawee or the collecting bank, the named bank will be deemed\n\na collecting bank. See § 4-106(c). In the instant case, the parties disagree\n\nwhether the particular drafts at issue were ambiguous. Bank of Texas claims “the\n\nDrafts quite clearly show, as a matter of law, that State Bank is a payor bank.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. A at 17.)\n\n      The drafts contain Speer’s name on the “Pay to the order of” line. (See,\n\ne.g., II Appellant’s App. A at 412.) On the bottom left hand corner, the drafts are\n\ndesignated “To” State Bank and Trust; immediately next to State Bank’s address\n\nis written “Ventura Classic, Brian Goss.” (Id.)

Steve James Ford, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(S.D. Ga. 1996), the trial court found that State Bank was a collecting bank with\n\nregard to the drafts at issue. Great Western Bank involved a check-kiting scheme\n\ngone bad. The facts were similar to the facts in this case. On receipt of the drafts\n\nat issue in Great Western, the plaintiff bank gave its customer immediate credit.\n\nSee id. at 394. The defendant bank’s customer did not authorize payment of the\n\ndrafts; thus, the defendant bank returned the drafts to the plaintiff bank. The\n\ndefendant bank did not, however, return the drafts within the period provided for\n\non the drafts, and so the plaintiff bank brought suit. See id. The defendant\n\nbank’s name appeared on the lower right side of the draft immediately next to the\n\nbank customer’s name and address. See id. at 395. As in the current case, the\n\ndrafts contained no account number. See id.\n\n      Applying Florida law, which is substantially similar to Oklahoma law in\n\nthis field, the court in Great Western found that it was “clear from looking at the\n\nsurrounding circumstances that [the defendant bank] was a collecting bank.” Id.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fThe key factors leading the court to this conclusion were the collection item sent\n\nand addressed to the defendant bank and “most importantly” the fact that the\n\ndefendant bank was not authorized to pay the drafts without its customer’s\n\napproval. Id. Because the drafts were ambiguous as to whether the defendant\n\nbank was a drawee/payor bank or a collecting bank, Florida’s adoption of the\n\nRevised UCC required the court to find the defendant bank was a collecting bank.\n\nSee id. at 396 (citing UCC § 4-106).\n\n      The current case is almost identical to Great Western. Not only were the\n\ndrafts accompanied by collection letters and was State Bank not authorized to pay\n\nthe drafts without Ventura’s approval, but the status of State Bank as a payor or\n\ncollecting bank was ambiguous from the face of the drafts due to the location of\n\nState Bank’s name and address on the face of the drafts. As such, the trial court\n\nproperly found that State Bank was a collecting bank. 4\n\n\n      4\n         Bank of Texas mistakenly relies on Reynolds-Wilson Lumber Co. v.\nPeople’s National Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1174854\"><a href=\"/opinion/1174854/reynolds-wilson-lumber-v-peoples-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Okla. 1985) (per curiam), for the\nproposition that the drafts at issue in this case unambiguously establish State\nBank was a payor bank. Reynolds-Wilson was decided before the 1991 revisions\nto Oklahoma’s Commercial Code and relied on the prior default rule that a draft\nmust contain “an express statement on [its] face . . . indicating it is to be paid ‘at’\nor ‘through’ a bank, before that bank is to be treated as a mere conduit [i.e., a\ncollecting bank] and not a payor.” Id. at 151 (citations omitted). The 1991\nrevisions expressly reverse the presumption that a bank is a payor bank unless\nindicated otherwise. The revisions do this by providing that if a draft is\nambiguous as to whether a bank is a payor bank or a collecting bank, the bank is a\ncollecting bank. See § 4-106(c). It may be true that where a draft contains the\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Because we find the drafts at issue in this case ambiguous as to the status\n\nof State Bank and because Bank of Texas has not shown that the drafts were\n\nactually unambiguous, we affirm the district court’s finding that State Bank was a\n\ncollecting bank. Consequently, State Bank was not liable as a matter of law under\n\n§ 4-302(a)(2) for returning the drafts outside the allotted time. 5\n\n                              B. Transfer Warranties\n\n      Section 4-207(a) provides that a “collecting bank that transfers an item and\n\nreceives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any\n\nsubsequent collecting bank that . . . [a]ll signatures on the item are authentic and\n\n\n      (...continued)\n      4\n\nmagic words “at” or “through,” the bank to which the words refer is a collecting\nbank. However, it is no longer true, as the court held in Reynolds-Wilson, that\nwithout those words a bank is not a collecting bank. In fact, the official\ncommentary to Article 4 directly addresses this issue. The comment states:\n\n      Often a draft will show that it is drawn on a business drawee . . .\n      with the name of a bank appearing under the name of the business\n      drawee. Under current Oklahoma law, any ambiguity may cause the\n      bank to be deemed a co-drawee and payor bank along with the\n      company. Reynolds-Wilson Lumber Co.[, 699 P.2d at 149]. The\n      revisions will reverse that conclusion. Under Rev. Sec. 4-106(c),\n      where it is unclear whether the bank named in the draft is a co-\n      drawee or a collecting bank, the bank will be a collecting bank only.\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, Commentary on Revised Uniform Commercial Code\nArticles 3 and 4–Negotiable Instruments and Bank Deposits and Collections, as\nenacted in Oklahoma, Article 4, Co-Drawee v. Collecting Bank.\n      5\n         Because we affirm the district court’s holding that State Bank was a\ncollecting bank, we need not reach Bank of Texas’s argument that the trial court\nerred in finding that, even if State Bank was a payor bank, it had a valid defense\nto payment of the drafts under § 4-302(b).\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fauthorized.” Section 4-207(c) directs that “[a] person to whom [such] warranties\n\n. . . are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor\n\nas damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result\n\nof the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of\n\ninterest incurred as a result of the breach.” Article 4 of the Oklahoma\n\nCommercial Code takes its definition of “good faith” from section 3-103.      See §\n\n4-104(c). Section 3-103(a)(4) defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the\n\nobservance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.”\n\n       The trial court concluded that as a collecting bank State Bank was entitled\n\nto transfer warranties from Bank of Texas under § 4-207(a)(2) and      that Bank of\n\nTexas breached its warranty to State Bank that Goss’s signatures on the drafts\n\nwere authentic and authorized.\n\n       Bank of Texas argues it did not “transfer” the drafts to State Bank in\n\nexchange for the cashier’s check as required by the code for transfer warranties to\n\napply. In support of this contention, Bank of Texas claims the “undisputed\n\nevidence” shows that the cashier’s check was issued in response to Bank of\n\nTexas’s valid claim of late return rather than as a “settlement or other\n\nconsideration” for the drafts. (Appellant’s Br. A at 27.) Thus, Bank of Texas’s\n\nargument continues, transfer warranties do not apply because Bank of Texas\n\nreceived payment in satisfaction of its late return claim.\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\f       Bank of Texas’s assertion that the undisputed evidence shows the cashier’s\n\ncheck was issued in payment of its valid claim of late return, and not in payment\n\nof the drafts, is unsupported by the record and contradicted by Bank of Texas’s\n\nown admissions. The lower court’s determination of the reason motivating State\n\nBank’s issuance of the cashier’s check is a finding of fact. This finding of fact is\n\nof utmost importance to the conclusion of law concerning whether transfer\n\nwarranties applied and whether such warranties were breached by Bank of Texas.\n\nWe conclude that Bank of Texas has waived its right to challenge the factual\n\nfinding that the cashier’s check was issued in payment of the drafts and not in\n\npayment of its claim of late return because in the pretrial order it stipulated and\n\nadmitted to the fact that “State Bank issued the State Bank Cashier’s Check . . . to\n\npay the five state Bank Drafts.” (II Appellant’s App. A at 375.) Moreover, the\n\nevidence at trial gathered from both parties’ witnesses demonstrates that the\n\ncashier’s check was issued to pay for the drafts.\n\n       Even if Bank of Texas had not waived its arguments concerning the\n\nmotivation for issuing the cashier’s check, we would still affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court. Where a case is submitted with stipulated facts, we still review\n\nthe district court’s findings for clear error.            See Adair State Bank v. Am.

Moreover, when State Bank did take the drafts the second time they were\n\nsent, State Bank took them because of the claim of late return and issued the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Bank of Texas also argues that the good faith requirement of § 3-416(b)\napplies. This Court, however, will not consider arguments made under Article 3.\nThe trial court expressly held the documentary drafts were not negotiable\ninstruments and thus not subject to Article 3. We cannot find in appellant’s brief\nany argument that the trial court erred in this conclusion, nor that the\ndocumentary drafts were actually negotiable instruments. Since any such claims\nwere not raised on appeal, they are waived.\n      Because Article 3 does not apply to the documentary drafts, we also reject\nappellant’s argument that State Bank waived the issue of signature authorization\nor authenticity under § 3-308 and thus was not entitled to transfer warranties.\nNotably, this argument borders on the frivolous even if § 3-308 did apply. State\nBank explicitly denied the authenticity of Ventura’s signature in the pleadings.\n\n                                            - 13 -\n\fcashier’s check in satisfaction of that claim and not in response to the actual\n\ndrafts.\n\n          Bank of Texas’s argument hinges on whether or not State Bank took the\n\ndrafts in good faith because when State Bank did finally “take” the drafts, it\n\nissued the cashier’s check in satisfaction of the drafts and not in satisfaction of\n\nthe claim of late return. Bank of Texas’s only argument that State Bank did not\n\ntake the drafts in good faith relies on the implication that State Bank knew the\n\nsignatures on the drafts were unauthorized but issued the cashier’s check anyway;\n\ntherefore, State Bank did not act in good faith.    After reviewing the record, we\n\nfind the evidence supports the inference that State Bank took the drafts and issued\n\nthe cashier’s check in good faith, i.e., with “honesty in fact and [in] the\n\nobservance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.” § 3-103(a)(4).        7\n\n\n\n          In sum, we affirm the district court’s conclusion that State Bank was\n\nentitled to transfer warranties because it was a collecting bank and acted in good\n\nfaith. We further affirm the district court’s finding that Bank of Texas breached\n\nits transfer warranties to State Bank that Goss’s signatures on the drafts were\n\nauthentic and authorized.   8\n\n\n\n\n        We note that Article 4 refers to the Article 3 definition of “good faith.”\n          7\n\nSee § 4-104(c).\n\n        Because it is not necessary to the outcome of this appeal, we decline to\n          8\n\nreach State Bank’s assertion that “[b]reach of warranty under the UCC is an\n                                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                           - 14 -\n\f                            C. Admission of Evidence\n\n      The district court admitted into evidence a chart created by Brenda\n\nPlowman, a State Bank employee, given to Bank of Texas’s counsel only ten\n\nminutes before the commencement of the second day of trial. Bank of Texas,\n\nciting no legal authority and making no legal arguments, argues the trial court\n\nerred in admitting the chart.\n\n      We affirm the district court’s admission of the second Plowman chart\n\nbecause the trial court did not abuse its discretion. “[Evidentiary] rulings\n\ngenerally are committed to the very broad discretion of the trial judge, and they\n\nmay constitute an abuse of discretion only if based on an erroneous conclusion of\n\nlaw, a clearly erroneous finding of fact or a manifest error in judgment.” Webb v.\n\nABF Freight Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757860\"><a href=\"/opinion/757860/rick-webb-v-abf-freight-system-inc-a-corporation-and-teamsters-local/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1246 (10th Cir. 1998).

In its cross-examination\n\nof Plowman, Bank of Texas was able to point out the errors it believed were in\n\nthe chart. As such, Bank of Texas’s substantial rights have not been affected.\n\n                                D. Ordinary Care\n\n      A collecting bank must exercise ordinary care in presenting an item or in\n\nsending an item for presentment. See § 4-202(a)(1). Section 3-103(a)(7) defines\n\n“ordinary care” as “observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in\n\nthe area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in which the\n\nperson is engaged.” 9 Section 4-202(b) states that a “collecting bank exercises\n\nordinary care . . . by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following\n\nreceipt of an item.” However, “[t]aking proper action within a reasonably longer\n\ntime may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of\n\nestablishing timeliness.” § 4-202(b).\n\n      The trial court, in its findings of fact, concluded that “[n]either State Bank\n\n[n]or Bank of Texas consistently followed the collection letter instructions\n\naccompanying documentary drafts or notations on the drafts so as to strictly\n\ncomply with the time limitations set forth and both banks had a pattern and\n\npractice of late returns beyond the time specified by some additional days.” State\n\n\n\n      9\n         Section 4-104(c) of the Oklahoma Commercial Code refers to § 3-103 for\nthe definition of “ordinary care.”\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\fBank I, at *14. The court further found that State Bank had returned the seven\n\ndrafts now at issue “within a reasonable time.” Id.\n\n      Bank of Texas argues the district court erred in holding State Bank did not\n\nviolate its duty of ordinary care by returning the drafts outside the stated sight\n\nperiods. It asserts that State Bank failed to establish a course of dealing showing\n\nthe parties regularly returned drafts outside the designated sight periods. Bank of\n\nTexas properly notes that State Bank bore the burden of proving that it exercised\n\nordinary care and acted in a timely manner because State Bank did not meet the\n\n“midnight deadline” of § 4-202(b).\n\n      We affirm the district court’s finding of fact that the parties had a custom\n\nof returning documentary drafts outside of the designated sight period and its\n\nresulting conclusion that therefore State Bank’s late return of the drafts was, as a\n\nmatter of law, performed with ordinary care. We stress, however, that our\n\naffirmation rests largely on the deferential clearly erroneous standard of review\n\nwe are obliged to employ with regard to the district court’s findings of fact. 10\n\nUnless, after reviewing the record and the arguments on appeal, we are\n\n\n\n      10\n          We note there was evidence in the record that might have caused us, if\nwe had been the finder of fact, to rule differently. For example, the cross-\nexamination of Plowman concerning her second chart, Bank of Texas’s arguments\nthat the Plowman Chart did not establish a course of dealing for returns, as\nopposed to payments, and Plowman’s testimony that the late return of the drafts\nwould have violated State Bank’s policies.\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fcompletely unconvinced by the factfinder’s conclusions, we must generally defer\n\nto the factfinder’s experience with the mainsprings of human conduct as applied\n\nto the entirety of the case at hand.

The drafts at issue\n\nwere returned between one and six days late. Even a narrow reading of the\n\nPlowman chart establishes Bank of Texas had a custom of returning payment on\n\ndrafts to State Bank between one and eight days late. Because State Bank’s one\n\nto six day late returns of the drafts fell within the one to eight day custom, we\n\naffirm the district court’s holding that State Bank exercised ordinary care in\n\nreturning the drafts outside of the designated sight periods. Furthermore, because\n\nwe affirm the district court’s holding that State Bank did not breach its duty of\n\nordinary care, we reject Bank of Texas’s arguments that it is entitled to actual and\n\nconsequential damages as a result of the alleged breach.\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\f                              E. The Cashier’s Check\n\n      1. State Bank’s Obligation to Pay the Cashier’s Check\n\n      Upon receipt of the drafts for the second time, State Bank, through its\n\nemployee Teresa Bray, issued a cashier’s check in payment of the drafts. When\n\nanother employee of State Bank realized the cashier’s check had been issued\n\nmistakenly, State Bank attempted, but failed, to retrieve the check from the mail.\n\nConsequently, the following day State Bank contacted Bank of Texas to inform\n\nBank of Texas that the cashier’s check had been issued mistakenly, without\n\nauthorization, and thus a stop payment order had been placed on the check.\n\n      The trial court found State Bank was justified in issuing the stop payment\n\nunder § 3-411(c)(ii) 11 because the drafts were forged and Speer was attempting to\n\nperpetrate fraud. Section 3-411(c) provides, in relevant part, that damages are not\n\nallowed under the section “if the refusal of the obligated bank to pay occurs\n\nbecause . . . the obligated bank asserts a claim or defense of the bank that it has\n\nreasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to enforce\n\nthe instrument.”\n\n      Bank of Texas argues that § 3-411(c) only allows the issuer of a cashier’s\n\ncheck to avoid damages, not to avoid payment of the check. This argument\n\ncompletely ignores § 3-305(a) which details general defenses an obliged party can\n\n\n      11\n           Under Article 3, a cashier’s check is an instrument. See § 3-104.\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fassert to the payment of an instrument. Specifically, that section allows the\n\nobligated party to assert\n\n      a defense . . . stated in another section of this article or a defense . . .\n      that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the\n      instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple\n      contract.\n\n§ 3-305(a)(2).\n\n      In support of the trial court’s holding that State Bank was justified in\n\nstopping payment on the cashier’s check, State Bank raises four arguments on\n\nappeal. First, State Bank claims Bank of Texas misrepresented material facts in\n\nits letter accompanying the drafts on their second return to State Bank. Second,\n\nState Bank argues it properly stopped payment due to the fact the check was\n\nissued by mistake. Third, it argues Bank of Texas did not give valid\n\nconsideration for the cashier’s check. Finally, State Bank argues Speer’s\n\nunderlying fraud vitiated the contracts, i.e., the drafts, and thus provided a\n\ndefense to the enforcement of the contracts. Because we find State Bank’s second\n\ndefense to payment of the cashier’s check sufficient to affirm the trial court’s\n\nholding, we need not reach the other three arguments raised on appeal.\n\n      As discussed above, § 3-305(a)(2) allows an obliged party to assert\n\ndefenses to payment of an instrument otherwise available under Article 3 of the\n\nOklahoma Commercial Code. Section 3-418(b) provides “if an instrument has\n\nbeen paid or accepted by mistake . . . the person paying or accepting may, to the\n\n                                          - 20 -\n\fextent permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution . . . revoke the\n\nacceptance.” Section 3-409 defines “acceptance” as the “drawee’s signed\n\nagreement to pay a draft as presented.” Thus, in the case at issue, State Bank had\n\naccepted the cashier’s check.\n\n      Under Oklahoma law, mistake of fact\n\n      is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of\n      the person making the mistake, and consisting in:\n\n             1. An unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact past or\n             present, material to the contract; or,\n             2. Belief in the present existence of a thing material to the\n             contract, which does not exist, or in the past existence of such\n             a thing, which has not existed.\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 63. The commentary to Article 3 of the Oklahoma\n\nCommercial Code states that:\n\n      [I]f money is paid under a mistake of fact—that is, on the mistaken\n      supposition that a specific fact exists which would entitle the payee\n      to the money—and when the money would not have been paid if the\n      payor had known the fact was otherwise, then the money generally\n      can be recovered. The basis for the rule is that money paid through\n      misapprehension of facts belongs, in equity and good conscience, to\n      the person who paid it.\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, Commentary on Revised Uniform Commercial Code\n\nArticles 3 and 4–Negotiable Instruments and Bank Deposits and Collections, as\n\nEnacted in Oklahoma, Article 3, Recovery of Payment by Mistake (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\f      In the instant case, State Bank employee Bray mistakenly believed State\n\nBank was authorized by its customer to issue the cashier’s check, and thus she\n\nmistakenly issued the check. At trial, she testified she would not have issued the\n\ncheck had she known Goss had told State Bank not to pay for the drafts.\n\nMoreover, State Bank’s behavior following the issuance of the cashier’s check,\n\ni.e., the attempt to retrieve the check from the mail and the immediate placement\n\nof a stop order on the check, supports the conclusion that the bank mistakenly\n\nissued the check. Because of this mistake, State Bank had a viable defense to\n\npayment of the check and was able to revoke its acceptance under § 3-418(b). On\n\nthis alternative ground, we affirm the district court’s holding that State Bank was\n\njustified in stopping payment on the cashier’s check.\n\n      2. Bank of Texas’s Immunity from State Bank’s Defenses to Payment\n         of the Cashier’s Check\n\n      According to § 3-418(c), State Bank cannot successfully invoke mistake as\n\na defense to payment of the cashier’s check if Bank of Texas “took the [cashier’s\n\ncheck] in good faith and for value.” Under §§ 3-305(a) and (b), State Bank\n\ncannot successfully assert a common law contract defense or other defense listed\n\nin Article 3 of the Oklahoma Commercial Code if Bank of Texas was a holder in\n\ndue course. Section § 3-302(a)(2) defines a holder in due course as one who took\n\nan instrument “(i) for value, (ii) in good faith, . . . and (vi) without notice that any\n\nparty has a defense or claim in recoupment described in subsection (a) of Section\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\f3-305 of this title.” Section 3-303(a)(3) states that an instrument is taken for\n\nvalue if it is “issued . . . as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim\n\nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due.”\n\n      Bank of Texas argues that State Bank issued the cashier’s check in payment\n\nof Bank of Texas’s valid claim of late return. Therefore, under § 3-302(a)(2), the\n\nclaim of late return was “value” transferred for the cashier’s check. 12\n\n      Earlier in this opinion, we affirmed the trial court’s finding of fact that\n\nState Bank issued the cashier’s check to pay for the drafts and not in response to\n\nBank of Texas’s claim of late return. Because State Bank issued the cashier’s\n\ncheck to pay for the drafts—which were worthless because Ventura refused to\n\nauthorize payment—rather than to pay for Bank of Texas’s claim of late return,\n\nBank of Texas transferred no value for the cashier’s check. For this reason, Bank\n\nof Texas is not immune under § 3-418 to State Bank’s defense of mistaken\n\npayment of the check.\n\n      As with the issue of whether State Bank was justified in stopping payment\n\nof the cashier’s check, the parties raise numerous arguments on appeal to support\n\n\n      12\n         Bank of Texas also argues it gave value for the underlying drafts which\nshould be considered as giving value for the cashier’s check. In support of this\nproposition it cites “Case #2” to comment four in the UCC Comment, 1991\nAmendment to § 3-302. It is unclear how the comment cited supports the\nproposition of transferred value, i.e., that because Bank of Texas gave value to\nSpeer for the documentary drafts, Bank of Texas therefore gave value to State\nBank by transferring the documentary drafts to it.\n\n                                         - 23 -\n\ftheir positions concerning whether Bank of Texas was immune to State Bank’s\n\ndefense to payment of the check. Because we conclude Bank of Texas did not\n\ntake the cashier’s check for value, we affirm, albeit on alternate grounds, the\n\ndistrict court’s holdings that State Bank could stop payment on the cashier’s\n\ncheck and that Bank of Texas was not a holder in due course. Our reasoning\n\nmakes it unnecessary to consider the parties’ other arguments.\n\n                                 III. Costs and Fees\n\n         The second set of appeals concerns the district court’s award of costs and\n\nfees to State Bank. We review the decision to award attorneys’ fees, and the\n\namount awarded, for abuse of discretion. See Case v. Unified Sch. Dist.

However, because the court found the issues in\n\nState Bank’s Texas law claims “inextricably intertwined” with the issues in Bank\n\nof Texas’s Oklahoma law counterclaims, the court premised an award of fees\n\nunder Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936 on the unsegregated bills of State Bank’s\n\nattorneys.

State Bank argues the district court erred in\n\nholding that it could not recover attorneys’ fees on its primary claims under Texas\n\nlaw. Specifically, State Bank claims it can recover attorneys’ fees under Tex.\n\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001, Tex. Bus. & Com.

In that case, the court expressly\n\nheld that a “cashier’s check is a written contract with the maker impliedly\n\nagreeing to pay to any authorized holder the face value stated therein.” Id. at 863.\n\nAt summary judgment in this case, the district court ruled that State Bank was\n\nable to recover the value of the cashier’s check. Because a cashier’s check is a\n\n“contract” under Texas law, we hold that State Bank could properly have been\n\nallowed attorneys’ fees for its recovery of the value of the cashier’s check under §\n\n38.001(8). 14 Accordingly, insofar as the district court implicitly held, as a matter\n\n\n        14\n          The cashier’s check was issued to pay for three of the five drafts at issue\nin State Bank’s primary suit against Bank of Texas.

App. 1990), State Bank also argues the district court erred in not allowing\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees on its successful conversion claim under § 38.001.\n\nGittelman involved a bank’s foreclosure on a car that served as collateral for a\n\nloan. See 788 S.W.2d at 166-67. The court noted that although a conversion\n\nclaim does not support an award of attorneys’ fees under § 38.001(8), a contract\n\nclaim does. See Gittelman, 788 S.W.2d at 171. The trial court’s finding that the\n\nbank converted Gittelman’s car implied the bank did not have authority to sell the\n\ncar. See id. This, in turn, supported a finding of breach of contract and thus an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees under a breach of contract theory. See id.\n\n      State Bank’s reliance on Gittelman is misplaced. Gittelman does not hold\n\nthat facts supporting a conversion claim always support a breach of contract\n\n      14\n        (...continued)\nN.A. v. First State Bank of Texas, No. 97-CV-277-B, at *4-5 (N.D. Okla. June 10,\n1998) (“State Bank II”).\n      15\n         We find unconvincing State Bank’s novel state law claim that the\ndocumentary drafts somehow created contractual relationships between the banks,\nand we affirm the denial of attorneys’ fees as to the claims regarding the Bank of\nTexas documentary drafts. Also, although we find State Bank’s argument that\n§ 38.001 “does not necessarily require that the party seeking fees on the contract\nclaim be a party to that contract” interesting, we can find no precedent for this\nposition under Texas law, nor has State Bank cited any. We decline to create any\nsuch precedent.\n\n                                       - 27 -\n\fclaim. In Gittelman, there were actual written contracts between the bank and its\n\ncustomer. See id. at 167 (noting that the trial court found the bank had breached\n\nthe relevant written contracts). Although the opinion is not explicit as to the\n\nterms of those contracts, it seems likely that the contracts at issue were loan\n\ndocuments signed at the time Gittelman designated her car as collateral. Thus,\n\nwhen the bank converted Gittelman’s car, it breached the terms of the contract\n\ndealing with collateral placed on the loan.\n\n      In State Bank’s case, the conversion claim, as stated in the complaint, was\n\nthat “Bank of Texas improperly exercised dominion and control over the titles to\n\nthe automobiles that corresponded to each of the Bank of Texas Drafts . . . and\n\nthereafter improperly transferred and converted some or all of those titles to Speer\n\nwithout paying State Bank the funds due.” (I Appellant’s App. A at 5.) The facts\n\nsupporting the conversion claim do not support a breach of contract claim\n\nbetween the two banks because, as discussed above, the documentary drafts do\n\nnot establish a contract between the banks. Thus, we hold that the trial court\n\nproperly denied State Bank’s request for attorneys’ fees under § 38.001 for its\n\nsuccess on the conversion claim.\n\n             b. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 4.103(e)\n\n      Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 4.103(e) allows damages, other than actual\n\ndamages, if there is “bad faith.” We reject State Bank’s argument that it is\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fentitled to recover attorneys’ fees under this section because the trial court\n\nexplicitly noted that “no . . . finding [of bad faith] was entered in this case.”\n\nState Bank III, at *7. Given the trial court was presented with the same\n\narguments we are under § 4.103(e), we think the foregoing statement implicitly\n\ndemonstrates that the trial court affirmatively did not find bad faith on the part of\n\nBank of Texas. We therefore affirm the trial court’s holding that State Bank\n\ncould not recover attorneys’ fees under § 4.103(e).\n\n             c. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 3.411(b)\n\n      Section 3.411(b) provides that a person who enforces a right to a check “is\n\nentitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from . . .\n\nnonpayment and may recover consequential damages.” Section 3.411(c) provides\n\nthat expenses or consequential damages are not recoverable if the obligated bank\n\nrefused to pay because it had “reasonable grounds to believe [it had a claim or\n\ndefense] . . . available against the person entitled to enforce the instrument.”\n\n      The trial court denied recovery of attorneys’ fees to State Bank under\n\n§ 3.411 because it found that it “did not and [could not] . . . conclude that Bank\n\nof Texas had no reasonable basis for asserting the positions taken.” State Bank\n\nIII, at *7. We affirm the trial court and reject as frivolous State Bank’s assertion\n\nthat the trial court’s finding “was inconsistent with the court’s earlier finding that\n\nBank of Texas had no viable defense to payment of that check under § 3-411(c).”\n\n\n                                          - 29 -\n\f(Appellee’s Br. B at 39.) Although the court ultimately found Bank of Texas had\n\nno viable defense, that determination did not preclude the court from finding that\n\nBank of Texas had a reasonable basis for asserting defenses to payment.\n\n       2. Attorneys’ Fees Under Oklahoma Law\n\n      In its cross-appeal, State Bank also asserts the trial court erred in denying\n\nattorneys’ fees under Oklahoma law for Bank of Texas’s counterclaims.\n\nSpecifically, State Bank asserts it was entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936 and under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207(c).\n\n             a. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936\n\n      Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 936 provides as follows:\n\n      In any civil action to recover on an open account, a statement of\n      account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument, or contract\n      relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, or merchandise, or\n      for labor or services, unless otherwise provided by law or the\n      contract which is the subject [of] the action, the prevailing party\n      shall be allowed a reasonable attorney fee to be set by the court, to be\n      taxed and collected as costs.\n\nAlthough the district court awarded State Bank attorneys’ fees under § 936 for its\n\nsuccessful defense to payment of the cashier’s check, it did not award fees under\n\nthat section for State Bank’s defense to payment of the documentary drafts. On\n\nappeal, State Bank claims “documentary drafts logically fall within the litany of\n\nmonetary obligations set forth by § 936.” (I Appellee’s Br. B at 40.) Notably,\n\nevery one of the “litany of monetary obligations” set forth in § 936 involves some\n\n\n                                        - 30 -\n\fsort of instrument on which suit would be brought because of a direct obligation\n\nestablished by the instrument between a plaintiff and a defendant. Here, Bank of\n\nTexas’s counterclaims under Oklahoma law were based on the claim that State\n\nBank was required to compensate Bank of Texas for the value of the drafts\n\nbecause State Bank returned the documentary drafts to Bank of Texas in an\n\nuntimely manner. The counterclaims were not brought for payment of the drafts\n\nthemselves.\n\n      Although State Bank properly prevailed on the counterclaims, the\n\ncounterclaims did not involve a suit on a contract, a note, a bill, etc., as is\n\nrequired under § 936. We therefore hold that the trial court did not err in failing\n\nto grant State Bank attorneys’ fees for its successful defense against the Bank of\n\nTexas counterclaims.\n\n              b. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207\n\n      The trial court held, and we affirm, that Bank of Texas breached the\n\ntransfer warranties it owed to State Bank on the State Bank drafts. Okla. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 12A, § 4-207(c) provides recovery “equal to the loss suffered . . . , but\n\nnot more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest” to one\n\nwho took an item in good faith and who experienced a breach of transfer\n\nwarranties. On appeal, State Bank argues the trial court erred by not allowing it\n\nto recover attorneys’ fees as a measure of “expenses” under § 4-207(c).\n\n\n                                          - 31 -\n\f      We have carefully considered the arguments raised on appeal by both State\n\nBank and Bank of Texas. Because we agree with the district court’s thorough\n\ndiscussion of the availability of attorneys’ fees as expenses under § 4-207, we\n\naffirm the denial of attorneys’ fees pursuant to that section. 16\n\n                            B. Bank of Texas’s Appeal\n\n      1. Inextricably Intertwined Doctrine\n\n      Although the district court did not find an independent justification for\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees for State Bank’s primary claims under Texas law or for\n\nthe counterclaim concerning the documentary drafts under Oklahoma law, the\n\ncourt found the claims and counterclaims “inextricably intertwined” for purposes\n\nof awarding attorneys’ fees.\n\n             [T]he Court finds the issues surrounding the cashier’s check\n      could not be adequately addressed without a thorough understanding\n      of the transactions involving the documentary drafts which led to the\n      issuance of the cashier’s check and the stop payment.\n\n\n      16\n          We decline to consider State Bank’s claim—made in its Reply Brief on\ncross-appeal—that it is entitled to fees incurred enforcing subpoenas. State\nBank’s opening brief on cross-appeal states “the trial court did err in concluding\nthat attorneys’ fees may not be recovered under UCC §§ 4-207(c), 4-103(e) and 3-\n411(b), and fee statutes set forth under Texas and Oklahoma law. State Bank\nurges that only to this extent should the trial court’s Order and Judgment be\nreversed.” (Appellee’s Br. B at 8.) We have reviewed State Bank’s opening brief\non cross-appeal and can find no mention of the subpoena fees issue. Since State\nBank did not argue the subpoena fees issue in its opening brief, Bank of Texas\nwas not given the chance to properly respond to the argument and we decline to\nconsider the issue.

Mhoon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675840\"><a href=\"/opinion/675840/state-farm-fire-casualty-company-v-robert-ray-mhoon-takura-fujiwara/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n984 n.7 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\f             The Court observes that this was a complex case in which the\n      similarity of the claims, defenses, amount of the cashier’s checks and\n      the underlying transactions required considerable concentration in\n      order to keep the primary claims and the counterclaims straight. The\n      legal research necessarily overlapped so that a finding that the claims\n      and defenses and underlying facts are, to an extent, “inextricably\n      intertwined” is supportable by the record.\n\nState Bank III, at *10. The court found that State Bank’s principal claims were\n\ngoverned by Texas law which, the court held, did not support an award of\n\nattorneys’ fees. Therefore, the court reduced the award by one third. See id., at\n\n*10-11.\n\n      As discussed, there is no question that State Bank was entitled to attorneys’\n\nfees under Oklahoma law for its successful defense to payment of the cashier’s\n\ncheck. Bank of Texas’s challenge on appeal to the award of attorneys’ fees under\n\nOklahoma law concerns the trial court’s application of the “inextricably\n\nintertwined” doctrine. Specifically, Bank of Texas argues that (1) the claims\n\ninvolved in these appeals are not intertwined, (2) the “inextricably intertwined”\n\ndoctrine does not apply to this case, and (3) State Bank was required, under\n\nOklahoma law, to segregate its requests for fees.\n\n      In RJB Gas Pipeline Co. v.

See RJB Gas Pipeline, 813 P.2d at 14.\n\n      Although we are sympathetic to the difficulty of segregating attorneys’ fees\n\nbetween claims that are so closely related, we can find no support for an\n\n“inextricably intertwined” exception to the general Oklahoma rule that attorneys’\n\nfees can only be awarded where there is an independent statutory basis.

Costs and Fees Related to Denton Texas Suit\n\n      Bank of Texas originally filed a lawsuit against State Bank in Denton,\n\nTexas, on the claims that ultimately became the counterclaims in the instant suit.\n\nThat suit was dismissed. State Bank sought recovery for the costs and attorneys’\n\nfees associated with that case (i.e., fees incurred for the removal petition and\n\nfiling a motion to transfer) in the instant suit. Citing absolutely no legal\n\nauthority, Bank of Texas asserts that recovery of those costs and fees in this suit\n\nis improper because State Bank “at least [should have] attempted to seek such\n\n\n                                         - 35 -\n\frecovery from the Denton judge.” (Appellant’s Br. B at 20.) We reject this\n\nargument as wholly unsupported by legal authority as well as unpersuasive. The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees arising out of the\n\nDenton suit except to the extent such fees were premised on the application of the\n\ninextricably intertwined doctrine under Oklahoma law.\n\n      Bank of Texas also claims the district court erred in awarding fees to State\n\nBank for State Bank’s unsuccessful attempt to recover punitive damages and for\n\nState Bank’s unsuccessful motion for summary judgment on Bank of Texas’s\n\ncounterclaims. Bank of Texas cites RJB Gas Pipeline Co. for the proposition that\n\nan unsuccessful claim for punitive damages related to a successful breach of\n\ncontract claim does not support an award of fees under Oklahoma law. State\n\nBank attempts to distinguish that case on the ground that the underlying claim for\n\nthe punitive damages was a tort claim. We do not find this distinction persuasive\n\nbecause State Bank premised its claim for punitive damages on its conversion\n\nclaim–i.e., a tort claim. State Bank also attempts to argue the district court’s\n\naward of fees for the unsuccessful summary judgment motion and for the punitive\n\ndamages claims were appropriate because of the district court’s proper application\n\nof the inextricably intertwined doctrine. Pursuant to our holding above, we\n\nreverse the district court’s award of attorneys’ fees for the unsuccessful summary\n\njudgment motion and for the punitive damages claim.\n\n\n                                         - 36 -\n\f      3.

Such charges are only appropriate\n\nif they are “clearly shown to have been made (1) for the delegated performance of\n\nsubstantive legal work, that (2) would otherwise have to be performed by a\n\nlawyer, (3) at a rate higher than that charged for the nonlawyers’ time.” Id. at\n\n809. A party seeking an award of attorneys’ fees “must plead and prove that the\n\ncharges made for non-lawyer’s time covered work that a lawyer would have had\n\nto perform but for the performance of such services by a legal assistant.” Id.\n\nAlso, the “total charges made for the legal assistant’s services must be less than\n\n\n                                        - 37 -\n\fthe total charges would have been, had a lawyer performed the services.” Id.

See id.\n\n      In its appeal, Bank of Texas claims that the award of attorneys’ fees to\n\nState Bank included charges for work performed by paralegals that was not\n\n“perfected” for purposes of either Texas or Oklahoma law. Specifically, Bank of\n\nTexas claims the charges were inappropriate under Texas law because there was\n\nno indication as to the qualifications of the paralegals and the billing summaries\n\ninclude billing for “clerical services” that are not “substantive legal services.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. B at 21.) The stated failure under Oklahoma law is that the trial\n\ntestimony did not demonstrate the work performed by the paralegals would\n\notherwise have been performed by an attorney and the billing inappropriately\n\nincluded charges for clerical duties performed by the paralegals.\n\n      After careful review of the record, we hold that insofar as the trial court\n\nproperly awarded attorneys’ fees, it did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees\n\nfor work performed by paralegals under either Oklahoma or Texas law. The\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fqualifications of the paralegals and their performance of “substantive legal work”\n\nwere substantiated in the fee application or testified to at trial. Although we\n\nagree with appellant that Oklahoma law places the burden of proof and pleading\n\non the party requesting fees, after careful review of the fee application we\n\nconclude the work performed by paralegals for which fees were sought was all\n\nwork that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma listed as proper for a legal assistant in\n\nTaylor, 874 P.2d at 809.\n\n         4.

Bangerter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701299\"><a href=\"/opinion/701299/jane-l-on-behalf-of-herself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-utah/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1505</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1509 (10th Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n         The district court affirmed the clerk’s award to State Bank of $3,401.71 in\n\ncosts made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920, concluding that the amount taxed as\n\ncosts for copies was justified. We have reviewed the record and the parties’\n\narguments and can find nothing to suggest the district court abused its discretion.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the court’s award of costs for copies. See, e.g., Tilton v.\n\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"154950\"><a href=\"/opinion/154950/tilton-v-capital-citiesabc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1476 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n         5. Oklahoma Commercial Code Costs\n\n\n                                         - 39 -\n\f      The clerk declined to award State Bank costs under the Oklahoma\n\nCommercial Code. Upon review of the clerk’s suggested taxation of costs, the\n\ntrial court awarded State Bank an additional $10,848.53 in costs as damages under\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, § 4-207. This additional award included costs incurred\n\nfor telephone use, postage, computer research, faxes, Federal Express, binding, a\n\nprivate investigator, courier services, staff overtime, mileage incurred for\n\nattorneys to take depositions of Bank of Texas employees, and expert witnesses.\n\nHowever, the court denied State Bank costs for meals under any theory of\n\nrecovery.\n\n      As an initial matter, we affirm the district court’s denial of costs pursuant\n\nto Okla. Stat. Ann. tit 12A, § 3-411 and § 4-103 for the reasons stated in the\n\ndiscussion above concerning the award of attorneys’ fees. However, because we\n\nfind that the district court properly awarded State Bank costs as an element of\n\ndamages for breach of transfer warranties under § 4-207, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s award of other costs. Although the official comments to § 4-207 indicate\n\na reluctance to grant attorneys’ fees as expenses, they do not demonstrate similar\n\nreluctance with regard to other expenses incurred in litigation as a result of\n\nbreach of transfer warranties. We decline to reach whether any of the\n\nindividually contested costs were properly awarded under § 1920 because we find\n\nthat they were properly awarded under § 4-207.\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\f                                        IV\n\n      The judgment of the district court is REVERSED insofar as it found that\n\nattorneys’ fees are not available under Texas law for State Bank’s successful\n\nrecovery on the cashier’s check and insofar as it applied the inextricably\n\nintertwined doctrine to allow recovery of attorneys’ fees under Oklahoma law.\n\nThe judgment is AFFIRMED as to all other issues and this matter is\n\nREMANDED to the district court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n\n\n                                      ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                      Carlos F.
