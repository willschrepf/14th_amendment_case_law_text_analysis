Weaver Sr.\n\nDECISION\n\n        {¶ 1} Plaintiff, Jess Howard Electric Company (JHE), brought this action against\ndefendant, Ohio School Facilities Commission (OSFC), alleging breach of contract and\nseeking a declaratory judgment.               The issues of liability and damages were not\nbifurcated and the case proceeded to trial on both issues.1\n        {¶ 2} In 2007, OSFC and the Columbus Public School District (the Owner)\nsolicited bids for the construction of a new building known as the Livingston Avenue\nElementary School (the project).             The project called for multiple prime contractors.\nHarris Design Services acted as the architect on the project. Smoot Elford Resource\n(SER), an agent of the Owner, acted as the construction manager on the project.\nPursuant to the contract’s General Conditions (GC), SER was responsible for\nscheduling the project and coordinating the work of the contractors. (Joint Exhibit A4.)\nMichael Kray, III, was SER’s project manager on the project from November 2007 until\nproject completion. William Green, Jr., an employee of SER for approximately five\n\n\n        \u0002\n         The trial testimony of Robert Large, Jonathan Howard, and William Green, Jr., was presented by\nvideo deposition in accordance with the court’s August 30, 2012 entry.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         -2-                                DECISION\n\nyears, was SER’s on-site supervisor until September 2008, and he reported to Kray.\nTom Sisterhen was SER’s project executive. FH Martin was the general contractor.\nThe project was a two-storied building comprised of four distinct areas, which were\nreferred to as Areas A, B, C, and D throughout the construction schedules.\n       {¶ 3} JHE bid for and was awarded a contract with the Owner as the prime\ncontractor for the electrical work on the project. According to JHE, in its bid it estimated\nits labor for the project to be 822 man-days. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.) Jonathan Howard is\nJHE’s president, but at the time of the bid, he was executive vice president and he\nreviewed the bid that was prepared by JHE’s estimators.          Howard testified that he\nbelieved that the bid was reasonable. The man-days component of the bid was based\non the default schedule, which was the schedule presented to those bidding on the\nproject in 2007. JHE’s total bid was $1,093,747. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 33.) On September\n4, 2007, the parties signed the contract and the total price for the prime contract for\nelectrical work was $1,113,747. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 3.)\n       {¶ 4} As testified to by Green, when a project is bid, the contractors are given a\ndefault schedule. Pursuant to GC 4.3, the default schedule governs the project until a\nconstruction schedule is issued.      After the contracts are awarded, a construction\nschedule is then developed by SER with the input of the contractors; this schedule was\nalso referred to as the contractor’s schedule. Even after the construction schedule is\ndeveloped, it continues to be adjusted throughout the project.\n       {¶ 5} At a November 7, 2007 Progress Meeting, Kray addressed the issue of\nmoving from the default schedule to the input schedule. (Defendant’s Exhibit FF.) Kray\ntestified that when he became the project manager for SER in November 2007, he\nlooked at the default schedule and learned that there was no subsequent schedule,\nwhich was a “problem.” According to Kray, the default schedule that was presented to\nthe contractors during the bidding process, was in effect until March 2008 when the\ncontractors signed the “contractor’s schedule.”\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        -3-                               DECISION\n\n       {¶ 6} On September 10, 2007, SER issued a “Notice to Proceed” to JHE.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 4.) As stated in the Notice to Proceed, the contract completion date\nwas December 30, 2008. During the course of the project, all of the contractors were\ngranted a nine-day extension of the contract completion date to January 9, 2009.\nChange Order 007, dated May 28, 2008, granted a time extension of nine days, but JHE\nrefused to sign the change order. (Joint Exhibit A2.)\n       {¶ 7} JHE alleges that its work on the project was encumbered by numerous\ndelays at the beginning on the project. Greg Rudduck, who has been employed by JHE\nfor over 30 years, was JHE’s project manager and was at the construction site several\ntimes a week during the course of the project. Initially, Rudduck testified that there was\na delay in obtaining the temporary power on the project site. According to Rudduck,\nJHE was unable to obtain the temporary power permit until the Owner received the\nbuilding permit.     While Rudduck testified that the building permit was obtained\napproximately eight weeks after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed, the court finds\nthat the building permit was issued on October 5, 2007, which was almost one month\nafter the Notice to Proceed was issued. (Defendant’s Exhibit CC.) According to both\nRudduck and Kray, obtaining the building permit was the responsibility of the Owner,\nwhile obtaining the electrical permit was JHE’s responsibility.\n       {¶ 8} Rudduck applied for the electrical permit on October 10, 2007.\n(Defendant’s Exhibit GG.) As of October 31, 2007, JHE was authorized to choose\neither American Electric Power or City of Columbus to provide the temporary power to\nthe project site. According to the testimony of both Large and Green, temporary power\nto the job site was in place around December 7, 2007.             Green testified that he\nhandwrote his daily job entries until power was on site. Green’s handwritten notes\ncontinued until nearly the end of November 2007, at which time he began to make his\nentries in Prolog, a computer program used by the Owner and contractors to track their\nwork. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 47.)\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                          -4-                                 DECISION\n\n       {¶ 9} Rudduck also testified about additional delays into December 2007, which\nincluded a water line issue caused by the Owner not paying the “tap fee,” and a soil\nissue which precluded JHE from installing the underground electrical lines.           Robert\nLarge is employed by JHE as an electrical foreman, a position he has held for\napproximately seven years. On the project, he was JHE’s on-site foreman. Large\nexplained that in late December 2007 and early January 2008, JHE was delayed on\ncertain activities because the plumbing contractor had not completed its work; however,\nhe admitted that JHE was performing other productive contract work during this time\nperiod. Large also testified that there were various delays in January and February\n2008 caused by the masonry contractor and FH Martin. However, Large admitted that\nthere are always “some” delays on a construction project.\n       {¶ 10} On January 3, 2008, Large noted in his Prolog entries that the schedule\nwas starting to be impacted from the delays. Large made similar notations throughout\nthe winter of 2008, but the last mention of any schedule impact was on April 7, 2008.\n(Joint Exhibit A3.) While Large testified that the project was still behind schedule after\nthat date and that he “got tired” of noting delays in Prolog, the court finds that the failure\nto include such indication is significant.\n       {¶ 11} Large testified that in the summer of 2008, JHE had to bring on additional,\nexperienced electricians to assist with the electrical work. In summary, Large explained\nthat JHE’s work was behind schedule on the project due to the delayed work of\npredecessor trades.\n       {¶ 12} As early as November 26, 2007, SER, through Kray, began the process of\nestablishing the construction schedule.      On December 14, 2007, Kray emailed the\n“Proposed Contract Schedule” to the contractors. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 8.) Kray’s email\nrequested that the contractors provide their input and sign and date the schedule by\nDecember 28, 2007. At the December 19, 2007 Progress Meeting, the construction\nschedule was discussed and JHE “noticed they are providing a [Gantt] chart which\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        -5-                                   DECISION\n\nindicates items to be completed at the same time. Jess Howard noted items on the\nschedule have moved up or back by as much as (2 1/2) months.” (Defendant’s Exhibit\nFF.) On January 2, 2008, Rudduck sent Kray an email that stated that JHE was being\nimpacted by delays on the schedule. Rudduck wrote, “it is my opinion that Areas A and\nB are 4 to 5 weeks behind schedule.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9.) Kray explained that JHE’s\nresponse was relevant input for developing the construction schedule.\n      {¶ 13} According to Rudduck, he met with SER representatives on February 5,\n2008, to discuss the delays on the project. During this meeting, JHE presented three\nGantt charts to SER depicting the default schedule, the proposed contractor’s schedule,\nand a revised default schedule. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits 13A-13C.) Rudduck explained that\nhe used this as a tool to show SER JHE’s scheduling concerns. Rudduck testified that\nhis concern was that the project was delayed at the beginning for various reasons and\nthat JHE’s completion date was going to stay the same such that JHE’s work on the\nproject would be compressed and stacking of trades would occur. Rudduck testified\nthat Kray and Sisterhen acknowledged that there was a problem with the schedule at\nthat time. Kray recalled the meeting and he testified that he did not agree with JHE’s\nassumptions that stacking was going to occur on the project.\n      {¶ 14} On February 26, 2008, JHE wrote a letter addressed to Steve Volpe, of\nColumbus Public Schools stating, “This letter is to advise the Columbus Public School\nDistrict that [JHE] is presenting a claim on Livingston Avenue Elementary School * * *\n[JHE] has no other choice but to ask for compensation on this project. Costs related to\nthis claim can only be addressed when a workable schedule is obtained, and reviewed,\nto achieve an agreeable completion date.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) Rudduck testified that\nthis letter intended to raise the issue of stacking that JHE was experiencing.\n      {¶ 15} At a March 5, 2008 meeting with SER and Columbus Public Schools, JHE\npresented a list of approximately 50 project items that were behind schedule. (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 14.) Rudduck testified that he believed these items were on the “critical path” to\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        -6-                                 DECISION\n\nJHE but he did not know if the Owner was of the same opinion. According to Rudduck,\nat the time of this meeting, the schedule on the project indicated that certain work was\ncomplete when, in fact, it was not complete on the job site. Kray admitted that these\nitems were behind schedule and that he understood that JHE wanted to correct the\nschedule. Further, Kray testified that the list of items provided by JHE was input to help\ndevelop the contractor’s schedule.\n       {¶ 16} Kray testified that when a project is behind schedule, there are four\noptions: 1) ignore the delay; 2) extend the contract time; 3) issue a notice to comply; or\n4) work as a “team” to find a solution. Kray testified that when JHE showed him the\nitems in Exhibit 14 that were behind schedule in February 2008, he chose to have the\ncontractors work as a team to solve the issue as he developed the construction\nschedule that was signed off by the contractors in March 2008. Kray testified that the\nlist of items that JHE provided was helpful input for the proposed schedule pursuant to\nGC 4.3.6.1 and that JHE provided input from December through February, which he\nconsidered before issuing the schedule in March 2008.\n       {¶ 17} In a follow-up letter to the March 5, 2008 meeting, JHE sent a letter to\nVolpe which states that it unsuccessfully attempted to work with Kray on the scheduling\nissues and that the project “is behind schedule on approximately 54 activities on the\ndefault schedule, and approximately 33 activities on the updated default schedule.”\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 15.) SER responded with a letter on March 18, 2008, in which Kray\nwrites, “you are correct in stating the project does not have a signed off schedule, but I\ndisagree with the premise of your letter for why the schedule is not signed off.”\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 16.) Kray went on to write that SER had been working “diligently to\nhave an approved Construction Schedule for the project” but that JHE has “applied the\nbreaks due to the concern for the manpower available * * *.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 16.)\n       {¶ 18} On March 25, 2008, JHE wrote a letter addressed to Kray which again\naddresses JHE’s concerns of the delays and lack of a schedule on the project.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         -7-                                DECISION\n\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17.) The letter states, “I would like to provide you with an extent of\nimpact these situations are causing [JHE], but at this point, it would not be practical or\npossible due to the status of the job in relationship to the schedule. * * * It is our claim\nthat the job is a minimum of ninety (90) days behind.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17.)\n        {¶ 19} On March 14, 2008, SER issued the construction schedule and the\ncontractors signed off on the schedule; however, JHE signed the schedule under\nprotest. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 18.) Once the construction schedule was released, it was\nupdated monthly to show the progress of the various activities and JHE continued to\nobject to those subsequent schedules. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits 21, 27, 28, 30, 31.)\n        {¶ 20} On April 3, 2008, JHE wrote a letter to Harris Design Services, care of\nMike Kray, seeking a “request for equitable adjustment” under the contract. The letter\nprovides a history of the correspondence between the parties and states that JHE “has\nbeen informing the Board’s authorized representatives that the Project has been\ndelayed for reasons not caused by [JHE]. * * * [JHE] requests a 90 day extension to the\nschedule from the Board and the Commission.” (Defendant’s Exhibit BB1.) JHE cites\nArticle 7 and “requests that the Board, with the approval of the Commission, issue a\nchange order directing that [JHE] comply with the latest revised scheduled in\naccordance with G.C. 7.1.2 and 7.4 et seq. In response to that directive, [JHE] will\nissue a proposal in accordance with G.C. 7.6.” (Defendant’s Exhibit BB1.) Jonathan\nHoward certified the April 3, 2008 letter: “I hereby certify that the increased costs\nincurred by the above claim are fairly and accurately assessed to be between\n$300,000.00 and $400,000.00, depending upon how soon predecessor trades recover\nto the original schedule. [JHE] agrees to produce its bid work papers and job costs for\nthe purpose of audit, subject to a reasonable protective order.” (Defendant’s Exhibit\nBB1.)\n        {¶ 21} On April 23, 2008, Kray responded to JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter and\ninformed JHE that the request “only partially provides the information requested in\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         -8-                                DECISION\n\nArticle 8.1.2.1” and requested JHE to provide all of the items listed under Article 8.1.2.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 20.) SER sent an additional letter to JHE on May 28, 2008 because it\nhad not received the additional information. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 22.) On June 4, 2008,\nJHE responded to SER’s April 23, 2008 letter. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 46.)\n       {¶ 22} Change Order 007 was issued on May 28, 2008 and granted a nine-day\nextension of time. On June 25, 2008, JHE wrote a letter to SER stating that it “cannot\naccept the proposed 9 day extension of time to the contract” and JHE requested a 60-\nday extension of time. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 23.)\n       {¶ 23} On July 15, 2008, JHE provided a response to SER’s request for additional\ninformation and updated costs pursuant to GC 8.1.2. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25, Defendant’s\nExhibit BB2.) Howard testified that this was JHE’s request for an Article 8 meeting. The\nletter stated that JHE estimated 822 man-days in its bid on the project but that as of July\n6, 2008, it had expended 72 percent of its man-days to complete 53 percent of the work\non the project. JHE estimated that an additional 445 man-days was required to finish\nthe project because of stacking delays and inefficiencies.         (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.)\nJonathan Howard certified “that the increased costs due to contract inefficiencies as of\n7-6-08 is $78,389.63. Total estimated cost to complete contract is $222,945.00, for a\ntotal claim of $301,334.63.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.) Attached to the letter was a job cost\nreport showing its labor details. Kray testified that he compared JHE’s estimated labor\ncosts as contained in the July 15, 2008 letter with a similar Columbus Public Schools\nbuilding project and determined that JHE’s labor estimate was not accurate. (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 48.)\n       {¶ 24} Sisterhen testified that he provided the recommendation as to whether\nJHE should be paid on its claim and if so, how much. He testified that upon analysis of\nthe claim, JHE failed to tie its costs to the scheduled activities. Further, he explained\nthat JHE provided him with inconsistent figures regarding the amount of man-days its\nwork was impacted. Reviewing JHE’s July 15, 2008 letter, Sisterhen testified that he\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                             -9-                          DECISION\n\nwas not “dissatisfied” with the amount of backup that JHE provided, but he testified that\nhe requested a detailed cost report several times from JHE that was never provided to\nhim. On August 20, 2008, Sisterhen asked JHE to provide detailed documentation to\nprove its impact and the amount thereof, which included, “the comparison of planned\nvs[.] actual labor; analysis of the labor hours presented regarding the onsite supervision\nwhich should not be included; and an analysis of the labor rate used in the calculation of\nthe total request.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 29.)\n       {¶ 25} On November 20, 2008, JHE provided a one-page “labor analysis to date”\nwhich states that the “actual cost of stacking and project inefficiencies” to date was\n$120,853,68.     (Defendant’s Exhibit BB3.)       In a May 27, 2009 email to Kray, JHE\nprovided a week by week breakdown of its labor on the project through November 20,\n2008. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 32.)\n       {¶ 26} On June 17, 2009, SER sent a letter to Columbus City School District\ninforming it that SER had completed the “job site dispute resolution with [JHE] * * * We\nwere not able to come to a resolution at the meetings and it has been determined by\n[SER] a change order is not warranted.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 34.) On June 18, 2009, SER\nsent a letter to JHE stating that the parties could not come to an agreement and that its\nrequest for a change order had been rejected. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 35.) JHE responded\nto the letter on July 27, 2009, stating that it intended to proceed on its claim for\ncompensation. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 36.) JHE provided additional information to SER on\nAugust 3, 2009, and provided an updated job cost report, the original cap sheet, and\nweekly labor reports. (Defendant’s Exhibit BB4.) On December 1, 2010, Columbus City\nSchools rejected JHE’s claim and determined that no change order for additional\ncompensation was warranted. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 39.)\n       {¶ 27} JHE claims that it is entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract.\nJHE alleges that OSFC’s failure to timely issue a construction schedule caused its work\nto stack on the project. JHE claims that it bid 822 man-days on the project but that it\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                          - 10 -                             DECISION\n\nincurred 1207.9 man-days of labor on the project. JHE seeks damages for the 385.9\nman-day overrun that it experienced on the project for a total claim of $208,353.99.\n(Plaintiff’s Post-Trial Brief, pg. 18-19.)\n\n\n       LAW\n       {¶ 28} Contract interpretation is a matter of law for the court. City of St. Marys v.\nAuglaize Cty. Bd. of Commrs., 115 Ohio St.3d 387, 2007-Ohio-5026, ¶ 38. When\ninterpreting a contract, a court’s principal objective is to ascertain and give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Hamilton Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Nationwide Ins. Cos., 86 Ohio St.3d\n270, 273 (1999). “The intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the\nlanguage they chose to employ in the agreement.” Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co., 31 Ohio\nSt.3d 130 (1987), paragraph one of the syllabus. In determining the parties’ intent, a\ncourt must read the contract as a whole and give effect, if possible, to every part of the\ncontract.   Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty.

No. 09AP-822, 2010-Ohio-2906.\n       {¶ 30} JHE argues that it complied with the contractual requirements for its\nrequest for additional compensation. Article 8 of the general conditions of the contract\ndetails the procedure for requesting additional payment. The relevant portion of the\nparties’ agreement reads as follows:\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 11 -                              DECISION\n\n       {¶ 31} “8.1.1 Any request for equitable adjustment of Contract shall be made in\nwriting to the Architect, through the Construction Manager, and filed prior to Contract\nCompletion, provided the Contractor notified the Architect, through the Construction\nManager, no more than ten (10) days after the initial occurrence of the facts which are\nthe basis of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, failure of the Contractor to\ntimely provide such notice and a contemporaneous statement of damages shall\nconstitute a waiver by the Contractor of any claim for additional compensation or for\nmitigation of Liquidated Damages.”\n       {¶ 32} Although Article 8.1.1 clearly requires that a written claim be filed prior to\ncontract completion, there is no writing requirement for the 10-day notice, and the court\nfinds that such language is unambiguous. OSFC argues that the “writing” requirement\nfor Article 8.1.1 is contained in GC 1.3, which states, “Whenever any provision of the\nContract Documents requires the giving of any notice, such notice shall be deemed to\nhave been validly given if given in writing and delivered personally to the individual or to\na member of the entity for whom the notice is intended * * *.” The court finds that GC\n1.3 does not require that all notices must be in writing. Consequently, the court must\nexamine both the written and oral communications between JHE and SER in order to\ndetermine whether JHE complied with the notice provision of Article 8.1.1.\n       {¶ 33} It must first be determined whether JHE provided notice no more than 10\ndays after the initial occurrence of the facts that are the basis of the claim.        JHE\ncontends that the 10-day notice requirement began to run when the construction\nschedule was issued in March 2008. However, Rudduck admitted that the basis of\nJHE’s claim were the delays and scheduling problems which occurred in the late fall of\n2007 and early winter of 2008. Rudduck testified that he did not provide notice within\n10 days regarding the issue of the building permit nor did he provide notice within 10\ndays of the soil compaction issue. Rudduck explained that he could not know the\nimpact of the delays inasmuch as the contractor’s schedule had not been signed at this\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                               - 12 -                                    DECISION\n\npoint in the project. However, Rudduck testified that JHE put SER on notice that the\ndelays at the beginning of the project were a concern and that this was discussed at the\nProgress meetings beginning in December 2007.\n        {¶ 34} The court finds unpersuasive JHE’s argument that the 10-day notice\nrequirement did not begin until the construction schedule was issued in March 2008.\nArticle 8 states that the notice must be given within 10 days, without regard to whether\nthe project is operating under the default schedule or construction schedule.\nFurthermore, GC 4.3.1 states that the schedule included in the bid governs until the\nconstruction manager issues the construction schedule.                    The court finds that JHE\nprovided notice within 10 days of the initial occurrence of the facts which are the basis\nof the claim. The court finds that JHE provided oral notice of its claim regarding the\ndelays on the project as evidenced in the Progress meeting in December 2007 and on\nJanuary 2, 2008, JHE informed SER that it was being impacted by delays on the\nschedule. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9.)2\n        {¶ 35} Along with notice of a claim, Article 8.1.1 requires that JHE provide a\ncontemporaneous statement of damages. The court finds that this contract language is\nunambiguous.        However, for the following reasons, JHE failed to present sufficient\nevidence to persuade the court that it provided a contemporaneous statement of\ndamages with its 10-day notice.\n        {¶ 36} On January 2, 2008, in response to SER’s proposed schedule, JHE\ninformed Kray that it was being impacted by delays on the schedule; however, there is\nno mention of any damages that JHE incurred. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9.) JHE’s February\n26, 2008 letter informing Columbus Public Schools that it is “presenting a claim” states\n\n        \u0002\n           JHE provided input to the Owner on October 1, 2007, by informing the Owner that there was a\nconflict in the default schedule inasmuch as it showed lighting being installed at the same time flooring\nwas to be installed on the project. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 5.) However, the court finds that this scheduling\ndefect was not related to the delays JHE claims it experienced in the late fall of 2007 and early winter of\n2008.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                              - 13 -                                   DECISION\n\nthat “[c]osts related to this claim can only be addressed when a workable schedule is\nobtained * * *.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) Additionally, JHE composed a letter to Columbus\nPublic Schools on March 6, 2008 detailing its concern with a lack of schedule, but it\ndoes not address any damages that it had incurred. Rudduck testified that he told\nGreen in March 2008 that the schedules did not accurately reflect the work that had\nbeen completed on the project. Rudduck testified that he explained to Green that this\n“costs” JHE; however, the court finds that this is insufficient evidence that a\ncontemporaneous statement of damages was provided. Rudduck admitted that he did\nnot provide a contemporaneous statement of damages. While JHE presented the Gantt\nCharts to SER in February 2008, these charts do not provide any contemporaneous\ndamages and JHE failed to prove that it orally provided a contemporaneous statement\nof damages. The first mention of any damages was JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter which\nprovided an estimate of its monetary damages, which was well beyond the time that\nJHE provided its 10-day notice in January 2008.\n        {¶ 37} In sum, even though JHE provided SER with timely notice of facts which\nsupport the basis of its claim, JHE never provided a contemporaneous statement of\ndamages. Thus, the court finds that JHE failed to comply with Article 8.1.1 of the\ncontract, which results in waiver by JHE of its right to an equitable adjustment of the\ncontract to compensate it for the additional costs of its labor.3\n        {¶ 38} Assuming, arguendo, that JHE had timely provided its notice and a\ncontemporaneous statement of damages pursuant to Article 8.1.1, the court must\ndetermine whether JHE complied with the remaining requirements of Article 8.1.2 with\nrespect to its claim for equitable adjustment. Article 8.1.2 provides:\n\n\n        \u0002\n          JHE does not argue that OSFC waived strict compliance with the notice requirements of Article\n8.1.1 by its words and actions. See Aggressive Mechanical, Inc. v. Ohio School Facilities Comm., Ct. of\nCl. No. 2010-12745 (Sept. 18, 2012), Stanley Miller Constr. Co. v. Ohio School Facilities Comm., Ct. of\nCl. No. 2006-04351 (May 8, 2012). JHE contends that it complied with the provisions of Article 8.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                           - 14 -                                DECISION\n\n         {¶ 39} “8.1.2 In every such written claim filed in accordance with paragraph GC\n8.1.1, the Contractor shall provide the following information to permit evaluation of the\nrequest for equitable adjustment of the Contract.\n         {¶ 40} “8.1.2.1 Nature and amount of the claim, which the Contractor shall certify\nbefore a notary public is a fair and accurate assessment of the damages suffered by the\nContractor;\n         {¶ 41} “8.1.2.2 Identification of persons, entities and events responsible for the\nclaim;\n         {¶ 42} “8.1.2.3 Activities on the Construction Schedule affected by the claim or\nnew activities created by any delay, interference, hindrance or disruption and the\nrelationship with existing activities;\n         {¶ 43} “8.1.2.4 Anticipated duration of any delay, interference, hindrance or\ndisruption;\n         {¶ 44} “8.1.2.5 Recommended action to avoid or minimize any future delay,\ninterference hindrance or disruption.\n         {¶ 45} “8.1.2.6 A statement from the Contractor that the amount requested is the\nentire amount associated with the claim.”\n         {¶ 46} The court finds that this contract language is unambiguous. In its post-trial\nbrief, JHE argues that its request for equitable adjustment was submitted on April 3,\n2008; however, in its reply brief, JHE contends that it submitted an Article 7 claim on\nApril 3, 2008, and that its Article 8 claim was not submitted until July 15, 2008. The\ncourt finds that JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter serves as its Article 8 claim. In fact, OSFC\nalso considered this letter to be an Article 8 claim inasmuch as SER requested\nadditional information pursuant to Article 8 on both April 23, 2008 and May 28, 2008.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibits 20, 22.) Initially, the court finds that JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter fails to\nmeet the requirements for a written claim pursuant to Article 8.1.2. While the letter\nstates that in “accordance with Article 8.1.2 the above correspondence details the\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 15 -                               DECISION\n\nscheduled activities impacted at any given time, and the persons, entities, and events\nresponsible for the claim to the extent we are aware,” the letter merely summarizes\nJHE’s previous communications with SER. The letter does not identify the persons,\nentities and events responsible for the claim; it does not set forth the activities on the\nconstruction scheduled affected by the claim; it does not provide a recommended action\nto avoid or minimize any future delay; and it does not provide a statement that the\namount requested is the entire amount associated with the claim.             Even if JHE’s\nprevious correspondence with SER were “incorporated by reference” into the April 3,\n2008 letter, the letter still fails to provide the amount of the claim and a statement that\nthe amount requested is the entire amount associated with the claim inasmuch as JHE\nestimated its costs to be between $300,000 and $400,000 “depending on how soon\npredecessor trades recover to the original schedule.” (Defendant’s Exhibit BB1.)\n       {¶ 47} On April 23, 2008, SER requested that JHE provide additional information\nas required by Article 8.1.2 and SER sent an additional letter on May 28, 2008.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibits 20, 22.) On June 4, 2008, JHE responded to SER’s April 23, 2008\nletter. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 46.) After SER informed JHE that additional information was\nrequired to proceed with JHE’s Article 8 claim, JHE submitted an additional letter to\nSER on July 15, 2008. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.)\n       {¶ 48} Sisterhen testified that the costs presented in JHE’s claim did not tie to\nscheduled activities. While Rudduck testified that JHE could not segregate its costs for\ncertain activities, the court finds that Sisterhen’s testimony is credible that JHE was\nrequired to provide documentation that would show its impact and the dollar amount of\nsuch impact.    Sisterhen testified that he requested this additional detailed job cost\ninformation from JHE, which would enable SER to assess whether JHE’s impacts were\ntied to specific scheduled activities. The court finds that Sisterhen testified credibly that\nthis information was not provided by JHE when it was requested.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         - 16 -                              DECISION\n\n       {¶ 49} Article 8.1.3 of the contract states: “The Contractor shall promptly provide\nany additional information requested by the Construction Manager or the Architect.”\nThe court finds that this language is unambiguous and that JHE was required to\npromptly provide additional information regarding its claim. Rudduck testified that SER\nrequested additional information regarding JHE’s claim. Sisterhen testified credibly that\nSER requested additional, detailed back-up documentation regarding cost information\nwhich was never provided by JHE. Sisterhen explained that the information that JHE\ndid provide regarding its costs was constantly changing. The court finds Sisterhen’s\ntestimony persuasive that he received detailed information from JHE only after litigation\nin this case commenced and that the information that JHE provided shortly before trial\ncommenced would have satisfied his request for additional information if it had been\ntimely generated. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits 40 and 41.)\n       {¶ 50} The court finds that Sisterhen credibly testified that he requested additional\ninformation from JHE which was only provided shortly before trial in this matter.\nAccordingly, the court finds that JHE failed to comply with Article 8 such that its claim for\nequitable adjustment must fail.\n       {¶ 51} Article 6.4.1 of the contract states:\n       {¶ 52} “Any request by the Contractor for an extension of time shall be made in\nwriting to the Construction Manager no more than ten (10) days after the initial\noccurrence of any condition which, in the Contractor’s opinion, entitles the Contractor to\nan extension of time. Failure to timely provide such notice to the Construction Manager\nshall constitute a waiver by the Contractor for any claim for extension, damages or\nmitigation of Liquidated Damages, to the fullest extent permitted by law.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n       {¶ 53} Additionally, Article 6.4.2 outlines the requirements that must be contained\nin the request:\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                          - 17 -                              DECISION\n\n         {¶ 54} “6.4.2 The Contractor’s request shall provide the following information so\nthat a timely response may be made to minimize any resulting damage, injury or\nexpense.\n         {¶ 55} “6.4.2.1 Nature of the interference, disruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 56} “6.4.2.2 Identification of persons, entities and events responsible for the\ninterference, disruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 57} “6.4.2.3 Date (or anticipated date) of commencement of the interference,\ndisruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 58} “6.4.2.4 Activities on the Construction Schedule which may be affected by\nthe interference, disruption, hindrance or delay, or new activities created by the\ninterference, disruption, hindrance or delay and the relationship with existing activities;\n         {¶ 59} “6.4.2.5 Anticipated duration of the interference, disruption, hindrance or\ndelay;\n         {¶ 60} “6.4.2.6 Specific number of days of extension requested;\n         {¶ 61} “6.4.2.7 Recommended action to avoid or minimize any future interference,\ndisruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 62} “6.4.2.8 [A] detailed proposal for an increase in the Contract Price which\nwould fully compensate the Contractor for all costs of acceleration of the Work needed\nto completely overcome the interference, disruption, hindrance, or delay; and\n         {¶ 63} “6.4.2.9 [A] statement from the Contractor that the extension requested is\nthe entire extension of the Contract Time associated with the interference, disruption,\nhindrance, or delay.”\n         {¶ 64} Unlike the 10-day notice required by Article 8.1.1, a request for an\nextension of time pursuant to Article 6 must be submitted in writing within 10 days after\nthe initial occurrence of the condition which the contractor believes entitles it to an\nextension of time. The court finds that the language of Article 6.4 is unambiguous.\nRudduck admitted that JHE did not provide written notice to the Owner within 10 days of\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 18 -                              DECISION\n\nthe issuance of the building permit. Further, he admitted that JHE did not provide\nwritten notice within 10 days of the issue with the soil which occurred in the fall of 2007.\nRudduck admitted that he knew that the delay in obtaining the building permit would\ncause a delay on the site work but he testified that he could not project the extent of the\ndelay inasmuch as no construction schedule had yet been issued by SER.\n       {¶ 65} After Kray emailed the contractors with the proposed construction\nschedule on December 17, 2007, Rudduck responded on January 2, 2008 and stated,\n“these delays and impacts will require a time extension and/or acceleration.” (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 9.)    However, this email does not meet the requirements of Article 6.4.2\ninasmuch as it does not state the specific number of days requested for an extension.\n       {¶ 66} In this case, the evidence of a written request regarding JHE’s claim for an\nextension of time first appears in the form of correspondence on February 26, 2008.\nJHE composed a letter addressed to Steve Volpe of Columbus Public Schools advising\n“Columbus Public School District that [JHE] is presenting a claim on [the project].”\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) The letter states that there is no approved schedule, that the\ndefault schedule is falling behind, and that stacking was occurring on the project. JHE\nstates in the letter that its input on the proposed construction schedule “showed the\nproject pushed out 90 days.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) Finally, the letter states that JHE\n“has no other choice but to ask for compensation on this project.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.)\n       {¶ 67} In its April 3, 2008 letter, JHE requested a 90-day extension to the\nschedule pursuant to Article 7. On May 28, 2008, a change order was granted giving\nJHE a nine- day time extension pursuant to Article 6.2.1.1, but JHE refused to sign the\nchange order, and on June 25, 2008, JHE sent a letter to SER rejecting the nine-day\nextension of time and requesting a 60-day extension of time.            (Joint Exhibit A2,\nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 23.)\n       {¶ 68} The court finds that JHE requested a 90-day extension of time on February\n26, 2008, and that after SER gave it a nine-day extension of time, it requested a 60-day\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 19 -                              DECISION\n\nextension. However, the court finds that JHE failed to request the time extension within\n10 days after the initial occurrence of the condition which JHE believed entitled it to an\nextension. Rudduck and Large both testified as to the delays that occurred on the\nproject in late 2007 and early 2008, but the court finds that the earliest that JHE\nprovided a written claim for an extension of time was on February 26, 2008, which is\nmore than 10 days after the initial occurrence of the condition. Additionally, the court\nfinds that JHE’s requests for an extension of time failed to comply with the requirements\nof Article 6.4.2. For example, the February 26, April 3, and June 25, 2008 letters from\nJHE do not include a detailed price proposal pursuant to Article 6.4.2.8. Therefore, the\ncourt finds that JHE failed to comply with the contractual requirements to request an\nextension of time.\n       {¶ 69} In its post-trial brief, JHE contends that the April 3, 2008 letter is a claim\npursuant to Article 7 and that when this request for a change order was not granted, it\nsubmitted an Article 8 notice in July 2008. (Plaintiff’s Response Brief, pg. 5.) To the\nextent that JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter is construed as a request for a change order, a\nchange order granting a nine day extension of time was issued on May 29, 2008, which\nJHE refused to sign. On June 25, 2008, JHE informed SER through a letter that it could\nnot accept the nine-day extension and requested a 60-day extension of time. (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 23.) According to Article 7.4.8, if a contractor does not agree with the school\ndistrict board’s change order, it must request an Article 8 equitable adjustment within 10\ndays of receipt of notice of the school district board’s change order. The court finds that\nthis language is unambiguous. Here, the change order was issued on May 29, 2008,\nbut JHE did not file its purported Article 8 claim until July 15, 2008. Accordingly, JHE’s\nfailure to comply with the contractual provisions bars its claims.\n       {¶ 70} Based on the foregoing, the court finds that JHE has failed to prove any of\nits claims by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the court shall render\njudgment in favor of OSFC.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737   - 20 -                      DECISION\n\n\n\n                      _____________________________________\n                      CLARK B.

Weaver Sr.\n\nDECISION\n\n        {¶ 1} Plaintiff, Jess Howard Electric Company (JHE), brought this action against\ndefendant, Ohio School Facilities Commission (OSFC), alleging breach of contract and\nseeking a declaratory judgment.               The issues of liability and damages were not\nbifurcated and the case proceeded to trial on both issues.1\n        {¶ 2} In 2007, OSFC and the Columbus Public School District (the Owner)\nsolicited bids for the construction of a new building known as the Livingston Avenue\nElementary School (the project).             The project called for multiple prime contractors.\nHarris Design Services acted as the architect on the project. Smoot Elford Resource\n(SER), an agent of the Owner, acted as the construction manager on the project.\nPursuant to the contract’s General Conditions (GC), SER was responsible for\nscheduling the project and coordinating the work of the contractors. (Joint Exhibit A4.)\nMichael Kray, III, was SER’s project manager on the project from November 2007 until\nproject completion. William Green, Jr., an employee of SER for approximately five\n\n\n        \u0002\n         The trial testimony of Robert Large, Jonathan Howard, and William Green, Jr., was presented by\nvideo deposition in accordance with the court’s August 30, 2012 entry.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         -2-                                DECISION\n\nyears, was SER’s on-site supervisor until September 2008, and he reported to Kray.\nTom Sisterhen was SER’s project executive. FH Martin was the general contractor.\nThe project was a two-storied building comprised of four distinct areas, which were\nreferred to as Areas A, B, C, and D throughout the construction schedules.\n       {¶ 3} JHE bid for and was awarded a contract with the Owner as the prime\ncontractor for the electrical work on the project. According to JHE, in its bid it estimated\nits labor for the project to be 822 man-days. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.) Jonathan Howard is\nJHE’s president, but at the time of the bid, he was executive vice president and he\nreviewed the bid that was prepared by JHE’s estimators.          Howard testified that he\nbelieved that the bid was reasonable. The man-days component of the bid was based\non the default schedule, which was the schedule presented to those bidding on the\nproject in 2007. JHE’s total bid was $1,093,747. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 33.) On September\n4, 2007, the parties signed the contract and the total price for the prime contract for\nelectrical work was $1,113,747. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 3.)\n       {¶ 4} As testified to by Green, when a project is bid, the contractors are given a\ndefault schedule. Pursuant to GC 4.3, the default schedule governs the project until a\nconstruction schedule is issued.      After the contracts are awarded, a construction\nschedule is then developed by SER with the input of the contractors; this schedule was\nalso referred to as the contractor’s schedule. Even after the construction schedule is\ndeveloped, it continues to be adjusted throughout the project.\n       {¶ 5} At a November 7, 2007 Progress Meeting, Kray addressed the issue of\nmoving from the default schedule to the input schedule. (Defendant’s Exhibit FF.) Kray\ntestified that when he became the project manager for SER in November 2007, he\nlooked at the default schedule and learned that there was no subsequent schedule,\nwhich was a “problem.” According to Kray, the default schedule that was presented to\nthe contractors during the bidding process, was in effect until March 2008 when the\ncontractors signed the “contractor’s schedule.”\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        -3-                               DECISION\n\n       {¶ 6} On September 10, 2007, SER issued a “Notice to Proceed” to JHE.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 4.) As stated in the Notice to Proceed, the contract completion date\nwas December 30, 2008. During the course of the project, all of the contractors were\ngranted a nine-day extension of the contract completion date to January 9, 2009.\nChange Order 007, dated May 28, 2008, granted a time extension of nine days, but JHE\nrefused to sign the change order. (Joint Exhibit A2.)\n       {¶ 7} JHE alleges that its work on the project was encumbered by numerous\ndelays at the beginning on the project. Greg Rudduck, who has been employed by JHE\nfor over 30 years, was JHE’s project manager and was at the construction site several\ntimes a week during the course of the project. Initially, Rudduck testified that there was\na delay in obtaining the temporary power on the project site. According to Rudduck,\nJHE was unable to obtain the temporary power permit until the Owner received the\nbuilding permit.     While Rudduck testified that the building permit was obtained\napproximately eight weeks after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed, the court finds\nthat the building permit was issued on October 5, 2007, which was almost one month\nafter the Notice to Proceed was issued. (Defendant’s Exhibit CC.) According to both\nRudduck and Kray, obtaining the building permit was the responsibility of the Owner,\nwhile obtaining the electrical permit was JHE’s responsibility.\n       {¶ 8} Rudduck applied for the electrical permit on October 10, 2007.\n(Defendant’s Exhibit GG.) As of October 31, 2007, JHE was authorized to choose\neither American Electric Power or City of Columbus to provide the temporary power to\nthe project site. According to the testimony of both Large and Green, temporary power\nto the job site was in place around December 7, 2007.             Green testified that he\nhandwrote his daily job entries until power was on site. Green’s handwritten notes\ncontinued until nearly the end of November 2007, at which time he began to make his\nentries in Prolog, a computer program used by the Owner and contractors to track their\nwork. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 47.)\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                          -4-                                 DECISION\n\n       {¶ 9} Rudduck also testified about additional delays into December 2007, which\nincluded a water line issue caused by the Owner not paying the “tap fee,” and a soil\nissue which precluded JHE from installing the underground electrical lines.           Robert\nLarge is employed by JHE as an electrical foreman, a position he has held for\napproximately seven years. On the project, he was JHE’s on-site foreman. Large\nexplained that in late December 2007 and early January 2008, JHE was delayed on\ncertain activities because the plumbing contractor had not completed its work; however,\nhe admitted that JHE was performing other productive contract work during this time\nperiod. Large also testified that there were various delays in January and February\n2008 caused by the masonry contractor and FH Martin. However, Large admitted that\nthere are always “some” delays on a construction project.\n       {¶ 10} On January 3, 2008, Large noted in his Prolog entries that the schedule\nwas starting to be impacted from the delays. Large made similar notations throughout\nthe winter of 2008, but the last mention of any schedule impact was on April 7, 2008.\n(Joint Exhibit A3.) While Large testified that the project was still behind schedule after\nthat date and that he “got tired” of noting delays in Prolog, the court finds that the failure\nto include such indication is significant.\n       {¶ 11} Large testified that in the summer of 2008, JHE had to bring on additional,\nexperienced electricians to assist with the electrical work. In summary, Large explained\nthat JHE’s work was behind schedule on the project due to the delayed work of\npredecessor trades.\n       {¶ 12} As early as November 26, 2007, SER, through Kray, began the process of\nestablishing the construction schedule.      On December 14, 2007, Kray emailed the\n“Proposed Contract Schedule” to the contractors. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 8.) Kray’s email\nrequested that the contractors provide their input and sign and date the schedule by\nDecember 28, 2007. At the December 19, 2007 Progress Meeting, the construction\nschedule was discussed and JHE “noticed they are providing a [Gantt] chart which\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        -5-                                   DECISION\n\nindicates items to be completed at the same time. Jess Howard noted items on the\nschedule have moved up or back by as much as (2 1/2) months.” (Defendant’s Exhibit\nFF.) On January 2, 2008, Rudduck sent Kray an email that stated that JHE was being\nimpacted by delays on the schedule. Rudduck wrote, “it is my opinion that Areas A and\nB are 4 to 5 weeks behind schedule.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9.) Kray explained that JHE’s\nresponse was relevant input for developing the construction schedule.\n      {¶ 13} According to Rudduck, he met with SER representatives on February 5,\n2008, to discuss the delays on the project. During this meeting, JHE presented three\nGantt charts to SER depicting the default schedule, the proposed contractor’s schedule,\nand a revised default schedule. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits 13A-13C.) Rudduck explained that\nhe used this as a tool to show SER JHE’s scheduling concerns. Rudduck testified that\nhis concern was that the project was delayed at the beginning for various reasons and\nthat JHE’s completion date was going to stay the same such that JHE’s work on the\nproject would be compressed and stacking of trades would occur. Rudduck testified\nthat Kray and Sisterhen acknowledged that there was a problem with the schedule at\nthat time. Kray recalled the meeting and he testified that he did not agree with JHE’s\nassumptions that stacking was going to occur on the project.\n      {¶ 14} On February 26, 2008, JHE wrote a letter addressed to Steve Volpe, of\nColumbus Public Schools stating, “This letter is to advise the Columbus Public School\nDistrict that [JHE] is presenting a claim on Livingston Avenue Elementary School * * *\n[JHE] has no other choice but to ask for compensation on this project. Costs related to\nthis claim can only be addressed when a workable schedule is obtained, and reviewed,\nto achieve an agreeable completion date.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) Rudduck testified that\nthis letter intended to raise the issue of stacking that JHE was experiencing.\n      {¶ 15} At a March 5, 2008 meeting with SER and Columbus Public Schools, JHE\npresented a list of approximately 50 project items that were behind schedule. (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 14.) Rudduck testified that he believed these items were on the “critical path” to\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        -6-                                 DECISION\n\nJHE but he did not know if the Owner was of the same opinion. According to Rudduck,\nat the time of this meeting, the schedule on the project indicated that certain work was\ncomplete when, in fact, it was not complete on the job site. Kray admitted that these\nitems were behind schedule and that he understood that JHE wanted to correct the\nschedule. Further, Kray testified that the list of items provided by JHE was input to help\ndevelop the contractor’s schedule.\n       {¶ 16} Kray testified that when a project is behind schedule, there are four\noptions: 1) ignore the delay; 2) extend the contract time; 3) issue a notice to comply; or\n4) work as a “team” to find a solution. Kray testified that when JHE showed him the\nitems in Exhibit 14 that were behind schedule in February 2008, he chose to have the\ncontractors work as a team to solve the issue as he developed the construction\nschedule that was signed off by the contractors in March 2008. Kray testified that the\nlist of items that JHE provided was helpful input for the proposed schedule pursuant to\nGC 4.3.6.1 and that JHE provided input from December through February, which he\nconsidered before issuing the schedule in March 2008.\n       {¶ 17} In a follow-up letter to the March 5, 2008 meeting, JHE sent a letter to\nVolpe which states that it unsuccessfully attempted to work with Kray on the scheduling\nissues and that the project “is behind schedule on approximately 54 activities on the\ndefault schedule, and approximately 33 activities on the updated default schedule.”\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 15.) SER responded with a letter on March 18, 2008, in which Kray\nwrites, “you are correct in stating the project does not have a signed off schedule, but I\ndisagree with the premise of your letter for why the schedule is not signed off.”\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 16.) Kray went on to write that SER had been working “diligently to\nhave an approved Construction Schedule for the project” but that JHE has “applied the\nbreaks due to the concern for the manpower available * * *.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 16.)\n       {¶ 18} On March 25, 2008, JHE wrote a letter addressed to Kray which again\naddresses JHE’s concerns of the delays and lack of a schedule on the project.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         -7-                                DECISION\n\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17.) The letter states, “I would like to provide you with an extent of\nimpact these situations are causing [JHE], but at this point, it would not be practical or\npossible due to the status of the job in relationship to the schedule. * * * It is our claim\nthat the job is a minimum of ninety (90) days behind.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17.)\n        {¶ 19} On March 14, 2008, SER issued the construction schedule and the\ncontractors signed off on the schedule; however, JHE signed the schedule under\nprotest. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 18.) Once the construction schedule was released, it was\nupdated monthly to show the progress of the various activities and JHE continued to\nobject to those subsequent schedules. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits 21, 27, 28, 30, 31.)\n        {¶ 20} On April 3, 2008, JHE wrote a letter to Harris Design Services, care of\nMike Kray, seeking a “request for equitable adjustment” under the contract. The letter\nprovides a history of the correspondence between the parties and states that JHE “has\nbeen informing the Board’s authorized representatives that the Project has been\ndelayed for reasons not caused by [JHE]. * * * [JHE] requests a 90 day extension to the\nschedule from the Board and the Commission.” (Defendant’s Exhibit BB1.) JHE cites\nArticle 7 and “requests that the Board, with the approval of the Commission, issue a\nchange order directing that [JHE] comply with the latest revised scheduled in\naccordance with G.C. 7.1.2 and 7.4 et seq. In response to that directive, [JHE] will\nissue a proposal in accordance with G.C. 7.6.” (Defendant’s Exhibit BB1.) Jonathan\nHoward certified the April 3, 2008 letter: “I hereby certify that the increased costs\nincurred by the above claim are fairly and accurately assessed to be between\n$300,000.00 and $400,000.00, depending upon how soon predecessor trades recover\nto the original schedule. [JHE] agrees to produce its bid work papers and job costs for\nthe purpose of audit, subject to a reasonable protective order.” (Defendant’s Exhibit\nBB1.)\n        {¶ 21} On April 23, 2008, Kray responded to JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter and\ninformed JHE that the request “only partially provides the information requested in\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         -8-                                DECISION\n\nArticle 8.1.2.1” and requested JHE to provide all of the items listed under Article 8.1.2.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 20.) SER sent an additional letter to JHE on May 28, 2008 because it\nhad not received the additional information. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 22.) On June 4, 2008,\nJHE responded to SER’s April 23, 2008 letter. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 46.)\n       {¶ 22} Change Order 007 was issued on May 28, 2008 and granted a nine-day\nextension of time. On June 25, 2008, JHE wrote a letter to SER stating that it “cannot\naccept the proposed 9 day extension of time to the contract” and JHE requested a 60-\nday extension of time. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 23.)\n       {¶ 23} On July 15, 2008, JHE provided a response to SER’s request for additional\ninformation and updated costs pursuant to GC 8.1.2. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25, Defendant’s\nExhibit BB2.) Howard testified that this was JHE’s request for an Article 8 meeting. The\nletter stated that JHE estimated 822 man-days in its bid on the project but that as of July\n6, 2008, it had expended 72 percent of its man-days to complete 53 percent of the work\non the project. JHE estimated that an additional 445 man-days was required to finish\nthe project because of stacking delays and inefficiencies.         (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.)\nJonathan Howard certified “that the increased costs due to contract inefficiencies as of\n7-6-08 is $78,389.63. Total estimated cost to complete contract is $222,945.00, for a\ntotal claim of $301,334.63.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.) Attached to the letter was a job cost\nreport showing its labor details. Kray testified that he compared JHE’s estimated labor\ncosts as contained in the July 15, 2008 letter with a similar Columbus Public Schools\nbuilding project and determined that JHE’s labor estimate was not accurate. (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 48.)\n       {¶ 24} Sisterhen testified that he provided the recommendation as to whether\nJHE should be paid on its claim and if so, how much. He testified that upon analysis of\nthe claim, JHE failed to tie its costs to the scheduled activities. Further, he explained\nthat JHE provided him with inconsistent figures regarding the amount of man-days its\nwork was impacted. Reviewing JHE’s July 15, 2008 letter, Sisterhen testified that he\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                             -9-                          DECISION\n\nwas not “dissatisfied” with the amount of backup that JHE provided, but he testified that\nhe requested a detailed cost report several times from JHE that was never provided to\nhim. On August 20, 2008, Sisterhen asked JHE to provide detailed documentation to\nprove its impact and the amount thereof, which included, “the comparison of planned\nvs[.] actual labor; analysis of the labor hours presented regarding the onsite supervision\nwhich should not be included; and an analysis of the labor rate used in the calculation of\nthe total request.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 29.)\n       {¶ 25} On November 20, 2008, JHE provided a one-page “labor analysis to date”\nwhich states that the “actual cost of stacking and project inefficiencies” to date was\n$120,853,68.     (Defendant’s Exhibit BB3.)       In a May 27, 2009 email to Kray, JHE\nprovided a week by week breakdown of its labor on the project through November 20,\n2008. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 32.)\n       {¶ 26} On June 17, 2009, SER sent a letter to Columbus City School District\ninforming it that SER had completed the “job site dispute resolution with [JHE] * * * We\nwere not able to come to a resolution at the meetings and it has been determined by\n[SER] a change order is not warranted.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 34.) On June 18, 2009, SER\nsent a letter to JHE stating that the parties could not come to an agreement and that its\nrequest for a change order had been rejected. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 35.) JHE responded\nto the letter on July 27, 2009, stating that it intended to proceed on its claim for\ncompensation. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 36.) JHE provided additional information to SER on\nAugust 3, 2009, and provided an updated job cost report, the original cap sheet, and\nweekly labor reports. (Defendant’s Exhibit BB4.) On December 1, 2010, Columbus City\nSchools rejected JHE’s claim and determined that no change order for additional\ncompensation was warranted. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 39.)\n       {¶ 27} JHE claims that it is entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract.\nJHE alleges that OSFC’s failure to timely issue a construction schedule caused its work\nto stack on the project. JHE claims that it bid 822 man-days on the project but that it\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                          - 10 -                             DECISION\n\nincurred 1207.9 man-days of labor on the project. JHE seeks damages for the 385.9\nman-day overrun that it experienced on the project for a total claim of $208,353.99.\n(Plaintiff’s Post-Trial Brief, pg. 18-19.)\n\n\n       LAW\n       {¶ 28} Contract interpretation is a matter of law for the court.

Article 8 of the general conditions of the contract\ndetails the procedure for requesting additional payment. The relevant portion of the\nparties’ agreement reads as follows:\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 11 -                              DECISION\n\n       {¶ 31} “8.1.1 Any request for equitable adjustment of Contract shall be made in\nwriting to the Architect, through the Construction Manager, and filed prior to Contract\nCompletion, provided the Contractor notified the Architect, through the Construction\nManager, no more than ten (10) days after the initial occurrence of the facts which are\nthe basis of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, failure of the Contractor to\ntimely provide such notice and a contemporaneous statement of damages shall\nconstitute a waiver by the Contractor of any claim for additional compensation or for\nmitigation of Liquidated Damages.”\n       {¶ 32} Although Article 8.1.1 clearly requires that a written claim be filed prior to\ncontract completion, there is no writing requirement for the 10-day notice, and the court\nfinds that such language is unambiguous. OSFC argues that the “writing” requirement\nfor Article 8.1.1 is contained in GC 1.3, which states, “Whenever any provision of the\nContract Documents requires the giving of any notice, such notice shall be deemed to\nhave been validly given if given in writing and delivered personally to the individual or to\na member of the entity for whom the notice is intended * * *.” The court finds that GC\n1.3 does not require that all notices must be in writing. Consequently, the court must\nexamine both the written and oral communications between JHE and SER in order to\ndetermine whether JHE complied with the notice provision of Article 8.1.1.\n       {¶ 33} It must first be determined whether JHE provided notice no more than 10\ndays after the initial occurrence of the facts that are the basis of the claim.        JHE\ncontends that the 10-day notice requirement began to run when the construction\nschedule was issued in March 2008. However, Rudduck admitted that the basis of\nJHE’s claim were the delays and scheduling problems which occurred in the late fall of\n2007 and early winter of 2008. Rudduck testified that he did not provide notice within\n10 days regarding the issue of the building permit nor did he provide notice within 10\ndays of the soil compaction issue. Rudduck explained that he could not know the\nimpact of the delays inasmuch as the contractor’s schedule had not been signed at this\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                               - 12 -                                    DECISION\n\npoint in the project. However, Rudduck testified that JHE put SER on notice that the\ndelays at the beginning of the project were a concern and that this was discussed at the\nProgress meetings beginning in December 2007.\n        {¶ 34} The court finds unpersuasive JHE’s argument that the 10-day notice\nrequirement did not begin until the construction schedule was issued in March 2008.\nArticle 8 states that the notice must be given within 10 days, without regard to whether\nthe project is operating under the default schedule or construction schedule.\nFurthermore, GC 4.3.1 states that the schedule included in the bid governs until the\nconstruction manager issues the construction schedule.                    The court finds that JHE\nprovided notice within 10 days of the initial occurrence of the facts which are the basis\nof the claim. The court finds that JHE provided oral notice of its claim regarding the\ndelays on the project as evidenced in the Progress meeting in December 2007 and on\nJanuary 2, 2008, JHE informed SER that it was being impacted by delays on the\nschedule. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9.)2\n        {¶ 35} Along with notice of a claim, Article 8.1.1 requires that JHE provide a\ncontemporaneous statement of damages. The court finds that this contract language is\nunambiguous.        However, for the following reasons, JHE failed to present sufficient\nevidence to persuade the court that it provided a contemporaneous statement of\ndamages with its 10-day notice.\n        {¶ 36} On January 2, 2008, in response to SER’s proposed schedule, JHE\ninformed Kray that it was being impacted by delays on the schedule; however, there is\nno mention of any damages that JHE incurred. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 9.) JHE’s February\n26, 2008 letter informing Columbus Public Schools that it is “presenting a claim” states\n\n        \u0002\n           JHE provided input to the Owner on October 1, 2007, by informing the Owner that there was a\nconflict in the default schedule inasmuch as it showed lighting being installed at the same time flooring\nwas to be installed on the project. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 5.) However, the court finds that this scheduling\ndefect was not related to the delays JHE claims it experienced in the late fall of 2007 and early winter of\n2008.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                              - 13 -                                   DECISION\n\nthat “[c]osts related to this claim can only be addressed when a workable schedule is\nobtained * * *.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) Additionally, JHE composed a letter to Columbus\nPublic Schools on March 6, 2008 detailing its concern with a lack of schedule, but it\ndoes not address any damages that it had incurred. Rudduck testified that he told\nGreen in March 2008 that the schedules did not accurately reflect the work that had\nbeen completed on the project. Rudduck testified that he explained to Green that this\n“costs” JHE; however, the court finds that this is insufficient evidence that a\ncontemporaneous statement of damages was provided. Rudduck admitted that he did\nnot provide a contemporaneous statement of damages. While JHE presented the Gantt\nCharts to SER in February 2008, these charts do not provide any contemporaneous\ndamages and JHE failed to prove that it orally provided a contemporaneous statement\nof damages. The first mention of any damages was JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter which\nprovided an estimate of its monetary damages, which was well beyond the time that\nJHE provided its 10-day notice in January 2008.\n        {¶ 37} In sum, even though JHE provided SER with timely notice of facts which\nsupport the basis of its claim, JHE never provided a contemporaneous statement of\ndamages. Thus, the court finds that JHE failed to comply with Article 8.1.1 of the\ncontract, which results in waiver by JHE of its right to an equitable adjustment of the\ncontract to compensate it for the additional costs of its labor.3\n        {¶ 38} Assuming, arguendo, that JHE had timely provided its notice and a\ncontemporaneous statement of damages pursuant to Article 8.1.1, the court must\ndetermine whether JHE complied with the remaining requirements of Article 8.1.2 with\nrespect to its claim for equitable adjustment. Article 8.1.2 provides:\n\n\n        \u0002\n          JHE does not argue that OSFC waived strict compliance with the notice requirements of Article\n8.1.1 by its words and actions. See Aggressive Mechanical, Inc. v. Ohio School Facilities Comm., Ct. of\nCl. No. 2010-12745 (Sept. 18, 2012), Stanley Miller Constr. Co. v. Ohio School Facilities Comm., Ct. of\nCl. No. 2006-04351 (May 8, 2012). JHE contends that it complied with the provisions of Article 8.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                           - 14 -                                DECISION\n\n         {¶ 39} “8.1.2 In every such written claim filed in accordance with paragraph GC\n8.1.1, the Contractor shall provide the following information to permit evaluation of the\nrequest for equitable adjustment of the Contract.\n         {¶ 40} “8.1.2.1 Nature and amount of the claim, which the Contractor shall certify\nbefore a notary public is a fair and accurate assessment of the damages suffered by the\nContractor;\n         {¶ 41} “8.1.2.2 Identification of persons, entities and events responsible for the\nclaim;\n         {¶ 42} “8.1.2.3 Activities on the Construction Schedule affected by the claim or\nnew activities created by any delay, interference, hindrance or disruption and the\nrelationship with existing activities;\n         {¶ 43} “8.1.2.4 Anticipated duration of any delay, interference, hindrance or\ndisruption;\n         {¶ 44} “8.1.2.5 Recommended action to avoid or minimize any future delay,\ninterference hindrance or disruption.\n         {¶ 45} “8.1.2.6 A statement from the Contractor that the amount requested is the\nentire amount associated with the claim.”\n         {¶ 46} The court finds that this contract language is unambiguous. In its post-trial\nbrief, JHE argues that its request for equitable adjustment was submitted on April 3,\n2008; however, in its reply brief, JHE contends that it submitted an Article 7 claim on\nApril 3, 2008, and that its Article 8 claim was not submitted until July 15, 2008. The\ncourt finds that JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter serves as its Article 8 claim. In fact, OSFC\nalso considered this letter to be an Article 8 claim inasmuch as SER requested\nadditional information pursuant to Article 8 on both April 23, 2008 and May 28, 2008.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibits 20, 22.) Initially, the court finds that JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter fails to\nmeet the requirements for a written claim pursuant to Article 8.1.2. While the letter\nstates that in “accordance with Article 8.1.2 the above correspondence details the\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 15 -                               DECISION\n\nscheduled activities impacted at any given time, and the persons, entities, and events\nresponsible for the claim to the extent we are aware,” the letter merely summarizes\nJHE’s previous communications with SER. The letter does not identify the persons,\nentities and events responsible for the claim; it does not set forth the activities on the\nconstruction scheduled affected by the claim; it does not provide a recommended action\nto avoid or minimize any future delay; and it does not provide a statement that the\namount requested is the entire amount associated with the claim.             Even if JHE’s\nprevious correspondence with SER were “incorporated by reference” into the April 3,\n2008 letter, the letter still fails to provide the amount of the claim and a statement that\nthe amount requested is the entire amount associated with the claim inasmuch as JHE\nestimated its costs to be between $300,000 and $400,000 “depending on how soon\npredecessor trades recover to the original schedule.” (Defendant’s Exhibit BB1.)\n       {¶ 47} On April 23, 2008, SER requested that JHE provide additional information\nas required by Article 8.1.2 and SER sent an additional letter on May 28, 2008.\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibits 20, 22.) On June 4, 2008, JHE responded to SER’s April 23, 2008\nletter. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 46.) After SER informed JHE that additional information was\nrequired to proceed with JHE’s Article 8 claim, JHE submitted an additional letter to\nSER on July 15, 2008. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 25.)\n       {¶ 48} Sisterhen testified that the costs presented in JHE’s claim did not tie to\nscheduled activities. While Rudduck testified that JHE could not segregate its costs for\ncertain activities, the court finds that Sisterhen’s testimony is credible that JHE was\nrequired to provide documentation that would show its impact and the dollar amount of\nsuch impact.    Sisterhen testified that he requested this additional detailed job cost\ninformation from JHE, which would enable SER to assess whether JHE’s impacts were\ntied to specific scheduled activities. The court finds that Sisterhen testified credibly that\nthis information was not provided by JHE when it was requested.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                         - 16 -                              DECISION\n\n       {¶ 49} Article 8.1.3 of the contract states: “The Contractor shall promptly provide\nany additional information requested by the Construction Manager or the Architect.”\nThe court finds that this language is unambiguous and that JHE was required to\npromptly provide additional information regarding its claim. Rudduck testified that SER\nrequested additional information regarding JHE’s claim. Sisterhen testified credibly that\nSER requested additional, detailed back-up documentation regarding cost information\nwhich was never provided by JHE. Sisterhen explained that the information that JHE\ndid provide regarding its costs was constantly changing. The court finds Sisterhen’s\ntestimony persuasive that he received detailed information from JHE only after litigation\nin this case commenced and that the information that JHE provided shortly before trial\ncommenced would have satisfied his request for additional information if it had been\ntimely generated. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits 40 and 41.)\n       {¶ 50} The court finds that Sisterhen credibly testified that he requested additional\ninformation from JHE which was only provided shortly before trial in this matter.\nAccordingly, the court finds that JHE failed to comply with Article 8 such that its claim for\nequitable adjustment must fail.\n       {¶ 51} Article 6.4.1 of the contract states:\n       {¶ 52} “Any request by the Contractor for an extension of time shall be made in\nwriting to the Construction Manager no more than ten (10) days after the initial\noccurrence of any condition which, in the Contractor’s opinion, entitles the Contractor to\nan extension of time. Failure to timely provide such notice to the Construction Manager\nshall constitute a waiver by the Contractor for any claim for extension, damages or\nmitigation of Liquidated Damages, to the fullest extent permitted by law.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n       {¶ 53} Additionally, Article 6.4.2 outlines the requirements that must be contained\nin the request:\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                          - 17 -                              DECISION\n\n         {¶ 54} “6.4.2 The Contractor’s request shall provide the following information so\nthat a timely response may be made to minimize any resulting damage, injury or\nexpense.\n         {¶ 55} “6.4.2.1 Nature of the interference, disruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 56} “6.4.2.2 Identification of persons, entities and events responsible for the\ninterference, disruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 57} “6.4.2.3 Date (or anticipated date) of commencement of the interference,\ndisruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 58} “6.4.2.4 Activities on the Construction Schedule which may be affected by\nthe interference, disruption, hindrance or delay, or new activities created by the\ninterference, disruption, hindrance or delay and the relationship with existing activities;\n         {¶ 59} “6.4.2.5 Anticipated duration of the interference, disruption, hindrance or\ndelay;\n         {¶ 60} “6.4.2.6 Specific number of days of extension requested;\n         {¶ 61} “6.4.2.7 Recommended action to avoid or minimize any future interference,\ndisruption, hindrance or delay;\n         {¶ 62} “6.4.2.8 [A] detailed proposal for an increase in the Contract Price which\nwould fully compensate the Contractor for all costs of acceleration of the Work needed\nto completely overcome the interference, disruption, hindrance, or delay; and\n         {¶ 63} “6.4.2.9 [A] statement from the Contractor that the extension requested is\nthe entire extension of the Contract Time associated with the interference, disruption,\nhindrance, or delay.”\n         {¶ 64} Unlike the 10-day notice required by Article 8.1.1, a request for an\nextension of time pursuant to Article 6 must be submitted in writing within 10 days after\nthe initial occurrence of the condition which the contractor believes entitles it to an\nextension of time. The court finds that the language of Article 6.4 is unambiguous.\nRudduck admitted that JHE did not provide written notice to the Owner within 10 days of\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 18 -                              DECISION\n\nthe issuance of the building permit. Further, he admitted that JHE did not provide\nwritten notice within 10 days of the issue with the soil which occurred in the fall of 2007.\nRudduck admitted that he knew that the delay in obtaining the building permit would\ncause a delay on the site work but he testified that he could not project the extent of the\ndelay inasmuch as no construction schedule had yet been issued by SER.\n       {¶ 65} After Kray emailed the contractors with the proposed construction\nschedule on December 17, 2007, Rudduck responded on January 2, 2008 and stated,\n“these delays and impacts will require a time extension and/or acceleration.” (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 9.)    However, this email does not meet the requirements of Article 6.4.2\ninasmuch as it does not state the specific number of days requested for an extension.\n       {¶ 66} In this case, the evidence of a written request regarding JHE’s claim for an\nextension of time first appears in the form of correspondence on February 26, 2008.\nJHE composed a letter addressed to Steve Volpe of Columbus Public Schools advising\n“Columbus Public School District that [JHE] is presenting a claim on [the project].”\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) The letter states that there is no approved schedule, that the\ndefault schedule is falling behind, and that stacking was occurring on the project. JHE\nstates in the letter that its input on the proposed construction schedule “showed the\nproject pushed out 90 days.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.) Finally, the letter states that JHE\n“has no other choice but to ask for compensation on this project.” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 12.)\n       {¶ 67} In its April 3, 2008 letter, JHE requested a 90-day extension to the\nschedule pursuant to Article 7. On May 28, 2008, a change order was granted giving\nJHE a nine- day time extension pursuant to Article 6.2.1.1, but JHE refused to sign the\nchange order, and on June 25, 2008, JHE sent a letter to SER rejecting the nine-day\nextension of time and requesting a 60-day extension of time.            (Joint Exhibit A2,\nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 23.)\n       {¶ 68} The court finds that JHE requested a 90-day extension of time on February\n26, 2008, and that after SER gave it a nine-day extension of time, it requested a 60-day\n\fCase No. 2010-12737                        - 19 -                              DECISION\n\nextension. However, the court finds that JHE failed to request the time extension within\n10 days after the initial occurrence of the condition which JHE believed entitled it to an\nextension. Rudduck and Large both testified as to the delays that occurred on the\nproject in late 2007 and early 2008, but the court finds that the earliest that JHE\nprovided a written claim for an extension of time was on February 26, 2008, which is\nmore than 10 days after the initial occurrence of the condition. Additionally, the court\nfinds that JHE’s requests for an extension of time failed to comply with the requirements\nof Article 6.4.2. For example, the February 26, April 3, and June 25, 2008 letters from\nJHE do not include a detailed price proposal pursuant to Article 6.4.2.8. Therefore, the\ncourt finds that JHE failed to comply with the contractual requirements to request an\nextension of time.\n       {¶ 69} In its post-trial brief, JHE contends that the April 3, 2008 letter is a claim\npursuant to Article 7 and that when this request for a change order was not granted, it\nsubmitted an Article 8 notice in July 2008. (Plaintiff’s Response Brief, pg. 5.) To the\nextent that JHE’s April 3, 2008 letter is construed as a request for a change order, a\nchange order granting a nine day extension of time was issued on May 29, 2008, which\nJHE refused to sign. On June 25, 2008, JHE informed SER through a letter that it could\nnot accept the nine-day extension and requested a 60-day extension of time. (Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 23.) According to Article 7.4.8, if a contractor does not agree with the school\ndistrict board’s change order, it must request an Article 8 equitable adjustment within 10\ndays of receipt of notice of the school district board’s change order. The court finds that\nthis language is unambiguous. Here, the change order was issued on May 29, 2008,\nbut JHE did not file its purported Article 8 claim until July 15, 2008. Accordingly, JHE’s\nfailure to comply with the contractual provisions bars its claims.\n       {¶ 70} Based on the foregoing, the court finds that JHE has failed to prove any of\nits claims by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the court shall render\njudgment in favor of OSFC.\n\fCase No. 2010-12737   - 20 -                      DECISION\n\n\n\n                      _____________________________________\n                      CLARK B.
