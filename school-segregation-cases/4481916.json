A self-funded ERISA plan has sued\nseveral independent health insurers seeking reimbursement\nfor medical expenses it paid on behalf of beneficiaries who\nwere covered under both the plan and the insurers’ policies.\n\f2                                                  No. 15-2237\n\nWe’re asked to decide whether a lawsuit like this one—a\n“coordination of benefits” dispute—seeks “appropriate\nequitable relief” under section 502(a)(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(3). Six circuits have held that section 502(a)(3) does\nnot authorize suits of this type because the relief sought is\nlegal, not equitable. We join this consensus and affirm the\ndismissal of the ERISA plan’s suit.\n                        I. Background\n    Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health\nand Welfare Fund (“Central States” or “the plan”) is a self-\nfunded ERISA plan that provides health coverage to partici-\npating Teamsters and their dependents. The plan’s trustee\nfiled suit on the plan’s behalf seeking a declaratory judg-\nment enforcing the plan’s terms and awarding restitution on\nvarious theories. The defendants are insurance companies\nthat underwrite and administer insurance policies for\nschools and youth sports leagues; their policies cover inju-\nries sustained by young athletes while participating in\nathletic activities sponsored by these schools and leagues.\nThe case arises from injuries sustained by student athletes\nwho had medical coverage under both the Central States\nplan and the independent insurers’ policies. The trustee\nalleges that the plan paid the beneficiaries’ medical bills in\nfull, in the total amount of about $343,000, and the insurers\nowe reimbursement.\n   The plan and the insurers’ policies have competing coor-\ndination-of-benefits clauses, and each side claims that its\nrespective provision makes the other primarily liable for the\nbeneficiaries’ medical expenses. Coordination-of-benefits\ndisputes like this one are often resolved in state court in a\ndeclaratory-judgment action on an equitable-contribution\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                            3\n\ntheory. 1 See 16 LEE R. RUSS & THOMAS F. SEGALLA, C OUCH\nON INSURANCE § 232:71 (3d ed. 2000).\n\n    But the trustee sued in federal court under section\n502(a)(3) of ERISA (the Employee Retirement Income Securi-\nty Act of 1974), which provides in relevant part that a partic-\nipant, beneficiary, or fiduciary of an employee-benefits plan\nmay bring a civil action “to obtain … appropriate equitable\nrelief … to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the\nterms of the plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B) (emphasis\nadded). The trustee contends that the suit seeks “appropriate\nequitable relief” to enforce the plan’s coordination-of-\nbenefits provision.\n    More specifically, the trustee seeks: (1) a declaratory\njudgment that the insurers are primarily liable for “current\nunpaid and future medical expenses” incurred by athletes\nwho are covered by both the plan and one of the insurers;\n(2) a declaratory judgment that the insurers are primarily\nliable for medical expenses for injuries already incurred and\ntreated; (3) the imposition of an equitable lien on sums held\nby the insurers in the amount of the benefits paid by the\nplan; and (4) an order that the insurers must reimburse the\nplan, variously justified on restitution, unjust enrichment,\nand subrogation theories.\n\n\n\n\n1 These suits also may be brought on equitable-subrogation or equitable-\nindemnification theories. For a discussion of the distinction between\nequitable contribution on the one hand and equitable subrogation or\nequitable indemnification on the other, see Home Insurance Co. v. Cincin-\nnati Insurance Co., 213 Ill. 2d 307 (Ill. 2004), and 15 L EE R. RUSS &\nTHOMAS F. SEGALLA, COUCH ON INSURANCE § 217:5 (3d ed. 1999).\n\f4                                                 No. 15-2237\n\n    The insurers moved to dismiss all claims. The district\njudge granted the motion on two different grounds. To the\nextent that the suit sought a declaratory judgment regarding\nfuture medical expenses, the judge held that it did not raise a\ncontroversy sufficient to invoke the court’s power to award\ndeclaratory relief and dismissed that claim for lack of sub-\nject-matter jurisdiction. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1). The\nremaining claims were dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for\nfailure to state a claim. The judge reasoned that the relief\nsought, though phrased in equitable terms, was not equita-\nble relief within the meaning of section 502(a)(3).\n                        II. Discussion\nA. Jurisdiction\n    As always, our first question is subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion. We’re satisfied that jurisdiction is secure over most of\nthis case. The Central States plan has clearly been injured by\nthe independent insurers’ failure to reimburse it for the\nmedical expenses it has paid, and its claim arises under a\nfederal statute, section 502(a)(3) of ERISA. But the request\nfor a declaratory judgment regarding the insurers’ liability\nfor “current unpaid and future medical expenses” is jurisdic-\ntionally problematic. For starters, the trustee’s use of the\nphrase “current unpaid and future medical expenses” is\nodd. The amended complaint alleges that Central States paid\nthe injured students’ medical expenses in full. Accepting that\nas true, there are no “current unpaid” medical expenses at\nall. The trustee explains in his briefs that this request for\nrelief relates to “prospective claims”—that is, claims that\nTeamsters’ dependents might make for injuries sustained in\nthe future.\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                              5\n\n     This clearly raises ripeness concerns, as the district judge\nrecognized. 2 The Declaratory Judgment Act permits a feder-\nal court to award a declaratory judgment only in “a case of\nactual controversy.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). This limitation is\nequivalent to the Constitution’s general limitation on the\njurisdiction of the federal courts. U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2,\ncl. 1; § 2201(a); Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S.\n270, 272 (1941). Maryland Casualty remains the leading\nstatement on ripeness questions in the context of\ndeclaratory-judgment actions: A suit is ripe when “the facts\nalleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a\nsubstantial controversy, between parties having adverse\nlegal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant\nthe issuance of a declaratory judgment.” 312 U.S. at 273. The\nquestion is “necessarily one of degree,” id., and it “must be\nworked out on a case-by-case basis,” 10B CHARLES ALAN\nWRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2757 (3d ed. 1998).\n    The trustee’s request for a declaratory judgment regard-\ning expenses the plan has already paid is plainly ripe for\nadjudication; that claim involves a definite injury between\nparties with adverse legal interests. The declaratory-\njudgment request regarding future claims, however, is\nunripe. That request for relief arises from hypothetical\nbenefits claims that have yet to be filed—indeed from inju-\nries that have not yet occurred—so the controversy between\n\n\n2 The Supreme Court has held that ripeness is a jurisdictional question.\nSee, e.g, Metro. Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft\nNoise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 265 n.13 (1991) (“[Ripeness] concerns our\njurisdiction under Article III, so we must consider the question on our\nown initiative.”).\n\f6                                                 No. 15-2237\n\nthe plan and the insurers is not of “sufficient immediacy” to\ninvoke a federal court’s jurisdiction.\n    Our decision in Solo Cup Co. v. Federal Insurance Co.,\n619 F.2d 1178 (7th Cir. 1980), is instructive on this point. In\nSolo Cup we dismissed as unripe an employer’s request for a\ndeclaration that its insurer must indemnify it for yet-to-be-\nfiled lawsuits. The employer had settled one plaintiff’s\ndiscrimination claim and sought indemnification for the\nsettlement; that claim was clearly justiciable. Id. at 1183. In\nthe meantime, the federal government had issued a report\nfinding that the employer had discriminated against some\n70 additional employees; the employer sought a judgment\ndeclaring that any sums it might have to pay on these poten-\ntial discrimination claims would be within the indemnity\ncoverage of the insurer’s policy. Id. at 1188–89. That claim\nwas unripe because “[t]he mere possibility that proceedings\nmight be commenced against an insured … is not sufficient\nto create a controversy within the meaning of either the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act or Article III of the Constitution.”\nId. at 1189.\n    The trustee’s request here—for a declaration regarding\npayment of future claims—is even more remote. In Solo Cup\nthe prospective claims against the insured were identifiable\nand had accrued but had not yet been filed. Here the trustee\nwants a declaration regarding hypothetical future medical\nclaims arising from injuries that have not yet occurred. This\naspect of the trustee’s declaratory-judgment request is\nclearly unripe.\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                     7\n\nB. Section 502(a)(3) and “Equitable Relief”\n   Turning now to the merits of the remaining claims, we\nagree with the district judge that the relief sought is legal,\nnot equitable, so the trustee’s suit is not authorized under\nERISA section 502(a)(3).\n    This is not the first time that Central States has sued in-\nsurers of schools and athletic leagues seeking reimburse-\nment for medical expenses it paid on behalf of its beneficiar-\nies. Six circuits have considered virtually identical claims by\nthe plan. All have reached the same conclusion: The suit is\nnot authorized under section 502(a)(3) because the relief\nsought is legal, not equitable. Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas\nHealth & Welfare Fund v. Student Assurance Servs., Inc.,\n797 F.3d 512 (8th Cir. 2015); Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas\nHealth & Welfare Fund v. Gerber Life Ins. Co., 771 F.3d 150 (2d\nCir. 2014); Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund\nv. Bollinger, Inc., 573 F. App’x 197 (3d Cir. 2014); Cent. States,\nSe. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. First Agency, Inc.,\n756 F.3d 954 (6th Cir. 2014); Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas\nHealth & Welfare Fund v. Health Special Risk, Inc., 756 F.3d 356\n(5th Cir. 2014).\n    These circuits rest their decisions on a quartet of Supreme\nCourt cases interpreting the phrase “appropriate equitable\nrelief” in section 502(a)(3): Mertens v. Hewitt Associates,\n508 U.S. 248 (1993); Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v.\nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204 (2002); Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical\nServices, Inc., 547 U.S. 356 (2006); and US Airways, Inc. v.\nMcCutchen, 133 S. Ct. 1537 (2013). The quartet has since\nbecome a quintet with the Court’s recent decision in\nMontanile v. Board of Trustees of the National Elevator Industry\nHealth Benefit Plan, 136 S. Ct. 651 (2016).\n\f8                                                  No. 15-2237\n\n    Mertens, the first in the series, involved a suit brought by\nERISA beneficiaries against a nonfiduciary who participated\nin an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The Court held that\n“appropriate equitable relief” is limited to “those categories\nof relief that were typically available in equity (such as\ninjunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensato-\nry damages).” Mertens, 508 U.S. at 256. The Court held that\nthe relief the ERISA beneficiaries sought was compensatory\ndamages, which is “the classic form of legal relief” and\ntherefore unavailable under section 502(a)(3). Id. at 255.\n    The next four cases—Great-West, Sereboff, McCutchen, and\nMontanile—all involved disputes between ERISA plans and\nbeneficiaries over the proceeds of auto-insurance settle-\nments. The ERISA beneficiaries suffered injuries in car\naccidents; the ERISA plans paid for the medical care to treat\nthese injuries. When the beneficiaries settled with the drivers\nwho caused the accidents, the ERISA plans demanded\nreimbursement from the settlement proceeds. The beneficiar-\nies refused, and the ERISA plans brought restitution claims\nunder section 502(a)(3) to enforce reimbursement provisions\nin their plan documents.\n    In Sereboff and McCutchen, the defendant beneficiaries\nheld the settlement proceeds in segregated accounts or\nfunds, and in each case the plans sought an equitable lien\nagainst the specifically identified account or fund; the Court\nheld that this form of relief was properly regarded as equi-\ntable. In Great-West and Montanile, on the other hand, the\ndefendant beneficiaries did not possess the settlement pro-\nceeds; the relief sought was money damages from the bene-\nficiary’s general assets, a quintessentially legal remedy. More\nspecifically, in Great-West the proceeds of the settlement\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                             9\n\nwere allocated to a trust rather than directly to the benefi-\nciary, who was the defendant in the plan’s suit; in Montanile\nthe settlement proceeds were paid directly to the defendant\nbeneficiary, but the record suggested that the money may\nhave been dissipated before the ERISA plan filed suit. 3\n    In each of these cases, the Court explained that whether a\nremedy is available under section 502(a)(3) “depends on\n(1) the basis for the plaintiff’s claim and (2) the nature of the\nunderlying remedies sought”; both must be equitable to\nproceed under section 502(a)(3). Montanile, 136 S. Ct. at 657\n(brackets and quotation marks omitted). The inquiry looks to\n“standard treatises on equity, which establish the basic\ncontours of what equitable relief was typically available in\npremerger equity courts.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). 4\n\n\n\n3 To be precise, in Montanile the lower courts had not had occasion to\ndetermine whether the defendant beneficiary had fully depleted the\nsettlement fund on nontraceable assets. Applying its prior cases, the\nCourt held that a recovery against a beneficiary’s general assets is legal\nrather than equitable relief, reversing the lower courts’ decisions to the\ncontrary, but remanded to permit the district court to determine whether\nthe beneficiary had dissipated the entire settlement fund or comingled\nthe fund with his general assets. Montanile v. Bd. of Trs. of the Nat’l\nElevator Indus. Health Benefit Plan, 136 S. Ct. 651, 661–62 (2016).\n4  But see RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT § 4 cmt. a (AM. LAW INST. 2011) (Some federal statutes\n“arguably necessitate[] an inquiry into the legal or equitable nature of\nthe relief sought … . Resolution of such problems turns on issues … that\nare beyond the reach of legal history and outside the scope of this\nRestatement.”); RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT ch. 7, topic 2, intro. note (AM. LAW INST. 2011) (“Lingering\neffects of [the law/equity distinction] on the remedies available under\n\f10                                                             No. 15-2237\n\n    Importantly, the Court made it clear that simply phrasing\nthe request for relief in equitable terms—e.g., restitution,\nunjust enrichment, an equitable lien—is not dispositive. The\nremedy is properly regarded as equitable only if the plaintiff\nseeks the return of “specifically identified funds that remain\nin the defendant’s possession or … traceable items that the\ndefendant purchased with the funds (e.g., identifiable prop-\nerty like a car).” Id. at 658. A section 502(a)(3) suit wasn’t\navailable in either Great-West or Montanile because the\nplaintiffs hadn’t pointed to specifically identifiable funds in\nthe defendant’s possession to which an equitable lien could\nattach.\n    The trustee hasn’t done so here either, so he cannot pro-\nceed under section 502(a)(3) on any of the theories he styles\nas “restitutionary.” He can’t point to specifically identifiable\nfunds in the insurers’ possession because the insurers never\nreceived any funds at all. They may have avoided what the\ntrustee claims are their contractual obligations to the in-\nsureds and in that sense realized a monetary benefit. But no\nmatter what the trustee calls his claim, he is seeking a recov-\nery from the insurers’ general assets. His request for declara-\ntory relief seeks an order requiring the insurers to reimburse\nthe plan—in other words, he asks for money damages, the\nepitome of legal relief. That kind of suit is unavailable under\nsection 502(a)(3). Great-West, 534 U.S. at 210 (“Almost invari-\nably … suits seeking (whether by judgment, injunction, or\ndeclaration) to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money\nto the plaintiff are suits for ‘money damages,’ … since they\nseek no more than compensation for loss resulting from the\n\nparticular statutes or on the right to jury trial are outside the scope of this\nRestatement.”).\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                  11\n\ndefendant’s breach of legal duty.”) (quotation marks omit-\nted).\n    The trustee offers several arguments to avoid this conclu-\nsion, but all fail. First, he invokes the equitable roots of his\nvarious restitutionary theories. As we’ve noted, however,\nthe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that even if the basis\nfor a claim is equitable, the relief sought must be equitable as\nwell and that requires identifying specific funds in the\ndefendant’s possession. Montanile, 136 S. Ct. at 657. The\nCourt has given us no indication that this requirement\napplies to some but not all of the three traditionally equita-\nble theories by which a plaintiff may obtain restitution:\nequitable lien, constructive trust, and subrogation. See\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT § 56 cmt. a (AM. LAW INST. 2011). And the\nRestatement makes clear that all of these remedies “confer\neither rights of ownership or a security interest in specifical-\nly identifiable property in the hands of the defendant.”\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT ch. 7, topic 2, intro. note (AM. LAW INST. 2011).\nRegardless of how the trustee characterizes his claims, the\nrelief he seeks isn’t equitable in nature, and a suit under\nsection 502(a)(3) is therefore unavailable.\n    Second, the trustee argues that allowing his suit is con-\nsistent with ERISA’s “underlying purpose[s]” of protecting\nplan assets and enforcing plan terms. For support he relies\non the Supreme Court’s opinion in King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct.\n2480 (2015). But the Court has heard this argument before in\nthe context of section 502(a)(3) suits and has consistently\nrejected it. Montanile, 136 S. Ct. at 661 (“[V]ague notions of a\nstatute’s ‘basic purpose’ are … inadequate to overcome the\n\f12                                                No. 15-2237\n\nwords of its text regarding the specific issue under consider-\nation.” (quoting Mertens, 508 U.S. at 261)).\n    Finally, the trustee relies on two cases from this court in\nwhich we permitted ERISA plans to litigate coordination-of-\nbenefits disputes against other insurers: Winstead v. Indiana\nInsurance Co., 855 F.2d 430 (7th Cir. 1988), and Winstead v.\nJ.C. Penney Co., 933 F.2d 576 (7th Cir. 1991). Both cases were\ndecided before Mertens, the Supreme Court’s first foray into\nthe question of appropriate equitable relief under section\n502(a)(3). These two early cases in our circuit cannot be\nreconciled with the Court’s consistent instructions in\nMertens, Great-West, Sereboff, McCutchen, and Montanile.\n    In closing, we recognize the dilemma this outcome cre-\nates for the plan. An equitable-contribution suit under state\nlaw is probably foreclosed by ERISA’s broad preemption\nprovision. See generally United of Omaha v. Bus. Men’s Assur-\nance Co. of Am., 104 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 1997) (holding that\nERISA preempts a state common-law subrogation claim in a\ndispute between two insurance companies over which\ncompany was responsible to pay for certain benefits). If\nERISA plans can’t bring section 502(a)(3) suits or state-law\nclaims to obtain reimbursement from other insurers with\noverlapping coverage obligations, then they’re left with just\none way to ensure that they don’t pay claims for which other\ninsurers are primarily liable: refuse to provide coverage to\nbeneficiaries who have other insurance and sue for a declar-\natory judgment that the other insurer is primarily liable. This\napproach leaves the ERISA beneficiary, “through no fault of\nhis own, … considerably worse off for having two policies\nthat coincidentally had conflicting language than he would\nbe if he had only one.” Gerber Life Ins. Co., 771 F.3d at 159.\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                   13\n\n    The trustee asks us to resolve this regrettable dilemma in\nthe plan’s favor. But that option is not open to us. It would\ndirectly contravene clear instructions from the Supreme\nCourt on the scope of section 502(a)(3) and create a circuit\nsplit to boot. Accordingly, we now join our sister circuits and\nhold that the trustee’s suit against the insurers to recoup\namounts it paid for the beneficiaries’ medical care seeks\nlegal relief, not equitable relief, and as such is not authorized\nby section 502(a)(3).\n                                                      AFFIRMED.\n\f",

A self-funded ERISA plan has sued\nseveral independent health insurers seeking reimbursement\nfor medical expenses it paid on behalf of beneficiaries who\nwere covered under both the plan and the insurers’ policies.\n\f2                                                  No. 15-2237\n\nWe’re asked to decide whether a lawsuit like this one—a\n“coordination of benefits” dispute—seeks “appropriate\nequitable relief” under section 502(a)(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(3). Six circuits have held that section 502(a)(3) does\nnot authorize suits of this type because the relief sought is\nlegal, not equitable. We join this consensus and affirm the\ndismissal of the ERISA plan’s suit.\n                        I. Background\n    Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health\nand Welfare Fund (“Central States” or “the plan”) is a self-\nfunded ERISA plan that provides health coverage to partici-\npating Teamsters and their dependents. The plan’s trustee\nfiled suit on the plan’s behalf seeking a declaratory judg-\nment enforcing the plan’s terms and awarding restitution on\nvarious theories. The defendants are insurance companies\nthat underwrite and administer insurance policies for\nschools and youth sports leagues; their policies cover inju-\nries sustained by young athletes while participating in\nathletic activities sponsored by these schools and leagues.\nThe case arises from injuries sustained by student athletes\nwho had medical coverage under both the Central States\nplan and the independent insurers’ policies. The trustee\nalleges that the plan paid the beneficiaries’ medical bills in\nfull, in the total amount of about $343,000, and the insurers\nowe reimbursement.\n   The plan and the insurers’ policies have competing coor-\ndination-of-benefits clauses, and each side claims that its\nrespective provision makes the other primarily liable for the\nbeneficiaries’ medical expenses. Coordination-of-benefits\ndisputes like this one are often resolved in state court in a\ndeclaratory-judgment action on an equitable-contribution\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                            3\n\ntheory. 1 See 16 LEE R. RUSS & THOMAS F. SEGALLA, C OUCH\nON INSURANCE § 232:71 (3d ed. 2000).\n\n    But the trustee sued in federal court under section\n502(a)(3) of ERISA (the Employee Retirement Income Securi-\nty Act of 1974), which provides in relevant part that a partic-\nipant, beneficiary, or fiduciary of an employee-benefits plan\nmay bring a civil action “to obtain … appropriate equitable\nrelief … to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the\nterms of the plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B) (emphasis\nadded). The trustee contends that the suit seeks “appropriate\nequitable relief” to enforce the plan’s coordination-of-\nbenefits provision.\n    More specifically, the trustee seeks: (1) a declaratory\njudgment that the insurers are primarily liable for “current\nunpaid and future medical expenses” incurred by athletes\nwho are covered by both the plan and one of the insurers;\n(2) a declaratory judgment that the insurers are primarily\nliable for medical expenses for injuries already incurred and\ntreated; (3) the imposition of an equitable lien on sums held\nby the insurers in the amount of the benefits paid by the\nplan; and (4) an order that the insurers must reimburse the\nplan, variously justified on restitution, unjust enrichment,\nand subrogation theories.\n\n\n\n\n1 These suits also may be brought on equitable-subrogation or equitable-\nindemnification theories.

RUSS &\nTHOMAS F. SEGALLA, COUCH ON INSURANCE § 217:5 (3d ed. 1999).\n\f4                                                 No. 15-2237\n\n    The insurers moved to dismiss all claims. The district\njudge granted the motion on two different grounds. To the\nextent that the suit sought a declaratory judgment regarding\nfuture medical expenses, the judge held that it did not raise a\ncontroversy sufficient to invoke the court’s power to award\ndeclaratory relief and dismissed that claim for lack of sub-\nject-matter jurisdiction. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1). The\nremaining claims were dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for\nfailure to state a claim. The judge reasoned that the relief\nsought, though phrased in equitable terms, was not equita-\nble relief within the meaning of section 502(a)(3).\n                        II. Discussion\nA. Jurisdiction\n    As always, our first question is subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion. We’re satisfied that jurisdiction is secure over most of\nthis case. The Central States plan has clearly been injured by\nthe independent insurers’ failure to reimburse it for the\nmedical expenses it has paid, and its claim arises under a\nfederal statute, section 502(a)(3) of ERISA. But the request\nfor a declaratory judgment regarding the insurers’ liability\nfor “current unpaid and future medical expenses” is jurisdic-\ntionally problematic. For starters, the trustee’s use of the\nphrase “current unpaid and future medical expenses” is\nodd. The amended complaint alleges that Central States paid\nthe injured students’ medical expenses in full. Accepting that\nas true, there are no “current unpaid” medical expenses at\nall. The trustee explains in his briefs that this request for\nrelief relates to “prospective claims”—that is, claims that\nTeamsters’ dependents might make for injuries sustained in\nthe future.\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                              5\n\n     This clearly raises ripeness concerns, as the district judge\nrecognized. 2 The Declaratory Judgment Act permits a feder-\nal court to award a declaratory judgment only in “a case of\nactual controversy.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). This limitation is\nequivalent to the Constitution’s general limitation on the\njurisdiction of the federal courts. U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2,\ncl. 1; § 2201(a); Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac.

Maryland Casualty remains the leading\nstatement on ripeness questions in the context of\ndeclaratory-judgment actions: A suit is ripe when “the facts\nalleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a\nsubstantial controversy, between parties having adverse\nlegal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant\nthe issuance of a declaratory judgment.” 312 U.S. at 273. The\nquestion is “necessarily one of degree,” id., and it “must be\nworked out on a case-by-case basis,” 10B CHARLES ALAN\nWRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2757 (3d ed. 1998).\n    The trustee’s request for a declaratory judgment regard-\ning expenses the plan has already paid is plainly ripe for\nadjudication; that claim involves a definite injury between\nparties with adverse legal interests. The declaratory-\njudgment request regarding future claims, however, is\nunripe. That request for relief arises from hypothetical\nbenefits claims that have yet to be filed—indeed from inju-\nries that have not yet occurred—so the controversy between\n\n\n2 The Supreme Court has held that ripeness is a jurisdictional question.\nSee, e.g, Metro.

In\nSolo Cup we dismissed as unripe an employer’s request for a\ndeclaration that its insurer must indemnify it for yet-to-be-\nfiled lawsuits. The employer had settled one plaintiff’s\ndiscrimination claim and sought indemnification for the\nsettlement; that claim was clearly justiciable. Id. at 1183. In\nthe meantime, the federal government had issued a report\nfinding that the employer had discriminated against some\n70 additional employees; the employer sought a judgment\ndeclaring that any sums it might have to pay on these poten-\ntial discrimination claims would be within the indemnity\ncoverage of the insurer’s policy. Id. at 1188–89. That claim\nwas unripe because “[t]he mere possibility that proceedings\nmight be commenced against an insured … is not sufficient\nto create a controversy within the meaning of either the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act or Article III of the Constitution.”\nId. at 1189.\n    The trustee’s request here—for a declaration regarding\npayment of future claims—is even more remote. In Solo Cup\nthe prospective claims against the insured were identifiable\nand had accrued but had not yet been filed. Here the trustee\nwants a declaration regarding hypothetical future medical\nclaims arising from injuries that have not yet occurred. This\naspect of the trustee’s declaratory-judgment request is\nclearly unripe.\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                     7\n\nB. Section 502(a)(3) and “Equitable Relief”\n   Turning now to the merits of the remaining claims, we\nagree with the district judge that the relief sought is legal,\nnot equitable, so the trustee’s suit is not authorized under\nERISA section 502(a)(3).\n    This is not the first time that Central States has sued in-\nsurers of schools and athletic leagues seeking reimburse-\nment for medical expenses it paid on behalf of its beneficiar-\nies. Six circuits have considered virtually identical claims by\nthe plan. All have reached the same conclusion: The suit is\nnot authorized under section 502(a)(3) because the relief\nsought is legal, not equitable. Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas\nHealth & Welfare Fund v.

The Court held that\n“appropriate equitable relief” is limited to “those categories\nof relief that were typically available in equity (such as\ninjunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensato-\nry damages).” Mertens, 508 U.S. at 256. The Court held that\nthe relief the ERISA beneficiaries sought was compensatory\ndamages, which is “the classic form of legal relief” and\ntherefore unavailable under section 502(a)(3). Id. at 255.\n    The next four cases—Great-West, Sereboff, McCutchen, and\nMontanile—all involved disputes between ERISA plans and\nbeneficiaries over the proceeds of auto-insurance settle-\nments. The ERISA beneficiaries suffered injuries in car\naccidents; the ERISA plans paid for the medical care to treat\nthese injuries. When the beneficiaries settled with the drivers\nwho caused the accidents, the ERISA plans demanded\nreimbursement from the settlement proceeds. The beneficiar-\nies refused, and the ERISA plans brought restitution claims\nunder section 502(a)(3) to enforce reimbursement provisions\nin their plan documents.\n    In Sereboff and McCutchen, the defendant beneficiaries\nheld the settlement proceeds in segregated accounts or\nfunds, and in each case the plans sought an equitable lien\nagainst the specifically identified account or fund; the Court\nheld that this form of relief was properly regarded as equi-\ntable. In Great-West and Montanile, on the other hand, the\ndefendant beneficiaries did not possess the settlement pro-\nceeds; the relief sought was money damages from the bene-\nficiary’s general assets, a quintessentially legal remedy. More\nspecifically, in Great-West the proceeds of the settlement\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                             9\n\nwere allocated to a trust rather than directly to the benefi-\nciary, who was the defendant in the plan’s suit; in Montanile\nthe settlement proceeds were paid directly to the defendant\nbeneficiary, but the record suggested that the money may\nhave been dissipated before the ERISA plan filed suit. 3\n    In each of these cases, the Court explained that whether a\nremedy is available under section 502(a)(3) “depends on\n(1) the basis for the plaintiff’s claim and (2) the nature of the\nunderlying remedies sought”; both must be equitable to\nproceed under section 502(a)(3). Montanile, 136 S. Ct. at 657\n(brackets and quotation marks omitted). The inquiry looks to\n“standard treatises on equity, which establish the basic\ncontours of what equitable relief was typically available in\npremerger equity courts.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). 4\n\n\n\n3 To be precise, in Montanile the lower courts had not had occasion to\ndetermine whether the defendant beneficiary had fully depleted the\nsettlement fund on nontraceable assets. Applying its prior cases, the\nCourt held that a recovery against a beneficiary’s general assets is legal\nrather than equitable relief, reversing the lower courts’ decisions to the\ncontrary, but remanded to permit the district court to determine whether\nthe beneficiary had dissipated the entire settlement fund or comingled\nthe fund with his general assets.

LAW INST. 2011) (Some federal statutes\n“arguably necessitate[] an inquiry into the legal or equitable nature of\nthe relief sought … . Resolution of such problems turns on issues … that\nare beyond the reach of legal history and outside the scope of this\nRestatement.”); RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT ch. 7, topic 2, intro. note (AM. LAW INST. 2011) (“Lingering\neffects of [the law/equity distinction] on the remedies available under\n\f10                                                             No. 15-2237\n\n    Importantly, the Court made it clear that simply phrasing\nthe request for relief in equitable terms—e.g., restitution,\nunjust enrichment, an equitable lien—is not dispositive. The\nremedy is properly regarded as equitable only if the plaintiff\nseeks the return of “specifically identified funds that remain\nin the defendant’s possession or … traceable items that the\ndefendant purchased with the funds (e.g., identifiable prop-\nerty like a car).” Id. at 658. A section 502(a)(3) suit wasn’t\navailable in either Great-West or Montanile because the\nplaintiffs hadn’t pointed to specifically identifiable funds in\nthe defendant’s possession to which an equitable lien could\nattach.\n    The trustee hasn’t done so here either, so he cannot pro-\nceed under section 502(a)(3) on any of the theories he styles\nas “restitutionary.” He can’t point to specifically identifiable\nfunds in the insurers’ possession because the insurers never\nreceived any funds at all. They may have avoided what the\ntrustee claims are their contractual obligations to the in-\nsureds and in that sense realized a monetary benefit. But no\nmatter what the trustee calls his claim, he is seeking a recov-\nery from the insurers’ general assets. His request for declara-\ntory relief seeks an order requiring the insurers to reimburse\nthe plan—in other words, he asks for money damages, the\nepitome of legal relief. That kind of suit is unavailable under\nsection 502(a)(3). Great-West, 534 U.S. at 210 (“Almost invari-\nably … suits seeking (whether by judgment, injunction, or\ndeclaration) to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money\nto the plaintiff are suits for ‘money damages,’ … since they\nseek no more than compensation for loss resulting from the\n\nparticular statutes or on the right to jury trial are outside the scope of this\nRestatement.”).\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                  11\n\ndefendant’s breach of legal duty.”) (quotation marks omit-\nted).\n    The trustee offers several arguments to avoid this conclu-\nsion, but all fail. First, he invokes the equitable roots of his\nvarious restitutionary theories. As we’ve noted, however,\nthe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that even if the basis\nfor a claim is equitable, the relief sought must be equitable as\nwell and that requires identifying specific funds in the\ndefendant’s possession. Montanile, 136 S. Ct. at 657. The\nCourt has given us no indication that this requirement\napplies to some but not all of the three traditionally equita-\nble theories by which a plaintiff may obtain restitution:\nequitable lien, constructive trust, and subrogation. See\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT § 56 cmt. a (AM. LAW INST. 2011). And the\nRestatement makes clear that all of these remedies “confer\neither rights of ownership or a security interest in specifical-\nly identifiable property in the hands of the defendant.”\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST\nENRICHMENT ch. 7, topic 2, intro. note (AM. LAW INST. 2011).\nRegardless of how the trustee characterizes his claims, the\nrelief he seeks isn’t equitable in nature, and a suit under\nsection 502(a)(3) is therefore unavailable.\n    Second, the trustee argues that allowing his suit is con-\nsistent with ERISA’s “underlying purpose[s]” of protecting\nplan assets and enforcing plan terms. For support he relies\non the Supreme Court’s opinion in King v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2811845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2811845/king-v-burwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). But the Court has heard this argument before in\nthe context of section 502(a)(3) suits and has consistently\nrejected it. Montanile, 136 S. Ct. at 661 (“[V]ague notions of a\nstatute’s ‘basic purpose’ are … inadequate to overcome the\n\f12                                                No. 15-2237\n\nwords of its text regarding the specific issue under consider-\nation.” (quoting Mertens, 508 U.S. at 261)).\n    Finally, the trustee relies on two cases from this court in\nwhich we permitted ERISA plans to litigate coordination-of-\nbenefits disputes against other insurers: Winstead v. Indiana\nInsurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510692\"><a href=\"/opinion/510692/marion-m-winstead-v-indiana-insurance-company-a-foreign-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1988), and Winstead v.\nJ.C.

Both cases were\ndecided before Mertens, the Supreme Court’s first foray into\nthe question of appropriate equitable relief under section\n502(a)(3). These two early cases in our circuit cannot be\nreconciled with the Court’s consistent instructions in\nMertens, Great-West, Sereboff, McCutchen, and Montanile.\n    In closing, we recognize the dilemma this outcome cre-\nates for the plan. An equitable-contribution suit under state\nlaw is probably foreclosed by ERISA’s broad preemption\nprovision. See generally United of Omaha v. Bus.

If\nERISA plans can’t bring section 502(a)(3) suits or state-law\nclaims to obtain reimbursement from other insurers with\noverlapping coverage obligations, then they’re left with just\none way to ensure that they don’t pay claims for which other\ninsurers are primarily liable: refuse to provide coverage to\nbeneficiaries who have other insurance and sue for a declar-\natory judgment that the other insurer is primarily liable. This\napproach leaves the ERISA beneficiary, “through no fault of\nhis own, … considerably worse off for having two policies\nthat coincidentally had conflicting language than he would\nbe if he had only one.” Gerber Life Ins. Co., 771 F.3d at 159.\n\fNo. 15-2237                                                   13\n\n    The trustee asks us to resolve this regrettable dilemma in\nthe plan’s favor. But that option is not open to us. It would\ndirectly contravene clear instructions from the Supreme\nCourt on the scope of section 502(a)(3) and create a circuit\nsplit to boot. Accordingly, we now join our sister circuits and\nhold that the trustee’s suit against the insurers to recoup\namounts it paid for the beneficiaries’ medical care seeks\nlegal relief, not equitable relief, and as such is not authorized\nby section 502(a)(3).\n                                                      AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
