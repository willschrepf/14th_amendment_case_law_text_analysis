Code §§27.001 et. seq. (CR 194) and the\n\nTex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a) final Order of Dismissal (CR 196) dismissing all causes of\n\naction against Kirk Brewer, M.D. Both Orders were signed on February 8, 2016.\n\nThe Order at (CR 196) states that the “Motions are so intertwined as to not allow\n\nsegregation.” Thus argument of Dr. Montoya is on both Orders. This is also an\n\nappeal of the Summary Judgment (CR 336) that granted San Angelo Community\n\nMedical Center a Judgment dismissing all causes of action because of the orders\n\ndismissing the claims against Kirk Brewer, M.D.       The Summary Judgment was\n\nsigned on May 17, 2016 (CR 336) and a Motion for New Trial (CR 344) and an\n\nAmended Motion for New Trial were filed by Plaintiffs (CR 349) and were denied\n\n(CR 363).\n\n\n      The underlying causes of action in this case are:\n\n      1) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient\n\nrelations; 2) Illegal and anticompetitive actions of the Defendants; 3) Defendants\n\ndefamation per se; 4) Malice; 5) Business Disparagement against the Plaintiffs; 6)\n\nRestraint of Trade- (Monopolization/Attempted Monopolization/Conspiracy to\n\nMonopolize); 7) Group Boycott and Conspiracy in Restraint of Trade; 8) Restraint\n\nof Trade/Tortious Interference by violating EMTALA (Emergency Medicine\n\n                                       Page 1\n\fTreatment and Action Labor Act) (CR 160 and 300).\n\n      Plaintiffs timely filed a Notice of Appeal (CR 367). Plaintiffs bring this\n\nappeal seeking a reversal of the trial courts granting of the Motion to Dismiss and\n\nthe final Order of Dismissal of all causes of action against Kirk Brewer, M.D. and\n\nthe Summary Judgment denying all causes of action against San Angelo\n\nCommunity Medical Center.\n\n\n      For ease all Plaintiffs will be referred to as “Dr. Montoya”, Defendant Kirk\n\nBrewer, M.D. will be referred to as “Dr. Brewer” and San Angelo Community\n\nMedical Center will be referred to as “SACMC”.\n\n\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\nAppellant’s Issues-\n\n1.   The trial court erred in granting the Motion to Dismiss per the Texas Citizens\n\n     Participation Act Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. and the final\n\n     Order of Dismissal pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a) dismissing all causes of\n\n     action against Kirk Brewer, M.D.\n\n\n2.    The trial court erred in granting San Angelo Community Medical Center a\n\n      Summary Judgment based on the court’s rulings for Kirk Brewer, M.D.\n\n      when Plaintiffs raised sufficient issues of law and evidentiary facts to deny\n\n      the Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n\n                                      Page 2\n\f3.    The Defendant Dr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss under Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a)\n\n      and Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. was untimely filed and\n\n      untimely heard by the Court.\n\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Dr. Montoya is a nephrologist in practice at SACMC since 1981. He filed\n\nsuit against Dr. Brewer (the hospital Chief of Staff) and SACMC for various Anti-\n\nCompetitive actions on July 6, 2015 (CR 7). Defendant SACMC filed Special\n\nExceptions and an answer on August 14, 2015 (CR 17). The Court granted the\n\nSpecial Exceptions on December 3, 2015 (CR 75). Dr. Montoya filed a Second\n\nAmended Petition in response to the Court Order on the Special Exceptions (CR\n\n103). Dr. Brewer filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 91(a)\n\nand Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem. Code §27.001 et.seq. (CR 76) and then filed an Amended\n\nMotion to Dismiss (CR 119). Dr. Montoya filed a response to the Motion to\n\nDismiss (CR 94) and a Supplemental Response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 177).\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya timely filed before the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss a\n\nFourth Amended Original Petition (CR 160). The Court granted the Motion to\n\nDismiss not distinguishing which rule the Court was using to grant the dismissal\n\n(CR 194). The Court specifically said it could not segregate the claims (CR 196).\n\n\n\n                                      Page 3\n\f        SACMC filed a untimely Motion to Dismiss (CR 202). SACMC filed a\n\nMotion for Leave to file their Motion to Dismiss (CR 216). At the same time as\n\nfiling the Motion to Dismiss SACMC filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (CR\n\n208) based only on the Court granting Dr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. The Court\n\ndenied leave to file the Motion to Dismiss of SACMC (CR 335).\n\n\n        Dr. Montoya filed a response to SACMC’s Motion to Dismiss (CR 331) and\n\na response to the Motion for Summary Judgment (Supp. CR ______).               Dr.\n\nMontoya timely filed before the Summary Judgment hearing a Sixth Amended\n\nOriginal Petition (CR 300). The Court granted the Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nof SACMC based on the ruling of dismissing all claims against Dr. Brewer (CR\n\n336).\n\n\n        Dr. Montoya requested findings of fact and conclusions of law (CR 337) to\n\nallow the court to state the facts and law it relied upon since the Court could not\n\nsegregate its prior Order (CR 196) that is the basis of the Summary Judgment. The\n\ncourt did not file any findings. Dr. Montoya filed a Motion for New Trial (CR\n\n344) and an amended Motion for New Trial (CR 349) and a Motion to Reconsider\n\nDr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. The Court signed an Order denying the First\n\nAmended Motion for New Trial (CR 363). Dr. Montoya timely filed Notice of\n\nAppeal (CR 367).\n\n\n                                      Page 4\n\f      Summary of Argument\n\n      Dr. Montoya sued the hospital SACMC and Dr. Brewer based upon causes\n\nof action that were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in the case of a doctor\n\nsuing the hospital where he had a medical practice. The exact same causes of\n\naction that were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in In Re Memorial\n\nHermann Hospital System, 464 S.W. 3d 686 (2015) are Dr. Montoya’s causes of\n\naction. The Court in In Re Memorial Hermann case stated “We hold that Dr.\n\nGomez’s petition presents multiple viable anti-competitive actions” Id at 713.\n\nAttached as Exhibit 1 to the response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 232) is a\n\ncertified copy of the pleading of Dr. Gomez from the In Re Memorial Hermann\n\ncase that was specifically approved by the Texas Supreme Court as viable causes\n\nof action. The causes of action approved by the Texas Supreme Court in In Re\n\nMemorial Hermann are:\n\n\n      (1)   Business Disparagement\n      (2)   Defamation\n      (3)   Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations\n      (4)   Improper Restraint of Trade under the Texas Fire Enterprises and\n            Anti-Trust Act of 1983.\n\n      Id. At 695-696\n\n      The Petitions (Original through Sixth Amended) (CR 7, 103, 143, 160, 272,\n\n300) of Dr. Montoya followed and alleged the approved Petition of the Texas\n\nSupreme Court In Re Memorial Hermann. Dr. Montoya is alleging the approved\n                                    Page 5\n\fanti-competitive and defamation causes of action of the Texas Supreme Court, by a\n\nphysician and his entities in which he practices, suing the hospital where he\n\npractices medicine, and Dr. Brewer as Chief of Staff for Anti-Competitive actions.\n\nThis case is exactly the In Re Memorial Hermann case approved by the Texas\n\nSupreme Court. The Texas Supreme Court determined In Re Memorial Hermann\n\nin 2015 allowing Anti-Competitive actions against a hospital and its opinion has\n\nnot been reversed.\n\n\n      Using the standards set forth in City of Dallas v. Sanchez 494 S.W.3d 722,\n\n724 (2016) for dismissal under Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a) Dr. Montoya’s pleadings,\n\n(CR 7, 103, 143, 160, 272, 300) taken as true, with the inferences reasonably\n\ndrawn from them entitle Dr. Montoya to the relief sought in his petitions and\n\nreasonable people could believe the facts pled.\n\n\n      Using the standard set forth in In Re Lipsky, 460 SW3d 579 (Tex.2016) for\n\ndetermination of whether the Texas Anti-Slapp Statute applies Tex.Civ.Prac. &\n\nRem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. Dr. Montoya proved through his pleadings and\n\naffidavits attached to the responses to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 94, 225) and\n\nSupplemental Response (CR 177) the case is not one seeking to intimidate or\n\nsilence the public but is a case of economic retaliation and is based upon valid\n\nclaims that have approved causes of action as set forth in In Re Memorial Hermann\n\n\n                                       Page 6\n\f                                ARGUMENT\n\nA.    Summary of Factual Allegations by Dr. Montoya in his Fourth\n      Amended Petition (CR 160) for Dr. Brewer. For SACMC the Sixth\n      Amended Original Petition (CR 300)\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya has practiced at San Angelo Community Hospital since 1981.\n\nUntil 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room\n\nper month to treat either new or existing patients at the San Angelo\n\nCommunity Medical Center. Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call\n\nfrom the emergency room or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist, and\n\none time for treatment of an existing patient that suffered with kidney\n\ndisease/problems. The lack of referrals caused substantial injury to Dr. Montoya\n\nand damaged his ability to compete, because he depended on these referrals and\n\nconsults to build and keep his practice. A majority of patients who need kidney\n\ntreatment suffering from kidney disease in a hospital will later need continuing\n\ncare for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such continuing\n\ntreatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need\n\ntreatment for a n average of 6 years, and each such patient would mean\n\nrevenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of approximately $100,000 per year. Dr.\n\nMontoya estimates that he has lost at least 100 long term kidney dialysis\n\npatients from 2007 to the present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme\n\nto refuse to give him patient referrals or consults from the emergency room of\n                                     Page 7\n\fSACMC. D r . M o n t o y a estimates that this lack of referrals has thus cost him\n\n$3,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya in developing, building and keeping his practice, has always\n\ntaken patients as an on-call staff attending physician from the emergency\n\nroom/department of SACMC.\n\n\n      In developing and building a practice Dr. Montoya as a nephrologist\n\nwanted long term kidney dialysis patients to treat in his practice. Referral from\n\nhospitals and area physicians is extremely important to a nephrologist to building\n\nand keeping a practice. The ability to obtain referrals from a hospital and area\n\nphysicians is a primary source of patients with kidney disease. Defendants in this\n\ncase conspired to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals needed for his nephrology\n\npractice to continue. This case is for the anticompetitive actions of the Defendants\n\nposing a danger of monopolization or attempted monopolization of patient\n\nchoice and causing patients to pay more for medical care and injuring consumer\n\npatients.\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya during his 36 year career in San Angelo built his practice\n\nincluding a dialysis unit that can serve 24 patients per shift from referring\n\nphysician and referrals of patients from the emergency room/department.\n\n\n\n                                       Page 8\n\f      Dr. Brewer is an employee and/or owner of a group of hospitalists\n\naffiliated with, and possibly created by, SACMC. Dr. Brewer was the chief of\n\nstaff of SACMC when this case was filed and head of the hospitalist group that\n\npractices at SACMC. Dr. Montoya has been denied the referral of patients that\n\ncome into the emergency room with kidney problems/illness/disease by the\n\nhospitalists controlled by Dr. Brewer and SACMC. These patients in need of a\n\nnephrologists care are being referred to the hospital affiliated physician group in\n\ncompetition with Dr. Montoya. Even Dr. Montoya's current patients are being\n\nreferred to the hospitalist/hospital affiliated group.\n\n\n      At all relevant times Dr. Kirk Brewer, himself, as a principal officer of\n\nCommunity Medical Associates, SACMC and Chief of Staff of SACMC and\n\nhead of the hospitalist system at SACMC and the agents/employees of SACMC\n\nworking under his control, direction, or in furtherance of unlawful and improper\n\nactions was and is employed by and acting in furtherance of the business of\n\n(SACMC) and its affiliated medical practice(s).\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya's skill as a nephrologist was, until the hospital created its\n\naffiliated medical practice and/or entered into an exclusive contract with the\n\ngroup of hospitalists affiliated and/or managed by Dr. Brewer, a marketing asset\n\nfor SACMC. Dr. Montoya is the only Spanish speaking nephrologist at SACMC.\n\n\n                                         Page 9\n\fDr. Montoya received his rotating share of referrals a s r e q ui r e d b y F e d e r a l\n\nL a w c a l l e d EM TA L A , of patients with kidney disease/illness/failure until\n\nSACMC created its affiliated practice groups and/or entered into an exclusive\n\ncontract with the group of hospitalists affiliated and/or managed by Dr. Brewer.\n\n\n       One example of Dr. Brewer’s actions- On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m.\n\nKirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalist care of a patient b e i n g s e e n b y\n\nDr. Montoya in the hospital (SACMC) .                            When Dr. Brewer’s\n\nrotation as on call hospitalist started he without ever seeing the patient or the\n\nchart cancelled Dr. Montoya's consult and treatment ordered by Dr. Montoya and\n\nconsulted another nephrologist.          This removal proves actual anti-competitive\n\naction of Dr. Brewer against Dr. Montoya. Dr. Montoya went to the call board a t\n\nt h e h o s p i t a l and witnessed his name on the call board as the nephrologist on\n\ncall on January 24 and 25, 2014.              SACMC is required to have an official\n\nEMTALA Medicare call list for on call physicians for the SACMC to take\n\nMedicare patients and be paid for the medicare patients.\n\n\n       Dr. Montoya’s name was on the call list but he was intentionally ignored.\n\nT h e r e m o v a l o f D r . M o n t o y a a s t h e patients p h y s i c i a n s also violates\n\na patient's right to choose their physician. This list was followed until Dr. Brewer\n\ncame to SACMC and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brought in\n\n                                            Page 10\n\ffor consult after removing Dr. Montoya is one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer,\n\nM.D. has a contract for paid services with Dr. Brewer. Dr. Brewer did not see\n\nthe patient when he removed D r . M o n t o y a as the treating nephrologist; he\n\nissued the change via a telephone order. Kirk Brewer, M.D. without seeing the\n\npatient, r e mo v e d D r . M o n t o ya a s t h e patient's doctor.   This change of\n\nnephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused Dr.\n\nMontoya economic loss. Attached as Exhibit B (CR 175-176 and 325-326) to\n\nthe petition is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing\n\nthe facts on January 25, 2014 as stated above.\n\n\n      Kirk Brewer, M.D. by his actions of removing Dr. Montoya as the\n\nnephrologist published a statement that Dr. Montoya was not a competent\n\nnephrologist to treat patients coming to the San Angelo Community Medical\n\nCenter emergency room. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was aware that his actions would\n\nbecome known to the staff physicians of San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\nand that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign saying Dr. Montoya should\n\nnot be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. These\n\nremarks caused hospitalists and other doctors at SACMC, as well as doctors and\n\nnurses in the SACMC emergency department, to cease and refuse to (a) admit\n\npatients to the care of Dr. Montoya, and (b) not to refer patients to Dr. Montoya\n\nfor nephrology consults.\n                                        Page 11\n\f      Attached to the petition as Exhibit C (CR 175) is the true and correct\n\nsworn statement that an existing patient of Dr. Montoya, Mrs. Welch tried to see\n\nDr. Montoya in the emergency room of San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\nand that the emergency room would not call Dr. Montoya to treat his existing\n\npatient. Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and Dr. Montoya has treated her for\n\nat least 20 years.\n\n\n      Another patient of Dr. Montoya, whose name is withheld per privacy\n\nrights, who is also over 90 years of age and has been a Dr. Montoya patient for at\n\nleast 10 years requested Dr. Montoya when she went to the emergency room and\n\nshe also was not allowed to see Dr. Montoya her personal physician.\n\n\n      These facts as stated in the Petition (CR 160) prove the defamation claim\n\nagainst Dr. Brewer dismissed under the Anti-Slapp Statute was in error. The\n\n“whisper campaign” was only for an economic reason and not made as a truthful\n\nstatement above Dr. Montoya. The Whisper Campaign was confirmed in Dr.\n\nHunt’s affidavit (CR 179). It also proves that Dr. Montoya’s claims under In Re\n\nMemorial Hermann standard are valid claims.         They should not have been\n\ndismissed under Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a).\n\n      The above facts are proven through the pleadings (CR 160 and 272) and the\n\naffidavits of Dr. Montoya (CR 96, 180, 250) and Dr. Hunt (CR 179) and the sworn\n\n                                     Page 12\n\fstatement of a patient Mrs. Welch (CR 175).\n\n      Causes of Action\n\n      Dr. Montoya sued the hospital SACMC and Dr. Brewer based upon causes\n\nof action that were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in the case of a doctor\n\nsuing the hospital where he had a medical practice. The exact same causes of\n\naction that were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in In Re Memorial\n\nHermann Hospital System, 464 S.W. 3d 686 (2015) are Dr. Montoya’s causes of\n\naction. The Court in In Re Memorial Hermann case stated “We hold that Dr.\n\nGomez’s petition presents multiple viable anti-competitive actions” Id at 713.\n\nAttached as Exhibit 1 to the response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 232) is a\n\ncertified copy of the pleading of Dr. Gomez from the In Re Memorial Hermann\n\ncase that was specifically approved by the Texas Supreme Court as viable causes\n\nof action. The causes of action approved by the Texas Supreme Court in In Re\n\nMemorial Hermann are:\n\n         (5) Business Disparagement\n         (6) Defamation\n         (7) Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations\n         (8) Improper Restraint of Trade under the Texas Fire Enterprises and\n             Anti-Trust Act of 1983.\n\n      Id. At 695-696\n\n      Using the standards set forth in City of Dallas v. Sanchez 494 S.W.3d 722,\n\n724 (2016) for dismissal under Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a) Dr. Montoya’s pleadings,\n\n\n                                     Page 13\n\ftaken as true, with the inference reasonably drawn from them entitle Dr. Montoya\n\nto the relief sought in his petitions and reasonable people could believe the facts\n\npled.\n\nB.      Approved Causes of Action Under In Re Memorial Hermann.\n        Dr. Montoya’s Causes of Action.\n\n        The causes of action in this suit are:\n\n        1) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient\n\nrelations; 2) Illegal and anticompetitive actions of the Defendants; 3) Defendants\n\ndefamation per se; 4) Malice; 5) Business Disparagement against the Plaintiffs; 6)\n\nRestraint of Trade- (Monopolization/Attempted Monopolization/Conspiracy to\n\nMonopolize); 7) Group Boycott and Conspiracy in Restraint of Trade; 8) Restraint\n\nof Trade/Tortious Interference by violating EMTALA (Emergency Medicine\n\nTreatment and Action Labor Act) (CR 160 and 300).\n\n\nC. The Texas Citizens Participation Act standard setforth in In Re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579\n(Tex.2016)\n\n             “As already mentioned, HN3 the Texas Citizens Participation Act or TCPA protects\n             citizens from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them on matters\n             of public concern. See House Comm. on Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence, Bill\n             Analysis, Tex. H.B. 2973, 82nd Leg., R.S. (2011). The Act provides a special\n             procedure for the expedited dismissal of such suits. A two-step process is initiated\n             by motion of a defendant who believes that the lawsuit responds to the defendant's\n             valid exercise of First Amendment rights. Under the first step, [**8] the burden is\n             initially on the defendant-movant to show \"by a preponderance of the evidence\"\n             that the plaintiff's claim \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to the [movant's]\n                                                        4                         5\n             exercise of: (1) the right of free speech; (2) the right to petition; or (3) the right of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 Page 14\n\f                       6\n          association.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 27.005(b). If the movant is able to\n          demonstrate that the plaintiff's claim implicates one of these rights, the second step\n          shifts the burden to the plaintiff to \"establish[] by clear and specific evidence a\n          prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.\" Id. §\n          27.005(c).\n\n          HN7 In determining whether the plaintiff's claim should be dismissed, the court is to\n          consider the pleadings and any supporting and opposing affidavits. Id. § 27.006(a).\n          Moreover, the motion to dismiss ordinarily suspends discovery, id. § 27.003(c),\n          although the statute leaves the possibility for a court to order limited discovery for\n          \"good cause\" as it relates to the motion itself, id. § 27.006(b). Within defined time\n          limits, the court must then rule on the motion and must dismiss the plaintiff's claim if\n          the defendant's constitutional rights are implicated and the plaintiff has not met the\n          required showing of a prima facie case. Id. § 27.005. The determination is to be\n          made promptly, ordinarily within 150 days of service of the underlying legal action.\n          See id. §§ 27.003(b), .004(a), .005(a).\n\n          In this proceeding, only the second step is at issue—the question being whether\n          the plaintiff has met its burden of \"establish[ing] by clear and specific evidence a\n          prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.\" Id. §\n          27.005(c). The parties disagree about the evidentiary burden this language\n          imposes. Lipsky argues that the phrase \"clear and specific evidence\" elevates the\n          evidentiary standard, requiring Range to produce direct evidence as to each\n          element of its claim. Range, on the other hand, argues that circumstantial evidence\n          and rational inferences may be considered by the court in determining whether\n          clear and specific evidence exists and that the TCPA's prima-facie-case\n          requirement does not impose a higher or unique evidentiary standard. The dispute\n          mirrors a similar disagreement among the courts of appeals.”\n          (In Re Lipsky at 586-587)\n          4\n           HN4 The \"right of free speech\" refers to communications related to \"a matter of public\n          concern\" which is defined to include an issue related to: \"(A) health or safety; (B)\n          environmental, economic, or community well-being; (C) the government; (D) a public official\n          or public figure; or (E) a good, product, or service in the marketplace.\" Id. § 27.001(3),\n          (7)(A)—(E).\n\n          5\n           HN5 The \"right to petition\" refers to a wide range of communications relating to judicial,\n          administrative, or other governmental proceedings. Id. § 27.001(4).\n\n          6\n           HN6 The \"right of association\" refers to people \"collectively express[ing], promot[ing],\n          pursu[ing], or defend[ing] common interests.\" Id. § 27.001(2).\n\n\n      In this case Dr. Montoya conclusively proved through his factual statements\n\nin pleadings (Fourth Amended and Sixth Amended Original Petition (CR 160 and\n\n300) and affidavits attached to his response (CR 94) and Supplemental Response to\n\n\n\n\n                                               Page 15\n\fthe Motion to Dismiss in (CR 177) that there is direct and circumstantial evidence\n\nto allow the suit to go forward.\n\n\n      Clear and Convincing Evidence of Dr. Montoya petitions on file and his and\n\nDr. Hunt’s affidavits prove that this case should not have been dismissed under\n\nTex.Civ.Proc.91(a) or Tex.Civ.Prac. Remedies Code §27.001 et. seq.\n\n\n      In the response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 94) Dr. Montoya’s Fourth\n\nAmended Petition (CR 160) and his affidavit (CR 97) proved that this case is a\n\nlegitimate lawsuit based upon the In Re Memorial Hermann causes of action (see\n\npage 19 above). Dr. Montoya in the Fourth Amended Original Petition (CR 160)\n\nspecifically addressed the factual allegations of how Dr. Brewer and SACMC\n\nharmed him by interfering with his ability to obtain new patients out of the\n\nemergency room referral and make a living as a nephrologist (see facts starting\n\npage 7 above). Dr. Montoya’s active pleading at the time of the hearing on the\n\nMotion to Dismiss was the Fourth Amended Petition (CR 160). A petition is\n\nevidence to keep a Motion to Dismiss from being granted City of Dallas at 724-\n\n725. In Re Lipksy at 586-587. Then Dr. Montoya’s Supplemental Response to the\n\nMotion to Dismiss (CR 177) filed an affidavit of an independent physician, John\n\nHunt, M.D. stating specifically he (Dr. Hunt) was aware of the whisper campaign\n\nthat Dr. Montoya was not to be referred any patients from the emergency room\n\n\n                                     Page 16\n\f(CR 179). Also Dr. Montoya filed a Supplemental Affidavit that Dr. Brewer had\n\nstolen his patient (CR 180) attached to the affidavit, (redacted patient name for\n\nHIPAA privacy requirements), were patient records showing Dr. Montoya had\n\nseen a patient referral out of the emergency room as Chief of Staff and Chief\n\nHospitalist Dr. Brewer removed Dr. Montoya as the nephrologist caring for the\n\npatient. The Whisper Campaign was economic activity not a free speech activity.\n\n\n      This evidence was clear and convincing and the Court should have denied\n\nDr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. Wherefore this Court should reverse the Motion\n\nto Dismiss.\n\n\nD.    Plaintiffs’ Business Disparagement and Defamation Claims Should Not\n      Be Dismissed\n\n       “The TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits\n\ndesigned only to chill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious\n\nlawsuits.” In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 589 (Tex. 2015) (emphasis added), citing\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 27.002 (balancing “the constitutional rights of\n\npersons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in\n\ngovernment to the maximum extent permitted by law” against “the rights of a\n\nperson to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury”). The TCPA is not\n\napplicable to this case, as Plaintiff’s causes of action are primarly concerned with\n\nDefendants’ anticompetitive actions, and injury to competition in the relevant\n\n                                      Page 17\n\fmarkets of nephrology services and referrals for nephrology services in San\n\nAngelo, Texas.     As Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition makes clear, the\n\nconspiracy which Defendants perpetrated to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals\n\nbegan in 2007.     Although Plaintiff details some specific defamations which\n\noccurred in 2014, those defamations are merely representative of the\n\nanticompetitive scheme to which Dr. Montoya was being subjected. Defendants’\n\ngroup boycott and monopolization/attempted monopolization of the relevant\n\nmarket began much earlier, so even if Plaintiff’s pleadings do not set forth a prima\n\nfacie case of defamation and business disparagement, Plaintiff’s antitrust claims\n\nshould not be dismissed because they are not based on those instances of\n\ndefamation.\n\n\n      In any event, Plaintiff has set forth a prima facie case of defamation and\n\nbusiness disparagement by clear and specific evidence in his affidavit and Fifth\n\nAmended Petition. The “clear and specific” evidence which is required to pass a\n\nTCPA challenge can be contained in the plaintiff’s pleadings or in affidavits. In re\n\nLipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 591 (Tex. 2015). In determining if the “clear and specific\n\nevidence” standard is met, the court must view the pleadings in the light most\n\nfavorable to the party opposing the TCPA motion. Sloat v. Rathbun, 2015 WL\n\n6830927, at *3 (Tex.App.-Austin, 2015) (“we view the pleadings in the light most\n\nfavorable to [the non-movant]; i.e., favoring the conclusion that her claims are not\n                                      Page 18\n\fpredicated on protected expression.”); see also Cheniere Energy, Inc. v. Lotfi, 449\n\nS.W.3d 210, 214 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (reviewing\n\npleadings and evidence in light most favorable to non-movant)\n\n      A prima facie standard generally requires only the “minimum quantum of\n\nevidence necessary to support a rational inference that the allegation of fact is\n\ntrue.” In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 590 (Tex. 2015), quoting In re E.I. DuPont de\n\nNemours & Co., 136 S.W.3d 218, 223 (Tex. 2004) (per curiam). “In a defamation\n\ncase that implicates the TCPA, pleadings and evidence that establishes the facts of\n\nwhen, where, and what was said, the defamatory nature of the statements, and how\n\nthey damaged the plaintiff should be sufficient to resist a TCPA motion to\n\ndismiss.” In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 591 (Tex. 2015).\n\n\n      Plaintiff has plainly satisfied this requirement.    As shown in Plaintiff’s\n\nFourth Amended Petition, Dr. Brewer’s defamation was published by conduct\n\nwhen he removed Dr. Montoya from consulting with a patient on January 25, 2014\n\nat 8:10 a.m. The defamation was published to the hospitalist overseeing that\n\npatient, and the nephrologists who was eventually called in to consult as a\n\nreplacement for Dr. Montoya.      The defamation was eventually spread to all\n\nhospitalists and emergency room doctors at SACMC. Fourth Amended Petition, p.\n\n8, ¶ 7.13 (CR 167). Dr. Montoya has also set forth a detailed calculation and\n\nexplanation of the damages he has suffered as a result of the Defendants’ scheme\n                                      Page 19\n\fto deprive him of nephrology referrals and consults. With regard to the January\n\n2014 defamation, Plaintiff has established his prima facie case with clear and\n\nspecific evidence.\n\n\nE.    Even if Plaintiff’s Defamations Are Dismissed, Plaintiff’s Remaining\n      Claims Are Not Subject to the TCPA\n\n      The TCPA is clearly meant to apply to individual claims, not to an entire\n\nlawsuit when allegedly defamatory statements are only important to certain claims.\n\nBreach of contract claims, for example, would not ordinarily be dismissed merely\n\nbecause a Plaintiff failed to plead a prima facie defamation case under the TCPA.\n\n\n      The TCPA’s definition of “legal action” makes this clear. The TCPA states\n\nthat “If a legal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to a party's exercise\n\nof the right of free speech, right to petition, or right of association, that party may\n\nfile a motion to dismiss the legal action.”       Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n27.003(a).\n\n\n      The TCPA then defines a “Legal action” as “a lawsuit, cause of action,\n\npetition, complaint, cross-claim, or counterclaim or any other judicial pleading or\n\nfiling that requests legal or equitable relief.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n27.003(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                        Page 20\n\f      The only cases which have interpreted the TCAP’s definition of “legal\n\naction” have held that the term “is broad and evidences a legislative intent to treat\n\nany claim by any party on an individual and separate basis.” Hicks v. Group &\n\nPension Administrators, Inc., 473 S.W.3d 518, 529 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi,\n\n2015), citing Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Dallas, Inc. v. Ward, 401\n\nS.W.3d 440, 443 (Tex.App.—Dallas 2013, pet. denied).               In Hicks, the court\n\nindividually examined each of the claims which allegedly violated the TCPA and\n\ndismissed two of those claims while refusing to dismiss two other claims because\n\nthe TCPA challenge to those claims was not timely filed.\n\n\n      Writing a concurrence in the case of Serafine v. Blunt, 466 S.W.3d 352, 393-\n\n94 (Tex.App.-Austin 2015, no pet.), Justice Pemberton wrote that where a “’legal\n\naction’ is based on, relates to, or is in response to” (whatever that phrase may\n\nmean) both expression protected by the Act and other unprotected activity, the\n\n“legal action” is subject to dismissal only to the extent it ‘is based on, relates to, or\n\nis in response to’ the protected conduct, as opposed to being subject to dismissal in\n\nits entirety” Id. at 394. Justice Pemberton showed that this result finds support in\n\nseveral features of the the TCPA's text, and he explained as follows:\n\n\n      The first is that the TCPA defines “legal action”—that which is subject to\n      dismissal—both expansively and variously, as previously noted, referring to\n      everything from an entire action or proceeding to particular facts that\n      underlie a claim or cause of action. This nomenclature contemplates the\n                                        Page 21\n\f      drawing of distinctions not only between claims, but also between factual\n      theories, as here.\n\n      Adding further support to this construction are the dual overarching\n      purposes that the Legislature has declared the TCPA is to serve: “encourage\n      and safeguard the constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely,\n      associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum\n      extent permitted by law, at the same time, protect the rights of a person to\n      file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.” Neither purpose is\n      advanced by holding that a claim is wholly subject to dismissal merely\n      because it partly “is based on, relates to, or is in response to” protected\n      expression under the Act. Nor would these purposes be served by the\n      converse holding that the claim is wholly beyond the Act merely it “is based\n      on, relates to, or is in response to” some unprotected activity.\n\n      Id. at 393-394. The Serafine court later noted that “longstanding principles\n\nof Texas jurisprudence” counsel against “a construction of the TCPA that would\n\nmandate presumptive dismissal of an entire claim merely because its factual\n\nunderpinnings might include even one allegation that implicates the Act's\n\nprotections.” Id. at 394.\n\n\n      Several cases have applied the TCPA as Justice Pemberton interprets it. For\n\nexample, in Tervita, LLC v. Sutterfield, 482 S.W.3d 280, 286-87 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n\n2015, pet. denied), the court dismissed some of the plaintiff’s claims based on\n\nconduct that occurred during a TDI-WC hearing, but refused to dismiss other\n\nclaims because the movant had not shown “by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat [plaintiff’s] allegations were based on [defendant’s] exercise of its right to\n\npetition or its right of association.” Id. at 287. The Tervita court thus held that the\n\n\n                                       Page 22\n\fTCPA did not apply to the plaintiff’s “employment discrimination based on (1)\n\ncreating a hostile work environment, (2) representing that he was ‘not entitled to\n\npursue benefits’ under the Texas Worker's Compensation Act, and (3) wrongful\n\ndischarge.” Id. at 286; see also Serafine v. Blunt, 466 S.W.3d 352, 359-60\n\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2015) (“to the extent that the Blunts' tortious-interference\n\ncounterclaim is based in part on Serafine's alleged threats made outside the context\n\nof the lawsuit, Serafine has not satisfied her initial burden to show that these\n\nportions of the Blunts' counterclaims are subject to the [TCPA].”)\n\n\n      The same result occurred in Sloat v. Rathbun, 2015 WL 6830927, at *6-7\n\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2015, pet. filed). In that case, the court rejected the defendants’\n\nargument that plaintiff’s entire suit was based on conduct protected under the\n\nTCPA, when the plaintiff had also plead facts which showed stalking and other\n\ntortious conduct.   The court rejected application of the TCPA and stated as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n      [Plaintiff’s claims] are garden-variety tort claims based on specific conduct\n      that the [Defendants] have failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the\n      evidence, implicates the exercise of their rights of “free speech,” “\n      association,” or “to petition.”\n\n      Sloat v. Rathbun, 2015 WL 6830927, at *8 (Tex.App.-Austin 2015, review\n\ndismissed). The Sloat court held that the defendant had failed to demonstrate, by a\n\n“preponderance of the evidence,” that the plaintiff’s causes of action for intentional\n                                       Page 23\n\finfliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy by intrusion on seclusion and\n\nby public disclosure of private facts, and tortious interference with contract were\n\n“based on, related to, or in response to” defendants’ “exercise of their right of free\n\nspeech, right to petition, or right of association.” Id. at *9. The defendants in Sloat\n\nhad thus failed to establish that the TCPA applied to the case. Id.\n\n\n      In this case, Dr. Brewer’s participation in the conspiracy aimed at depriving\n\nPlaintiffs of referrals for nephrology patients is not based on allegedly defamatory\n\nstatements, but it instead is based on his conduct. The TCPA simply does not\n\napply to such claims, and the court erred when it dismissed all of Plaintiffs’ claims\n\nagainst Dr. Brewer.\n\n\n      Wherefore the Plaintiffs request the Order dismissing Dr. Brewer be\n\nreversed and the Summary Judgment in favor of SACMC be reversed.\n\nF.    Appellant Has Valid Causes of Action for Antitrust Violations\n\n\n      As noted above, Dr. Montoya’s defamation claims are examples of how\n\nDefendant enforced its anticompetitive scheme to deprive Dr. Montoya of\n\nnephrology referrals, but Plaintiff’s antitrust claims are primarily based on the\n\nillegal scheme itself and not individual defamatory statements.          Plaintiff has\n\nplainly set forth valid antitrust claims as they largely mirror the causes of action\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page 24\n\fwhich the Supreme Court held to be valid in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital\n\nSystem, 464 S.W.3d 686 (Tex. 2015).\n\n      The causes of action in this case, along with the underlying facts, are very\n\nsimilar to the causes of action approved by the Supreme Court in In re Memorial\n\nHermann Hospital. In both cases a doctor who has privileges at a hospital has\n\nalleged that the defendants conspired to prevent him from obtaining patient\n\nreferrals. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711; Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended\n\nPetition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5 (CR 301-303).         In both cases, the alleged\n\nconspirators consist of the hospital itself, a physician practice group, and individual\n\ndoctors who practice at the hospital. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 695;\n\nPlaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition (CR 300). In both cases, the doctors have\n\nexplained how other doctors how other doctors are a primary source of referrals,\n\nand that these referrals are required for a doctor to be able to compete. In re\n\nMemorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711; Sixth Amended Petition, pp. 6.2, 6.3, 6.8-\n\n6.11 (CR 301-305).       Both lawsuits allege that the defendants intentionally\n\ninterfered with the plaintiff’s longstanding practice for obtaining referrals from\n\nother doctors in the community, and that the defendants’ acts constituted a\n\n“concerted effort . . . to restrain competition in and monopolize” the relevant\n\nmarket. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 708; Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended\n\nPetition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 7.1, 12.7 (CR 301-302, 309, 314). Both lawsuits\n\n\n                                       Page 25\n\fallege that the defendants impugned the reputation of the plaintiff doctors through\n\na covert whisper campaign which convinced other doctors not to refer patients to\n\nthe plaintiff doctors. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 696; Plaintiff’s Sixth\n\nAmended Petition, paragraph 6.15-6.17 (CR305-306). Both lawsuits allege that\n\nthe plaintiff doctor lost a substantial amount of business from referrals due to the\n\nanticompetitive conspiracy against them. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p.\n\n711 (plaintiff alleged that “referral patterns changed” so that he was no longer the\n\n“number one” physician, and that following the conduct at issue, another physician\n\nreceived more referrals); Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, paragraph 7.11 and\n\n13.3-13.4 (Dr. Montoya received 10-20 calls per month from the SACMC\n\nemergency room to treat new or existing patients before the anticompetitive\n\nconspiracy began, but he has only received a single call from emergency room for\n\na new patient since then; all referrals now go to the nephrologists at WTMA). In\n\nboth this case and in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital, the plaintiff doctor alleges\n\nthat   the   defendants’   acts   “constitute    illegal   monopolization,   attempted\n\nmonopolization, and/or conspiracy to monopolize under Texas law.” in In re\n\nMemorial Hermann Hospital; Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, paragraph 12.7\n\n(CR 314). Plaintiff has plainly stated a valid cause of action under the antitrust\n\nlaws of Texas which is in no way designed only to chill Defendants’ First\n\nAmendment rights. “” In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 589 (Tex. 2015) (“The\n\n\n                                       Page 26\n\fTCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits designed only to\n\nchill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.”) (emphasis\n\nadded). The trial court’s granting of Dr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss under the\n\nTCPA must be reversed with regard to Dr. Montoya’s antitrust claims. The trial\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to SACMC, which was based on the improper\n\ndismissal of Dr. Montoya’s antitrust claims, must also be reversed.\n\nG.     Appellant’s Petition Clearly Brought Claims Directly Against SACMC\n       for SACMC’s Own Conduct\n\n\n     SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment argued that because the court had\n\npreviously dismissed Dr. Brewer from the case, SACMC should also be dismissed\n\nbecause “Plaintiff alleges no direct or separate liability claims against SACMC\n\nabove and apart from the actions of its agent, Brewer.” SACMC’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment as a Matter of Law, p. 3 (hereafter “SACMC Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment”) (CR 208). This statement is absolutely false.\n\n       Dr. Montoya’s Sixth Amended Petition makes it clear that SACMC was\n\nbeing sued for its own conduct, and not merely for the conduct or statements of Dr.\n\nBrewer. For example, Dr. Montoya’s Petition stated as follows:\n\n       The Defendants (SACMC) and Dr. Kirk Brewer, along with WTMA and Dr.\n       Brewer’s group of hospitalists, acting by and through its agents/employees/\n       principals/officers, acted together to carry out the improper and illegal\n       actions and therefore are jointly and severally liable for civil conspiracy in\n       carrying out their wrongful activities.\n\n\n                                       Page 27\n\f       Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, p. 5, ¶ 6.10 (CR 304). The Petition also\n\nincluded allegations against all of the Defendants in each of Plaintiff’s causes of\n\naction.   See, e.g., Id., p. 10 (“Defendant’s intentionally interfered with Dr.\n\nMontoya’s longstanding and continuous relationships with patients and referring\n\nphysicians from the emergency room/department in a concerted effort to restrain\n\ncompetition and monopolize the practice of nephrology            . . . in the relevant\n\nmarket.”) Id., p. 10, , ¶ 7.1 (CR 309).           Similar conduct was alleged against\n\nSACMC for each of Plaintiff’s causes of action against it. As there were only ever\n\ntwo Defendants in the lawsuit, Dr. Montoya’s allegations against the plural\n\n“Defendants” plainly included SACMC. SACMS’s suggestion that there were no\n\n“direct . . . liability” claims against it is simply false.\n\n       The causes of action against SACMC are all separate and independent of Dr.\n\nBrewer. For example, with regard to Dr. Montoya’s group boycott claim and\n\nclaims for monopolization and attempted monopolization, Dr. Montoya has alleged\n\nthat SACMC, Dr. Brewer, Dr. Brewer’s group of hospitalists (who will be named\n\nonce Defendants have responded to Dr. Montoya’s discovery), and West Texas\n\nMedical Associates conspired to monopolize the relevant markets defined in Dr.\n\nMontoya’s pleadings, and to keep Dr. Montoya from competing in those markets\n\nby a group boycott. See Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, paragraphs 12-12.8\n\n(CR 313-314) and 13-13.4 (CR 315-317). It is obvious that each member of a\n\n\n                                           Page 28\n\fconspiracy is liable for their participation in the conspiracy. A conspirator need\n\nnot have the same motives as the other conspirators, and need not be at the same\n\nmarket level of the other conspirators to be a participant in a conspiracy that is\n\nillegal under the Texas antitrust laws. See, e.g., Spectators' Communication\n\nNetwork Inc. v. Colonial Country Club, 253 F.3d 215, 220-221 (5th Cir. 2001)\n\n(“Antitrust law has never required identical motives among conspirators, and even\n\nreluctant participants have been held liable for conspiracy. For acquiescence in an\n\nillegal scheme is as much a violation of the Sherman Act as the creation and\n\npromotion of one.”)\n\n\nH.    The Court Improperly Granted a Motion to Dismiss Which\n      Masquerades as a Grant of Summary Judgment\n\n\n      While styled as an order on a summary judgment motion, the court in fact\n\ngranted a Motion to Dismiss in favor of SACMC, as the court effectively ruled that\n\nDr. Montoya’s pleadings did not state a claim against SACMC. The mere fact that\n\nDr. Brewer was dismissed from the case does not mean that SACMC could not be\n\nliable for its own conduct or the conduct of its other agents besides Dr. Brewer.\n\nSACMC did not present any evidence in support of its summary judgment motion\n\nwhich showed that it had not engaged in any of the conduct which Dr. Montoya\n\nsued it for; SACMC instead relied solely on the fact that Dr. Brewer was dismissed\n\nfrom the case under a Texas procedural rule. This “evidence” was in fact no\n                                      Page 29\n\fevidence at all, and it resulted in the court in effect granting summary judgment to\n\nSACMC based on Dr. Montoya’s pleadings.\n\n\n      At the hearing on SACMC’s summary judgment motion, the court\n\nrepeatedly stressed its belief that Dr. Montoya was required to plead specific\n\nwrongful acts by an agent of SACMC in order to be able to maintain its lawsuit\n\nagainst SACMC. However, there is simply no rule in Texas holding that in order\n\nto plead a valid cause of action against a business entity, one must list specific\n\ntortious or wrongful actions which company representatives undertook on behalf of\n\nthe organization. Texas pleading precedent clearly allows a party suing a business\n\nentity to merely allege that the business entity itself did something wrongful. See,\n\ne.g., Bank One, Texas, N.A. v. Stewart, 967 S.W.2d 419, 430-31 (Tex.App.\n\nHouston [14 Dist.] 1998, pet. denied) (although no specific acts of company\n\nrepresentative were plead, court stated that “Although the allegations are broad,\n\nboth petitions raise a reasonable inference that Bank One and Weyerhaeuser\n\nparticipated in a conspiracy to defraud LRI by inducing Trendmaker to avoid\n\nliability on the Midland Note. [Plaintiff’s] pleading also gives fair notice of his\n\nclaim . . . “); Farlow v. Harris Methodist Fort Worth Hosp., 284 S.W.3d 903, 910\n\n(Tex.App. Fort Worth,2009) (“Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an\n\nemployer may be vicariously liable for the negligence of its agent or employee\n\nwho was acting within the scope of employment even though the employer did not\n\n                                      Page 30\n\fpersonally commit a wrong.”). Obviously, a corporate entity itself can commit a\n\nwrong. Companies are liable for their own actions or failures to act, and Texas\n\nallows companies to be sued directly for those acts. Transcontinental Gas Pipeline\n\nCorp. v. Texaco, Inc., 35 S.W.3d 658, 669 (Tex.App. Houston [1 Dist.] 2000, rev.\n\ndenied) (noting that “in usual business practice,” “companies are liable for their\n\nown acts.”)\n\n\n      For example, if one sues a construction company for failing to build a fence\n\nproperly, one does not have to name in the pleading the company employees who\n\nbuilt the inadequate fence. If one sues a grocery store for selling tainted meat, one\n\ndoes not have to name the individual butcher who packaged it. Such a rule would\n\nas a practical matter make most lawsuits impossible, as a plaintiff almost never\n\nknows at the pleading stage which employees or agents, if any, were involved in\n\nthe wrongful acts.    Because of this, every jurisdiction in the United States,\n\nincluding Texas, allows a company to be sued for the company’s own wrongful\n\nacts. So long as the lawsuit gives the company notice of what it is being sued for\n\nso that it can prepare a defense, the Texas pleading standards are satisfied. Dr.\n\nMontoya’s lawsuit against SACMC plainly satisfied the Texas notice pleading\n\nstandard, and the court’s decision to grant summary judgment to SACMC because\n\nno specific acts of SACMC’s agents were listed in the lawsuit after Dr. Brewer was\n\ndismissed was clear error.\n\n                                       Page 31\n\fI.     Dr. Montoya’s Petition Meets the Texas Notice Pleading Standard\n\n       As noted above, the court’s grant of summary judgment was actually a\n\ndismissal based on the pleadings. While the Defendants and the court persist in\n\ntheir belief that this case primarily involves defamatory statements, the central\n\nbasis of Dr. Montoya’s lawsuit is that the Defendants, along with WTMA and Dr.\n\nBrewer’s group of hospitalists, conspired to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals for\n\nnephrology patients. Dr. Montoya’s pleading is nearly identical to the plaintiff’s\n\npleading in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital System, 464 S.W.3d 686 (Tex.\n\n2015), a case in which the Supreme Court specifically held that that a physician\n\nhad stated valid claims against a hospital and its co-conspirators. Under Hermann\n\nMemorial, Dr. Montoya’s pleading is plainly sufficient under Texas law.\n\n     While the court need not look beyond Hermann Memorial, cases such as In re\n\nGarth, 214 S.W.3d 190, 192 (Tex.App. Beaumont, 2007) clearly show that Dr.\n\nMontoya’s pleadings for his conspiracy-based antitrust claims meet the Texas\n\nnotice pleading standard. The court in Garth stated as follows:\n\n       At the time the trial court entered its order, Plaintiff's First Amended Petition\n       was the pleading before the court. Although very broad, the First Amended\n       Petition clearly alleges a conspiracy by the individual defendants, asserts\n       that they committed overt acts, and seeks punitive damages against them . . .\n       Because we construe [Plaintiff’s] pleadings in her favor, we hold that her\n       pleadings are sufficient to notify the individual defendants that she sought to\n       hold them liable for punitive damages through a conspiracy theory. . .\n\n\n\n\n                                        Page 32\n\fId. at 192. A similar result was reached in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst &\n\nYoung & Co., 10 S.W.3d 798, 809 (Tex.App. Dallas,2000), rev’d on other\n\ngrounds, 51 S.W.3d 573 (Tex.,2001). In that case, the court stated as follows:\n\n      Although rule 47(a) of the rules of civil procedure requires a pleading to\n      contain “a short statement of the cause of action sufficient to give fair notice\n      of the claim involved,” see tex.R. Civ. P. 47(a), this does not require that\n      each element of a claim be specifically alleged in a pleading. See Boyles v.\n      Kerr, 855 S.W.2d 593, 601 (Tex.1993) (op. on reh'g). Rather, it is sufficient\n      if the cause of action can be “reasonably inferred” from the pleading. See\n      Boyles, 855 S.W.2d at 601. In this case, Pacific's live pleading alleges that\n      Ernst & Young “conspired with, aided and abetted, associated with, and\n      assisted ... in the dissemination of false and misleading information or\n      omissions of material facts to prospective investors in First Republic backed\n      securities.” The petition also alleged that Ernst & Young's participation in\n      the fraud enabled First Republic to make misrepresentations to the public\n      after the merger. We have reviewed this language and, after doing so, we\n      conclude that (1) a claim for conspiracy or “aiding and abetting” may be\n      reasonably inferred from this language, and (2) the language was therefore\n      sufficient to support a conspiracy or “aiding and abetting” claim.\n\nPacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst & Young & Co., 10 S.W.3d 798, 809 (Tex.App.\n\nDallas,2000), rev’d on other grounds, 51 S.W.3d 573 (Tex. 2001). Importantly,\n\nthe court in Pacific Mutual held that the pleading was sufficient even though it\n\nonly named the corporate defendant as the conspirator, and did not name any\n\ncorporate agents who had participated in the conspiracy. The same result was\n\nreached in State v. Ford Motor Co., 169 S.W.2d 504, 513-14 (Tex.Civ.App. 1943),\n\nwhere the court stated as follows:\n\n\n      In any event, the pleader was not required to plead the exact agreement and\n      by whom made with respect to the unlawful combination or conspiracy\n\n                                       Page 33\n\f      plead. It is only the facts constituting the cause of action for conspiracy,\n      particularly the acts which constitute the grounds or gravamen of the action,\n      that must be alleged with certainty and particularity. This the petition did. . .\n      We are therefore of the view that the general allegation that a trust,\n      combination, or conspiracy was entered into by Ford and its dealers, together\n      with the allegations of specific instances whereby Ford and its dealers\n      operated so as to limit the territory in which a dealer could resell\n      automobiles and parts purchased from Ford . . . fully comply with the rule\n      that in alleging a combination or conspiracy the facts constituting the\n      conspiracy, or from which it may be inferred, should be clearly and\n      concisely set out. . . [A]s a rule great latitude is allowed in setting out in the\n      petition the particular acts from which the conspiracy may be inferred.\n\n      State v. Ford Motor Co., 169 S.W.2d 504, 513-14 (Tex.Civ.App. 1943).\n\nAgain, it is important to note that the court in Ford Motor held that merely naming\n\nthe corporate entity, Ford, as a conspirator was sufficient to state a valid claim\n\nunder the Texas notice pleading standard. The same result was reached in Bank\n\nOne, Texas, N.A. v. Stewart, 967 S.W.2d 419, 430-31 (Tex.App. Houston [14 Dist.\n\n1998) (“Although the allegations are broad, both petitions raise a reasonable\n\ninference that Bank One and Weyerhaeuser participated in a conspiracy to defraud\n\nLRI by inducing Trendmaker to avoid liability on the Midland Note.”). In Stewart,\n\nas in the other cases cited above, the court held that the plaintiff had pleaded a\n\nvalid conspiracy claim where it alleged that the corporate defendants themselves\n\nhad participated in the conspiracy.\n\n      If the court had actually applied Rule 91a, the court would apply the fair\n\nnotice pleading standard applicable in Texas to determine whether the allegations\n\nof the petition are sufficient to allege a cause of action. Wooley v. Schaffer, 447\n\n                                       Page 34\n\fS.W.3d 71, 76 (Tex.App. Houston [14 Dist.] 2014), citing Roark v. Allen, 633\n\nS.W.2d 804, 810 (Tex .1982) (“A petition is sufficient if it gives fair and adequate\n\nnotice of the facts upon which the pleader bases his claim.”); see also Bart Turner\n\n& Assocs. v. Krenke, No. 3:13–CV–2921–L, 2014 WL 1315896, at *5 (N.D.Tex.\n\nMar. 31, 2014) (applying Texas's fair notice pleading standard to determine\n\nwhether to grant motion to dismiss under Rule 91a). In conducting its review, the\n\ncourt must construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff, look to the\n\npleader's intent, and accept as true the factual allegations in the pleadings to\n\ndetermine if the cause of action has a basis in law or fact. Id. at 76. Although\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 47(a) requires “a short statement of the cause of\n\naction sufficient to give fair notice of the claim involved,” it does not require that\n\neach element of the claim be specifically alleged in a pleading. See Pac. Mut. Life\n\nIns. v. Ernst & Young, 10 S.W.3d 798, 809 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2000, no pet.) (citing\n\nBoyles v. Kerr, 855 S.W.2d 593, 601 (Tex.1993)). If a cause of action can be\n\n“reasonably inferred” from the pleading, the pleading is sufficient. Pac. Mut., 10\n\nS.W.3d at 809. Dr. Montoya’s Petition plainly meets this standard.\n\n      While the court’s decision to grant summary judgment to SACMC cannot\n\nwithstand review under the Texas notice pleading standard, the court’s decision\n\nwas particularly wrong in light of Dr. Montoyas’ antitrust claims, which allege a\n\nconspiracy to monopolize the relevant market and a group boycott (i.e., a type of\n\n\n                                       Page 35\n\fanticompetitive conspiracy) against Dr. Montoya by SACMC, Dr. Brewer, Dr.\n\nBrewer’s group of hospitalists, and WTMA. Because of the secretive nature of\n\nconspiracies, courts allow plaintiffs to show conspiracy by circumstantial rather\n\nthan direct evidence. Kirby v. Cruce, 688 S.W.2d 161, 164 (Tex.App.—Dallas\n\n1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The agreement need not be formal, the understanding may\n\nbe tacit, and each conspirator need not know the details of the conspiracy. Id. at\n\n164; Bourland v. State of Texas, 528 S.W.2d 350, 354 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin\n\n1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Given the law on this subject, it makes no sense to grant a\n\nsummary judgment in favor of SACMC merely because Dr. Montoya has not\n\npleaded in detail exactly which representatives of SACMC entered into the\n\nconspiracy, whom they had conversations and agreements with, and so forth. It is\n\nridiculous to make Dr. Montoya plead such facts before even undertaking\n\ndiscovery in this matter.1              A conspiracy never needs to be proven with direct\n\nevidence if there is sufficient circumstantial evidence, but in dismissing SACMC\n\nbecause Dr. Montoya’s pleadings did not show a specific conspiratorial action by\n\nan agent of SACMC, the court effectively required Dr. Montoya to provide direct\n\nevidence of the antitrust conspiracy at the pleading stage. This holding is simply\n\nnot allowed under the Texas summary judgment rule, and would not even be\n\nallowed under Rule 91a motion to dismiss.\n1\n  Plaintiffs did send out Requests for Production and Interrogatories in this matter, but Defendants only tendered\nobjections and refused to provide a single substantive answer. Plaintiff was in the process of filing a Motion to\nCompel when the court granted SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n                                                    Page 36\n\fJ.    The Trial Court Erred When It Failed to Consider the Allegations in\n      Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition\n\n\n      Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition clearly brought claims against SACMC\n\ndirectly, and even under that pleading, a grant of summary judgment to SACMC\n\nwould have been erroneous. Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, however, made it\n\nclear beyond any doubt that SACMC was being sued for its own conduct, and not\n\nmerely for Dr. Brewer’s actions. The court thus erred when it failed to consider\n\nthe new allegations in Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition which was filed on May\n\n4, 2016, a week before the summary judgment hearing on May 11, 2016. This\n\nresulted in an erroneous grant of summary judgment to SACMC, as SACMC’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment was based on stale factual allegations which were\n\nsuperseded by the allegations in the Sixth Amended Petition.\n\n      SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment argued that because the court had\n\npreviously dismissed Dr. Brewer from the case, SACMC should also be dismissed\n\nbecause “Plaintiff alleges no direct or separate liability claims against SACMC\n\nabove and apart from the actions of its agent, Brewer.” SACMC’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment as a Matter of Law, p. 3 (hereafter “SACMC Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment”). SACMC based its argument on the statement in Plaintiffs’\n\nFourth Amended Petition that Brewer “was and is employed by and acting in\n\nfurtherance of the business of [SACMC] and its medical practices” and “at all\n\n\n                                     Page 37\n\ftimes acted for SACMC.” Id., p. 3. SACMC thus contended that “SACMC’s only\n\npotential liability sounds in the doctrine of respondeat superior.” Id.\n\n        While Dr. Montoya had no need to correct his previous pleading on this\n\nissue, as even the Fourth Amended Petition made it clear that Dr. Montoya sought\n\nto hold SACMC liable for its own conduct and not merely the conduct of Dr.\n\nBrewer2, Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amended Petition showed beyond doubt that SACMC is\n\nnot being sued only under a respondeat superior theory for Dr. Brewer’s actions.\n\nPlaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition thus includes the following statements:\n\n        Dr. Brewer is individually liable for his own illegal, improper acts and\n        omissions. At various times Dr. Brewer acted for himself, (SACMC) and/or\n        his group of hospitalists.\n\n        Each Defendant in this case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and\n        WTMA and Dr. Brewer’s group of hospitalists (eventual defendants)\n        are being sued for their individual roles and conduct in the\n        monopolization,       attempted    monopolization,      conspiracy     to\n        monopolize, and group boycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each\n        of these entities may have engaged in the illegal conduct through their\n        agents or representatives, they are being sued for their individual roles\n        and conduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of\n        liability due to actions by Dr. Brewer.\n\n        Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, p. 4, ¶ 6.6 and p. 14, ¶ 12.2 (CR 39).\n\nAfter this pleading was filed, the fact that SACMC was being sued for its own\n\nconduct became indisputable. The sole basis of SACMC’s Motion for Summary\n\n2\n  Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition repeatedly makes it clear that SACMC was being sued for its own conduct,\nand not merely for vicarious liability for statements made by Dr. Brewer. Paragraph 6.1 of Plaintiff’s Fourth\nAmended Petition, for example, clearly stated that “This case is for the anticompetitive actions of the Defendants\nposing a danger of monopolization or attempted monopolization of patient choice and causing patients to pay more\nfor medical care and injuring consumer patients.” Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition, p. 2, paragraph 6.2\n\n                                                    Page 38\n\fJudgment, that “SACMC’s only potential liability sounds in the doctrine of\n\nrespondeat superior,” did not exist even before the Sixth Amended Petition was\n\nfiled, and it certainly did not exist afterwards.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s opinion in Sosa v. Central Power & Light, 909 S.W.2d\n\n893, 895 (Tex. 1995) shows that the trial court erred when it failed to consider the\n\nallegations in Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amended Petition. In Sosa, the Court stated as\n\nfollows:\n\n      Because the Sosas timely filed their second amended original petition, it\n      superseded their first amended original petition containing the statements on\n      which the defendants based their motion for summary judgment. Contrary to\n      statements in live pleadings, those contained in superseded pleadings are not\n      conclusive and indisputable judicial admissions. Drake Ins. Co. v. King, 606\n      S.W.2d 812, 817 (Tex.1980). Therefore, the basis for the defendants' motion\n      no longer existed and summary judgment was improper.\n\n      Id. at 895. Sosa has recently been reaffirmed by cases such as Lee Homes of\n\nLimestone County, Inc. v. First National Bank, 2015 WL 5175469, at *2\n\n(Tex.App.-Waco 2015, no pet.). Sosa was also cited in Myers v. Southwest Bank,\n\n2014 WL 7009956, at *6 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2014, pet. denied).              Myers\n\nsummarized the facts and holding from Sosa as follows:\n\n\n      The defendants in Sosa attempted to meet their burden by arguing that the\n      plaintiffs' own pleadings established that the plaintiffs' claims were barred\n      by limitations. The plaintiffs then amended their petition to remove the\n      statements on which the defendants had relied in their motion. The\n      defendants' motion, which was based entirely on the plaintiffs pleading\n      themselves out of court, no longer had any basis. Summary judgment was\n      therefore improper.\n                                         Page 39\n\f      Id. at *6. The same is true in this case, as Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amended Petition\n\nmade it clear that the entire basis for SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment no\n\nlonger existed after that amended pleading was filed.         The court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to SACMC was therefore improper.\n\n\nWhat is EMTALA (The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act\nCause of Action)?\n\n\n      The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (hereinafter\n\nEMTALA) is Section 1867(a) of the Social Security Act, and is codified within the\n\nsection of the U.S. Code which governs the Medicare program. (42 USC 1395cc)\n\nThe Healthcare Financing Administration (hereinafter HCFA) is the federal agency\n\nthat governs Medicare payments and has the statutory authority to issue regulations\n\nconcerning the implementation of EMTALA. (HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-\n\n15)\n\n\n      EMTALA is a statute which governs when and how a patient must be (1)\n\nexamined and offered treatment or (2) transferred from one hospital to another\n\nwhen he is in an unstable medical condition (3) the list of doctors on staff that are\n\non call and the fair assignment of patients to doctors. 42 USC 1395cc(a)(1)(I)(iii),\n\nHCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page 40\n\f      But in this case it does not involve patient dumping but the refusal to follow\n\nthe mandatory call list of EMTALA to fairly distribute the paying nephrology\n\npatients under Medicare or private insurance.\n\n\nL. Maintaining the Call List Requirement\n\n\n      Medicare –participating hospitals must maintain a list of physicians who are\n\non call to provide emergency care to individuals presenting to the emergency\n\nroom. (42 USC 1395cc(a)(1)(I)(iii))\n\nUnder EMTALA the hospital and its officers are responsible for maintaining an\n\non-call roster for the emergency department. (42 USC 1395cc(a)(1)(I)(iii))\n\n\n      San Angelo Community Medical Center is a Medicare –participating\n\nhospital.\n\n\n\nM. All nephrology patients that go on to dialysis are covered under Medicare-\nthus are paying patients for the doctor and hospital\n\n      The avowed purpose of the statute is to prevent hospitals from rejecting\n\npatients, refusing to treat them, or transferring them to \"charity hospitals\" or\n\n\"county hospitals\" because they are unable to pay or are covered under the\n\nMedicare or Medicaid programs and to fairly distribute patients coming to the\n\nemergency room between physicians so the physician receives paying and non-\n\n\n                                      Page 41\n\fpaying patients. (42 USC 1395cc (a)(1)(I)(iii)), HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-\n\n15.\n\n\nThis is a key in this case, the patients coming to the emergency room for\nnephrology care are guaranteed to pay the doctor for services through Medicare.\n\nDr. Brewer wants the paying patients to go to the other nephrologist in the hospital\nowned group and to not have Dr. Montoya receive his fair share of patients. Dr.\nBrewer is paid by the other nephrologist for coverage.\n\nThe purpose of the call list is to allow all physicians to equally receive call and\npaying and non-paying patients.\n\nA brief to the Trial Court an EMTALA was provided after the Motion to Dismiss\n\nhearing (CR 185). This brief has even more details.\n\n\n      Wherefore the Plaintiffs based upon EMTALA request the Orders\n\ndismissing Dr. Brewer be reversed and the Summary Judgment be reversed.\n\n\nN. Summary Judgment in favor of SACMC\n\n      Despite Appellants valid claims under In Re Memorial Hermann and the\n\nlegal arguments and facts proven in the response to the Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment (Supp. CR ____) the trial court committed reversible error by granting\n\nthe Defendant SACMC Summary Judgment (CR 336). Thus this Court should\n\nreverse the granting of the Summary Judgment and render judgment for Appellants\n\ndenying the Summary Judgment.\n\n      Summary Judgment for the Defendant is only proper if, as a matter of law,\n                                        Page 42\n\fthe Plaintiff cannot succeed on any theory pled.

App. Corpus Christi 2006); and the summary termination of a\n\ncase when it clearly appears that only questions of law are involved and that there\n\nare no genuine issues of fact. (See Bliss v. NRG Industries, 162 S.W.3d 434 (Tex.\n\nApp. Dallas 2005); Martin v. Commercial Metals Co., 138 S.W.3d 619 (Tex. App.\n\nDallas 2004). The trial court erred in not finding genuine issue of fact and not\n\nfollowing the Texas Supreme Court in In Re Memorial Hermann and In Re Lipsky\n\nand City of Dallas.\n\n         The Appellant in the response to the Motion for Summary Judgment proved\n\nthe facts stated on pages 13-18 above through the factual affidavit attached to the\n\n\n                                         Page 43\n\fresponse for Summary Judgment (Supp. CR____).\n\n     The Defendant in their Motion for Summary Judgment did not disprove any\n\nelement of the Plaintiffs cause of actions of Dr. Montoya’s Sixth Amended\n\nPetition (CR 300). All the Defendant did was state unsworn statements that are\n\nnot facts and rely on the Order of Dismissal in favor of Dr. Brewer.            The\n\nDefendants did not attach any evidentiary affidavits to their Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment disputing the facts of the Plaintiff and the independent affidavit of Dr.\n\nHunt (Supp. CR ________) (Supp. CR_____).\n\n     Thus the Motion for Summary Judgment should be reversed and denied.\n\n     To succeed on a traditional Motion for Summary Judgment, the Defendant\n\nmust show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to\n\nSummary Judgment as a matter of law. Tex.R.Civ.P. 166a(c); Mann Frankfort\n\nStein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289, SW3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009); Nixon v.\n\nMr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 SW2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985). To meet this burden, the\n\nDefendant must conclusively prove all essential elements of its claim. MMP, Ltd.\n\nv. Jones, 710 SW2d 59, 60 (Tex. 1986). A matter is conclusively established if\n\nreasonable people could not differ on the conclusion to be drawn from the\n\nevidence. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 SW3d 802, 816 (Tex. 2005). If the\n\nDefendant establishes its right to summary judgment as a matter of law, the\n\nburden shifts to the Plaintiff to present evidence that raises a genuine issue of\n\n\n                                      Page 44\n\fmaterial fact. Boudreau v. Fed. Trust Bank, 115 SW3d 740, 743 (Tex. App.-\n\nDallas 2003, pet. Denied). In deciding whether to grant Defendant’s motion, the\n\ncourt must take as true all competent evidence favorable to the Plaintiff’s favor.\n\nLimestone Prods. Distrib., Inc. v. McNamara, 71 SW3d 308, 311 (Tex. 2002);\n\nRhone-Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 SW2d 217, 223 (Tex. 1999); Nixon, 690 SW2d\n\nat 548-49.\n\n      The Plaintiffs presented proof to deny the Summary Judgment in the factual\n\naffidavits of Dr. Montoya (Supp. CR ____) and Dr. Hunt (Supp. CR___).\n\n\n      No Summary Judgment evidence was presented by the Defendant SACMC.\n\nDr. Montoya’s response to the Motion for Summary Judgment objected to the\n\nMotion because there is no evidence attached to the Motion (Supp. CR______).\n\nThe statements in the body of the argument are heresay and Dr. Montoya requested\n\nthe Court to strike those statements as defective and not meeting the standard for\n\nSummary Judgment evidence. The statements in the argument are conclusory and\n\nwithout factual basis as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP\n\n166a(c)) (CR 208).\n\n      Dr. Montoya further objected to the argument because it did not meet the\n\nstandard set forth for an affidavit in the Texas Supreme Court Radio Station KSCS\n\nv. Jennings 750 S.W.2d 760 (Tex. 1988). The Supreme Court held that affidavit\n\nfor summary judgment failed to establish that it was based on personal knowledge\n                                     Page 45\n\fand was thus inadequate summary judgment proof. The argument in the Motion is\n\nnot a factual affidavit showing proof.\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya objected to the argument because it was not an affidavit which\n\nmust state facts and cannot merely recite legal conclusions. Brownlee v. Brownlee,\n\n655 S.W. 2d 111, 112 (Tex. 1984). In this case the argument does not meet the\n\nKSCS or Brownlee standards.\n\n\nO. SUMMARY-JUDGMENT EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY PLAINTIFF\n\n       To support the facts in this response, Dr. Montoya offered the following\n\nsummary-judgment evidence attached to this response and incorporates the\n\nevidence into this response by reference.\n\n\n      Exhibit 1: Certified copy of Pleading approved by the Texas Supreme Court\n\nas valid causes of action in In Re Memorial Hermann (Supp. CR ______).\n\n\n      Exhibit 2: Is the affidavit of Steve F. Montoya, Jr., M.D. one of the\n\nPlaintiffs. In the affidavit he states the facts and refutes the allegations for the\n\ndismissal under TRCP 91(a) and the Anti-Slapp allegations (Supp. CR_______).\n\n\n      Exhibit 3: Is the affidavit of Dr. Hunt that confirms the causes of actions\n\nand the facts of the Anti-Trust actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\n(Supp. CR_____).\n\n\n                                         Page 46\n\fP.    Defendant did not disprove plaintiff’s cause of action as a matter of law.\n      A defendant is entitled to summary judgment on a plaintiff’s cause of action\n\nif the defendant can disprove at least one element of the cause of action as a matter\n\nof law. Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. Grant, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2002); see Tello v.\n\nBank One, N.A., 218 S.W.3d 109, 113 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no\n\npet.). SACMC has not disproved any of Plaintiffs elements in their causes of\n\naction (CR 208).\n\n\n      The Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment by SACMC was nothing\n\nmore than a thinly vailed attempt to get around the untimely filing of the Motion to\n\nDismiss under 91(a) and the Anti-Slapp Motion Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§§27.001 et. seq.\n\n      The trial court erred in granting the Summary Judgment because Defendant\n\nSACMC did not show there was not genuine issue of material fact and/or\n\nPlaintiffs’ factual affidavits proved genuine issues of material facts.\n\n\n      The finding of the Court dismissing Dr. Brewer (CR 194 and 196) is not\n\ncontrolling to the causes of action brought against SACMC. The causes of action\n\nagainst SACMC cannot be controlled by the dismissal of Dr. Brewer without valid\n\nSummary Judgment evidence, which there is none.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Page 47\n\f      The Defendant SACMC does not even attach a single factual affidavit or any\n\naffidavit in support of their Summary Judgment (CR 208). The only thing relied\n\nupon is the Court prior Order of Dismissal of Dr. Brewer’s claims.\n\n\n      SACMC filed a Motion for Special Exceptions on August 14, 2015 (CR 17)\n\nand the court granted the Special Exceptions on December 3, 2015 (CR 75). The\n\nPlaintiffs Petition was amended to comply with the Court order. SACMC should\n\nhave filed a Motion to Dismiss when it filed the Special Exception. The Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment is a untimely Motion to Dismiss that has no evidence or\n\nproof attached (CR 208).\n\n\n      The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants\n\nConstitutional Rights to speak freely, associate freely and participate in\n\ngovernmental as permitted by law. These are the requirements to meet in filing a\n\nMotion under the Anti-Slapp Statute Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq.\n\nand as set out in Paulsen v. Yarrell 455 SW3d 192 (Tex.-App.-Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2014, no pet.) (quoting In Re Estate of Check 438 SW3d at 836).\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the\n\nTexas Anti-Slapp Statute Chapter 27 includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In\n\nRe Lipsky). The evidence of the Plaintiff in the Petitions and in his response\n\n\n\n\n                                      Page 48\n\faffidavits of Dr. Montoya and Dr. Hunt meets the In Re Lipsky standard (see CR\n\n300, 94, 177, 331and Supp. CR____ ).\n\n      The Defendant SACMC did not even join in Dr. Brewer’s Motion to\n\nDismiss under 91(a) or his Anti-Slapp motion (CR 76 and 119). All the actions\n\nSACMC were untimely.\n\nIssue 3\n\n1.    Pursuant to Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a)3(b) a Motion to Dismiss must be filed at\n\n      least 21 days before the Motion is heard. The original Motion to Dismiss\n\n      was filed on July 7, 2016 (CR 119). The hearing was set by the Court for\n\n      January 12, 2016 (CR 91-93). An amended Notice of Hearing was set on\n\n      January 29, 2016 (CR 183). The amended Notice of the Motion to Dismiss\n\n      was sent on January 13, 2016 (CR 184). This notice was less than the 21\n\n      days required by Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a)3(b). The amended Motion to Dismiss\n\n      was filed on January 7, 2016 (CR 119).       Dr. Montoya objected to the\n\n      Amended Motion of Dr. Brewer as not being allowed without restarting the\n\n      period.   The Court erred in allowing the Motion to Dismiss under\n\n      Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a) to be heard. Dr. Montoya objected to the hearing in his\n\n      Supplemental Response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 177). Tex.Civ.Proc.\n\n      91(a)5(d) require the hearing to be reset Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a)6. By filing the\n\n      Amended Motion Dr. Brewer waived the right to be heard.\n\n\n                                     Page 49\n\f2.    Pursuant to Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. a Motion to\n\n      Dismiss a legal action under this section must be filed not later than the 60 th\n\n      day after the date of service of the legal action Tex.Civ.Prac.Remedies Code\n\n      §27.003(b). Dr. Brewer was originally served on October 9, 2015 (Supp.\n\n      CR_____). Dr. Brewer filed his Motion to Dismiss under Tex.Civ.Prac. &\n\n      Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. on December 8, 2015 which was within the 60\n\n      days after the date of service. Dr. Brewer then filed an Amended Motion to\n\n      Dismiss on June 7, 2015 (CR 119) which is outside the sixty day\n\n      requirement of Tex.Civ.Prac.Remedies Code §27.003(b).             Dr. Montoya\n\n      objected to the untimely filed affidavits and Amended Motion (CR 177).\n\n      The Court should strike the affidavits as untimely filed and thus the Motion\n\n      should be denied as not meeting the first proving of In Re Lipsky.\n\n\n                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n\n      The Appellants showed in their response to the Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and the factual affidavits in the response to Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment that this Court should (1) reverse the granting of the Summary Judgment\n\nand (2) remand the case to the trial court for trial. The Appellants showed valid\n\ncauses of actions and facts and the this court should reverse the Orders of\n\nDismissal for Dr. Brewer and remand the case to the trial court for trial.\n\n\n                                       Page 50\n\f                                           Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                           Paul Craig Laird II Law Firm, PLLC.\n\n                                           /s/ Paul Craig Laird II\n                                           By: Paul Craig Laird II\n                                           SBOT #11795420\n                                           800 West Airport Freeway\n                                           Suite 800, LB 6015\n                                           Irving, Texas 75062\n                                           (972) 554-0929\n                                           (214) 260-4935 fax\n                                           pcl880@aim.com\n                                           ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANTS\n                      CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n      Based on a word count using Microsoft Word 2007, this Appellant’s Brief\ncontains 12,584 words excluding the portions of the brief excluded from the word\ncount under T.P.A.P.94(i)(l).\n                                           /s/ Paul Craig Laird II\n                                           Paul Craig Laird II\n                         CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n     I hereby certify that a true and correct copy of the above and foregoing\nAppellant’s Brief was served on the following by email on the 21st day of\nNovember, 2016.\n                                          /s/ Paul Craig Laird II\n                                          Paul Craig Laird II\n         Appellee Kirk Brewer, M.D. counsel of record:\n         Robert B.

This case should be conducted under Discovery Level Two until the Court enters a Level\n       Three Scheduling Order.\n\n2.     Plaintiff STEVE F. MONTOYA, JR., M.D. is an individual residing in Tom Green\n       County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Renal Care is a Texas Corporation with its principal\n       place of business in Tom Green County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Nephrology is a\n       Texas-Professional Association with its principal place of business in Tom Green County,\n       Texas.\n\n3.     Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center is a Delaware LLC that is registered\n       to do business in the State of Texas and has its principal place of business in San Angelo,\n       Tom Green· County, Texas. San Angelo Medical Center can be served by serving its\n       registered agent Corporation Service Company d/b/a CSC-Lawyers Incorporating Service\n       Company as its registered address, 211 E. 7ili Street, Suite 620, Austin, Texas 78701.\n\n       Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. is an individual whose principal place of business and\n       residence is in Tom Green County, Texas. Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. can be served\n       at his office at- San Angelo Medical Center at 3501 Knickerbocker Rd., San Angelo,\n       Texas 76904.\n\n4. :   Venue and Jurisdiction\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORI0Ilf18(JETIT10N                                        Page 1 of 13\n\f      Venue is proper in Tom Green County under Tex.Civ.Prac. & Remedies Code Section\n      15.002(a) (1) as all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this legal\n      action occurred in Tom Green County, Texas.\n\n5.    Dr. Montoya, West Texas Renal Care and West Texas Nephrology, PA have incurred and\n      sues for damages in the maximum amount of $ 6,400,000.00 plus three times for\n      exemplary damages plus attorneys and costs as allowed by law and jurisdiction is proper\n      in this Court.\n\n6.1   Dr. Steve F. Montoya has practiced as a nephrologist since 1979 in San Angelo, Texas.\n      Dr. Montoya has practiced at San Angelo Community Hospital since 1981. Dr. Montoya\n      in developing, building and keeping his practice has always taken patients as an on-call\n      staff attending physician from the emergency room/department of San Angelo\n      Community Medical Center.\n\n6.2   In developing and building a practice Dr. Montoya as a nephrologist wanted long term\n      kidney dialysis patients to treat in his practice.        Referral from hospitals and area\n      physicians is extremely important to a nephrologist to building and keeping a practice.\n      The ability to obtain referrals from a hospital and area physicians is a primary source of\n      patients with kidney disease. This case is for the anticompetitive actions of the\n      Defendants posing a danger of monopolization or attempted monopolization of patient\n      choice and causing patients to pay more for medical care and injuring consumer patients.\n\n6.3   Besides word of mouth and patient to patient referral Dr. Montoya built his patient base\n      from referring physicians, from referrals of patients who came to the emergency\n      room/department and hospital patients with kidney disease. A patient who lives in the\n      service area/relevant market of San Angelo Community Medical Center and needs long\n      term care which can include dialysis is one of the primary ways Dr. Montoya and his\n      entities succeed. Dr. Montoya during his 36 year career in San Angelo built his practice\n      including a dialysis unit that can serve 24 patients per shift.\n\n6.4   The service area/relevant market for San Angelo Community Medical Center is Tom\n      Green County and contiguous counties.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGilf'SfETITION                                           Page2 of 13\n\f6.5   Dr. Brewer is an employee of an entity owned and created by San Angelo Community\n      Medical Center. Dr. Brewer is the chief of staff of the hospital and head of the hospitalist\n      group that practices at San Angelo Community Medical Center. Dr. Montoya has been\n      denied the referral of patients . that come into the emergency room with kidney\n      problems/illness/disease. These patients are being referred to the hospital owned group.\n      Even Dr. Montoya's current patients are being referred to hospitalist/hospital owned\n      group. The group owned by the hospital is costing the patient money because the patients\n      have to pay for a hospitalist and are then being referred to a different nephrologist whose\n      group has a contract/agreement with the hospital and its owned entities. The patients are\n      denied the opportunity to save money. The hospitalist group charges the patients at a\n      higher comprehensive rate/code.\n\n6.6   At all relevant times Dr. Kirk Brewer, as a principal officer of Community Medical\n      Associates and Chief of Staff of San Angelo Community Medical Center (SACMC) and\n      head of the hospitalist system at (SACMC) with agents/employees of (SACMC) working\n      under his control, direction, or in furtherance of unlawful and improper actions was and is\n      employed by and acting in furtherance of the business of (SACMC) and its owned\n      medical practice(s). Dr. Brewer is individually liable for his own illegal, improper acts\n      and omissions. Dr. Brewer at all times acted for (SACMC). Dr. Brewer is also liable for\n      the improper acts and omissions as Chief of Staff of (SACMC). Dr. Brewer, as well as\n      the other agents/employees of (SACMC) and/or its owned practices are liable under the\n      doctrine of respondeat superior and vicarious liability.\n\n6.7   The Defendants (SACMC) and Dr. Kirk Brewer, acting by and through its\n      agents/employees/principals/officers acted together to carry out the improper and illegal\n      actions and therefore are jointly and severally liable for civil conspiracy in carrying out\n      their wrongful activities.\n\n6.8   All conditions precedent to Plaintiffs recovery have been performed or have occurred.\n      Dr. Montoya is a hard working member of the San Angelo Medical Community. Dr.\n      Montoya came out of San Antonio, Texas and received a full scholarship for his\n      undergraduate degree at Rice University. After graduating Rice University Dr. Montoya\n      then went on to medical school at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIODftr2ETITI0N                                         Page 3 of 13\n\f       in Dallas, Texas. After Dr. Montoya finished his residency and training he went to in\n       west Texas. Dr. Montoya built a stellar reputation for quality patient care, excellence in\n       the practice of nephrology and dialysis care of the long term illness of kidney\n       failure/disease.\n\n6.9    Dr. Montoya is the only nephrologist in San Angelo that speaks Spanish. Dr. Montoya\n       cares about his patients, his fellow medical professionals, and his community.             Dr.\n       Montoya's practice has expanded over the years including with the referral from local\n       physicians, the emergency room/department and hospital consultation because of his\n       well-deserved reputation for quality patient care.\n\n6.10   Dr. Montoya's skill as a nephrologist was until the hospital created its own medical\n       practice, a marketing asset for SACMC. Dr. Montoya received his rotating share of\n       referrals of patients with kidney disease/illness/failure until SACMC created its own\n       practice groups.\n\n6.11   The recommendation and referral through the emergency room/department directly\n       affects the patient's choice of doctor. The doctor in turn decides the patient's course of\n       treatment and what and how the patient is coded for billing on treatment.\n\n6.12   The choice of doctor directly affects the patient's costs and expenses both in the short\n       term and for long term care of kidney disease/illness/failure. Individuals with kidney\n       disease can require care for the rest of their life which may include dialysis.\n\n6.13   Improperly manipulating the doctor a patient receives care from creates a cost to the\n       patient and improperly distorts free and informed patient choice and options for medical\n       care.\n\n6.14   The correct and appropriate way for any health care provider of emergency hospital\n       services and nephrology service is to provide the highest quality of care to the patient.\n       Patients deserve to have lower costs. The illegal and unjust way of treating patients is to\n       manipulate their free choice in the market place. In this case it is to only refer a patient to\n       a hospitalist, in a group owned by the hospital, and to them only refer a patient to a\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED OR1Gllf~3ETITI0N                                              Page4 of 13\n\f       nephrologist in a hospital owned group and to malign and smear a highly qualified\n       nephrologist in the practice at the same hospital.\n\n6.15   The Defendants decided to then have a covert whisper campaign and not refer any\n       patients to Dr. Montoya.\n\n6.16   The Defendants illegal and anti-competitive acts unfairly and wrongfully have cast Dr.\n       Montoya's stellar reputation under a dark cloud. Also the patients of Dr. Montoya have\n       been refused the services of Dr. Montoya when the patient is in the hospital. The patients\n       are suffering in paying higher costs and expenses for their care.\n\n6.17   Dr. Montoya was brought up on charges of incompetent patient care for misspelled words\n       on a chart. These actions were just taken to discredit Dr. Montoya and his ability to\n       practice medicine in San Angelo and at San Angelo Community Medical Center. None\n       of the actions of the hospital were based on patient care but for retaliation after Dr.\n       Montoya complained about the Defendants anticompetitive actions. The actions also\n       were to hurt the reputation of Dr. Montoya in advanced abilities in nephrology. Dr.\n       Montoya corrected the \"misspelled words\" and harsh undeserved review of his charts\n       continued. Despite the efforts of Defendants the railroading of Dr. Montoya was not\n       successful.\n\n6.18   The actions of the Defendants have a tendency to reduce or eliminate competition that is\n       not offset by any countervailing procompetitive justification.\n\n       Causes of Action\n\n       The causes of action are only under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n7.     Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations\n\n7.1    The actions of the Defendants are tortiously interfering with patient choice and care. The\n       actions are being taken by the Defendants to keep the Plaintiff from having a successful\n       nephrology practice. Defendant's actions are such that they know that their interference\n       will cause the Plaintiff damage in excess of the minimum judicial limits of the Court.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGilf'84ETITION                                           Page 5 of 13\n\f      Defendants intentionally interfered with Dr. Montoya's longstanding and continuous\n      relationships with patients and referring physicians from the emergency room/department\n      in a concerted effort to restrain completion and monopolize the practice of nephrology\n      and the treatment of long term kidney disease in the relevant market described in this\n      petition.\n\n7.2   Every contract, combination or competition of the relevant defendants in restraint of trade\n      or commerce is unlawful and is just as it is unlawful for any person to monopolize,\n      attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\n\n7.3   The Plaintiff pleads a reduction of competition in the relevant market in general to\n      patients. A monopoly in this case is caused by the elimination of Dr. Montoya and is just\n      as harmful as it would be if driving out competition in large groups. Removal of Dr.\n      Montoya from the hospital and its relevant market will adversely affect and unreasonably\n      affect overall competitive conditions and cost patients money. The Defendants through\n      their actions are possessing or trying to possess monopoly power in the relevant market\n      and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power is distinguished from growth\n      through business acumen.\n\n7.4   The Defendants are engaging anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to\n      monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power and the\n      defendants' ability to lessen or destroy completion in the relevant market and cost\n      patients money.\n\n7.5   Patients are damaged by the actions of the Defendants by higher cost of care.\n\n      Patients have an absolute right under the patients Bill of Rights attached as Exhibit D to\n      \"Participate in decisions about your care, including developing your treatment plan,\n      discharge planning and having your family and personal physician promptly notified of\n      your admission. Select providers of goods and services to be received after discharge.\"\n      The Plaintiffs did not follow the Bill of· Rights and violated the patient choice and\n      damaged the Defendants in violating the Bill of Rights.\n\n7.6   The actions of the Defendants are illegal and anticompetitive.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGDf465ETITION                                           Page 6 of 13\n\f7. 7   San Angelo Community Medical Center created its own group of doctors owned by the\n       hospital in both hospitalist groups and in a group named Community Medical Associates.\n       These groups came into existence on or about 2006. Until these groups Dr. Montoya\n       received his share of new patients from the hospital and emergency room. After these\n       groups were formed Dr. Montoya received only one referral since 2007.\n\n       Facts for Cause of Action\n\n7.8    Realleges all facts in paragraph 6 above.\n\n7.9    Dr. Montoya was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical\n       Center in 1981. Dr. Montoya has full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at\n       San Angelo Community Medical Center. The facts of the case are that Kirk Brewer,\n       M.D. was during his actions an officer and/or Chief of Staff of the medical staff of San\n       Angelo Community Medical Center. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was hired by San Angelo\n       Community Medical Center to run the hospitalist service. As an officer of the staff and\n       Chief of Staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. owed Dr. Montoya as a member of the staff a fiduciary\n       duty to not interfere by direct or indirect action with his practice of nephrology at San\n       Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n7.10   Kirk Brewer, M.D. came to San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2007. Part of Dr.\n       Montoya and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a rotating\n       system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital and\n       emergency room.      When you are the named specialist you receive a call from the\n       emergency room physician that a doctor with your specialty is needed for a patient. A\n       big part of Dr. Montoya's practice was obtaining new patients and treating existing\n       patients that came to the emergency room and needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 Dr.\n       Montoya has obtained new patients from the emergency room.\n\n7.11   Until 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month\n       to treat either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n       Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or a\n       hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new\n       patient or existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGDfflgETITION                                         Page 7 of 13\n\f7.12   The one time for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 Dr. Montoya\n       was called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on\n       duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n       informed Dr. Montoya that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure.                 Dr.\n       Montoya was informed his name was on the call board in the emergency room as\n       nephrologist on call. Both of the above doctors asked Dr. Montoya to consult concerning\n       treatment for that patient. Dr. Montoya gave an initial consult advice/orders of treatment\n       to both doctors. This consultation call was to Dr. Montoya at 9:38 p.m. Dr. Montoya\n       informed them he would come see the patient and then review the test results and\n       determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as Exhibit A is a true and\n       correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n\n\n7.13   On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of the\n                                                                                               I\n       patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started.

Dr. Montoya went to the call board! and\n       witnessed his name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014. !The\n       San Angelo Community Medical Center is required to have an official EMT!LA\n       Medicare call list for on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical C nter\n                                                                                               I\n       to take Medicare patients.

MONTOYA, JR., M.D., West Texas Renal Care and West Texas\nNephrology file this Sixth Amended Original Petition and would show:\n\n1.     This case should be conducted under Discovery Level Two until the Court enters a Level\n       Three Scheduling Order.\n\n2.     Plaintiff STEVE F. MONTOYA, JR., M.D. is an individual residing in Tom Green\n       County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Renal Care is a Texas Corporation with its principal\n       place of business in Tom Green County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Nephrology is a\n       Texas Professional Association with its principal place of business in Tom Green County,\n       Texas.\n\n3.     Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center (SACMC) is a Delaware LLC that is\n       registered to do business in the State of Texas and has its principal place of business in\n       San Angelo, Tom Green County, Texas. San Angelo Medical Center can be served by\n       serving its registered agent Corporation Service Company d/b/a CSC-Lawyers\n       Incorporating Service Company as its registered address, 211 E. 7th Street, Suite 620,\n       Austin, Texas 78701.\n\n       Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. is an individual whose principal place of business and\n       residence is in Tom Green County, Texas. Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. can be served\n       at his office at San Angelo Medical Center at 3501 Knickerbocker Rd., San Angelo,\n       Texas 76904.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGINAL PEmION                                           Page 1 of25\n\n                                                JQQ\n\f      Other participants in the anticompetitive conspiracy against Plaintiffs include Dr.\n      Brewer's group of hospitalists (exact name unknown), West Texas Medical Associates\n      (\"WTMA\") and groups affiliated with the hospital. These entities and individuals are not\n      defendants at this time.\n\n4.    Venue and Jurisdiction\n      Venue is proper in Tom Green County under Tex.Civ.Prac. & Remedies Code Section\n      15.002(a) (1) as all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this legal\n      action occurred in Tom Green County, Texas.\n\n5.    Dr. Montoya, West Texas Renal Care and West Texas Nephrology, PA have incurred and\n      sues for damages in the maximum amount of$ 6,400,000.00 plus three times exemplary\n      damages plus attorneys' fees and costs as allowed by law. Until 2007 Dr. Montoya\n      would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat either new or\n      existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since 2008 Dr.\n      Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n      consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new or existing\n      patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused\n      substantial injury to Dr. Montoya and damaged his ability to compete, because he\n      depended on these referrals and consults to build his practice. A majority of patients who\n      need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney disease in a hospital later need continuing care\n      for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such continuing treatments is\n      kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need treatment for average of 6\n      years, and each such patient would mean revenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of\n      approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya estimates that he has lost at least 100\n      long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the present due to the Defendants'\n      anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient referrals or consults. He estimates\n      that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $3,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of\n      time.\n\n6.1   Dr. Steve F. Montoya has practiced as a nephrologist since 1979 in San Angelo, Texas.\n      Dr. Montoya has practiced at San Angelo Community Hospital since 1981. Dr. Montoya\n      in developing, building and keeping bis practice, has always taken patients as an on-call\n\n                                                                                        Page 2 of25\n PLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGI8~1PETITION\n\f      staff attending physician from the emergency room/department of San Angelo\n      Community Medical Center.\n\n6.2   In developing and building a practice Dr. Montoya as a nephrologist wanted long tenn\n      kidney dialysis patients to treat in his practice.     Referral from hospitals and area\n      physicians is extremely important to a nephrologist to building and keeping a practice.\n      The ability to obtain referrals from a hospital and area physicians is a primary source of\n      patients with kidney disease. Defendants in this case conspired to deprive Plaintiffs of\n      referrals needed for his nephrology practice. This case is for the anticompetitive actions\n      of the Defendants posing a danger of monopoliz.ation or attempted monopoliz.ation of\n      patient choice and causing patients to pay more for medical care and injuring consumer\n      patients.\n\n6.3   Besides word of mouth and patient to patient referral Dr. Montoya built his patient base\n      from referring physicians, from referrals of patients who came to the emergency\n      room/department and hospital patients with kidney disease. Dr. Montoya,s practice\n      depends on finding a patient who lives in the service area/relevant market of San Angelo\n      Community Medical Center and needs long tenn care which can include dialysis.\n      Dialysis care is one of the primary ways Dr. Montoya and his entities succeed. Dr.\n      Montoya during his 36 year career in San Angelo built his practice including a dialysis\n      unit that can serve 24 patients per shift.\n\n6.4   The service area/relevant market for San Angelo Community Medical Center is Tom\n      Green County and contiguous counties. The service area/relevant geographic market, for\n      the purposes of all of Plaintiff's claims for antitrust violations and other anticompetitive\n      conduct, is Tom Green County and contiguous counties. Patients needing emergency\n      care for kidney ailments are not likely to travel far from their homes for such treatment,\n      so the relevant geographic market for hospital nephrology services and for nephrology\n      consults and referrals is therefore Tom Green County and contiguous counties. Patients\n      needing longer term nephrology services, such as kidney. dialysis, often need repeated\n      and frequent care from a doctor or dialysis clinic near their home or residence. Such care\n      is often required multiple times per week. Because patients are not likely to travel far for\n      such repeated and frequent doctor and clinic visits, doctors and clinics located far from\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN3'cf2TITION                                          Page 3 of25\n\f      Tom Green County are not a substitute for nephrology services in the Tom Green County\n      area, and the relevant geographic market is therefore Tom Green County and contiguous\n      counties. Patients needing emergency care for kidney ailments are also not likely to\n      travel far from their homes for such treatment, so the relevant geographic market for\n      hospital nephrology services and for nephrology consults and referrals is therefore Tom\n      Green County and contiguous counties.\n6.5   Dr. Brewer is thought be an employee and/or owner of a group of hospitalists affiliated\n      with, and possibly created by, SACMC. Dr. Brewer is the chief of staff of the hospital\n      and head of the hospitalist group that practices at San Angelo Community Medical\n      Center.   Dr. Montoya has been denied the referral of patients that come into the\n      emergency room with kidney problems/illness/disease. These patients are being referred\n      to the hospital affiliated group. Even Dr. Montoya's current patients are being referred to\n      the hospitalist/hospital affiliated group. The group affiliated with the hospital is costing\n      the patient money because the patients have to pay for a hospitalist and are then being\n      referred to a different nephrologist whose group has a contract/agreement with the\n      hospital and its affiliated entities. The patients are denied the opportunity to save money.\n      The hospitalist group charges the patients at a higher comprehensive rate/code.\n\n6.6   At all relevant times Dr. Kirk Brewer, himself, as a principal officer of Community\n      Medical Associates, San Angelo Community Medical Center and Chief of Staff of San\n      Angelo Community Medical Center (SACMC) and head of the hospitalist system at\n      (SACMC) with agents/employees of (SACMC) working under his control, direction, or\n      in furtherance of unlawful and improper actions was and is employed by and acting in\n      furtherance of the business of (SACMC) and its affiliated medical practice(s). Dr.\n      Brewer is individually liable for his own illegal, improper acts and omissions. At various\n      times Dr. Brewer acted for himself, (SACMC) and/or his group of hospitalists. Dr.\n      Brewer is also liable for the improper acts and omissions as Chief of Staff of (SACMC).\n      Dr. Brewer, as well as the other agents/employees of (SACMC) and/or its affiliated\n      practices are liable under the doctrine ofrespondeat superior and vicarious liability.\n\n6.7   The Defendants (SACMC) and Dr. Kirk Brewer, along with WTMA and Dr. Brewers\n      group of hospitalists acting by and through its agents/employees/principals/officers acted\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~jTITION                                             Page4 of25\n\f       together to carry out the improper and illegal actions and therefore are jointly and\n       severally liable for civil conspiracy in carrying out their wrongful activities.\n\n6.8    All conditions precedent to Plaintiffs recovery have been performed or have occurred.\n       Dr. Montoya is a hard working member of the San Angelo Medical Community. Dr.\n       Montoya came out of San Antonio, Texas and received a full scholarship for his\n       undergraduate degree at Rice University. After graduating Rice University Dr. Montoya\n       then went on to medical school at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School\n       in Dallas, Texas. After Dr. Montoya finished his residency and training he went to in\n       west Texas. Dr. Montoya built a stellar reputation for quality patient care, excellence in\n       the practice of nephrology and dialysis care of the long term illness of kidney\n       failure/disease. Dr. Montoya's reputation in the medical community in the San Angelo\n       areaffom Green County allowed him to regularly obtain referrals for nephrology work\n       from the emergency room at SACMC, as well as consults for nephrology work from\n       other doctors at SACMC. These referrals and consults were and are necessary for Dr.\n       Montoya's continued presence as a competitor in the market for nephrology services in\n       the San Angelo/fom Green County area. Dr. Montoya relied on these consults and\n       referrals to build his nephrology practice, for once he had consulted on a patient, that\n       patient was likely to remain a patient of Dr. Montoya's if that patient needed continuing\n       kidney care such as dialysis.\n\n6.9    Dr. Montoya is the only nephrologist in San Angelo that speaks Spanish. Dr. Montoya\n       cares about his patients, his fellow medical professionals, and his community.             Dr.\n       Montoya's practice has expanded over the years including with the referral from local\n       physicians, the emergency room/department and hospital consultation because of his\n       well-deserved reputation for quality patient care. These referrals are necessary for Dr.\n       Brewer to compete.\n\n6.10   Dr. Montoya's skill as a nephrologist was, until the hospital created its affiliated medical\n       practice or entered into an exclusive contract with the group of hospitalists affiliated\n       and/or managed by Dr. Brewer, a marketing asset for SACMC. Dr. Montoya received his\n       rotating share of referrals of patients with kidney disease/illness/failure until SACMC\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~4TITION                                                  Page S of25\n\f       created its affiliated practice groups and/or entered into an exclusive contract with the\n       group ofhospitalists affiliated and/or managed by Dr. Brewer.\n\n6.11   The recommendation and referral through the emergency room/department directly\n       affects the patient's choice of doctor. The doctor in turn decides the patient's course of\n       treatment and what and how the patient is coded for billing on treatment.\n\n6.12   The choice of doctor directly affects the patient's costs and expenses both in the short\n       term and for long term care of kidney disease/illness/failure. Individuals with kidney\n       disease can require care for the rest of their life which may include dialysis.\n\n6.13   Improperly manipulating the doctor a patient receives care from creates a cost to the\n       patient and improperly distorts free and informed patient choice and options for medical\n       care.\n\n6.14   The correct and appropriate way for any health care provider of emergency hospital\n       services and nephrology service is to provide the highest quality of care to the patient.\n       Patients deserve to have lower costs. The illegal and unjust way of treating patients is to\n       manipulate their free choice in the market place. In this case the Defendants only\n       referred a patient to a hospitalist; in a group affiliated with the hospital, then only refer a\n       patient to a nephrologist in a hospital affiliated group. Defendants also maligned and\n       then smeared a highly qualified nephrologist in practice at the same hospital.\n\n6.15   Starting in 2008 Defendants decided to then have a covert whisper campaign and not\n       refer any patients to Dr. Montoya.\n\n6.16   The Defendants illegal and anti-competitive acts unfairly and wrongfully have cast Dr.\n       Montoya's stellar reputation under a dark cloud. Also the patients of Dr. Montoya have\n       been refused the services of Dr. Montoya when the patient is in the hospital. The patients\n       are suffering in paying higher costs and expenses for their care.\n\n6.17   Dr. Montoya was brought up on charges of incompetent patient care for misspelled words\n       on a chart. These actions were just taken to discredit Dr. Montoya and his ability to\n       practice medicine in San Angelo and at San Angelo Community Medical Center. None\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~STITION                                                 Page 6 of25\n\f         of the actions of the hospital were based on patient care but for retaliation after Dr.\n         Montoya complained about the Defendants anticompetitive actions. The actions also\n         were done to hurt the reputation of Dr. Montoya in advanced abilities in nephrology. Dr.\n         Montoya corrected the \"misspelled words\" and harsh undeserved review of his charts\n         continued. Despite the efforts of Defendants the railroading of Dr. Montoya was not\n         successful.\n\n6.18     The actions of the Defendants have a tendency to reduce or eliminate competition that is\n         not offset by any countervailing procompetitive justification.\n\n\n6.19     Dr. Montoya was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical\n         Center in 1981. Dr. Montoya has full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at\n         San Angelo Community Medical Center. The facts of the case are that Kirk Brewer,\n         M.D. was during his actions an officer and/or Chief of Staff of the medical staff of San\n         Angelo Community Medical Center. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was hired by San Angelo\n         Community Medical Center to run the hospitalist service. As an officer of the staff and\n         Chief of Staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. owed Dr. Montoya as a member of the staff a fiduciary\n         duty to not interfere by direct or indirect action with his practice of nephrology at San\n         Angelo Community Medical Center.\n6.20     Kirk Brewer, M.D. came to San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2007. Dr.\n         Montoya has long relied on obtaining patients is the fact hospital emergency room uses a\n         rotating system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital and\n         emergency room.      When you are the named specialist you receive a call from the\n         emergency room physician that a doctor with your specialty is needed for a patient. A\n         big part of Dr. Montoya's practice was obtaining new patients and treating existing\n         patients that came to the emergency room and needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 Dr.\n         Montoya has obtained new patients from the emergency room.\n\n\n6.21     The one timeDr.Montoya received a consult for a new patient is described below. On\n       January 24, 2014 Dr. Montoya was called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center\n       emergency room physician on duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the\n       emergency room physician informed Dr. Montoya that a patient was diagnosed with acute\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGINWSTITION                                                Page 7 of25\n\f   renal failure. Dr. Montoya was informed his name was on the call board in the emergency\n   room as nephrologist on call. Both of the above doctors asked Dr. Montoya to consult\n   concerning treatment for that patient Dr. Montoya gave initial consult advice/orders of\n   treatment to both doctors. This consultation call was to Dr. Montoya at 9:38 p.m. Dr.\n   Montoya informed them he would come see the patient and then review the test results and\n   determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as Exhibit A is a true and\n   correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n   Until 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to\n   treat either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new patient or existing\n   patient that suffered with kidney problems. The lack of referrals caused substantial injury to\n   Dr. Montoya and damaged his ability to compete, because he depended on these referrals\n   and consults to build his business. Many patients who need kidney treatment in a hospital\n   later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such\n   continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need\n   treatment for four to eight years, and each such patient would mean revenue to Dr.\n   Montoya's practice of approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya estimates that he has\n   lost 10-12 long term kidney dialysis patients.per year from 2008 to the present due to the\n   Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient referrals or consults. He\n   estimates that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $3,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that\n   period of time. All referrals now go to the nephrologist at an affiliated group of the hospital.\n   This damage estimate is specifically incorporated by reference into all of Plaintiffs causes\n   of action set forth infra.\n\n\n6.22     On January 25, 2014 at 8: 10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of the\n   patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the patient or the\n   chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled Dr. Montoya's consult and treatment by Dr. Montoya\n   and consulted another nephrologist. Dr. Montoya went to the call board and witnessed his\n       name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014. The San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center is required to have an official EMTALA Medicare call list for\n   on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical Center to take Medicare patients.\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGINWtTITION                                               Page 8 of25\n\f   This is the list my name was on and was intentionally ignored. This also violates a patient's\n   right to choose their physician. This list was followed until Dr. Brewer came to San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brough~ in\n   for consult is one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services.\n   Dr. Brewer did not see the patient when he removed me as the treating nephrologist he\n   issued the change via a telephone order (see Exhibit B). Kirk Brewer, M.D. without seeing\n   the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change ofnephrologist was for Kirk\n   Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused Dr. Montoya economic loss. Attached as Exhibit\n   Bis a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts on January 25,\n   2014.\n   Kirk Brewer, M.D. by his actions of removing Dr. Montoya as the nephrologist published a\n   statement that Dr. Montoya was not a competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the\n   San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was aware\n   that his actions would become known to the staff physicians of San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center and that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign saying Dr. Montoya\n       should not be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. These\n       remarks caused hospitalists and other doctors at SACMC, as well as doctors and nurses in\n       the SACMC emergency department, to cease and refuse to (a) admit patients to the care of\n       Dr. Montoya, and (b) refer patients to Dr. Montoya for nephrology consults.\n\n\n6.23      Attached to this petition as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n       existing patient of Dr. Montoya, Mrs. Welch tried to see Dr. Montoya in the emergency\n       room of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not\n       call Dr. Montoya to treat his existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and Dr.\n       Montoya has treated her for at least 20 years.\n6.24      Another patient of Dr. Montoya, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also\n       over 90 years of age and has been a Dr. Montoya patient for at least 10 years requested Dr.\n       Montoya when she went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see Dr.\n       Montoya.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                                  Page 9 of25\n\f6.25      A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician. Both of the above\n       happened when Kirk Brewer, M.D. was President of the medical staff or an officer of the\n       medical staff and when he was head of the hospitalist service when the above happened.\n\n6.26      Again by the actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are\n       controlled by their supervisors or lead physicians Kirk Brewer, M.D. through this actions\n       defamed Dr. Montoya as a qualified physician or staff at San Angelo Community Medical\n       Center.\n\n6.27      Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary damages from the Defendant, because they\n       acted with malice required to support an award of exemplary damages. Defendants have\n       acted with a specific intent to cause injury to the Plaintiff.\n\n6.28      Plaintiff sues under this cause of action for anticompetitive conduct and/or effect. The\n       Plaintiff sues for damages that are within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n          Causes of Action\n\n          The causes of action are only under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n7.        Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations\n\n7.1       The actions of the Defendants are tortiously interfering with patient choice and care. The\n          actions are being taken by the Defendants to keep the Plaintiff from having a successful\n          nephrology practice. Defendant's actions are such that they know that their interference\n          will cause the Plaintiff damage in excess of the minimum judicial limits of the Court.\n\n          Defendants intentionally interfered with Dr. Montoya's longstanding and continuous\n          relationships with patients and referring physicians from the emergency room/department\n          in a concerted effort to restrain completion and monopolize the practice of nephrology\n          and the treatment of long term kidney disease in the relevant market described in this\n          petition.\n\n7.2       Every contract, combination or competition of the relevant defendants in restraint of trade\n          or commerce is unlawful and is just as it is unlawful for any person to monopolize,\n          attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                                     Page 10 of25\n\f7.3   The Plaintiff pleads a reduction of competition in the relevant market in general to\n      patients. A monopoly in this case is caused by the elimination of Dr. Montoya and is just\n      as harmful as it would be if driving out competition in large groups. Removal of Dr.\n      Montoya from the hospital and its relevant market will adversely affect and unreasonably\n      affect overall competitive conditions and cost patients money. The Defendants through\n      their actions are possessing or trying to possess monopoly power in the relevant market\n      and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power is distinguished from growth\n      through business acumen.\n\n7.4   The Defendants are engaging in anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to\n      monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power and the\n      defendants' ability to lessen or destroy completion in the relevant market and cost\n      patients money.\n\n7.5   Patients are damaged by the actions of the Defendants by higher costs of care.\n\n      Patients have an absolute right under the patients Bill of Rights attached as Exhibit D to\n      \"Participate in decisions about your care, including developing your treatment plan,\n      discharge planning and having your family and personal physician promptly notified of\n      your admission. Select providers of goods and services to be received after discharge.\"\n      The Plaintiffs did not follow the Bill of Rights and violated the patient choice and\n      damaged the Defendants in violating the Bill of Rights.\n\n7.6   The actions of the Defendants are illegal and anticompetitive.\n\n7.7   San Angelo Community Medical Center created its affiliated group of doctors affiliated\n      with the hospital in both hospitalist groups and in a group named Community Medical\n      Associates. These groups came into existence on or about 2006. Before these groups\n      existed Dr. Montoya received his share of new patients from the hospital and emergency\n      room. After these groups were formed Dr. Montoya received only one referral since\n      2007.\n\n\n8.

The Plaintiff is entitled to and\n      sues for exemplary damages within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n      Plaintiff sues under this cause of action for anticompetitive conduct and/or effect.\n\n9.    Defamation Per Se\n\n9.1   The statements of the Defendants constitute defamation per se in that they suggest that\n      the Plaintiff is not a competent nephrologist and should not be referred patients.\n\n9.2   The Defendants have published the above statements on numerous occasions through a\n      whisper campaign and their conduct.\n\n9.3   The defamatory statements are false. Defendants have and are publishing the remarks to\n      individuals and entities to harm the Plaintiff and to remove all competition illegally in an\n      anti-competitive action.\n\n9.4   The statements and actions of the Defendants were published by their conduct. The\n      actions were referring to Dr. Montoya as a non-competent nephrologist.                  The\n      statement(s)/ actions were defamatory and caused Dr. Montoya economics loss.\n\n9.5   The total loss is between $3,000,000.00 and $6,500,000.00 from not receiving any\n      referrals from the emergency room or hospitalists. Until 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive\n      10-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat either new or existing patients at\n      the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received\n      one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist,\n      except for one time for treatment of a new or existing patient that suffered with kidney\n      disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused substantial injury to Dr. Montoya and\n      damaged his ability to compete, because he depended on these referrals and consults to\n      build his practice. A majority of patients who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney\n      disease in a hospital later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems; the\n      most common of such continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis\n      patient will need treatment for at least ten years, and each such patient would mean\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~PfTITION                                            Page 12 of25\n\f      revenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya\n      estimates that he has lost at least 100 long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the\n      present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient\n      referrals or consults. He estimates that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $3,000,000\n      to $6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n\n9.6   The defamatory statements are untrue.        Dr. Montoya is a competent and qualified\n      nephrologist to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n9.7   The actions of the Defendants were intentional or done with negligence when the\n      Defendants knew that the statement was false and his actions would lead a reasonable\n      prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory potential.\n\n9.8   All officers and President of the medical staff and the medical staff must follow the rules\n      at San Angelo Community Medical Center and staff of San Angelo Community Medical\n      Center and have a new patient in the emergency room or hospital that needs a specialist\n      consultation assigned to the name off the rotating consultation list. By the Defendants.\n      not following this procedure Dr. Montoya did not receive any consultation requests from\n      the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2008-\n      present and one in 2014.\n\n\n10.   Malice\n\n      By reference Plaintiff adopts and realleges the acts stated above as if they were set forth\n      herein. For further cause of action, Defendant's conduct amounts to malice under the\n      Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 41.007 and the common law of Texas because\n      Defendant's actions have and are involving an extreme degree of risk considering the\n      probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others.           Plaintiff is entitled to\n      exemplary damages and does hereby sue for them.\n\n11.   Business Disparagement\n\n      The Plaintiffs reallege the allegations and facts set forth above.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~P2TITI0N                                            Page 13 of25\n\f       The Defendants published disparaging comments and allegations about Dr. Montoya and\n       his practice. Defendants took the action(s) to harm the Plaintiff's business interests.\n       Defendants knew the disparagement was false and the actions were done with malice.\n\n12.    Restraint of trade      (Monopolization/Attempted Monopolization/ Conspiracy to\n       Monopolize)\n\n12.1   The Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations and facts set forth\n       above.\n\n12.2   Plaintiff makes claim under the Texas Business and Commerce Code Sections 15.0S(b)\n       and 15.21 known as the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act as it recognizes as illegal\n       improper attempts to abuse the patient referral of the emergency room/department and\n       hospital patients, as well as conspiracies to limit patient choices by concerted illegal\n       action as engaged by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs seek relief for this anticompetitive\n       action(s) solely under the laws established by the State of Texas concerning\n       anticompetitive misconduct affecting Texas citizens and patients. The Defendants (along\n       with WTMA and Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists) have monopolized and/or attempted\n       to monopolize the relevant markets of nephrology services and/or referrals and consults\n       for nephrology services by conspiring to deprive Plaintiffs of consults and referrals for\n       nephrology services. By conspiring against Dr. Montoya, the Defendants and unindicted\n       co-conspirators are attempting to remove him as a competitor to monopolize the markets\n       for themselves.\n\n12.3   In Tom Green County the Plaintiffs are in competition with the Defendants. Defendants\n       have derived or attempted to derive illegal benefit and patient choice and option for care\n       was improperly limited in Tom Green and contiguous counties. The area of service the\n       Defendants are trying to control is Tom Green and contiguous counties. The Defendants\n       are trying to restrain competition in these counties\n\n12.4   Defendants actions are in furtherance of the combination and conspiracy and with the\n       purpose and intent of excluding the Plaintiffs from the patient care market in the relevant\n       market described above and destroying competition from Dr. Montoya and causing a\n       resulting loss and cost to patients. These acts were done with the specific intent to harm\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                            Page 14 of25\n\f       both Dr. Montoya and patients in the relevant market.      These acts were done with the\n       specific intent to weaken or eliminate competition from the Plaintiffs and injure patients\n       and obtain market dominance in the relevant market.\n\n12.5   The actions also hurt the patient population in the relevant market by removing or trying\n       to remove completion in the practice of nephrology.\n\n12.6   The concerted actions of the Defendants were flagrant and willful and done for the\n       purpose of harming Dr. Montoya, the Plaintiffs and patients. Defendants illegally and\n       improperly diverted the patients to the hospital affiliated practice. Each Defendant in this\n       case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and WTMA and Dr. Brewer's group of hospitalists\n       (eventual defendants) are being sued for their individual roles and conduct in the\n       monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to monopolize, and group\n       boycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each of these entities may have engaged in the\n       illegal conduct through their agents or representatives, they are being sued for their\n       individual roles and conduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of\n       liability due to actions of Dr. Brewer.\n\n12.7   The acts of the Defendants constitute illegal monopolization, attempted monopolization\n       and /or conspiracy to monopolize under applicable Texas law. The Defendants have\n       monopolized or have a dangerous chance of monopolizing the relevant product markets\n       of nephrology services and referrals and consults for nephrology services. This case is\n       for the anticompetitive actions of the Defendants posing a danger of monopolization and\n       injuring consumer patients.        By restricting competition the Defendants are hurting\n       patients in the relevant market.\n\n12.8   Plaintiff sues under this cause of action for anticompetitive conduct and/or effect. While\n       the Defendants' monopolization and attempted monopolization has harmed Dr. Montoya\n       and his professional practice, it has also harmed consumers and others who pay for\n       nephrology services in the relevant market by increasing the costs of those services. This\n       is demonstrated by the chart attached hereto as Exhibit B. Before Dr. Brewer's group\n       of hospitalists became the attending physicians for all nephrology patients at SACMC,\n       nephrology patients would be referred to Dr. Montoya who would serve as the attending\n       physician for the patient. This arrangement avoided the \"middle man\" which now exists,\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~P4TITION                                            Page 15 of25\n\f       as the hospitalists now usually serve as an additional charging entity between the patient\n       and the nephrology specialist. Even if the hospitalists could do the same work as Dr.\n       Montoya or his partner used to provide, the patient still faces increased cost for the same\n       nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services than Dr.\n       Montoya charges. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare\n       allowable rate, which adds up to average charges of$506.85 per day. See Exhibit. E. Dr.\n       Mont~ya, however, charges at the \"Moderate,, Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to\n       an average cost of $346.13 per day. The difference between these charges is $160.72 per\n       nephrology patient per average hospital stay.            Over the course of a year,\n       consumers/payors for nephrology services have thus paid thousands more for the\n       hospitalists' physician and nephrology services than they would have paid for care from\n       Dr. Montoya who is a physician specialist in nephrology. This is a classic example of an\n       antitrust injury, i.e. an injury to competition which the antitrust laws were made to\n       prevent. This antitrust injury arises from the Defendants monopolization and attempted\n       monopolization of the relevant markets for (a) nephrology services in the San\n       Angelo/Tom Green County area, and {b) the market for referrals and consults for\n       nephrology services in the San Angelo/Tom Green County area.\n\n13.    Group Boycott and Conspiracy in Restraint of trade\n\n13.1   SACMC, Dr. Kirk Brewer, Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists, and West Texas Medical\nAssociates (\"WTMA\") entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in\nviolation of Section 15.0S(a) of the Texas Antitrust Act. See Tex.Bus. & Com. Code Ann.§\n15.0S(a). In furtherance of this conspiracy, the conspirators entered into an agreement by which\nall new nephrology patients entering the SACMC emergency room would be admitted to a\nhospitalist working in Dr. Brewer,s group ofhospitalists. The patients were admitted to these\nhospitalists even when they were already a patient of Dr. Montoya, and even if they specifically\nrequested Dr. Montoya to be their attending physician. The hospitals would then refer the\npatients to groups affiliated with the hospital. This combination deprived Dr. Montoya of patient\nreferrals he should have received for (a) new patients entering the hospital through the\nemergency room, and (b) nephrology consults for patients already in the hospital. By favoring\nhospitalists over Dr. Montoya, Dr. Brewer increased financial remuneration for himself because\nthese patients were being treated by hospitalists in his own group. Dr. Brewer and his group also\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                             Page 16 of25\n\fbenefited by referring the patients groups affiliated with the hospital for nephrology services,\nbecause Dr. Brewer and his hospitalist group receive payments from WTMA for providing\n\"coverage\" at the SACMC emergency room for nephrology patients. In return for these\npayments, Dr. Brewer and his hospitalists insure that all referrals and consults at SACMC for\nnephrology services are made to groups affiliated with the hospital such as WTMA.\n\n\n\n13.2   The combination between SACMC, Dr. Kirk Brewer, Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists,\nand WTMA constitutes a concerted refusal to deal with Dr. Montoya which is a per se violation\nof the Section 15.0S(a) of the Texas Antitrust Act. See Tex.Bus. & Com. Code Ann.§ 15.0S(a).\nIt would also violate the \"rule of reason\" as it unreasonably restrained trade and commerce in the\nrelevant market of nephrology services in the San Angelo area, as well as in the markets for\nreferrals and consults for nephrology services in the San Angelo area. This anticompetitive\nconspiracy decreased patient choice and raised the price of care for those needing nephrology\nservices. Each Defendant in this case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and WTMA and Dr.\nBrewer's group of hospitalists (eventual defendants) are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct in the monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to monopolize, and group\nboycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each of these entities may have engaged in the illegal\nconduct through their agents or representatives, they are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of liability.\n\n\n\n13.3   The conspiracy is a horizontal agreement in restraint of trade, as it involves a direct\ncompetitor of Dr. Montoya (WTMA, a group affiliated with SACMC) that employs a\nnephrologist for the provision of nephrology services in the San Angelo geographic market.\nSACMC (along with Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists) has a dominant position and\nmarket power in the market for nephrology services in the San Angelo area, and in the market for\nreferrals and consults for nephrology services in the San Angelo area. SACMC, Dr. Brewer and\nDr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists hold a dominant position in the relevant market, in that these\nentities control the referral of all nephrology patients from within the SACMC hospital and\nemergen~y room to specialists such as Dr. Montoya; these entities thus control access to an\nelement necessary to enable Dr. Montoya to compete. There are no pro-competitive effects from\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN3½P6TITION                                            Page 17 of25\n\fthis arrangement. The hospitalists and emergency room doctors at SACMC have agreed with\nSACMC, Dr. Brewer, and Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists to only refer patients to, and ask for\nconsults from, nephrology doctors in groups affiliated with the hospital who are \"approved\" by\nDr. Brewer because they make payments to Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists. This\ncourse of dealing increases the profits of Dr. Brewer, groups affiliated with the hospital and Dr.\nBrewer's group ofhospitalists at the expense of competitors such as Dr. Montoya and is not\nintended to enhance overall efficiency or to make markets more competitive. These allegations\nare sufficient to raise a per se violation claim.\n\n13.4   Each Defendant in this case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and WTMA and Dr.\nBrewer's group of hospitalists (eventual defendants) are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct in the monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to monopolize, and group\nboycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each of these entities may have engaged in the illegal\nconduct through their agents or representatives, they are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of liability.\n\n\n\n13.5    While the conspirators' concerted refusal to deal has harmed Dr. Montoya and his\nprofessional practice, it has also banned consumers and others who pay for nephrology services\nin the relevant market by increasing the costs of those services. This is demonstrated by the\nchart attached hereto as Exhibit E. Before Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists became the\nattending physicians for all nephrology patients at SACMC, nephrology patients would be\nreferred to Dr. Montoya who would serve as the attending physician for the patient. This\narrangement avoided the \"middle man\" which now exists, as the hospitalists now usually serve\nas an additional charging entity between the patient and the nephrology specialist. Even if the\nhospitalists could do the same work as Dr. Montoya or his partner used to provide, the patient\n(and/or insurance and taxpayer-funded Medicare/Medicaid) still faces increased cost for the\nsame nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services than Dr. Montoya\ncharges. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare allowable rate,\nwhich adds up to average charges of $506.85 per day. See Exhibit E. Dr. Montoya, however,\ncharges at the \"Moderate\" Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to an average cost of $346.13\nper day.

Over the course of a year, consumers/payors for nephrology services have thus\npaid thousands more for the hospitalists' physician and nephrology services than they would\nhave paid for care from Dr. Montoya who is a physician specialist in nephrology. This is a\nclassic example of an antitrust injury, i.e. an injury to competition which the antitrust laws were\nmade to prevent. This antitrust injury arises from the conspirators' group boycott/concerted\nrefusal to deal with Dr. Montoya, as well as with the Defendants' monopolization and attempted\nmonopolization of the relevant market.\n\n14.    Restraint of Trade/ Tortious Interference by Violating EMTALA-\n\n14.1   The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (hereinafter EMTALA) is\nSection 1867(a) of the Social Security Act, and is codified within the section of the U.S. Code\nwhich governs the Medicare program. (42 USC 1395cc)                    The Healthcare Financing\nAdministration (hereinafter HCFA) is the federal agency that governs Medicare payments and\nhas the statutory authority to issue regulations concerning the implementation of EMTALA.\n(HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15)\n\n\n14.2   EMTALA is a statute which governs when and how a patient must be (1) examined and\noffered treatment or (2) transferred from one hospital to another when he is in an unstable\nmedical condition (3} the list of doctors on staff that are on call and the fair assignment of\npatients to doctors.     42 USC JJ95cc(a){l)(I)(iii), HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15 ,\nEmergency Dept. Compliance and Reimbursement Insider, May 2000,1-5.                  The statute is\nsometimes referred to as the anti-patient dumping act.\n\n\nBut in this case it does not involve patient dumping but the refusal to follow the mandatory call\nlist of EMTALA to fairly distribute the paying nephrology patients under Medicare or private\ninsurance.\n\n\n14.3    San Angelo Community Medical Center is Required to Maintain the Call List\n\n\nMedicare -participating hospitals must maintain a list of physicians who are on call to provide\nemergency care to individuals presenting to the emergency room. (42 USC 1395cc(a)(J)(I)(iii))\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~P~TITION                                              Page 19 of25\n\fUnder EMTALA the hospital and its officers are responsible for maintaining an on-call roster for\nthe emergency department. (42 USC J395cc(a)(l)(/)(iii))\n\n\nSan Angelo Community Medical Center is a Medicare -participating hospital.\n\n\nThe governing board and staff of the hospital must set standards for on-call services and a call\nlist and require that medical staff bylaws appropriately address the issue of call rotation, the call\nlist, and ensure the staff is properly accountable for the enforcement and compliance with the\nrequirements ofEMTALA. 42 USC 1395cc(a)(l)(l)(iii) ,42 CFR 482.11 and 42 CFR 482.22.\n\n\n14.4   All nephrology patients that go on to dialysis are covered under Medicare- thus are\npaying patients for the doctor and hospital\n\n\nPhysicians on staff are required to take all the referrals in their specialty. (HCFA Interpretive\nGuidelines V-15)\n\n\nA patient presenting for nephrology care is automatically placed under Medicare after their\ninitial diagnosis and Medicare pays the nephrology care even if the patient is under 65 and would\nordinarily be Medicare eligible. While in a hospital, inpatient hemodialysis is available, which would\nbe covered by Medicare Part A. This coverage by Medicare Part A is temporary and when the patient\nleaves the hospital the patient is covered by Medicare Part B for hemodialysis in dialysis facilities\n(Medicare      Coverage        of     Kidney       Dialysis      and      Transplant       Services\".·\nwww.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdj)\nThus all nephrology care is paid for either by private insurance or Medicare and is a financial\nbenefit to the hospital and on call physician.\n\n\n14.5 EMTALA apply in this case\n\n\nEMTALA applies to \"participating hospitalstt under Medicare -          i.e., to hospitals which have\nentered into \"provider agreementstt under which they will accept payment from the Department\nof Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the\nMedicare program for services provided to beneficiaries of that program. In practical terms, this\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~,TIT!ON                                                Page20 of25\n\fmeans that it applies to virtually all hospitals in the U.S., with the exception of the Shriners'\nHospital for Crippled Children and many military hospitals. Its provisions apply to all patients,\nand not just to Medicare patients. Thus the requirements apply to San Angelo Community\nMedical      Center      hospital      as     a     participating       hospital   under     Medicare.\n\n\nThe avowed purpose of the statute is to prevent hospitals from rejecting patients, refusing to treat\nthem, or transferring them to \"charity hospitals\" or \"county hospitals\" because they are unable to\npay or are covered under the Medicare or Medicaid programs and to fairly distribute patients\ncoming to the emergency room between physicians so the physician receives paying and non-\npaying patients. (42 USC 1395cc (a)(l)(l)(iii)), HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15.\n\n\n14.6 Does EMTALA apply only to people without insurance?\nNo. The statute expressly provides that the Act's provisions apply to all patients \"whether or not\neligible for Medicare benefits\". 42 USC 1395dd(a). Thus the facts of this case are subject to the\nfair distribution of patients to all nephrologists that are on staff.\n\n\nDespite the fact that the purpose of the statute is to prevent ''patient dumping\", there is no\nrequirement that the patient in fact be unable to pay his bills or that there be an economic\nmotivation behind the decision to transfer the patient. Cooper v. Gulf Breeze Hospital, 839 F.\nSupp. 1538 (1993). This is a key in this case, the patients coming to the emergency room for\nnephrology care are guaranteed to pay the doctor for services through Medicare.\n\n\n14.7    San Angelo Community Medical Center wants the paying patients to go to the other\nneghrologist in the hospital owned or affiliated group and to not have Dr. Montoya receive his\nfair share ofpatients.\n\n\n14.8    The pumose of the call list is to allow all physicians to egually receive call and paying\nand non-paying patients.\n\nIn this case the kidney disease patients are all paying patients under the government Medicare\nprogram.\n\n14.9 Fair Use of the Call List by the Hospital and Staff\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~tf!TION                                                   Page 21 of25\n\fThe HCFA (Health Care Financing Administration) is concerned that the call list fairly rotate\nbetween the specialty physicians that practice in the hospital.

Dr. Brewer and the hospital\nviolated EMTALA and interfered with Dr. Montoya receiving patients through the call list as\nrequired by EMTALA.\n\nAll the actions of both Dr. Brewer and the hospital were for monetary gain to have the hospital\naffiliated groups prosper and squeeze out the physician Dr. Montoya who is not part of the\nhospital affiliated group.\n\n14.9 Additional regulatory provisions - the \"snitch rule\"\nThe regulations do include a provision which imposes a very significant obligation on receiving\nhospitals. The regulation, at 42 CFR 489.20(m), obligates a participating hospital \"to report to\n[CMS] or the State survey agency any time it has reason to believe it may have received an\nindividual who has been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another\nhospital in violation of the requirements of Section 489.24(d).\" This regulation became effective\non September 29, 1995. Note that it requires reporting only when a patient has been improperly\ntransferred; it does not require reporting other known or suspected violations.\nSan Angelo Community Medical Center has violated this provision.\n\n14.10 Summary of violations of EMTALA-\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~fTITION                                             Page22 of25\n\fSan Angelo Community Medical Center has violated EMTALA to the economic harm of the\nPlaintiff Dr. Montoya.\n\nI .EMTALA requires a fair and rotating call list for all specialists at the hospital.\n\n2.

Nephrolog_y patients receive Medicare and thus         the hospital and treating physician are\nguaranteed pument for services thus the call list generates guaranteed fees for the medical\nservices.\n\n6.

Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or\n    a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new\n    or existing patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals\n    caused substantial injury to Dr. Montoya and damaged his ability to compete, because he\n    depended on these referrals and consults to build his practice. A majority of patients\n    who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney disease in a hospital later need continuing\n    care for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such continuing\n    treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need treatment for at\n    least six years, and each such patient would mean revenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of\n    approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya estimates that he has lost at least 100\n    long tenn kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the present due to the Defendants'\n    anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient referrals or consults. He estimates\n    that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $1,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of\n    time.\n\n                                      Prayer for Relief\n\n\n    For these reasons Plaintiff requests that:\n    1.

Motion Timely Filed\n\n         Section 27.003, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code and Rule 9la.3, Tex. R. Civ. P. requires\n\nthis motion to be filed within 60 days after the first pleading containing the challenged cause of\n\naction is served on the movant. The petition in this case was served upon Defendant Brewer on\n\nOctober 9, 2015. Accordingly, this motion is timely filed.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                      Page 1 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 76\n\f                          II. Causes of Action Asserted Against Brewer\n\n       The causes of action alleged in the Plaintiffs' Petition are:\n\n       (1)     Tortious Interference with Current and Prospective Business/Patient\nRelations (pp. 5-6);\n       (2)     Tortious Interference with Current and Prospective Business/Patient\nRelations- Exemplary Damages (p. 7);\n       (3)     Defamation Per Se (p. 7);\n       (4)     Malice (p. 7);\n       (5)     Business Disparagement (pp. 7-8)\n       (6)     Restraint of Trade (Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act) (p. 8-9).\n\n       As demonstrated below, none of the causes of action pleaded have any basis in law or in\n\nfact against Brewer.\n\n                                   III. No Legal Basis for Claims\n\nA.     The Court should dismiss Plaintifr s claim pursuant to the Texas Citizens\n       Participation Act.\n\n       This Court should dismiss Plaintiffs claims pursuant to the Texas Citizens Participation\n\nAct (\"TCPA\") because his claims are based on, relate to, or are in response to Defendant's\n\nexercise of his right to free speech. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 27.00S(b) (\"[A]\n\ncourt shall dismiss a legal action against the moving party if the moving party shows by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the legal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to the\n\nparty's exercise of: (1) the right of free speech ....\"). To avoid dismissal, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish \"by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of [its\n\nclaims].\" Id. at § 27.00S(c). If a plaintiff fails to meet this burden, the court must dismiss the\n\naction and award attorneys' fees to the moving party. Id. at § 27.009. Plaintiff cannot meet this\n\ndemanding burden; dismissal of his claims is therefore warranted.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                        Page 2 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  77\n\f       1. Plaintiffs' Claims Arise Out ofDefendant's Exercise of His Right to Free Speech\n\n       Plaintiffs claims are premised on Defendant's communications regarding a matter of\n\npublic concern. Such statements are squarely within the TCP A. Plaintiffs claims should\n\ntherefore be dismissed with prejudice. The TCPA defines \"[e]xercise of the right of free speech\n\n[as] communication made in connection with a matter of public concern.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code Ann. at§ 27.001(3). A '\"matter of public concern' includes an issue related to: (A)\n\nhealth or safety; [or] (B) environmental, economic, or community well-being.\" Id. at §\n\n27.0001(7).\n\n       Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: 1) engaged in a covert whisper campaign\n\nand decided not to refer any patients to Plaintiff and 2) brought charges against Plaintiff relating\n\nto incompetent patient care. Importantly, Plaintiff does not identify any actual statements in\n\nwhich Defendant ever disparaged Plaintiff, or suggested that any entity should refrain from doing\n\nbusiness with Plaintiff. In fact, the only specific action alleged to have harmed Plaintiff - the\n\ncharges brought against Plaintiff relating to incompetent patient care - is statutorily protected\n\nconduct pursuant to the medical committee privileges and immunities provided by the Texas\n\nOccupations Code, §§160.001 et seq., 160.010 (and especially subsection (c) of that section), and\n\n161.001 et seq., the Texas Health & Safety Code, §161.001 et seq. and 161.033, and the Federal\n\nHealth Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.SC., § 1110 I et seq.\n\n       Furthermore, these charges relating to Plaintifrs patient care constitute free speech under\n\nthe TCPA because it fits within TCPA's definition of \"communication[s] made in connection\n\nwith a matter of public concern,\" including: \"health or safety\" (Plaintiff is a:physician);\n\n\"community well-being\" (Plaintiff practices medicine in the community in which Defendants\n\nwork and live); or \"service in the marketplace\" (Plaintiff provides medical services to the\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                       Page 3 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  78\n\fcommunity in which Defendant works and lives). See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. at§\n\n27.001(7); Lippincott v. Whisenhunt, 462 S.W.3d 507, 509-10 (Tex. 2015) (holding that e-mails\n\nsent by administrators at medical facility containing disparaging comments about certified\n\nregistered nurse anesthetist were communications made in connection with a matter of public\n\nconcern and were protected by the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA); e-mails related to\n\nwhether nurse anesthetist properly provided medical services to patients, and included\n\nallegations that nurse anesthetist failed to provide adequate coverage for pediatric cases,\n\nadministered a different narcotic than was ordered, falsified records, and violated facility's sterile\n\nprotocol policy); see also Newspaper Holdings, Inc. v. Crazy Hotel Assisted Living, Ltd., 416\n\nS.W.3d 71, 81 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no. pet. h.) (holding that articles relating to\n\nthe plaintiffs obligation to meet the licensing requirements and standards for operating an\n\nassisted living facility were made in connection with a matter of public concern and related to the\n\nexercise of free speech).\n\n       Additionally, Plaintiffs pleadings fail to present a prima facie case on each of Plaintiffs\n\ncauses of action, because Plaintiffs pleadings are not clear and specific. \"Pleadings that might\n\nsuffice in a case that does not implicate the TCPA may not be sufficient to satisfy the TCPA's\n\n'clear and specific evidence' requirement.\" In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 590 (Tex. 2015) \"[A]\n\nplaintiff must provide enough detail to show the factual basis for its claim,\" including how the\n\n\"defendants damaged the plaintiff.\" Id. at 591. \"[G]eneral allegations that merely recite the\n\nelements of a cause of action ... will not suffice.\" Id. at 590. Additionally, \"[b]are, baseless\n\nopinions do not create fact questions, and neither are they a sufficient substitute for the clear and\n\nspecific evidence required to establish a prima facie case under the TCPA.\" Id. at 592. Without\n\nmore, allegations stating that a plaintiff suffered \"direct economic losses and 'lost profits,\"' are\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                         Page 4 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  79\n\fonly conclusory and do not constitute evidence. Id.; see Coastal Transp. Co. v. Crown Cent.\n\nPetroleum, 136 S.W.3d 227, 232 (Tex. 2004); Ryland Grp., Inc. v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 122\n\n(Tex. 1996) (per curiam); Wholesale TV & Radio Adver., LLC v. Better Bus. Bureau of Metro.\n\nDallas, Inc., No. 05-11-01337-CV, 2013 WL 3024692, at *4 (Tex.

App.-Texarkana 2003, no\n\npet.).\n\n         Plaintiffs entire petition is based on, relates to, or is in response to Defendant's exercise\n\nof his right to speak freely on issues relating to public health and safety. Therefore, Plaintiffs\n\ncauses of action should be dismissed pursuant to the TCPA.\n\nB.       Plaintiff's Claims Have No Basis in Law\n\n         Rule 91 a, Tex. R. Civ. Proc., provides:\n\n                        \"(A) party may move to dismiss a cause of action on the\n                grounds that it has no basis in law or in fact. A cause of action\n                has no basis in law if the allegations, taken as true, together\n                with the inferences reasonably drawn from them, do not entitle\n                the claimant to the relief sought.\"\n\n\n1. Tortious Interference with Existing and Prospective Patients and Exemplary Damages\n\n         The elements of tortious interference with an existing business relationship \"are (I) the\n\nexistence of a contract subject to interference, (2) the act of interference was willful and\n\nintentional, (3) such intentional act was a proximate cause of plaintiffs damages, and (4) actual\n\ndamage or loss occurred.\" Victoria Bank & Trust Co. v. Brady, 811 S. W.2d 931, 939 (Tex.199 I);\n\nsee Browning-Ferris, Inc. v. Reyna, 865 S.W.2d 925,926 (Tex.1993).\n\n         \"To establish ... tortious interference with prospective business relationships, a plaintiff\n\nmust show that ( 1) there was a reasonable probability that the parties would have entered into a\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                         Page 5 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                    80\n\fbusiness relationship; (2) the defendant committed an independently tortious or unlawful act that\n\nprevented the relationship from occurring; (3) the defendant either acted with a conscious desire\n\nto prevent the relationship from occurring or knew the interference was certain or substantially\n\ncertain to occur as a result of the conduct; and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual harm or damages\n\nas a result of the defendant's interference.\" Plotkin v. Joekel, 304 S. W.3d 455, 487 (Tex. App.-\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (quoting Richardson-Eagle, Inc. v. William M Mercer,\n\nInc., 213 S.W.3d 469, 475 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied)); see Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc. v. Sturges, 52 S.W.3d 711, 713 (Tex. 2001). Independently tortious means \"conduct\n\nthat would violate some other recognized tort duty.\" Sturges, 52 S.W.3d at 713. A plaintiff can\n\nrecover exemplary damages if he can show the interference was malicious. Seelbach v. Clubb, 7\n\nS.W.3d 749, 757 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 1999, pet. denied).\n\n       All of Plaintiffs allegations regarding his claim for tortious interference with existing\n\nbusiness and prospective patients, if taken as true, do not entitle Plaintiff to the relief he seeks\n\nbecause as to Brewer, Plaintiff fails to allege, and there are no facts which support: I) the\n\nexistence of a contract which is subject to interference; 2) that there was a reasonable probability\n\nthat the Plaintiff and these prospective patients would have entered into a doctor-patient\n\nrelationship; or 3) that Brewer committed an independently tortious or unlawful act that\n\nprevented the doctor-patient relationship from occurring. Plaintiff alleges generally that\n\nDefendants interfered with Plaintiffs relationships with patients and referring physicians;\n\nhowever, Plaintiff alleges no specific tortious or unlawful conduct against Brewer which, if true,\n\nconstitutes tortious interference with Plaintiffs ability to enter into a relationship with patients\n\nand referring physicians, nor does Plaintiff allege that he is under a current contract with any\n\npatients or physicians with which Brewer could interfere, nor has Plaintiff alleged any facts\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER. M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                       Page 6ofl5\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  81\n\fwhich support a finding that there was a reasonable probability that Plaintiff would have entered\n\ninto said relationships, but for Brewer's conduct. Because Plaintiff cannot establish elements\n\nessential to his claim for tortious interference with existing and prospective patient relations,\n\nPlaintiffs claims for the same should be dismissed; further, without proof oftortious interference,\n\nPlaintiffs claim for exemplary damages must be denied as well.\n\n       Alternatively, Plaintifrs claim should be dismissed because a hospital, through its agents,\n\nhas a duty to engage in peer review of its physicians._Patel v. Midland Mem'l Hosp. & Med. Ctr.,\n\n298 F.3d 333, 347 (5th Cir. 2002). Thus, any contractual interference caused by Brewer/s\n\nexercise of this right with respect to Plaintiff was justified. See Friendswood Dev. Co. v.\n\nMcDade & Co., 926 S. W.2d 280, 282 (Tex.1996) (\"A party is justified in interfering with\n\nanother's contract if it exercises (1) its own legal rights or (2) a good faith claim to a colorable\n\nlegal right, even though that claim ultimately proves to be mistaken.\"); Patel v. Midland Mem'l\n\nHosp. & Med. Ctr., 298 F.3d 333,347 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\n2. Defamation Per Se\n\n       Defamation is a false statement about a plaintiff published to a third person without legal\n\nexcuse which damages the plaintiffs reputation. Doe v. Mobile Video Tapes, Inc., 43 S.W.3d 40,\n\n48 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.); Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380, 384 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Waco 2005, no pet.) To be considered defamation per se, the statement must (1) impute\n\nthe commission of a crime; (2) impute contraction of a loathsome disease; (3) cause injury to a\n\nperson's office, business, profession, or calling; or (4) impute sexual misconduct. Goodman, 50\n\nS.W.3d at 140. Whether words are capable of the defamatory meaning the plaintiff attributes to\n\nthem is a question of law for the court. Musser v. Smith Protective Serv., Inc., 123 S.W.2d 653,\n\n654-55 (Tex.1987); Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380,384 (Tex. App.-Waco 2005, no pet.).\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                       Page7 of15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 82\n\fIf particular language alleged to be defamatory may, or may not, be so, according to other\n\nfacts or circumstances, then an innuendo is required in order to tender as an issue the fact\n\nthat the words conveyed to hearers the defamatory meaning. Montgomery Ward & Co. v.\n\nPeaster, 178 S.W.2d 302, 305 (Tex. Civ. App.-Eastland 1944, no writ). Consequently,\n\ninnuendo should never be considered when interpreting defamation per se. The very\n\ndefinition of \"per se,\" \"in and of itself,\" precludes the use of innuendo. Moore v.\n\nWaldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380, 386 (Tex. App.-Waco 2005, no pet.) If the statement, taken\n\nby itself and as a whole, is defamatory, it will require no extrinsic evidence to clarify its\n\nmeaning; it will stand alone. Burnaman v. J.C. Penney Co., 181 F.Supp. 633, 636-37\n\n(S.D.Tex.1960); Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380, 386 (Tex. App.-Waco 2005, no\n\npet.).\n\n         Plaintifr s Original Petition fails to allege what, if any, defamatory statement\n\nBrewer made against Plaintiff, and in what context, and to whom those statements were\n\nmade. Without establishing what the defamatory statement was that allegedly defamed\n\nPlaintiff, innuendo is required to determine whether it is in fact defamatory, preventing\n\nPlaintiff from prevailing on his claim for defamation per se. Plaintifrs defamation per se\n\nclaim should be dismissed accordingly.\n\n3. Malice\n\n         Plaintiff claims that he is entitled to exemplary damages for his claims for tortious\n\ninterference and defamation per se under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.007 because\n\nBrewer's conduct involved an \"extreme degree of risk considering the probability and magnitude\n\nof the potential harm to others.\" Pl. Pet. p. 7. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §41.007 does not\n\nentitle Plaintiff to exemplary damages, as § 41.007 only provides that \"[p]rejudgment interest\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                        Page 8 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 83\n\fmay not be assessed or recovered on an award of exemplary damages.\" Therefore, taking all\n\nPlaintiffs allegations as true, Plaintiff is not entitled to exemplary damages under § 41.007, Tex.\n\nCiv.

Code.\n\n       Moreover, even if the Court allows Plaintiff to correct, what may be a typographical error\n\nin the statute cited, Plaintiffs claim for exemplary damages for Malice fails because Plaintiff\n\ndoes not allege that Brewer acted with malice, which means \"a specific intent by the defendant to\n\ncause substantial injury or harm to the claimant;\" rather, Plaintiff alleges that Brewer acted with\n\nan extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to\n\nothers, which is an element of gross negligence. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917,\n\n921 (Tex. 1998) (\"Gross negligence includes ... viewed objectively from the actor's standpoint,\n\nthe act or omission must involve an extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and\n\nmagnitude of the potential harm to others.\") However, Plaintiff does not allege that Brewer was\n\ngrossly negligent, and cannot establish that he is entitled to exemplary damages for malice based\n\non the allegations contained in Plaintiffs Original Petition. Accordingly, Plaintiffs claim for\n\nexemplary damages should be dismissed.\n\n4. Business Disparagement\n\n       To prevail on a business disparagement claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the\n\ndefendant published false and disparaging information about it, (2) with malice, (3) without\n\nprivilege, (4) that resulted in special damages to the plaintiff. Hurlbut v. Gulf At/. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n749 S.W.2d 762, 766 (Tex.1987); Forbes Inc. v. Granada Biosciences, Inc:., 124 S.W.3d 167,\n\n170 (Tex. 2003). Actual malice is not ill will; it is the making of a statement with knowledge that\n\nit is false, or with reckless disregard of whether it is true. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S.\n\n323, 328 (1974). \"Reckless disregard\" is defined as a high degree of awareness of probable\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. •s MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                        Page 9 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY·s FEES\n\n\n                                                  84\n\ffalsity, for proof of which the plaintiff must present \"sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion\n\nthat the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\" St. Amant\n\nv. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731, (1968). An error in judgment is not enough. See Time, Inc. v.\n\nPape, 401 U.S. 279, 290, (1971); Carr v. Brasher, 776 S.W.2d 567, 571 (Tex. 1989).\n\nFurthermore, a plaintiff cannot rely on a statement of opinion to support its business\n\ndisparagement claim because such statements are constitutionally protected. Carr v. Brasher,\n\n776 S.W.2d 567, 570 (Tex. 1989).\n\n       Plaintiffs pleadings, even if taken as true, do not entitle Plaintiff to the relief sought for\n\nbusiness disparagement. As addressed above, Plaintiff makes no specific allegations that Brewer\n\npublished any false, defamatory statement regarding Plaintiffs business. Plaintiffs allegations\n\nthat Brewer brought him up on charges of incompetent patient care, and started a whisper\n\ncampaign to not refer business to Plaintiff does not support a claim for business disparagement.\n\nA whisper campaign not to refer patients to Plaintiff, taken as true, does not imply that false\n\nstatements were made about Plaintiff in the alleged \"whisper campaign,\" and any charges\n\nBrewer brought against Plaintiff were brought as part of a medical peer review process which is\n\nprotected under the TCPA, and the privileges and immunities as set forth in the Texas\n\nOccupations Code, §§160.001 et seq., 160.0IO(and especially subsection (c) of that section), and\n\n161.001 et seq., the Texas Health & Safety Code, §161.001 et seq., and 161.033, and the Federal\n\nHealth Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U .S.C., §1110 I et seq. Furthermore, Plaintiff fails to\n\nallege or establish that Brewer's statements caused Plaintiff special damages. Proof of special\n\ndamages is an essential part of the plaintiffs' cause of action for business disparagement. Hurlbut\n\nv. Gulf At/. Life Ins. Co., 749 S.W.2d 762, 767 (Tex. 1987). The requirement goes to the cause\n\nof action itself and requires that plaintiff \"establish pecuniary loss that has been realized or\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                       Page 10 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 85\n\fliquidated as in the case of specific lost sales.\" W. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of\n\nTorts,§ 128 at 971 (5th Ed.1984); Hurlbut v. GulfAtl. Life Ins. Co., 749 S.W.2d 762, 767 (Tex.\n\n1987). Plaintiff generally alleges that Defendants took the action(s) to harm Plaintiff's business\n\ninterests; this is insufficient to establish special damages under a claim for business\n\ndisparagement. Accordingly, Plaintifrs claim for business disparagement should be dismissed.\n\n       Additionally, Plaintifr s claim for business dispargement must be dismissed because the\n\nTexas Medical Practice Act (\"TMPA\") affords immunity from civil liability to peer-review\n\nparticipants when they act \"without malice and in the reasonable belief that the action or\n\nrecommendation is warranted by the facts known to that person.\" Tex. 0cc. Code §\n\n160.010(a)(2). Plaintifrs allegations against Brewer concern his actions as a peer-review\n\nparticipant, and peer-review participants are always presumed to have acted without malice.\n\nBenson v. St. Joseph Reg'l Health Ctr., 575 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). To overcome the\n\npresumption, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving the contrary by clear and convincing\n\nevidence. Benson v. St. Joseph Reg'l Health Ctr., 575 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). Plaintiff's\n\nconclusory allegation that Defendants acted with malice falls far short of the clear and\n\nconvicning evidence standard required to establish this element and no facts alleged support his\n\nallegation of malice. Accordingly, Brewer should be found immune from Plaintifr s business\n\ndisparagement claim, and it should be dismissed.\n\n5. Restraint of Trade\n\n       Initially, Brewer would re-assert its argument that Plaintifr s claims must be dismissed\n\nbecause the Texas Medical Practice Act (\"TMPA\") affords immunity from civil liability to peer-\n\nreview participants when they act \"without malice and in the reasonable belief that the action or\n\nrecommendation is warranted by the facts known to that person.\" Tex. 0cc. Code §\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER. M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                     Page 11 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 86\n\f160.0IO(a)(2). Plaintiffs allegations against Brewer concern his actions as a peer-review\n\nparticipant, and peer-review participants are always presumed to have acted without malice.\n\nBenson v. St. Joseph Reg'/ Health Ctr., 575 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). To overcome the\n\npresumption, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving the contrary by clear and convincing\n\nevidence. Benson v. St. Joseph Reg'/ Health Ctr., 575 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). As\n\ndiscussed above, Plaintiff's Petition fails to allege facts sufficient to entitle him to a finding of\n\nmalice against Brewer. Accordingly, Brewer is immune from Plaintiffs Restraint of Trade\n\nclaim, and it should be dismissed.\n\n       Alternatively, Plaintiffs bald allegations that Defendants referred patients to a hospital-\n\nowned practice to obtain market dominance in the nephrology practice in Tom Green and\n\ncontiguous counties, coupled with Plaintiffs failure to allege that he suffered an antitrust injury\n\ndo no entitle Plaintiff to relief under a Texas Antitrust Act.\n\n       The Texas Antitrust Act provides, in relevant part, that \"[e]very contract, combination, or\n\nconspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is unlawful,\" and that \"[i]t is unlawful for any\n\nperson to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or\n\ncommerce.\" Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 15.0S(a), (b) (Vernon 2002). To establish that a\n\ndefendant contracted, combined, or conspired in restraint of trade in violation of the Texas\n\nAntitrust Act, a plaintiff must show that the alleged contract, combination, or conspiracy is\n\nunreasonable and has an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market. See Winston v.\n\nAm. Med. Int'/, 930 S.W.2d 945, 951-52 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, writ denied). The\n\nTexas Antitrust Act does not prohibit all restraints of trade; instead, it prohibits only those that\n\nrestrain trade unreasonably. See DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S. W.2d 670, 687 (Tex.1990).\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D.'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                        Page 12 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 87\n\f       Courts have generally been reluctant to hold that a group of physicians who decide that .\n\nthey do not want to refer patients to a particular physician, because they doubt his qualifications,\n\nhave committed a per se violation of the Sherman Act. Because actions on the part of hospitals\n\nand physicians, which might resemble group boycotts, may well be mandated by an ethically\n\ngrounded concern for patients' well-being ... such behavior, in the medical service industry,\n\nshould be analyzed in terms of the rule of reason. Marlin v. Robertson, 307 S.W.3d 418, 428-29\n\n{Tex. App.-San Antonio 2009, no pet.) Pontius v. Children's Hosp., 552 F.Supp. 1352, 1370\n\n(W.D.Pa.1982); see also Jackson v. Radcliffe, 795 F.Supp. 197, 205 (S.D.Tex.1992) (applying\n\nrule of reason to physician's contention that termination of his contract with hospital was illegal\n\nrestraint of trade); Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hospital, 945 F.2d 696, 708-09 (4th Cir.1991)\n\n(analyzing denial or revocation of medical staff privileges under rule of reason); Marin v.\n\nCitizens Mem'l Hosp., 700 F.Supp. 354, 360 (S.D.Tex.1988) (applying rule of reason to\n\nphysician's claim that hospital for which he worked and its medical staff formed group boycott to\n\nreduce or eliminate his competitive potential).\n\n       Furthermore, a plaintiff cannot demonstrate the unreasonableness of a restraint merely by\n\nshowing that it caused him an economic injury. Oksanen, 945 F.2d at 708. For example, the fact\n\nthat a hospital's decision caused a disappointed physician to practice medicine elsewhere does\n\nnot of itself constitute an antitrust injury. Id. \"If the law were otherwise, many a physician's\n\nworkplace grievance with a hospital would be elevated to the status of an antitrust action.\" Id.\n\n\"To keep the antitrust laws from becoming so trivialized, the reasonableness of a restraint is\n\nevaluated based on its impact on competition as a whole within the relevant market.\" Id. The fact\n\nthat a competitor's income may have been reduced by someone's conduct, does not mean that\n\ncompetition was impermissibly restrained in the relevant market. Rea v. Hosp. Corp. ofAm., 892\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                      Page 13 of 15\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  88\n\fF. Supp. 821, 834 (N.D. Tex. 1993) aff'd in part, rev'd in part sub nom. Johnson v. Hosp. Corp.\n\nof Am., 95 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 1996). To meet its burden, a plaintiff must prove what market it\n\ncontends was restrained and that the defendants played a significant role in the relevant market.\n\nId. at 709. Absent this market power, any restraint on trade created by the defendants' actions is\n\nunlikely to implicate Texas Antitrust Act section 15.0S(a). See_Marlin v. Robertson, 307 S.W.3d\n\n418, 429 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2009, no pet.) \"There must be evidence of 'demonstrable\n\neconomic effect' not just an inference of possible effect.\" Coca-Cola Co. v. Harmar Bottling\n\nCo., 218 S.W.3d 671,689 {Tex.2006).\n\n       Plaintiffs allegations, even if taken as true, do not entitle him to a relief under the Texas\n\nAntitrust Act, as his allegations do not demonstrate that Brewer' s actions play a significant role\n\nin the nephrology market in Tom Green and contiguous counties or that Plaintiff suffered an\n\nantitrust injury from Brewer's actions. In fact, Plaintiffs allegations demonstrate that Plaintiff\n\nmaintains his own medical practice with a dialysis unit capable of serving 24 patients per shift.\n\n(Pl. Pet. p. 2). Any patient who wishes to use Plaintiff is still able to seek out his services. See\n\nNafrawi v. Hendrick Med. Ctr., 676 F. Supp. 770, 774-75 (N.D. Tex. 1987) (holding that there\n\nwas no antitrust violation by a hospital that denied a doctor staff privileges when the doctor\n\nmaintained full privileges at a comparable facility, any patient who wishes to use his services\n\ncould still seek out his services, and even if he no longer practiced medicine at all, patients in the\n\nrelevant market could still obtain services identical to those he provided.) Therefore, Plaintiffs\n\nclaim for restraint of trade should be dismissed.\n\n                               IV.

No Legal Basis fer Claims\nA.      The Court should dismiss Plaintifrs claim pursuant to the Texas Citizens\n        Participation Act.\n\n        This Court should dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to the Texas Citizens Participation\n\n Act (''TCPN') because his claims are based on, relate to, or are m response to Defendant's\n\n exercise of his right to free speech. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.

To avoid dismissal, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish \"by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of [its\n\nclaims).\" id. at § 27.00S(c). If a plaintiff fails to meet this burden, the court must dismiss the\n\naction and award attorneys' fees to the moving party. Id. at§ 27.009. Plaintiff cannot meet this\n\ndemanding burden and dismissal of his claims is therefore warranted.\n\nPlaintiffs' Claims Arise Out ofDefendant's Exercise of His Right to Free Speech\n\n        Plaintiffs claims are premised on Defendant's communications regarding a matter of\n\npablie eeAeem. PlaiRtiff aetes in his latest pleading on page 3 that \"Dr Brewer at all times acted\n\nfor (SACMC).\" Further, in Defendant Brewer's attached affidavit, he states that \"[F]urther, any\n\ndiscussions I have had concerning Dr. Montoya, regardless of the context, have been within the\n\nhospital, and either directly concemmg patient care andtor associated with the pee1 1eview\n\nprocess.\" As such, any claimed statements are squarely within the TCPA. Plaintiffs claims\n\nshould therefore be dismissed with prejudice. The TCPA defines \"[e]xercise of the right of free\n\nspeech [as] communication made io connection with a matter of public concern.\" Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code Ann. at§ 27.001(3). A \"'matter of public concern' includes an issue related to: (A)\n\nhealth or safety; [or] (B) environmental, economic, or community well-being.\" Id at §\n\n27.0061(1}.\n\n         Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: l) engaged in a covert whisper campaign\n\n and decided not to refer any patients to Plaintiff and 2) brought charges against Plaintiff relating\n\n to incompetent patient care. Importantly, Plaintiff does not 1dent1fy any actual statements m\n\n which Defendant ever disparaged Plaintiff, or suggested that any entity should refrain from doing\n\n\n Dt:F.ENDANT KIRK BREWER.

Plaintiff alleges generally that\n\nDefendants interfered with Plaintiff's relationships with patients and referring physicians;\n\nhowever, Plaintiff alleges no specific tortious or unlawful conduct against Brewer which, if true,\n\neonstittttes tertiat1s interfereflee with Plaintiff's ability to enter into a relationship with patients\n\nand referring physicians, nor does Plaintiff allege that he is under a current contract with any\n\npatients or physicians with which Brewer could interfere, nor has Plaintiff alleged any facts\n\nwhich support a finding that there was a reasonable probabll1ty tliat Plamuff WoUld have entered\n\ninto said relationships, but for Brewer's conduct.

Defamation Per Se\n\n       Defamation is a false statement about a plaintiff published to a third person without legal\n\nexcuse which damages the plaintiffs 1cputation. Doe\"· Mobile Video Tapes, 1-nc., 43 S.W.3d 48,\n\n48 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.); Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380, 384 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Waco 2005, no pet.) To be considered defamation per se, the statement must (1) impute\n\nthe commission of a crime; (2) impute contraction of a loathsome disease; (3) cause injury to a\n\nperson's office, business, profession, or calling; or (4) impute sexual misconduct. Goodman, 50\n\nS,WJd at 140, 'Whether woJ:ds are capable of tbe defurnatocy meaning the plaintiff attributes to\n\nthem is a question of law for the court. Musser v. Smith Protective Serv., Inc., 723 S.W.2d 653,\n\n654-55 (Tex.1987); Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380,384 (Tex. App.-Waco 2005, no pet.).\n\n       If parhcular language alleged to be defamatory may, or may not, be so, according to otbe1\n\nfacts or circumstances, then an innuendo is required in order to tender as an issue the fact that the\n\nwords conveyed to hearers the defamatory meaning. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Peaster, 178\n\nS w 2d 3Q2 1 305 (Tex Civ App            Eastland 1944, no writ). Consequently. innuendo should\n\nnever be considered when interpreting defamation per se. The very definition of \"per se,\" \"in\n\nand of itself,\" precludes the use of innuendo. Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380, 386 (Tex.\n\nApp. Waco 2.66S, no pet.) If the statement; taken b)' it5elf and as a whale, is defamatory, it will\n\nrequire no extrinsic evidence to clarify its meaning; it will stand alone. Burnaman v. J.C. Penney\n\nCo., 181 F.Supp. 633, 636-37 (S.D.Tex.1960); Moore v. Waldrop, 166 S.W.3d 380, 386 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Waco 2005, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S AMENDED MO I ION IO DISMISS                                  .Page8ofl!I\nAND FOR RECOVERY OF COSTS ANO A1TORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                               126\n\f       Plaintiffs Second Amended Original Petition now alleges that the so-called defamatory\n\nstatement Brewer made against Plaintiff was actually not a statement at all concerning Plaintiff,\n\nbut innuendo, an order calling for a change in attending physician to Defendant Brewer followed\n\nby the words \"Consult Dr. Stevenson,,, Allegedly, by publishing this is one patient's medical\n\nrecord, this was tantamount to a defarnato1y pet se statement against the Plaintiff. Clearl), this is\n\nnothing but innuendo and is certainly not a particular statement against the Plaintiff. Again,\n\nwhen innuendo is required to determine whether a particular statement is in fact defamatory, then\n\nthe Plaintiff is prevented from prevailing on his claim for defamation per se.             Plaintiff's\n\ndefamation per se claim should be dismissed accordingly.\n\n3. Maliee\n\n        Plaintiff claims that he is entitled to exemplary damages for his claims for tortious\n\ninterference and defamation per se under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.007 because\n\nBrewer's conduct mvolved an \"extreme degree of risk cons1dermg the probabtltty and magnitude\n\nof the potential harm to others.\" Pl. Pet. p. 7. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §41.007 does not\n\nentitle Plaintiff to exemplary damages, as § 41.007 only provides that \"(p ]rejudgment interest\n\nmay not be assessed or recovered oo ao award of exemplary damages,\" Therefore, taking all\n\nPlaintiffs allegations as true, Plaintiff is not entitled to exemplary damages under§ 41.007, Tex.\n\n Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code.\n\n        Moreover, even if the Court allows Plaintiff to correct, what may be a typograf)hieal error\n\n in the statute cited, Plaintifrs claim for exemplary damages for Malice fails because Plaintiff\n\n does not allege that Brewer acted with malice, which means \"a specific intent by the defendant to\n\n cause substantial injury or harm to the claimant;\" rather, Plaintiff alleges that Brewer acted with\n\n an extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to\n\n\n DEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. ·s AMENDED MOTION to DISMISS                                    Page9ot 19\n AND FOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND AITORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                              127\n\fothers, which is an element of gross negligence. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917,\n\n921 (Tex 1998) (''Gross negligence includes ... viewed objectively from the actor's standpoint,\n\nthe act or omission must involve an extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and\n\nmagnitude of the potential harm to others.'') However, Plaintiff does not allege that Brewer was\n\ngrossly negligent; and cmmot establish that lie is entitled to exemplary damages for malice based\n\non the allegations contained in Plaintiff's Original Petition. Accordingly, Plaintiffs claim for\n\nexemplary damages should be dismissed.\n\n4. Business Disparagement\n\n       To prevail on a business disparagement claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the\n\ndefendant published false and disparaging infum:aation about it, (2) with malice, (3) wjthnut\n\nprivilege, (4) that resulted in special damages to the plaintiff. Hurlbut v. Gulf Atl. Life Ins. Co .•\n\n749 S.W.2d 762, 766 (Tex.1987); Forbes Inc. v. Granada Biosciences. Inc'\"' 124 S.W.3d 167,\n\n170 ( I ex. 2003). Actual mahce 1s not ul will; tt 1s the making of a        statement with specific\nintent/knowledge that it is false, or with reckless disregard of whether it is true. Gertz v. Robert\n\nWelch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 328 (1974). \"Reckless disregard\" is defined as a high degree of\n\nawar:eness of pi:obable falsicy, for proof of wbicb the plaintiff must present \"sufficient evidence\n\nto permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his\n\npublication.\" SI. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731, (1968). An error in judgment is not\n\nenough. See   Time, inc. v. Pape,   461 U.S. 219, 2~6, (1971), Can v. B1ashe,, 776 S.W.2d 567,\n\n571 (Tex. 1989). Furthermore, a plaintiff cannot rely on a statement of opinion to support its\n\nbusiness disparagement claim because such statements are constitutionally protected. Carr v.\n\nBrasher, 116 S.W.2d 567,570 (Tex. 1989).\n\n\n\n\n DEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S AMENDED MOTION TO DISMISS                                    Page IUot 19\n AND }.OR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                               128\n\f       Plaintiff's pleadings, even if taken as true, do not entitle Plaintiff to the relief sought for\n\nbusiness disparagement As addressed above, Plaintiff makes no specific allegations that Brewer\n\npublished any false, defamatory statement regarding Plaintifrs business. Plaintiff's conclusory\n\nallegations that Brewer made charges of incompetent patient care, evidently by innuendo, and\n\nstarted a whisper campaign without any supprn ting facts to not 1efe1 business to Plaintiff does\n\nnot support a claim for business disparagement. A whisper campaign not to refer patients to\n\nPlaintiff, taken as true, does not imply that false statements were made about Plaintiff in the\n\nalleged \"whisper campaign,\" and to the extent any charges were brought by Brewer against\n\nPlaintiff were brought as part of a medical peer review process which is protected under the\n\nTCPA, and the privileges and immunities as set furth in the Texas Occupations Code, §§160 001\n\net seq., 160.0lO(and especially subsection (c) of that section), and 161.001 et seq., the Texas\n\nHealth & Safety Code, §161.001 el seq., and 161.033, and the Federal Health Care Quality\n\nImprovement Act, 42 0 .S.C., §1110 l et seq. Furthermore, Plamtlff tails to allege or establish\n\nthat Brewer's statements caused Plaintiff special damages. Proof of special damages is an\n\nessential part of the plaintiffs' cause of action for business disparagement. Hurlbut v. Gulf At/.\n\nLife !'118. Co., 149 S.W.2d 762, 767 (Tex 1987) The cequicement goes to the cause of action\n\nitself and requires that plaintiff \"establish pecuniary loss that has been realized or liquidated as in\n\nthe case of specific lost sales.\" W.

While\n\nPlaintiff generally alleges that Defendants took the action(s) to harm Plaintiff's business interests\n\nand the alleged Defamation per se caused between $1,000,000.00 and $6,500,000.00 in damages;\n\nthis is insufficient to establish special damages under a claim for business disparagement as such\n\na claim is still wholly conclusory, not supported by any facts as to the number of patients,\n\n\n DEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S AMENDED MOTION TO DISMISS                                    Page II of (9\n AND FOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                               129\n\festimated or otherwise, and the amount lost per patient. Plaintiff claims this goes back to 2007\n\nor 2003, which would mean, even iftme, most oftbese claim wnnld be barred by limjta,tinns and\n\nimproper anyway. Regardless, Plaintiff's claim for business disparagement should be dismissed.\n\n       Additionally, Plaintiff's claim for business disparagement must be dismissed because the\n\nTexas Medical Practice Act (\"TMPA\") affords immunity from civil liability to peer-review\n\nparticipants when they act \"without malice and in the reasonable belief that the action or\n\nrecommendation is warranted by the facts known to that person.\" Tex. 0cc.

PlaintiWs allegations against Brewer concern his actions as a peer-review\n\nparticipant, and peer-review participants are always presumed to have acted without malice.\n\nBenson P. St. .laseph Reg'/ Healll1 Cir., S7S F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). Te ev@Kome the\n\npresumption, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving the contrary by clear and convincing\n\nevidence. Benson v. St. Joseph Reg'/ Health Ctr., 515 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). Plaintiffs\n\nconclusory allegation that Defendants acted with mahce falls far short of the clear and\n\nconvincing evidence standard required to establish this element and no facts alleged support his\n\nallegation of malice. Accordingly, Brewer should be found immune from Plaintiff's business\n\ndisparagement elaim, and it should be dismissed.\n\n5. Restraint of Trade\n\n        Initially, Brewer would re-assert its argument that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed\n\n because the I exas Medical Practice Act (\"TMPA\") affords tmmunlty from civil liability to peer-\n\n review participants when they act \"without malice and in the reasonable belief that the action or\n\n recommendation is warranted by the facts known to that person.\" Tex. 0cc.

St. Joseph Reg'/ Health Ctr., 515 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). To overcome the\n\npresumption, a plaintiff hears the burden of proving the contrar_y by clear and convincing\nevidence. Benson v. St. Joseph Reg'/ Health Ctr., 515 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir. 2009). As\n\ndiscussed above, Plaintiff's Petition fails to allege facts sufficient to entitle him to a fmding of\n\nmalice against B1twe1, much less evidence of the elem and convincing btuden. The Plaintiff has\n\nattached his own affidavit in response to the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. As is noted below,\n\nthe affidavit is conclusory in nature and legally insufficient to defeat this motion. Accordingly,\n\nBrewer is immune from Plaintifrs Restraint of Trade claim, and it should be dismissed.\n\n       Further, Plaintifrs conclusory allegations that Defendants referred patients to a hospital-\n\n0v.<n0d practiGe   t8   ebtaiA market ,fominance ia the aephrology practice in Tam Green and\n\ncontiguous counties, coupled with Plaintifrs failure to allege that he suffered an antitrust injury\n\ndo not entitle Plaintiff to relief under a Texas Antitrust Act.\n\n       The 'I exas Antitrust Act provides, m relevant part, that \"[e]very contract, combmauon, or\n\nconspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is unlawful,'' and that \"[i]t is unlawful for any\n\nperson to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or\n\ncommerce\" Tex Bus & Com Code Aoo § J5 QS(a), (b) (Yemao 2002) Tn establish that a\n\ndefendant contracted, combined, or conspired in restraint of trade in violation of the Texas\n\nAntitrust Act, a plaintiff must show that the alleged contract, combination, or conspiracy is\n\nunreasonable and has an adverse effect on competition in the 1elevant maikct. See Whi;sto,, v.\n\nAm. Med. Int'/, 930 S.W.2d 94S, 951-52 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, writ denied). The\n\nTexas Antitrust Act does not prohibit all restraints of trade; instead, it prohibits only those that\n\nrestrain trade unreasonably. See DeSantis v.

Oksanen, 945 F.2d at 708. For example, the fact\n\nthat a hospital's decision caused a disappointed physician to practice medicine elsewhere does\n\nnot of itself constitute an antitrust injttry. ld. \"If the law '.-Vere otherwise, many a physieian's\n\nworkplace grievance with a hospital would be elevated to the status of an antitrust action.\" Id\n\n\"To keep the antitrust laws from becoming so trivialized, the reasonableness of a restraint is\n\nevaluated based on its impact on competition as a whole within the relevant market.\" Jct.

I have handled civil litigation cases in Tom\nGreen County since J 996 I am board <'terti:6ed in Persona] lnjucy Trial l aw by the Texas Board\nof Legal Specialization (since 1995) and as a Civil Trial Advocate by the National Board of Trial\nAdvocacy (since 2001). As such, I am familiar with the prosecution and defense of cases such as\nthis and what is reasonable and necessary for attorneys' fees and expenses. Further, I am\nfamiliar witJ1 the case law and Texas Disciplioary Rules of Professional Conduct concerning\nreasonable and necessary attorneys' fees and expenses. In reaching my opinions, l considered\nthe various rectors as required in making my determination, including the complexity of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          E~IT2\n\fmattert the amount of damages claimed, all lawyers involved on all sides, the time and skill\nrequired. my ability and reputation, a11d also the experience of my partner, Jessica Hat le~ who has\nassisted in the case.

The Motion to Dismiss is based upon Texas Anti-Slapp Statute, Chapter 27 Actions\n         invoking the exercise of certain Constitutional Rights.\n\n      2. No affidavits are attached to the Motion.\n\n      3. Attached hereto is the affidavit of Dr. Montoya as evidence in support of his\n         response.\n\n      4. The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants Constitutional\n         Rights to speak freely, associate freely and participate in governmental as permitted\n         by law. These are the requirements to meet in filing a Motion under the Anti-Slapp\n         Statute Tex.C.P.R.C.§27.005(b) and as set out in Paulsen v. Yarrell 455 SW3d 192\n         (Tex.-App.-Houston {r' Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (quoting In Re Estate of Check 438\n         SW3d at 836).\n\n      5. The evidence presented by Dr. Montoya is that this case deals with the same standard\n         as setforth in the recent Texas Supreme Court of In Re Memorial Herman Hospital et\n         al 464 SW3d 686 2015. This case is on concerning anti-trust, business damages and a\n         campaign to stop competition by Dr. Montoya at San Angelo Community Medical\n         Center.\n\n      6. The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the Texas\n         Statute includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In Re Lipsky, 2015 WL1870073).\n         This evidence of Dr. Montoya meets the standard.\n\n      7. In this case th~ evidence is both direct, actual and circumstantial. The pleadings and\n         affidavit of Dr. Montoya prove that his case is real and not a continually protected\n         case.\n\n\n\n                                               94\n\f8.

Montoya, Jr. M.D. and after\nbeing duly sworn under oath stated.\n\n      \"My name is Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D. I am the Plaintiff in this case. I have\nknowledge of all the facts of this affidavit as Plaintiff and all facts are within my personal\nknowledge true and correct and that I was involved with facts stated.\n\n       I have not used any patient name, except where authorized by the patient or their agent, to\navoid any HIPAA or privacy violation.\n\n       1. I was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical Center in\n           1981. I have full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center. This case does not involve the rights of Defendant Kirk\n           Brewer, M.D. to speak freely, associate freely, and participate in government as\n           permitted by law. The facts of the case are that Kirk Brewer, M.D. was during his\n           actions an officer and/or Chief of Staff of the medical staff of San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center.         Kirk Brewer, M.D. was hired by San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center to run the hospitalist service. As an officer of the staff\n           and Chief of Staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. owed me a member of the staff a fiduciary duty\n           to not interfere by direct or indirect action with my practice of nephrology at San\n           Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n       2. Kirk Brewer, M.D. came to San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2007. Part of\n           my practice and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a rotating\n           system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital and\n           emergency room. When you are the named specialist you receive a call from the\n           emergency room physician that a doctor with your specialty is needed for a patient.\n          A big part of my practice was obtaining new patients and treating existing patients\n          that came to the emergency room and needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 I have\n          gotten new patients from the emergency room.\n\n\n\n\n                                               96\n\f3. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to treat\n   either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 I have received only one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new patient or\n   existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\n4. The one time for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 I was called\n   by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on duty\n   and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels.    Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n   informed me that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure. I was informed my\n   name was on the call board in the emergency room as nephrologist on call. Both of\n   the above doctors asked me to consult concerning treatment for that patient. I gave\n   my initial consult advice/orders of treatment to both doctors. This consultation call\n   was to me at 9:38 p.m. I informed them I would come see the patient and then review\n   the test results and determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as\n   Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts\n   on January 24, 2014.\n\n5. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the\n   patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult and treatment by me and\n   consulted another nephrologist. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is one that\n   is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Kirk Brewer,\n   M.D. without seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of\n   nephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D. 's economic gain and caused me economic\n   loss. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record\n   showing the facts on January 25, 2014.\n\n\n6. Kirk Brewer, M.D. by his actions of removing me as the nephrologist published a\n   statement that I was not a competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was aware\n   that his actions would become known to the staff physicians of San Angelo\n\n\n\n                                       97\n\f   Community Medical Center and that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign\n   saying I should not be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center.\n\n7. The statements and actions of Kirk Brewer, M.D. were published by his conduct. The\n   actions were referring to me as a non-competent nephrologist. The statement(s) were\n   defamatory and caused me economics loss.\n\n8. The total loss is between $1,000,000.00 and $6,500,000.00 from not receiving any\n   referrals from the emergency room or hospitalists.\n\n9. The defamatory statements are untrue. I am a competent and qualified nephrologist\n   to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n10. The actions of Kirk Brewer, M.D. were intentional or done with negligence when\n   Kirk Brewer, M.D. knew that the statement was false and his actions would lead a\n   reasonable prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory\n   potential.\n\n\n11. As officer and as President of the medical staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. must follow the\n   rules at San Angelo Community Medical Center and staff of San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center and have a new patient in the emergency room or hospital that needs\n   a specialist consultation assigned to the name off the rotating consultation list. By\n   Kirk Brewer, M.D. not following this procedure I did not receive any consultation\n   requests from the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center in 2008-present and one in 2014.\n\n\n12. Attached to this affidavit as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n   existing patient of mine Mrs. Welch tried to see me in the emergency room of San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not call me\n   to treat my existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and I have treated her\n   for at least 20 years.\n\n\n\n                                       98\n\f    ----~-·--·----···---                                          -   -   -   .\n\n\n\n\n         13, Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privaoy rights, who is also over\n             90 years of age and has been my patient fo1· a.t least lOyears requested roe when she\n             went to t~ emergency room and she also was refused to see me,\n\n         14.

BACKGROUND & SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n           Plaintiff originally filed this lawsuit in July of 2015 against Dr. Kirk Brewer (\"Brewer\")\n\nand the moving defendant, San Angelo Community Medical Center (\"SACMC\"), alleging\n\nnumerous causes of action related to supposed ill-treatment of Plaintiff and his medical\n\npractice's reputation. 2 After a several amendments to his Original Petition, this Court granted\n\nBrewer's Motion to Dismiss and ordered the case against Brewer to be dismissed under Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure rule 91(a) and the Texas Citizens Participation Act on February 8,\n\n\n\n1\n    For judicial economy, this Motion is concurrently filed with Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and Motion for leave\nto File Its Motion to Dismiss.\n2\n  See Plaintiffs Original Petition.\n\n\nSACMC's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                                         Page 1\n\n                                                       208\n\f2016. 3 As explained more fully below, because all of Plaintiff's claims of liability against\n\nSACMC derive from Brewer's alleged bad acts and Brewer has been dismissed from this case,\n\nSACMC now moves this Court to dismiss all claims for relief, with prejudice.\n\n                                              ARGUMENT\n\n    A.      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Traditional summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c) is proper\n\nwhen a movant establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter oflaw. Gary E. Patterson & Assocs., P.C. v. Holub, 264 S.W.3d 180, 190\n\n{Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied) (citing Randall's Food Mkts., Inc. v. Johnson,\n\n891 S.W.2d 640, 644 {Tex.1995) and Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c)). \"A defendant is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment if the evidence disproves as a matter of law at least one element of each of\n\nthe plaintiffs causes of action or if it conclusively establishes all elements of an affirmative\n\ndefense.\" Id.\n\n    B.      SACMC IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ALL OF PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS\n            BECAUSE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS AGAINST BREWER HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.\n\n         As best SACMC can glean, Plaintiff's Fourth Amended Petition, his current live\n\npleading, alleges six causes of action:\n\n    1) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations (Pl.' s 4th\n       Am. Pet. ,r,r 7-7.7);\n    2) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations - Exemplary\n       Damage (Id. at ,r 8);\n    3) Defamation Per Se (Id. at ,r,r 9-9.8);\n    4) Malice (Id. at ,r 1O);\n    5) Business Disparagement (Id. at ,r 11 ); and\n    6) Restraint of trade (Id. at ,r 12-12.8).\n\n\n\n\n3\n See Order On Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s Motion to Dismiss Per The Texas Citizens Participation Act,\nattached as Exhibit A.\n\n\nSACMC's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                                    Page2\n\n                                                   209\n\f       The gravamen of Plaintiffs allegations concern Brewer's supposed \"whisper campaign\"\n\nto \"wrongly ... cast Dr. Montoya's stellar reputation under a dark cloud\" and the bringing up of\n\nPlaintiff on charges of improper care \"to discredit Dr. Montoya and his ability to practice\n\nmedicine in San Angelo and at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\" Id. at           11 6.15-17.\nPlaintiff further alleges that Brewer \"was and is employed by and acting in furtherance of the\n\nbusiness of (SACMC) and its medical practices\" and \"at all times acted for (SACMC).\" Id. at ,I\n\n6.6. Aside from Brewer, Plaintiff does not specifically allege in his live pleading any other\n\nindividuals who took part in the alleged various defamatory and conspiratorial schemes Brewer\n\nsupposedly perpetrated. Further, Plaintiff alleges no direct or separate liability claims against\n\nSACMC above and apart from the actions of its agent, Brewer.           Instead, SACMC's only\n\npotential liability sounds in the doctrine of respondeat superior.\n\n       Under Texas law, a master can only be held liable for the servant's misdeeds if the\n\nservant committed misdeeds. The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly made this clear. See\n\nKnutson v. Morton Foods, Inc., 603 S.W.2d 805, 807 n. 2 (Tex.1980) (noting \"that where the\n\nemployer's liability rests solely on respondeat superior, an adjudication acquitting the employee\n\nof negligence will [bar] a subsequent suit against the employer\"); see also Johnson v. Ram, 01-\n\n13-00404-CV, 2014 WL 3697881, at *8 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] July 24, 2014)\n\n(refusing to reverse summary judgment dismissing doctor for vicarious liability because\n\nplaintiffs couldn't recover against nurses as a matter of law.)\n\n         In G & H Towing Co. v. Magee, 347 S. W.3d 293 (Tex. 2011 ), the plaintiffs filed a\n\nnegligent entrustment suit against an employee and a suit against his employer. Id. at 294-95.\n\nAfter the employee obtained summary judgment in his favor, the trial court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the employer even though the employer had not specifically sought it. Id.\n\n\n\n\nSACMC's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                      Page3\n\n                                                210\n\fat 295-296.    Finding that \"an employer cannot be vicariously liable in tort when its agent or\n\nemployee has not engaged in tortious conduct,\" the Texas Supreme Court held that even where\n\nsummary judgment is not specifically sought and but nonetheless granted, \"the error is harmless\n\nwhen the omitted cause of action is precluded as a matter of law by other grounds raised in the\n\ncase.\" Id. at 298.\n\n        This Court has already dismissed Brewer from this case under Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure rule 91 (a) and the Texas Citizens Participation Act. As such, it has held that Brewer's\n\nactions or omissions were 1) constitutionally protected and/or 2) had \"no basis in law or in fact.\"\n\nIn other words, Brewer, like the employee in G & H Towing, committed no tortious act.\n\nTherefore, under plain and settled Texas law, SACMC cannot be held liable for Plaintiffs claims\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant SACMC respectfully requests\n\nthat this grant this Motion for Summary Judgment and that judgment be entered dismissing all of\n\nPlaintiffs claims against Defendant with prejudice, and for such other and further relief at law or\n\nin equity as may be shown that Defendant is justly entitled to receive.\n\n\n\n\nSACM C's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                       Page4\n\n                                                 211\n\f                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                         CARR MCGOLDRICK, LLP\n\n                                                             f'Ld,.o\n                                                J         .

MONTOYA, JR., M.D., WEST TEXAS RENAL CARE AND\nWEST TEXAS NEPHROLOGY ask the Court to deny Defendant SAN ANGELO\nCOMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER'S Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n                                       INTRODUCTION\n\n1.      The Plaintiffs are Steve F. Montoya, Jr., M.D., West Texas Renal Care and West Texas\nNephrology. The Plaintiffs sued the hospital based tipon causes of action that were approved by\nthe Texas Supreme Court in a case of a doctor suing the hospital where he had a medical\npractice. The exact same causes of action were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in In Re\nMemorial Hermann Hospital System. 464 S.W. 3d 6'86 (2015). The justices in Memorial\nHermailn case stated \"We hold that Dr. Gomez's petition presents multiple viable anti-competent\nactions;' Id at 713. Attached as Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the pleading of Dr. Gomez from\nthe Memorial Hermann case that was specifically approved by as viable the Texas Supreme\nCourt causes of action. The causes of action approved by the Texas Supreme Court in Memorial\nHermann are:\n\n        ( 1)   Business Disparagement\n        (2)    Defamation\n        (3)    Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations\n        (4)    Improper Restraint of Trade under the Texas Fire Enterprises and Anti-Trust Act\n               of 1983.\n\n        Id. At 695-696\n\n        The Petition of the Plaintiffs followed the approved Petition of Dr. Gomez.\n\n\n\nPLAINTlFFS RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-\nPAGE l OF4\n\f       The Plaintiffs ask the Court to take judicial notice of the Original Petition of the Plaintiffs\nand the Amended Petitions on file to verify that the Plaintiffs are alleging the approved causes of\naction of the Texas Supreme Court, by a physician and his entities in which he practices suing\nthe hospital where he practices medicine. This case is exactly the Memorial Hermann case\napproved by the Texas Supreme Court. The Texas Supreme Court determined Memorial\nHermann in 2015 and has not changed its opinion in the year following the ruling.\n\n       This Traditional Motion for Summary is nothing more than a thinly vailed attempt to get\naround the untimely filing of the Motion to Dismiss under 9I(a) and the Anti-Slapp Motion.\n\n       The finding of the Court concerning Dr. Brewer has no relevance to the causes of action\nbrought against San Angelo Community Medical Center. The causes of action against San\nAngelo Community Medical Center are all separate and independent of Dr. Brewer.\n\n        The Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center does not even attach a single\nfactual affidavit or any affidavit in support of the Summary Judgment.\n\n       The Motion for Summary Judgment is a untimely Motion to Dismiss that has no evidence\nor proof attached.\n\n       San Angelo Community Medical Center filed a Motion for Special Exceptions on August\n14, 2015 the court granted the Special Exceptions on December 3, 2015. The Plaintiffs Petition\nwas amended to comply with the Court order.\n\n       Since the Order of Dismissal of Defendant Dr. Brewer hearing the Plaintiffs have added\nAnti-Trust violations concerning group boycott and violations of the EMTALA standards against\nSan Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n       The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants Constitutional Rights\nto speak freely, associate freely and participate in governmental as permitted by law. These are\nthe requirements to meet in filing a Motion under the Anti-Slapp Statute Tex. C.P.R. C.§27. 005(b)\nand as set out in Paulsen v. Yarrell 455 SW3d 192 (Tex.-App.-Houston [1 st Dist.] 2014, no pet.)\n(quoting In Re Estate o,[Check 438 SW3d at 836).\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the Texas Anti-\nSlapp Statute Chapter 27 includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In Re Lipsky, 2015\nWLJ870073). The evidence of the Plaintiff meets the standard.\n\n      The Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center did not even join in Dr. Brewer's\nMotion to Dismiss w1der 9l(a) or his Anti-Slapp motion.\n\n                                    Request to Strike/Objection\n\n       No Summary Judgment evidence is presented by the Defendant San Angelo Community\nMedical Center. Respondents to the Motion for Summary Judgment object to the Motion\nbecause there is no evidence attached to the Motion. The statements in the body of the argument\n\nPLAINTIFFS RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-\nPAGE20F 4\n\fare heresay and Respondents request the Court to strike those statements as defective and not\nmeeting the standard for Summary Judgment evidence. The statements in the argument are\nconclusory and without factual basis as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP\n166a(c)).\n\n        The Respondents further object to the argument because it does not meet the standard set\nforth for an affidavit in the Texas Supreme Court Radio Station KSCS v. Jennings 750 S.W.2d\n760 (Tex. 1988). The Supreme Court held that affidavit for summary judgment failed to\nestablish that it was based on personal knowledge and was thus inadequate summary judgment\nproof. The argument in the Motion is not a factual affidavit showing proof.\n\n        The Plaintiff objects to the argument because it is not an affidavit which must state\nfacts and cannot merely recite legal conclusions. Brownlee v. Brownlee, 655 S.W. 2d 111, 112\n(Tex. 1984). In this case the argument does not meet the KSCS or Brownlee standards.\n\n            SUMMARY-JUDGMENT EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY PLAINTIFF\n\n2.     To support the facts in this response, Plaintiffs offer the following summary-judgment\nevidence attached to this response and incorporates the evidence into this response by reference.\n\n       Exhibit 1: Certified copy of Pleading approved by the Texas Supreme Court as valid\ncauses of action in Memorial Hennann Hospital System.\n\n        Exhibit 2: Is the affidavit of Steve F. Montoya, Jr., M.D. one of the Plaintiffs. In the\naffidavit he states the facts and refutes the allegations for the dismissal under TRCP 9l(a) and\nthe Anti-Slapp allegations.\n\n       Exhibit 3: Is the affidavit of Dr. Hunt that confirms the causes of actions and the facts of\nthe Anti-Trust actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\nA.     Defendant did not disprove plaintiff's cause of action as a matter of law.\n\n3.      A defendant is entitled to summary judgment on a plaintiff's cause of action if the\ndefendant can disprove at least one element of the cause of action as a matter of law. Sw. Elec.\nPower Co. v. Grant, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2002); see Tello v. Bank One, N.A., 218 S.W.3d\n109, 113 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.). The Defendant has not disproved any\nof Plaintiffs elements in their causes of action.\n\n                                            PRAYER\n\n4.      For these reasons, Plaintiffs ask the Court to deny Defendant's Motion for Summary\nJudgment. Plaintiffs ask the Court to grant Plaintiffs objections so they will be preserved for\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-\nPAGE 3 OF4\n\f                                                    Respectfully Submitted\n\n                                                    Paul Craig Laird II Law Firm, PLLC\n\n                                                    Isl Paul Craig Laird II\n                                                    By: Paul Craig Laird II\n                                                    800 W.

The su1·geon in turn\n\n           determines, based upon the quality of the surgical and post-surgical equipment, staff,\n\n           and facilities, the hospital in which the surgical care is delivered. The surgeon's\n\n           decisions as tu whel'e tu perform his or her surgeries directly impact the profitability of\n\n           the h08pitals in the specific conununity (in the West Houston and Katy community, the\n\n           surgical market is primarily at Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center and\n\n           The Methodist We.st Houston Hospital). As a result, the ability to fairly compare the\n\n           reputations of surgeons in a medical market community such as West Houston and\n\n                                                       -5-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22AM                    713-755-1451                           Page 7 / 18\n\n\n\n\n          Katy affects patient choice and the continued availability of the highest quality patient\n\n          care. Improperly manipulating comparative information and reputations of suxgeons in\n\n          a medical market such as West Houston and Katy creates an improper distortion of free\n\n          and informed patient choice and options for medical care.\n\n          5.4   The appropriate way for any health ca1·e provider to attract patients in a\n\n          competitive market is by actually providing and being known for providing the highest\n\n          quality of care. The illegal and unjust way (11utti11g patients and their free choice in the\n\n          market in jeopardy) is to malign., spread w1true 01\" misleading ill.formation, or othe1wise\n\n          smear the reputation of a highly qualified surgeon in the same medical community.\n\n          5.5   With new management and operational changes at Memorial City Memorial\n\n          Hermann, including the arrival of Mr. Alexander as CEO, Dr. Gomez became\n\n          increasingly concerned about a decline in the quality of patient care at the hospital The\n\n          decline in patient care arose from the understaffing of qualified nurses in the hospital's\n\n          intensive care unit (ICU), general care units and the emergency room; the lack of\n\n          consistent procedurnl safeguards fo1· monitoring patients; and the failure to update\n\n          critical equipment. Memmial Hermann also began deliberate efforts to restrict surgical\n\n          care for the most critically ill patients, pushing for abandonment of \"salvage\" cases (for\n\n          example, eme1·gency surgery on patients in active cardiac arrest, able to be saved ill\n\n          some but not all cfrcumstances by a qualified surgeon).       \\I\\Jhat this meant to patients\n\n          most in need of a surgeon with Dr. Gomez' unique qualifications was the elimination of\n\n          patient choice and poten.tially life-saving prncedw·es ill favor of potentially higher\n\n          statistical ranking for Memorial Hermann as calculated by U. S. News and World\n\n                                                        -6-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                          Page 8 / 18\n\n\n\n\n           Report.\n\n           5.6   In response to D1·. Gomez repeatedly speaking out about these concerns, as well\n\n           as the likelihood Dr. Gomez would move his surgeries to The Methodist Hospital-\n\n           West Houston as the staffing and equipment dysfun.ctions contm.ued, Dr. Macris and\n\n           Mr. Alexander, and others, joined in a calculated and deliberate scheme to destroy\n\n           Dr. Gomez' reputation and ability to practice medicine in the West Houston and Katy\n\n           conununity. Dr. Macris wanted to disadvantage a skilled competitor, and Memorial\n\n           Hermann needed to avoid losing patients by working with D1·. MaCI\"is in capturing the\n\n           patients that would have otherwise been treated by Dr. Gomez at another facility.\n\n           5.7    Quality patient care is the most important goal of any legitimate health care\n\n           provider.     Under both fedel'al and state law, hospitals and their medical staff are\n\n           required to follow st1·ict standards for peer review evaluation and monitoring. These\n\n           peer review standards rely upon a consistent and well-developed process to ensure that\n\n           favoritism, improper motives, a:t'ld manipulation for unjust purposes play no role.\n\n           Memorial Hermann had such a process in place at all relevant timesr but Defendants\n\n           acted to evade and avoid its safeguards while manipulating the rules for peer review\n\n           and utilization review for their own wrongful purposes.\n\n           5.8    In order to disa·edit Dr. Gomez and Cl'ush his ability to practice medicine in the\n\n           We~t Houston and Katy comm.unity, Dr. Macri::; and Memorial Hermann began\n\n           com.piling (and distorting) statistical data related to the mortality rates of Dr. Gomez's\n\n           patients.   The manipulated data, which was reported using neither the generally\n\n           accepted methodologies for proper peer review comparison nor basic scientific\n\n                                                        -7-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                          Page 9 I 18\n\n\n\n\n           principles, was intended to create the appearance that patients were more likely to die\n\n           in Dr. Gomez's care as compared to other surgeons at Memorial Hermann. At bottom,\n\n           the statistical information compiled and manipulated by Dr. Macris and Memorial\n\n           Hermann was geared to demonstrating a fa1sehood: that Dr. Gomez was an\n\n           incompetent physician undersel'ving of his reputation and the trust his hard work had\n\n           earned in the West Houston and Katy medical commwlity.\n\n           5.9    Rather than comply with the medical peer review process and its safeguards\n\n           against im.prnper :i1-ulue11ce, Defendants attempted to evade these well-e.stablished\n\n           protocols and the standing medical peer review committee at the hospital. Defendants\n\n           then set up an emergency \"meeting\" and presented Dr. Gomez with the option of either\n\n           immediately suspending his practice or agreemg to active interventional monitoring\n\n           under Defendants' supervision.      Both \"options\" would have effectively destroyed\n\n           Dr. Gomez' reputati011. iJ.1 the medical community, severely curtailing patient choice, as\n\n           well as the opportunity for these and future patients to benefit from Dr. Gomez'\n\n           advanced abilities in cardiothoracic and surgical procedures.\n\n           5.10   At the time Dr. Gomez was presented with these \"options\" by Defendants, he\n\n -\n (\"-.\n           was also told that he would not be able to review at any meaningful level the alleged\n\n           data supporting the emergency action outside the usual peer review process (the data\n\n           that ultimately proved to be improperly manipulated and without a basic medical and\n\n           scientific grounding). Defendants also refused Dr. Gomez the opportunity to meet with\n\n           or present any information. to Defendants and those acting with Defendants, and\n\n           instead insisted that Dr. Gomez' quahty of care could not be evaluated by the\n\n                                                        -8-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                           Page 10 / 18\n\n\n\n\n           established medical peer l'eview committee.\n\n           5.11   Fortuitously, and despite Defendants' best efforts to continue the railroading of\n\n           Dr. Gomez, the actual peer review committee at Memorial Hermann intervened to\n\n           require Defendants to present their data, and other alleged reasons for attempting to\n\n           block Dr. Gomez' continued practice at Memol'ial Hermann, to the peer 1·eview process.\n\n           Notwithstanding Defendants' presentation of the manipulated patient data, the\n\n           evaluation of the peer 1·eview committee exunernted D1·. Gomez. During the process,\n\n           Defeudants were provided with clear and convincing evidence that the manipulated\n\n           data used to\" compare\" Dr. Gomez could not be relied upon for any legitimate purpose.\n\n           5.12   After completing its comprehensive evaluation, including comparison with\n\n           D1·. Macris' own patient care outcome statistics, the pee1· review committee's rejection of\n\n           Defendants' anti-competitive and unlawful abuse of the peer review process should\n\n           have deterred Defendants from. their continued misconduct. Unfortunately, Defendants\n\n           elected to instead continue a whisper campaign of selective and improper\n\n           dissemination of both the manipulated data and othe1· misinformation within the\n\n           medical community. The first indication Dr. Gomez received that Defendants' smear\n\n           campaign had continued w1.abated was when the same type of manipulated and\n\n           misleading data was presented by Dr. Macris on November 1, 2011 at a non-peer review\n\n           meeting organized by MHMD i11. a publicly displayed \"comparison\", readily\n\n           identifiable with Dr. Gomez and intended to be seen as such.       The circumstances and\n\n           details uf this public defamation are set forth in greate1· detail in Paragraph 7.3 below,\n\n           based on the infmmation available at this time.\n\n                                                        -9-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                      713-755-1451                         Page 11 / 18\n\n\n\n\n           5.13   Mark Twain once noted that, \"A lie can travel around the world before the truth\n\n           can even finish putting on its pants.\" Defendants' illegal and anti-competitive acts\n\n          unfairly cast Dr. Gomez' stellar reputation under a dark cloud. As could be anticipated,\n\n           if not intended, Defendants' calculated wrongdoing also imposed substantial economic,\n\n           emotional, and physical impacts upon Dr. Gomez. Facing continuing hal'assment and\n\n           improper attempts to interfere with his practice at Memorial Hermann, Dr. Gomez\n\n           resigued his pdvileges at Memorial Herma1m in May 2012.

Montoya, Jr. M.D. and after\nbeing duly sworn under oath stated.\n\n      \"My name is Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D. I am the Plaintiff in this case. I have\nknowledge of all the facts of this affidavit as Plaintiff and all facts are within my personal\nknowledge true and correct and that I was involved with facts stated.\n\n       I have not used any patient name, except where authorized by the patient or their agent, to\navoid any HIP AA or privacy violation.\n\n       1. I was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical Center in\n           1981.   I have full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center. This case does not involve the rights of Defendant San\n           Angelo Community Medical Center to speak freely, associate freely, and participate\n           in government as permitted by law. The facts of the case are that I have full staff\n           privileges to practice nephrology medicine at San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\n\n       2. Part of my practice and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a\n           rotating system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital\n           and emergency room pursuant to the EMTALA Medicare call list. When you are the\n           named specialist you receive a call from the emergency room physician that a doctor\n           with your specialty is needed for a patient. A big part of my practice was obtaining\n           new patients and treating existing patients that came to the emergency room that\n           needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 I have gotten new patients from the emergency\n           room.\n\n\n       3. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to treat\n           either new or existing patients for nephrology care at the San Angelo Community\n           Medical Center. Since 2008 I have received only one call from the emergency room\n           or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist. A nephrologist treats patients with\n           kidney problems and or disease. The one call I received was for treatment of a new\n           patient or existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\f4. The one time call for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 I was\n   called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on\n   duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n   informed me that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure. I was informed my\n   name was on the call board in the emergency room as nephrologist on call. Both of\n   the above doctors asked me to consult concerning treatment for that patient. I gave\n   my initial consult advice/orders of treatment to both doctors. This consultation call\n   was to me at 9:38 p.m. I informed them I would come see the patient and then review\n   the test results and determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as\n   Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record, removing the\n   name of the patient for HIPPA privacy, showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n\n5. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the\n   patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult and treatment by me and\n   consulted another nephrologist. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is one that\n   is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Kirk Brewer,\n   M.D. without seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of\n   nephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic\n   loss. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record\n   showing the facts on January 25, 2014.\n\n\n6. In removing me as the nephrologist the hospital published a statement that I was not a\n   competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center emergency room. San Angelo Community Medical Center through\n   its agents and representatives was aware that its actions would become known to the\n   staff physicians of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that there was by\n   conduct and a whisper campaign saying I (Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D.) should not be\n   allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\f7. The statements and actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and\n   through its agents and representatives were published by conduct. The actions were\n   referring to keep from treating my own patients and any new patient coming to the\n   San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room.                The statement(s) and\n   actions were defamatory and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n8. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat\n   either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 I have only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new or existing\n   patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused\n   substantial injury to the Plaintiffs and damaged their ability to compete, because the\n   Plaintiffs depend on these referrals and consults to build and maintain the nephrology\n   practice. A majority of patients who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney\n   disease in a hospital later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems;\n   the most common of such continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney\n   dialysis patient will need treatment for six years, and each such patient would mean\n   revenue to the Plaintiffs practice of approximately $100,000 per year. I estimates that\n   the Plaintiffs have lost at least I 00 long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the\n   present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give me patient\n   referrals or consults. I estimate that this lack of referrals has thus cost Plaintiffs\n   $1,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n9. The defamatory statements and actions are untrue. I am a competent and qualified\n   nephrologist to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. If I were\n   not a competent and qualified nephrologist I would have been removed from the staff\n   of the hospital.\n\n\n10. The actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and through its agents and\n   representatives were intentional or done with negligence when San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center knew that the statement was false and the actions would\n   lead a reasonable prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory\n\f   potential. The actions interred with my ability to make a living as a nephrologist on\n   staff at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n11. The rules at San Angelo Community Medical Center and of the staff of San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center are to have a new patient in the emergency room or\n   hospital that needs a specialist consultation assigned to the name off the rotating\n   consultation list. The consultation list is kept by San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center by and through its agents and representatives. By San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center not following this procedure I did not receive any consultation\n   requests from the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center in 2008-present and one in 2014.\n\n\n12. Attached to this affidavit as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n   existing patient of mine Mrs. Welch tried to see me in the emergency room of San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not call me\n   to treat my existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and I have treated her\n   for at least 20 years. These actions interfered with my right to treat my patient and to\n   the patient's rights to pick her physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of\n   rights (see attached Exhibit D) and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached\n   Exhibit E)\n\n\n13. Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also over\n   90 years of age and has been my patient for at least 10 years requested me when she\n   went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see me. This action\n   interfered with my right to treat my patient and to the patient's rights to pick her\n   physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of rights (see attached Exhibit D)\n   and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached exhibit E)\n\n\n\n14. A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician.   Attached as Exhibit\n   F is a true and correct copy of the patient bill of rights posted at the San Angelo\n\f   Community Medical Center. Attached as Exhibit E a true and correct copy of the\n   dialysis patient bill of rights concerning care of a dialysis patient. Both of these\n   patient bills of rights were violated by San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n15. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient referred in Exhibits A and B as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then\n   without ever seeing the patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult\n   and treatment and consulted another nephrologist.        I went to the call board and\n   witnessed my name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014.\n   The San Angelo Community Medical Center is required to have an official EMTALA\n   Medicare call list for on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center to take Medicare patients.       This is the list my name was on and was\n   intentionally ignored. This also violates a patient's right to choose their physician.\n   This list was followed until Dr. Brewer came to San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is\n   one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Dr.\n   Brewer did not see the patient when he removed me as the treating nephrologist he\n   issued the change via a telephone order (see Exhibit B). Kirk Brewer, M.D. without\n   seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of nephrologist\n   was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n16. By the actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are controlled\n   by their supervisor or lead physician Kirk Brewer, M.D. through the above actions\n   intentionally interfered with my practice of medicine at San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center to keep me from receiving patients as required by the EMTALA\n   Medicare call list.\n\n\n17. The Defendants' anticompetitive conduct has harmed consumers and others who pay\n   for nephrology services in the relevant market by increasing the costs of those\n   services. This is demonstrated by the chart attached hereto as Exhibit G. Before Dr.\n   Brewer's group of hospitalists became the attending physicians for all nephrology\n\f          patients at SA.CMC, nephrology patients would be referred to nie (Dr. Montoya) who\n          would serve as the attending physician for the patient. This arrangement avoided the\n          \"middle man\" which now exists, as the hospitalists now usually serve as an additional\n          charging entity between the patient and the nephrology specialist. Even if the\n          hospitalists could do the same work as me or my partner used to provide, the patient\n          (and/or insurance and taxpayer-funded Medicare/Medicaid) still faces increased cost\n          for the same nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services\n          than I charge. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare\n          allowable rate, which adds up to average charges of $506.85 per day. See Exhibit\n          G. In approximately 2010, at the SACMC emergency room, Dr. Brewer\n          explicitly told me that he and his group of hospitalists will always charge at the\n          comprehensive rate, regardless of medical necessity, because those charges\n          maximize revenue for Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists. · I, however,\n          charge at the \"Moderate\" Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to an average cost\n          of $346.13 per day. The difference between these charges is $160.72 per nephrology\n          patient per average hospital stay. Over the course of a year, consumers/payors for\n          nephrology services have thus paid thousands more for the hospitalists' physician and\n          nephrology services than they would have paid for care from me who is a physician\n          specialist in nephrology.\n     All of the actions described in this affidavit are done by or for the Defendant San Angelo\nCommunity Medical Center.\n\n       Further affiant saith not.\"\n\n       Signed this 4th day of May, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n         Subscribed and sworn to me the undersigned notary by Steve F. Montoya, Jr., M.D. on\nthe 4th day of May, 2016.\n\n\n\n                              ~9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~\";'{\n                                  ~··\"'\"~               DALILA CRUZ      ~\n                                {~*: r}            MY COMMISSION EXPIRES               ~\n                                 \\l'\"'•1Tf11~\"'\n                                       •:.,,•~..

The Motion to Dismiss is based upon Texas Anti-Slapp Statute, Chapter 27 Actions\n         invoking the exercise of certain Constitutional Rights.\n\n      2. No affidavits are attached to the Motion.\n\n      3. Attached as Exhibit 2 hereto is the affidavit of Dr. Montoya as evidence in support of\n         his response.\n\n      4. The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants Constitutional\n         Rights to speak freely, associate freely and participate in governmental as permitted\n         by law. These are the requirements to meet in filing a Motion under the Anti-Slapp\n         Statute Tex.C.P.R.C.§27.005(b) and as set out in Paulsen v. Yarrell 455 SW3d 192\n         (Tex.-App.-Houston [1 st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (quoting In Re Estate of Check 438\n         SW3d at 836).\n\n      5. The evidence presented by Dr. Montoya is that this case deals with the same standard\n         as setforth in the recent Texas Supreme Court of In Re Memorial Herman Hospital et\n         al 464 SW3d 686, 695-696 2015. This case is on concerning anti-trust, business\n         damages and a campaign to stop competition by Dr. Montoya at San Angelo\n         Community Medical Center. Attached as Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the pleading\n         approved by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n      6. The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the Texas\n         Statute includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In Re Lipsky, 2015 Wll 870073).\n         This evidence of Dr. Montoya meets the standard.\n\n\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGE I OF7\n\n                                           225\n\f                  ---        -    -    ..   -------·-·---·----·-------~---·-----···---        .\n\n\n\n\n       7. In this case the evidence is both direct, actual and circwnstantial. The pleadings and\n          affidavit of Dr. Montoya prove that his case is real and not a continually protected\n          case.\n\n       8. Attached to this Response is the affidavit of John Hunt, M.D. (Exhibit 3) attached\n          hereto as if setforth at length that proves the whisper campaign and that the call list is\n          a requirement of Medicare rules and that the actions of San Angelo Community\n          Medical Center were to hurt Dr. Montoya economically and professionally.\n\n       9. Plaintiffs Business Disparagement and Defamation Claims Should Not Be\n          Dismissed\n\n         \"The TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits designed only to\nchill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.\" In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579,\n589 (Tex. 2015) (emphasis added), citing Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 27.002 (balancing \"the\nconstitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise\nparticipate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law\" against \"the rights of a\nperson to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury\"). The TCPA is not applicable to this\ncase, as Plaintiffs causes of action are primarly concerned with Defendants' anticompetitive\nactions, and injury to competition in the relevant markets of nephrology services and referrals for\nnephrology services in San Angelo, Texas. As Plaintiff's Fifth Amended Petition makes clear,\nthe conspiracy which Defendants perpetrated to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals began in 2007.\nAlthough Plaintiff details some specific defamations which occurred in 2014, those defamations\nare merely representative of the anticompetitive scheme to which Dr. Montoya was being\nsubjected. Defendants' group boycott and monopolization/attempted monopolization of the\nrelevant market began much earlier, so even if Plaintiff's pleadings do not set forth a prima facie\ncase of defamation and business disparagement, Plaintiff's antitrust claims should not be\ndismissed because they are not based on those instances of defamation.\n\n        In any event, Plaintiff has set forth a prima facie case of defamation and business\ndisparagement by clear and specific evidence in his affidavit and Fifth Amended Petition. The\n\"clear and specific\" evidence which is required to pass a TCP A challenge can be contained in the\nplaintiff's pleadings or in affidavits. In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 591 (Tex. 2015). In\ndetermining if the \"clear and specific evidence\" standard is met, the court must view the\npleadings in the light most favorable to the party opposing the TCPA motion. Sloat v. Rathbun,\n2015 WL 6830927, at *3 (Tex.App.-Austin, 2015) (\"we view the pleadings in the light most\nfavorable to [the non-movant]; i.e., favoring the conclusion that her claims are not predicated on\nprotected expression.\"); see also Cheniere Energy, Inc. v. Lotfl, 449 S.W.3d 210, 214\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (reviewing pleadings and evidence in light most\nfavorable to non-movant)\n\n\n\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGE20F 7\n\n                                               226\n\f        A prima facie standard generally requires only the \"minimum quantum of evidence\nnecessary to support a rational inference that the allegation of fact is true.\" In re Lipsky, 460\nS.W.3d 579, 590 (Tex. 2015), quoting In re E.1 DuPont de Nemours & Co., 136 S.W.3d 218,\n223 (Tex. 2004) (per curiam). \"In a defamation case that implicates the TCPA, pleadings and\nevidence that establishes the facts of when, where, and what was said, the defamatory nature of\nthe statements, and how they damaged the plaintiff should be sufficient to resist a TCP A motion\nto dismiss.\" In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579,591 (Tex. 2015).\n\n        Plaintiff has plainly satisfied this requirement. As shown in Plaintiff's Fifth Amended\nPetition, Dr. Brewer's defamation was published by conduct when he removed Dr. Montoya\nfrom consulting with a patient on January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. The defamation was published\nto the hospitalist overseeing that patient, and the nephrologists who was eventually called in to\nconsult as a replacement for Dr. Montoya. The defamation was eventually spread to all\nhospitalists and emergency room doctors at SACMC. Dr. Montoya has also set forth a detailed\ncalculation and ·explanation of the damages he has suffered as a result of the Defendants' scheme\nto deprive him of nephrology referrals and consults. See Plaintifr s Fifth Amended Petition,\nparagraph 5. With regard to the January 2014 defamation, Plaintiff has established his prima\nfacie case with clear and specific evidence.\n\n       10.     Even if Plaintifrs Defamations Are Dismissed, Plaintiff's Remaining Claims\n               Are Not Subject to the TCPA\n\n        The TCPA is clearly meant to apply to individual claims, not to an entire lawsuit when\nallegedly defamatory lawsuits are only important to certain claims. Breach of contract claims,\nfor example, would not ordinarily be dismissed merely because a Plaintiff failed to plead a prima\nfacie defamation case under the TCPA.\n\n        The TCPA's definition of \"legal action\" makes this clear. The TCPA states that \"If a\nlegal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to a party's exercise of the right of free\nspeech, right to petition, or right of association, that party may file a motion to dismiss the legal\naction.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 27.003(a).\n\nThe TCPA then defines a \"Legal action\" as \"a lawsuit, cause of action, petition, complaint,\ncross-claim, or counterclaim or any other judicial pleading or filing that requests legal or\nequitable relief.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 27.003(a).\n        The only cases which have interpreted the TCAP's definition of \"legal action\" have held\nthat the term \"is broad and evidences a legislative intent to treat any claim by any party on an\nindividual and separate basis.\" Hicks v. Group & Pension Administrators, Inc., 473 S.W.3d 518,\n529 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi, 2015), citing Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Dallas, Inc.\nv. Ward, 401 S.W.3d 440, 443 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2013, pet. denied). In Hicks, the court\nindividually examined each of the claims which allegedly violated the TCPA and dismissed two\n\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGE 3 OF7\n\n                                               227\n\fof those claims while refusing to dismiss two other claims because the TCP A challenge to those\nclaims was not timely filed.\n\n         Writing a concurrence in the case of Serafine v. Blunt, 466 S.W.3d 352, 393-94\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2015, no pet.), Justice Pemberton wrote that where a \"'legal action' is based\non, relates to, or is in response to\" (whatever that phrase may mean) both expression protected by\nthe Act and other unprotected activity, the \"legal action\" is subject to dismissal only to the extent\nit 'is based on, relates to, or is in response to' the protected conduct, as opposed to being subject\nto dismissal in its entirety\" Id. at 394. Justice Pemberton then pointed to this result finds support\nin several features of the the TCPA's text, and he explained as follows:\n\n       The first is that the TCPA defines \"legal action\"-that which is subject to dismissal-\n       both expansively and variously, as previously noted, referring to everything from an\n       entire action or proceeding to particular facts that underlie a claim or cause of action.\n       This nomenclature contemplates the drawing of distinctions not only between claims, but\n       also between factual theories, as here.\n\n       Adding further support to this construction are the dual overarching purposes that the\n       Legislature has declared the TCPA is to serve: \"encourage and safeguard the\n       constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise\n       participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law, at the same time,\n       protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\"\n       Neither purpose is advanced by holding that a claim is wholly subject to dismissal merely\n       because it partly \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to\" protected expression under\n       the Act. Nor would these purposes be served by the converse holding that the claim is\n       wholly beyond the Act merely it \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to\" some\n       unprotected activity.\n\nId. at 393-394. The Serafine court later cited to \"longstanding principles of Texas jurisprudence\"\ncounsel against \"a construction of the TCPA that would mandate presumptive dismissal of an\nentire claim merely because its factual underpinnings might include even one allegation that\nimplicates the Act's protections.\" Id. at 394.\n\nSeveral cases have applied the TCPA as Justice Pemberton interprets it. For example, in Tervita,\nUC v. Sutterfield, 482 S.W.3d 280, 286-87 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2015, pet. denied), the court\ndismissed some of the plaintiffs claims based on conduct that occurred during a TOI-WC\nhearing, but refused to dismiss other claims because the movant had not shown \"by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that [plaintiffs] allegations were based on [defendant's] exercise\nof its right to petition or its right of association.\" Id. at 287. The Tervita court thus held that the\nTCPA did not apply to the plaintiffs \"employment discrimination based on (1) creating a hostile\nwork environment, (2) representing that he was \"not entitled to pursue benefits\" under the Texas\nWorker's Compensation Act, and (3) wrongful discharge.\" Id. at 286; see also Serafine v. Blunt,\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGE 4 OF 7\n\n                                                228\n\f466 S.W.3d 352, 359-60 (Tex.App.-Austin 2015) (\"to the extent that the Blunts' tortious-\ninterference counterclaim is based in part on Serafine's alleged threats made outside the context\nof the lawsuit, Serafine has not satisfied her initial burden to show that these portions of the\nBlunts' counterclaims are subject to the [TCPA].\")\n\n        The same result occurred in Sloat v. Rathbun, 2015 WL 6830927, at *6-7 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 2015, pet. filed). In that case, the court rejected the defendants' argument that plaintiffs\nentire suit was based on conduct protected under the TCP A, when the plaintiff had also plead\nfacts which showed stalking and other tortious conduct. The court rejected application of the\nTCPA and stated as follows:\n\n       [Plaintiffs claims] are garden-variety tort claims based on specific conduct that the\n       [Defendants] have failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, implicates\n       the exercise of their rights of \"free speech,\"\" association,\" or \"to petition.\"\n\nSloat v. Rathbun, 2015 WL 6830927, at *8 (Tex.App.-Austin 2015, pet. filed). The Sloat court\nheld that the defendant had failed to demonstrate, by a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" that the\nplaintiffs causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy by\nintrusion on seclusion and by public disclosure of private facts, and tortious interference with\ncontract were \"based on, related to, or in response to\" defendants' \"exercise of their right of free\nspeech, right to petition, or right of association.\" Id. at *9. The defendants in Sloat had thus\nfailed to establish thatthe TCPA applied to the case. Id.\n\n       11. Plaintiff Has Valid Causes of Action for Antitrust Violations\n\n        As noted above, Plaintiffs defamation claims are examples of how Defendant enforced\nits anticompetitive scheme to deprive Dr. Montoya of nephrology referrals, but Plaintiff's\nantitrust claims are primarily based on the illegal scheme itself and not individual defamatory\nstatements. Plaintiff has plainly set forth valid antitrust claims as they largely mirror the causes\nof action which the Supreme Court held to be valid in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital System,\n464 S.W.3d 686 (Tex. 2015).\n\n        The causes of action in this case, along with the underlying facts, are very similar to the\ncauses of action approved by the Supreme Court in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital. In both\ncases a doctor who has privileges at a hospital has alleged that the defendants conspired to\nprevent him from obtaining patient referrals. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711;\nPlaintiff 's Fifth Amended Petition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5. In both cases, the alleged\nconspirators consist of the hospital itself, a physician practice group, and individual doctors who\npractice at the hospital In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 695; Plaintiff's Fifth Amended\nPetition. In both cases, the doctors have explained how other doctors how other doctors are a\nprimary source of referrals, and that these referrals are required for a doctor to be able to\ncompete. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711; Fifth Amended Petition, pp. 6.2, 6.3, 6.8-\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGES OF 7\n\n                                              229\n\f6.11. Both lawsuits allege that the defendants intentionally interfered with the plaintiff's\nlongstanding practice for obtaining referrals from other doctors in the community, and that the\ndefendants' acts constituted a \"concerted effort ... to restrain competition in and monopolize\"\nthe relevant market. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 708; Plaintiffs Fifth Amended\nPetition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 7.1, 12.7. Both lawsuits allege that the defendants impugned\nthe reputation of the plaintiff doctors through a covert whisper campaign which convinced other\ndoctors not to refer patients to the plaintiff doctors. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 696;\nPlaintiff's Fifth Amended Petition, paragraph 6.15-6.17. Both lawsuits allege that the plaintiff\ndoctor lost a substantial amount of business from referrals due to the anticompetitive conspiracy\nagainst them. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711 (plaintiff alleged that \"referral patterns\nchanged\" so that he was no longer the \"number one\" physician, and that following the conduct\nat issue, another physician received more referrals); Plaintiff's Fifth Amended Petition,\nparagraph 7.11 and 13.3-13.4 (Dr. Montoya received 10-20 calls per month from the SACMC\nemergency room to treat new or existing patients before the anticompetitive conspiracy began,\nbut he has only received a single call from emergency room for a new patient since then; all\nreferrals now go to the nephrologists at WTMA). In both this case and in In re Memorial\nHermann Hospital, the plaintiff doctor alleges that the defendants' acts \"constitute illegal\nmonopolization, attempted monopolization, and/or conspiracy to monopolize under Texas law.\"\nin In re Memorial Hermann Hospital, ; Plaintifrs Fifth Amended Petition, paragraph 12.7.\nPlaintiff has plainly stated a valid cause of action under the antitrust laws of Texas which is in no\nway designed only to chill Defendants' First Amendment rights. \"\" In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d\n579, 589 (Tex. 2015) (\"The TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits\ndesigned only to chill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.\") (emphasis\nadded).

FACTUAL BACI<GROUND\n\n\n             5.1    Since returning after advanced training to practice medicine in his hometown of\n\n             Houston, Texas, Dr. Gomez worked hard to build a stellar reputation for quality patient\n\n             care, technical excellence, and outstanding professionalism in cardiothoracic and\n\n             genernl surgery in the West Houston and Katy community. Dr. Gomez cares about his\n\n             patients, his fellow medical professionals, and his conununity, and his practice\n\n             expanded over a number of years with continuing referrals from medical professionals\n\n                                                              -4-\n\n\n                                                              235\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                            Page 6 / 18\n\n\n\n\n          aware of his well-dese1·ved reputation for outstanding patient care.\n\n          5.2    Dr. Gomez's skills and specialized abilities for patients requiring cardio-thoracic\n\n                                         11\n          and general surgeries, from basic\" open heart surgery to advanced robotic-assisted\n\n          surgical procedures, were actively promoted for many years by Memorial He1·mann as\n\n          part of its own marketing efforts in the West Houston and Katy medical community.\n\n          Dr. Gomez's practice was further enhanced by his pioneering implementation of \"off\n\n          the pump\" surgel'y and robotic-assisted ca1·diuthoracic procedures in. the Houston .\n\n          medical community. \"Off the pump surgery\" eliminates the need for the U8e of a heart-\n\n          lung machine by-pass during surgery and gi·eatly enhanced patient care and outcomes.\n\n          Robotfo-assisted s~gery, which typically eliminates the need to crack open the patient's\n\n          sternum in favor of much smaller entry ports for the robotic surgical tools, likewise led\n\n          to better outcomes and quicker recoveries for patients for~te enough to come under\n\n          Dr. Gomez' care.\n\n          5.3   The recommendation of the referring physicians to the patient directly impacts\n\n          the choice of the specific smgeon entrw,1:ed with patient care. The sw·geon in turn\n\n          determines, based upon the quality of the surgical and post-surgical equipment, staff,\n\n         and facilities, the hospital in which the surgical care is delivered. The surgeon's\n\n          decisions as to whei·e to perform his or her surgeries directly impact the profitability of\n\n         the hospitals in the specific conununity (in the West Houston and Katy community, the\n\n         surgical market is primarily at Memorial Hem1ann Memorial City Medical Center and\n\n         The Methodist West Houston Huspital). As a result, the ability tu fairly compare the\n\n         reputations of surgeons in a medical market community such as West Houston and\n\n                                                     -5-\n\n                                                    236\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                           Page 7 / 18\n\n\n\n\n          Katy affects patient choice and the co11tinued availability of the highest quality patient\n\n          care. Improperly manipulating comparative information and reputations of surgeons in\n\n          a medical market such as West Houston and Katy creates an improper distortion of free\n\n          and informed patient choice and options for medical care.\n\n          5.4    The appropriate way for any health ca1·e provider to attract patients in a\n\n          competitive market is by actually providing and being known for providing the highest\n\n          quality uf care. The illegal ,md unjust way (putti11g patients and their free choice hl the\n\n          market h1 jeopardy) is to malign, spread w,true 01· misleading information, or othe1wise\n\n          smear the reputation of a highly qualified surgeon in the same medical community.\n\n          5.5    With new management and operational changes at Memorial City Memorial\n\n          Hermann, including the arrival of Mr. Alexander as CEO, Dr. Gomez became\n\n          increasingly concerned about a decline in the quality of patient care at the hospital. The\n\n          decline in patient care arose from the understaffing of qualified nurses in the hospital's\n\n          intensive care unit (ICU), general care units and the emergency room; the lack of\n\n          consistent procedural safeguards for monitoring patients; and the failure to update\n\n          critical equipment. Memorial Hermann also began deliberate efforts to restrict surgical\n\n          care for the most critically ill patients, pushing for abandonment of \"salvage\" cases (for\n\n          example, eme1·gency surgery on patients in active cardiac arrest, able tu be saved in\n\n         some but not all circull'lbiances by a qualified surgeon).   What this meant to patients\n\n         most in need of a surgeon with Dr. Gomez' unique qualifications was the elimination of\n\n         patient choice and potentially life-saving procedw·es in favor uf potentially higher\n\n         statistical ranking for Memorial Hermann as calculated by U.

Gomez repeatedly speaking out about these concerns, as well\n\n            as the likelihood Dr. Gomez would move his surgeries to The Methodist Hospital-\n\n            West Houston as the staffing and equipment dysfunctions continued, Dr. Macris and\n\n            Mr. Alexander, and others, joined in a calculated and deliberate scheme to destroy\n\n            Dr. Gomez' reputation and ability to practice medicine in the West Houston and Katy\n\n            conmmnity. _Dr. Mac_ris wal'~ted to disadv~ntage a skilled competitor, and Memorial\n\n            Hermann needed to avoid losing patit'llts by working with 01·. Macri::; in capturing the\n\n            patients that would have otherwise been treated by Dr. Gomez at another facility.\n\n            5.7   Quality patient care is ·the most important goal of any legitimate health care\n\n            provider.   Under both federal_ and state law, hospitals and their medical staff are\n\n            required to follow stl'ict standards for peer review evaluation and monitoring. These\n\n            peer review standards rely upon a consistent and well-developed process to ensure that\n\n            favoritism, improper motives, and manipulation for unjust purposes play no role.\n\n            Memorial Hermann had such a process in place at all relevant times, but Defendants\n\n            acted to evade and avoid its safeguards while manipulating the rules for peer review\n\n            and utilization review for their own wrongful purposes.\n\n           5.8    ht order to discredit Dr. Gomez and crush his ability tu practice medicine in the\n\n           West HoUb1on and Katy conuuunity, Dr. Macris and Mell\\orial Hermann began\n\n           compiling (and distorting) statistical data related to the mortality rates of Dr. Gomez's\n\n           patients.

At bottom,\n\n                the statistical information compiled and manipulated by Dr. Macris and Memorial\n\n                Hermann was geared to demonstrating a falsehood: that Dr. Gomez was an\n\n                incompetent physician undersel'ving of his reputation and the ti·ust his hard work had\n\n                earned in the West Houston and Katy medical community.\n\n                5.9    Rather than comply with the medical peer review process and its safeguards\n\n                against im.proper :influence, Defendants attempted to evade these well-established\n\n                protocols and the standing medical peer review committee at the hospital Defendants\nj .\n                then set up an emerge11cy \"meeting'' and presented Dr. Gomez with the option of either\n\n                immediately suspending his practice or agreeing to active interventional monitoring\n\n                under Defendants' supervision.      Both \"options'' would have effectively destroyed\n\n                Dr. Gomez' reputation i.l1 the medical community, severely curtailing patient choice, as\n\n                well as the opportunity for these and future patients to benefit from Dr. Gomez'\n\n                advanced abilities in cardiothorncic and surgical procedures.\n\n                5.10   At the time Dr. Gomez was presented with these \"options\" by Defendants, he\n\n      -\n      I'\n      c....\n       0\n      00\n                was also told that he would not be able to review at any meaningful level the alleged\n\n\n      l   I\n                data supporting the emergency action outside the usual peer review process (the data\n      0\n      0\n      0         that ultimately proved to be improperly manipulated and without a basic medical and\n      VI\n\n\n      ~L:\n               scientific grounding).

Montoya, Jr. M.D. and after\n       being duly sworn under oath stated.\n\n             \"My name is Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D. I am the Plaintiff in this case. I have\n       knowledge of all the facts of this affidavit as Plaintiff and all facts are within my personal\n       knowledge true and correct and that I was involved with facts stated.\n\n              I have not used any patient name, except where authorized by the patient or their agent, to\n       avoid any HIPAA or privacy violation.\n\n              1. I ·was ·admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical Center in\n                  1981.   I have full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at San Angelo\n                  Community Medical Center. This case does not involve the rights of Defendant San\n                  Angelo Community Medical Center to speak freely, associate freely, and participate\n                  in government as permitted by law. The facts of the case are that I have full staff\n                  privileges to practice nephrology medicine at San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\n              2. Part of my practice and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a\n                 rotating system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital\n                 and emergency room pursuant to the EMTALA Medicare call list. When you are the\n                 named specialist you receive a call from the emergency room physician that a doctor\n                 with your specialty is needed for a patient. A big part of my practice was obtaining\n                . new patients and treating existing patients that came to the emergency room that\n                 needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 I have gotten new patients from the emergency\n                 room.\n\n              3. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to treat\n                 either new or existing patients for nephrology care at the San Angelo Community\n                 Medical Center. Since 2008 I have received only one call from the emergency room\n                 or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist. A nephrologist treats patients with\n                 kidney problems and or disease. The one call I received was for treatment of a new\n                 patient or existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\n\n\n\n                              £.1. Ji; bi f L        250\n\f     ·-------·--·····-·--·-------··--· -- •....\n\n\n\n\n4. The one time call for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 I was\n    called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on\n    duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n    informed me that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure. I was informed my\n    name was on the call board in the emergency room as nephrologist on call. Both of\n    the above doctors asked me to consult concerning treatment for that patient. I gave\n    my initial consult advice/orders of treatment to both doctors. This consultation call\n   was to me at 9:38 p.m. I informed them I would come see the patient and then review\n   the test results and determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as\n   Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record, removing the\n   name of the patient for HIPPA privacy, showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n\n5. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the\n   patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult and treatment by me and\n   consulted another nephrologist. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is one that\n   is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Kirk Brewer,\n   M.D. without seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of\n   nephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic\n   loss. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record\n   showing the facts on January 25, 2014.\n\n\n6. In removing me as the nephrologist the ~ospital published a statement that I was not a\n   competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center emergency room. San Angelo Community Medical Center through\n   its agents and representatives was aware that its actions would become known to the\n   staff physicians of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that there was by\n   conduct and a whisper campaign saying I (Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D.) should not be\n   allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n\n\n                                           251\n\f7. The statements and actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and\n    through its agents and representatives were published by conduct. The actions were\n    referring to keep from treating my own patients and any new patient coming to the\n   San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room.               Toe statement(s) and\n   actions were defamatory and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n8. Until 2007 I would receive l 0-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat\n   either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 I have only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new or existing\n   patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused\n   substantial injury to the Plaintiffs and damaged their ability to compete, because the\n   Plaintiffs depend on these referrals and consults to build and maintain the nephrology\n   practice. A majority of patients who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney\n   disease in a hospital later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems;\n   the most common of such continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney\n   dialysis patient will need treatment for six years, and each such patient would mean\n   revenue to the Plaintiffs practice of approximately $100,000 per year. I estimates that\n   the Plaintiffs have lost at least 100 long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the\n   present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give me patient\n   referrals or consults. I estimate that this lack of referrals has thus cost Plaintiffs\n   $1,000,000 to-$6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n9. The defamatory statements and actions are untrue. I am a competent and qualified\n   nephrologist to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. If I were\n   not a competent and qualified nephrologist I would have been removed from the staff\n   of the hospital.\n\n\n10. The actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and through its agents and\n   representatives were intentional or done with negligence when San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center knew that the statement was false and the actions would\n   lead a reasonable prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory\n\n\n\n                                      252\n\f    potential. The actions interred with my ability to make a living as a nephrologist on\n    staff at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n11. The rules at San Angelo Community Medical Center and of the staff of San Angelo\n    Community Medical Center are to have a new patient in the emergency room or\n    hospital that needs a specialist consultation assigned to the name off the rotating\n    consultation list. The consultation list is kept by San Angelo Community Medical\n    Center by and through its agents and representatives. By San Angelo Community\n    Medical Center not following this procedure I did not receive any consultation\n    requests from the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical\n    Center in 2008-present and one in 2014.\n\n\n12. Attached to this affidavit as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n    existing patient of mine Mrs. Welch tried to see me in the emergency room of San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not call me\n   to treat my existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and I have treated her\n   for at least 20 years. These actions interfered with my right to treat my patient and to\n   the patient's rights to pick her physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of\n   rights (see attached Exhibit D) and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached\n   Exhibit E)\n\n\n13. Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also over\n   90 years of age and has been my patient for at least 10 years requested me when she\n   went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see me. This action\n   interfered with my right to treat my patient and to the patient's rights to pick her\n   physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of rights (see attached Exhibit D)\n   and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached exhibit E)\n\n\n\n14. A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician.   Attached as Exhibit\n   F is a true and correct copy of the patient bill of rights posted at the San Angelo\n\n\n\n\n                                        253\n\f    Community Medical Center. Attached as Exhibit E a true and correct copy of the\n   dialysis patient bill of rights concerning care of a dialysis patient. Both of these\n   patient bills of rights were violated by San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n15. On January 25, 2014 at 8: 10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient referred in Exhibits A and B as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then\n   without ever seeing the patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult\n   and treatment and consulted another nephrologist.        I went to the call board and\n   witnessed my name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014.\n   The. San Angelo Community. Medical Center is required to have. an official EMTALA\n   Medicare call list for on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center to take Medicare patients.       This is the list my name was on and was\n   intentionally ignored. This also violates a patient's right to choose their physician.\n   This list ·was· followed until Dr.· Brewer came to San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is\n   one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Dr.\n   Brewer did not see the patient when he removed me as the treating nephrologist he\n   issued the change via a telephone order (see Exhibit B). Kirk Brewer, M.D. without\n   seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of nephrologist\n   was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n16. By the. actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are controlled\n   by their supervisor or lead physician Kirk Brewer, M.D. through the above actions\n   intentionally interfered with my practice of medicine at San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center to keep me from receiving patients as required by the EMTALA\n   Medicare call list.\n\n\n17. The Defendants' anticompetitive conduct has harmed consumers and others who pay\n   for nephrology services in the relevant market by increasing the costs of those\n   services. This is demonstrated by the chart attached hereto as Exhibit G. Before Dr.\n   Brewer's group of hospitalists became the attending physicians for all nephrology\n\n\n\n\n                                      254\n\f            patients at SACMC, nephrology patients would be referred to rrie (Dr. Montoya) who\n            would serve as the attending physician for the patient. This arrangement avoided the\n            \"middle man'' which now exists, as the hospitalists now usually serve as an additional\n            charging entity between the patient and the nephrology specialist. Even if the\n           hospitalists could do the same work as me or my partner used to provide, the patient\n           (and/or insurance and taxpayer-funded Medicare/Medicaid) still faces increased cost\n           for the same nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services\n           than I charge. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare\n           allowable rate, which adds up to average charges of $506.85 per day. See Exhibit\n          ·-·G.· In· approximately , 2010, at· the SACMC · emergency room, -Dr. ·Brewer · · ·\n           explicitly told me that he and his group of hospitalists will always charge at the\n           comprehensive rate, regardless of medical necessity, because those charges\n           maximize revenue for Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists.            I, however,\n          ·charge· at the \"Moderate\" Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to an average cost\n           of $346.13 per day. The difference between these charges is $160. 72 per nephrology\n           patient per· average hospital stay. Over the course of a year, consumers/payors for\n           nephrology services have thus paid thousands more for the hospitalists' physician and\n           nephrology services than they would have paid for care from me who is a physician\n           specialist in nephrology.\n    All of the actions described in this affidavit are done by or for the Defendant San Angelo\nCommunity Medical Center.\n\n       Further affiant saith not.\"\n\n       Signed this 4th day of May, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n         Subscribed and sworn to me the undersigned notary by Steve F.

CODEE§ 160.007(b).\n74    As already illustrated in our brief review of the meaning of \"anticompetitive,\" there is no practical difference between the\n      terms anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive effects as used in the caselaw, because we do not deem conduct\n      anticompetitive unless it has a net anticompetitive effect.\n75    Memorial Hermann argues that our decision in Irving Healthcare Sys. v. Brooks, 927 S.W.2d 12 (Tex.1996), forecloses\n      argument that section 160.007(b)'s anticompetitive action exception encompasses routine business torts, including\n      interference with prospective business relations. In Brooks, we noted that ''the statute provides that if a court makes a\n      preliminary finding that a medical peer review committee's proceedings, records, or communications are relevant to an\n      anticompetitive action ... they are not confidential,\" but that \"a similar provision for a libel action in which the plaintiff claims\n      malice\" was \"[n]oticeably absent from the statute.\" 927 S.W.2d at 16. We also held that the statute did not \"explicitly\n      exclude from its confidentiality provisions any of [the plaintiff's] other causes of action.\" Id.\n          The plaintiff in Brooks sued for libel, slander, \"intentional infliction of mental anguish,\" and interference with business\n          relations. Id. at 14-15. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had \"Intentionally and maliciously supplied false\n          information, thereby damaging or destroying [the plaintiff's] ability to gain admittance to the medical staffs of the\n          hospitals to which he applied.\" Id. Thus, Brooks did not require us to review the applicability of subsection (b), because\n          the trial court never made the required preliminary finding of relevance to an anticompetitive action. Furthermore,\n          aithough the plaintiff's \"other causes of action,\" Included an allegation that the defendant tortiously interfered with\n          prospective business relations, the plaintiff did not allege that the conduct was independently wrongful because the\n          provision of false information had a negative effect on competition and constituted an antitrust violation. Our decision\n          today is therefore consistent with our holding in Brooks.\n76     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Sturges, 52 S.W.3d 711, 726 (Tex.2001 ).\n77    TEX. BUS. & COMM.

Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc., 551 U.S. at 886, 127 S.Ct. 2705 (holding that the goal of judicial scrutiny is to\n      \"distinguish[ ] between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating\n      competition that are in the consumer's best interest\").\n133   We note that there may be procompetitive justifications for allowing the presentation of even misleading data, such as\n      allowing for freer and more informed discussions-particularly in light of procedures available to physicians to challenge\n      the peer review process. For example, ensuring that the data cannot be challenged might delay the hospital's ability to\n      respond to concerns raised by the data. It may be that such increased responsiveness is of greater value than the Interim\n      damage to a physician's reputation.\n          As we have already discussed, the inclusion and wording of the anticompetitive exception to the medical peer review\n          committee privilege does not condition the exception on a pre-determination that the behavior at Issue is indeed\n          anticompetitive. It requires only that the action seeks to establish that the behavior is anticompetitive. This case\n          presents Itself to us at the discovery phase rather than summary judgment. The procompetitive value of allowing for\n          the presentation of false data is a factual determination-one likely requiring the aid of expert reports-and it is not a\n          determination that we can make as a matter of law.\n134   See Brader, 64 F.3d at 876.\n135    Cf.

Code §§27.001 et. seq. (CR 194) and the\n\nTex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a) final Order of Dismissal (CR 196) dismissing all causes of\n\naction against Kirk Brewer, M.D. Both Orders were signed on February 8, 2016.\n\nThe Order at (CR 196) states that the “Motions are so intertwined as to not allow\n\nsegregation.” Thus argument of Dr. Montoya is on both Orders. This is also an\n\nappeal of the Summary Judgment (CR 336) that granted San Angelo Community\n\nMedical Center a Judgment dismissing all causes of action because of the orders\n\ndismissing the claims against Kirk Brewer, M.D.       The Summary Judgment was\n\nsigned on May 17, 2016 (CR 336) and a Motion for New Trial (CR 344) and an\n\nAmended Motion for New Trial were filed by Plaintiffs (CR 349) and were denied\n\n(CR 363).\n\n\n      The underlying causes of action in this case are:\n\n      1) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient\n\nrelations; 2) Illegal and anticompetitive actions of the Defendants; 3) Defendants\n\ndefamation per se; 4) Malice; 5) Business Disparagement against the Plaintiffs; 6)\n\nRestraint of Trade- (Monopolization/Attempted Monopolization/Conspiracy to\n\nMonopolize); 7) Group Boycott and Conspiracy in Restraint of Trade; 8) Restraint\n\nof Trade/Tortious Interference by violating EMTALA (Emergency Medicine\n\n                                       Page 1\n\fTreatment and Action Labor Act) (CR 160 and 300).\n\n      Plaintiffs timely filed a Notice of Appeal (CR 367). Plaintiffs bring this\n\nappeal seeking a reversal of the trial courts granting of the Motion to Dismiss and\n\nthe final Order of Dismissal of all causes of action against Kirk Brewer, M.D. and\n\nthe Summary Judgment denying all causes of action against San Angelo\n\nCommunity Medical Center.\n\n\n      For ease all Plaintiffs will be referred to as “Dr. Montoya”, Defendant Kirk\n\nBrewer, M.D. will be referred to as “Dr. Brewer” and San Angelo Community\n\nMedical Center will be referred to as “SACMC”.\n\n\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\nAppellant’s Issues-\n\n1.   The trial court erred in granting the Motion to Dismiss per the Texas Citizens\n\n     Participation Act Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. and the final\n\n     Order of Dismissal pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a) dismissing all causes of\n\n     action against Kirk Brewer, M.D.\n\n\n2.    The trial court erred in granting San Angelo Community Medical Center a\n\n      Summary Judgment based on the court’s rulings for Kirk Brewer, M.D.\n\n      when Plaintiffs raised sufficient issues of law and evidentiary facts to deny\n\n      the Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n\n                                      Page 2\n\f3.    The Defendant Dr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss under Tex.R.Civ.Proc. 91(a)\n\n      and Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. was untimely filed and\n\n      untimely heard by the Court.\n\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Dr. Montoya is a nephrologist in practice at SACMC since 1981. He filed\n\nsuit against Dr. Brewer (the hospital Chief of Staff) and SACMC for various Anti-\n\nCompetitive actions on July 6, 2015 (CR 7). Defendant SACMC filed Special\n\nExceptions and an answer on August 14, 2015 (CR 17). The Court granted the\n\nSpecial Exceptions on December 3, 2015 (CR 75). Dr. Montoya filed a Second\n\nAmended Petition in response to the Court Order on the Special Exceptions (CR\n\n103). Dr. Brewer filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 91(a)\n\nand Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem. Code §27.001 et.seq. (CR 76) and then filed an Amended\n\nMotion to Dismiss (CR 119). Dr. Montoya filed a response to the Motion to\n\nDismiss (CR 94) and a Supplemental Response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 177).\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya timely filed before the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss a\n\nFourth Amended Original Petition (CR 160). The Court granted the Motion to\n\nDismiss not distinguishing which rule the Court was using to grant the dismissal\n\n(CR 194). The Court specifically said it could not segregate the claims (CR 196).\n\n\n\n                                      Page 3\n\f        SACMC filed a untimely Motion to Dismiss (CR 202). SACMC filed a\n\nMotion for Leave to file their Motion to Dismiss (CR 216). At the same time as\n\nfiling the Motion to Dismiss SACMC filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (CR\n\n208) based only on the Court granting Dr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. The Court\n\ndenied leave to file the Motion to Dismiss of SACMC (CR 335).\n\n\n        Dr. Montoya filed a response to SACMC’s Motion to Dismiss (CR 331) and\n\na response to the Motion for Summary Judgment (Supp. CR ______).               Dr.\n\nMontoya timely filed before the Summary Judgment hearing a Sixth Amended\n\nOriginal Petition (CR 300). The Court granted the Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nof SACMC based on the ruling of dismissing all claims against Dr. Brewer (CR\n\n336).\n\n\n        Dr. Montoya requested findings of fact and conclusions of law (CR 337) to\n\nallow the court to state the facts and law it relied upon since the Court could not\n\nsegregate its prior Order (CR 196) that is the basis of the Summary Judgment. The\n\ncourt did not file any findings. Dr. Montoya filed a Motion for New Trial (CR\n\n344) and an amended Motion for New Trial (CR 349) and a Motion to Reconsider\n\nDr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. The Court signed an Order denying the First\n\nAmended Motion for New Trial (CR 363). Dr. Montoya timely filed Notice of\n\nAppeal (CR 367).\n\n\n                                      Page 4\n\f      Summary of Argument\n\n      Dr. Montoya sued the hospital SACMC and Dr. Brewer based upon causes\n\nof action that were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in the case of a doctor\n\nsuing the hospital where he had a medical practice.

Summary of Factual Allegations by Dr. Montoya in his Fourth\n      Amended Petition (CR 160) for Dr. Brewer. For SACMC the Sixth\n      Amended Original Petition (CR 300)\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya has practiced at San Angelo Community Hospital since 1981.\n\nUntil 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room\n\nper month to treat either new or existing patients at the San Angelo\n\nCommunity Medical Center. Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call\n\nfrom the emergency room or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist, and\n\none time for treatment of an existing patient that suffered with kidney\n\ndisease/problems. The lack of referrals caused substantial injury to Dr. Montoya\n\nand damaged his ability to compete, because he depended on these referrals and\n\nconsults to build and keep his practice. A majority of patients who need kidney\n\ntreatment suffering from kidney disease in a hospital will later need continuing\n\ncare for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such continuing\n\ntreatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need\n\ntreatment for a n average of 6 years, and each such patient would mean\n\nrevenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of approximately $100,000 per year. Dr.\n\nMontoya estimates that he has lost at least 100 long term kidney dialysis\n\npatients from 2007 to the present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme\n\nto refuse to give him patient referrals or consults from the emergency room of\n                                     Page 7\n\fSACMC. D r . M o n t o y a estimates that this lack of referrals has thus cost him\n\n$3,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya in developing, building and keeping his practice, has always\n\ntaken patients as an on-call staff attending physician from the emergency\n\nroom/department of SACMC.\n\n\n      In developing and building a practice Dr. Montoya as a nephrologist\n\nwanted long term kidney dialysis patients to treat in his practice. Referral from\n\nhospitals and area physicians is extremely important to a nephrologist to building\n\nand keeping a practice. The ability to obtain referrals from a hospital and area\n\nphysicians is a primary source of patients with kidney disease. Defendants in this\n\ncase conspired to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals needed for his nephrology\n\npractice to continue. This case is for the anticompetitive actions of the Defendants\n\nposing a danger of monopolization or attempted monopolization of patient\n\nchoice and causing patients to pay more for medical care and injuring consumer\n\npatients.\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya during his 36 year career in San Angelo built his practice\n\nincluding a dialysis unit that can serve 24 patients per shift from referring\n\nphysician and referrals of patients from the emergency room/department.\n\n\n\n                                       Page 8\n\f      Dr. Brewer is an employee and/or owner of a group of hospitalists\n\naffiliated with, and possibly created by, SACMC. Dr. Brewer was the chief of\n\nstaff of SACMC when this case was filed and head of the hospitalist group that\n\npractices at SACMC. Dr. Montoya has been denied the referral of patients that\n\ncome into the emergency room with kidney problems/illness/disease by the\n\nhospitalists controlled by Dr. Brewer and SACMC. These patients in need of a\n\nnephrologists care are being referred to the hospital affiliated physician group in\n\ncompetition with Dr. Montoya. Even Dr. Montoya's current patients are being\n\nreferred to the hospitalist/hospital affiliated group.\n\n\n      At all relevant times Dr. Kirk Brewer, himself, as a principal officer of\n\nCommunity Medical Associates, SACMC and Chief of Staff of SACMC and\n\nhead of the hospitalist system at SACMC and the agents/employees of SACMC\n\nworking under his control, direction, or in furtherance of unlawful and improper\n\nactions was and is employed by and acting in furtherance of the business of\n\n(SACMC) and its affiliated medical practice(s).\n\n\n      Dr. Montoya's skill as a nephrologist was, until the hospital created its\n\naffiliated medical practice and/or entered into an exclusive contract with the\n\ngroup of hospitalists affiliated and/or managed by Dr. Brewer, a marketing asset\n\nfor SACMC. Dr. Montoya is the only Spanish speaking nephrologist at SACMC.\n\n\n                                         Page 9\n\fDr. Montoya received his rotating share of referrals a s r e q ui r e d b y F e d e r a l\n\nL a w c a l l e d EM TA L A , of patients with kidney disease/illness/failure until\n\nSACMC created its affiliated practice groups and/or entered into an exclusive\n\ncontract with the group of hospitalists affiliated and/or managed by Dr. Brewer.\n\n\n       One example of Dr. Brewer’s actions- On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m.\n\nKirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalist care of a patient b e i n g s e e n b y\n\nDr. Montoya in the hospital (SACMC) .                            When Dr. Brewer’s\n\nrotation as on call hospitalist started he without ever seeing the patient or the\n\nchart cancelled Dr. Montoya's consult and treatment ordered by Dr. Montoya and\n\nconsulted another nephrologist.          This removal proves actual anti-competitive\n\naction of Dr. Brewer against Dr. Montoya. Dr. Montoya went to the call board a t\n\nt h e h o s p i t a l and witnessed his name on the call board as the nephrologist on\n\ncall on January 24 and 25, 2014.              SACMC is required to have an official\n\nEMTALA Medicare call list for on call physicians for the SACMC to take\n\nMedicare patients and be paid for the medicare patients.\n\n\n       Dr. Montoya’s name was on the call list but he was intentionally ignored.\n\nT h e r e m o v a l o f D r . M o n t o y a a s t h e patients p h y s i c i a n s also violates\n\na patient's right to choose their physician. This list was followed until Dr. Brewer\n\ncame to SACMC and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brought in\n\n                                            Page 10\n\ffor consult after removing Dr. Montoya is one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer,\n\nM.D. has a contract for paid services with Dr. Brewer. Dr. Brewer did not see\n\nthe patient when he removed D r . M o n t o y a as the treating nephrologist; he\n\nissued the change via a telephone order. Kirk Brewer, M.D. without seeing the\n\npatient, r e mo v e d D r . M o n t o ya a s t h e patient's doctor.   This change of\n\nnephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused Dr.\n\nMontoya economic loss. Attached as Exhibit B (CR 175-176 and 325-326) to\n\nthe petition is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing\n\nthe facts on January 25, 2014 as stated above.\n\n\n      Kirk Brewer, M.D. by his actions of removing Dr. Montoya as the\n\nnephrologist published a statement that Dr. Montoya was not a competent\n\nnephrologist to treat patients coming to the San Angelo Community Medical\n\nCenter emergency room. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was aware that his actions would\n\nbecome known to the staff physicians of San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\nand that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign saying Dr. Montoya should\n\nnot be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. These\n\nremarks caused hospitalists and other doctors at SACMC, as well as doctors and\n\nnurses in the SACMC emergency department, to cease and refuse to (a) admit\n\npatients to the care of Dr. Montoya, and (b) not to refer patients to Dr. Montoya\n\nfor nephrology consults.\n                                        Page 11\n\f      Attached to the petition as Exhibit C (CR 175) is the true and correct\n\nsworn statement that an existing patient of Dr. Montoya, Mrs. Welch tried to see\n\nDr. Montoya in the emergency room of San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\nand that the emergency room would not call Dr. Montoya to treat his existing\n\npatient.

The Texas Citizens Participation Act standard setforth in In Re Lipsky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex.2016)\n\n             “As already mentioned, HN3 the Texas Citizens Participation Act or TCPA protects\n             citizens from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them on matters\n             of public concern. See House Comm. on Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence, Bill\n             Analysis, Tex. H.B. 2973, 82nd Leg., R.S. (2011). The Act provides a special\n             procedure for the expedited dismissal of such suits. A two-step process is initiated\n             by motion of a defendant who believes that the lawsuit responds to the defendant's\n             valid exercise of First Amendment rights. Under the first step, [**8] the burden is\n             initially on the defendant-movant to show \"by a preponderance of the evidence\"\n             that the plaintiff's claim \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to the [movant's]\n                                                        4                         5\n             exercise of: (1) the right of free speech; (2) the right to petition; or (3) the right of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 Page 14\n\f                       6\n          association.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 27.005(b). If the movant is able to\n          demonstrate that the plaintiff's claim implicates one of these rights, the second step\n          shifts the burden to the plaintiff to \"establish[] by clear and specific evidence a\n          prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.\" Id. §\n          27.005(c).\n\n          HN7 In determining whether the plaintiff's claim should be dismissed, the court is to\n          consider the pleadings and any supporting and opposing affidavits. Id. § 27.006(a).\n          Moreover, the motion to dismiss ordinarily suspends discovery, id. § 27.003(c),\n          although the statute leaves the possibility for a court to order limited discovery for\n          \"good cause\" as it relates to the motion itself, id. § 27.006(b). Within defined time\n          limits, the court must then rule on the motion and must dismiss the plaintiff's claim if\n          the defendant's constitutional rights are implicated and the plaintiff has not met the\n          required showing of a prima facie case. Id. § 27.005. The determination is to be\n          made promptly, ordinarily within 150 days of service of the underlying legal action.\n          See id. §§ 27.003(b), .004(a), .005(a).\n\n          In this proceeding, only the second step is at issue—the question being whether\n          the plaintiff has met its burden of \"establish[ing] by clear and specific evidence a\n          prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.\" Id. §\n          27.005(c). The parties disagree about the evidentiary burden this language\n          imposes. Lipsky argues that the phrase \"clear and specific evidence\" elevates the\n          evidentiary standard, requiring Range to produce direct evidence as to each\n          element of its claim. Range, on the other hand, argues that circumstantial evidence\n          and rational inferences may be considered by the court in determining whether\n          clear and specific evidence exists and that the TCPA's prima-facie-case\n          requirement does not impose a higher or unique evidentiary standard. The dispute\n          mirrors a similar disagreement among the courts of appeals.”\n          (In Re Lipsky at 586-587)\n          4\n           HN4 The \"right of free speech\" refers to communications related to \"a matter of public\n          concern\" which is defined to include an issue related to: \"(A) health or safety; (B)\n          environmental, economic, or community well-being; (C) the government; (D) a public official\n          or public figure; or (E) a good, product, or service in the marketplace.\" Id. § 27.001(3),\n          (7)(A)—(E).\n\n          5\n           HN5 The \"right to petition\" refers to a wide range of communications relating to judicial,\n          administrative, or other governmental proceedings. Id. § 27.001(4).\n\n          6\n           HN6 The \"right of association\" refers to people \"collectively express[ing], promot[ing],\n          pursu[ing], or defend[ing] common interests.\" Id. § 27.001(2).\n\n\n      In this case Dr. Montoya conclusively proved through his factual statements\n\nin pleadings (Fourth Amended and Sixth Amended Original Petition (CR 160 and\n\n300) and affidavits attached to his response (CR 94) and Supplemental Response to\n\n\n\n\n                                               Page 15\n\fthe Motion to Dismiss in (CR 177) that there is direct and circumstantial evidence\n\nto allow the suit to go forward.\n\n\n      Clear and Convincing Evidence of Dr. Montoya petitions on file and his and\n\nDr. Hunt’s affidavits prove that this case should not have been dismissed under\n\nTex.Civ.Proc.91(a) or Tex.Civ.Prac. Remedies Code §27.001 et. seq.\n\n\n      In the response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 94) Dr. Montoya’s Fourth\n\nAmended Petition (CR 160) and his affidavit (CR 97) proved that this case is a\n\nlegitimate lawsuit based upon the In Re Memorial Hermann causes of action (see\n\npage 19 above). Dr. Montoya in the Fourth Amended Original Petition (CR 160)\n\nspecifically addressed the factual allegations of how Dr. Brewer and SACMC\n\nharmed him by interfering with his ability to obtain new patients out of the\n\nemergency room referral and make a living as a nephrologist (see facts starting\n\npage 7 above). Dr. Montoya’s active pleading at the time of the hearing on the\n\nMotion to Dismiss was the Fourth Amended Petition (CR 160). A petition is\n\nevidence to keep a Motion to Dismiss from being granted City of Dallas at 724-\n\n725. In Re Lipksy at 586-587. Then Dr. Montoya’s Supplemental Response to the\n\nMotion to Dismiss (CR 177) filed an affidavit of an independent physician, John\n\nHunt, M.D. stating specifically he (Dr. Hunt) was aware of the whisper campaign\n\nthat Dr. Montoya was not to be referred any patients from the emergency room\n\n\n                                     Page 16\n\f(CR 179). Also Dr. Montoya filed a Supplemental Affidavit that Dr. Brewer had\n\nstolen his patient (CR 180) attached to the affidavit, (redacted patient name for\n\nHIPAA privacy requirements), were patient records showing Dr. Montoya had\n\nseen a patient referral out of the emergency room as Chief of Staff and Chief\n\nHospitalist Dr. Brewer removed Dr. Montoya as the nephrologist caring for the\n\npatient. The Whisper Campaign was economic activity not a free speech activity.\n\n\n      This evidence was clear and convincing and the Court should have denied\n\nDr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. Wherefore this Court should reverse the Motion\n\nto Dismiss.\n\n\nD.    Plaintiffs’ Business Disparagement and Defamation Claims Should Not\n      Be Dismissed\n\n       “The TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits\n\ndesigned only to chill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious\n\nlawsuits.” In re Lipsky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (Tex. 2015) (emphasis added), citing\n\nTex.

The TCPA is not\n\napplicable to this case, as Plaintiff’s causes of action are primarly concerned with\n\nDefendants’ anticompetitive actions, and injury to competition in the relevant\n\n                                      Page 17\n\fmarkets of nephrology services and referrals for nephrology services in San\n\nAngelo, Texas.     As Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition makes clear, the\n\nconspiracy which Defendants perpetrated to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals\n\nbegan in 2007.     Although Plaintiff details some specific defamations which\n\noccurred in 2014, those defamations are merely representative of the\n\nanticompetitive scheme to which Dr. Montoya was being subjected. Defendants’\n\ngroup boycott and monopolization/attempted monopolization of the relevant\n\nmarket began much earlier, so even if Plaintiff’s pleadings do not set forth a prima\n\nfacie case of defamation and business disparagement, Plaintiff’s antitrust claims\n\nshould not be dismissed because they are not based on those instances of\n\ndefamation.\n\n\n      In any event, Plaintiff has set forth a prima facie case of defamation and\n\nbusiness disparagement by clear and specific evidence in his affidavit and Fifth\n\nAmended Petition. The “clear and specific” evidence which is required to pass a\n\nTCPA challenge can be contained in the plaintiff’s pleadings or in affidavits.

As shown in Plaintiff’s\n\nFourth Amended Petition, Dr. Brewer’s defamation was published by conduct\n\nwhen he removed Dr. Montoya from consulting with a patient on January 25, 2014\n\nat 8:10 a.m. The defamation was published to the hospitalist overseeing that\n\npatient, and the nephrologists who was eventually called in to consult as a\n\nreplacement for Dr. Montoya.

Even if Plaintiff’s Defamations Are Dismissed, Plaintiff’s Remaining\n      Claims Are Not Subject to the TCPA\n\n      The TCPA is clearly meant to apply to individual claims, not to an entire\n\nlawsuit when allegedly defamatory statements are only important to certain claims.\n\nBreach of contract claims, for example, would not ordinarily be dismissed merely\n\nbecause a Plaintiff failed to plead a prima facie defamation case under the TCPA.\n\n\n      The TCPA’s definition of “legal action” makes this clear. The TCPA states\n\nthat “If a legal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to a party's exercise\n\nof the right of free speech, right to petition, or right of association, that party may\n\nfile a motion to dismiss the legal action.”       Tex.

In Hicks, the court\n\nindividually examined each of the claims which allegedly violated the TCPA and\n\ndismissed two of those claims while refusing to dismiss two other claims because\n\nthe TCPA challenge to those claims was not timely filed.\n\n\n      Writing a concurrence in the case of Serafine v.

Justice Pemberton showed that this result finds support in\n\nseveral features of the the TCPA's text, and he explained as follows:\n\n\n      The first is that the TCPA defines “legal action”—that which is subject to\n      dismissal—both expansively and variously, as previously noted, referring to\n      everything from an entire action or proceeding to particular facts that\n      underlie a claim or cause of action. This nomenclature contemplates the\n                                        Page 21\n\f      drawing of distinctions not only between claims, but also between factual\n      theories, as here.\n\n      Adding further support to this construction are the dual overarching\n      purposes that the Legislature has declared the TCPA is to serve: “encourage\n      and safeguard the constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely,\n      associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum\n      extent permitted by law, at the same time, protect the rights of a person to\n      file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.” Neither purpose is\n      advanced by holding that a claim is wholly subject to dismissal merely\n      because it partly “is based on, relates to, or is in response to” protected\n      expression under the Act. Nor would these purposes be served by the\n      converse holding that the claim is wholly beyond the Act merely it “is based\n      on, relates to, or is in response to” some unprotected activity.\n\n      Id. at 393-394. The Serafine court later noted that “longstanding principles\n\nof Texas jurisprudence” counsel against “a construction of the TCPA that would\n\nmandate presumptive dismissal of an entire claim merely because its factual\n\nunderpinnings might include even one allegation that implicates the Act's\n\nprotections.” Id. at 394.\n\n\n      Several cases have applied the TCPA as Justice Pemberton interprets it.

The Tervita court thus held that the\n\n\n                                       Page 22\n\fTCPA did not apply to the plaintiff’s “employment discrimination based on (1)\n\ncreating a hostile work environment, (2) representing that he was ‘not entitled to\n\npursue benefits’ under the Texas Worker's Compensation Act, and (3) wrongful\n\ndischarge.” Id. at 286; see also Serafine v.

The Sloat court held that the defendant had failed to demonstrate, by a\n\n“preponderance of the evidence,” that the plaintiff’s causes of action for intentional\n                                       Page 23\n\finfliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy by intrusion on seclusion and\n\nby public disclosure of private facts, and tortious interference with contract were\n\n“based on, related to, or in response to” defendants’ “exercise of their right of free\n\nspeech, right to petition, or right of association.” Id. at *9. The defendants in Sloat\n\nhad thus failed to establish that the TCPA applied to the case. Id.\n\n\n      In this case, Dr. Brewer’s participation in the conspiracy aimed at depriving\n\nPlaintiffs of referrals for nephrology patients is not based on allegedly defamatory\n\nstatements, but it instead is based on his conduct. The TCPA simply does not\n\napply to such claims, and the court erred when it dismissed all of Plaintiffs’ claims\n\nagainst Dr. Brewer.\n\n\n      Wherefore the Plaintiffs request the Order dismissing Dr. Brewer be\n\nreversed and the Summary Judgment in favor of SACMC be reversed.\n\nF.    Appellant Has Valid Causes of Action for Antitrust Violations\n\n\n      As noted above, Dr. Montoya’s defamation claims are examples of how\n\nDefendant enforced its anticompetitive scheme to deprive Dr. Montoya of\n\nnephrology referrals, but Plaintiff’s antitrust claims are primarily based on the\n\nillegal scheme itself and not individual defamatory statements.          Plaintiff has\n\nplainly set forth valid antitrust claims as they largely mirror the causes of action\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page 24\n\fwhich the Supreme Court held to be valid in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital\n\nSystem, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2015).\n\n      The causes of action in this case, along with the underlying facts, are very\n\nsimilar to the causes of action approved by the Supreme Court in In re Memorial\n\nHermann Hospital. In both cases a doctor who has privileges at a hospital has\n\nalleged that the defendants conspired to prevent him from obtaining patient\n\nreferrals. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711; Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended\n\nPetition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5 (CR 301-303).         In both cases, the alleged\n\nconspirators consist of the hospital itself, a physician practice group, and individual\n\ndoctors who practice at the hospital. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 695;\n\nPlaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition (CR 300). In both cases, the doctors have\n\nexplained how other doctors how other doctors are a primary source of referrals,\n\nand that these referrals are required for a doctor to be able to compete. In re\n\nMemorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711; Sixth Amended Petition, pp. 6.2, 6.3, 6.8-\n\n6.11 (CR 301-305).       Both lawsuits allege that the defendants intentionally\n\ninterfered with the plaintiff’s longstanding practice for obtaining referrals from\n\nother doctors in the community, and that the defendants’ acts constituted a\n\n“concerted effort . . . to restrain competition in and monopolize” the relevant\n\nmarket. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 708; Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended\n\nPetition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 7.1, 12.7 (CR 301-302, 309, 314). Both lawsuits\n\n\n                                       Page 25\n\fallege that the defendants impugned the reputation of the plaintiff doctors through\n\na covert whisper campaign which convinced other doctors not to refer patients to\n\nthe plaintiff doctors. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 696; Plaintiff’s Sixth\n\nAmended Petition, paragraph 6.15-6.17 (CR305-306). Both lawsuits allege that\n\nthe plaintiff doctor lost a substantial amount of business from referrals due to the\n\nanticompetitive conspiracy against them. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p.\n\n711 (plaintiff alleged that “referral patterns changed” so that he was no longer the\n\n“number one” physician, and that following the conduct at issue, another physician\n\nreceived more referrals); Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, paragraph 7.11 and\n\n13.3-13.4 (Dr. Montoya received 10-20 calls per month from the SACMC\n\nemergency room to treat new or existing patients before the anticompetitive\n\nconspiracy began, but he has only received a single call from emergency room for\n\na new patient since then; all referrals now go to the nephrologists at WTMA). In\n\nboth this case and in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital, the plaintiff doctor alleges\n\nthat   the   defendants’   acts   “constitute    illegal   monopolization,   attempted\n\nmonopolization, and/or conspiracy to monopolize under Texas law.” in In re\n\nMemorial Hermann Hospital; Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, paragraph 12.7\n\n(CR 314). Plaintiff has plainly stated a valid cause of action under the antitrust\n\nlaws of Texas which is in no way designed only to chill Defendants’ First\n\nAmendment rights. “” In re Lipsky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (Tex. 2015) (“The\n\n\n                                       Page 26\n\fTCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits designed only to\n\nchill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.”) (emphasis\n\nadded). The trial court’s granting of Dr. Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss under the\n\nTCPA must be reversed with regard to Dr. Montoya’s antitrust claims. The trial\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to SACMC, which was based on the improper\n\ndismissal of Dr. Montoya’s antitrust claims, must also be reversed.\n\nG.     Appellant’s Petition Clearly Brought Claims Directly Against SACMC\n       for SACMC’s Own Conduct\n\n\n     SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment argued that because the court had\n\npreviously dismissed Dr. Brewer from the case, SACMC should also be dismissed\n\nbecause “Plaintiff alleges no direct or separate liability claims against SACMC\n\nabove and apart from the actions of its agent, Brewer.” SACMC’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment as a Matter of Law, p. 3 (hereafter “SACMC Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment”) (CR 208). This statement is absolutely false.\n\n       Dr. Montoya’s Sixth Amended Petition makes it clear that SACMC was\n\nbeing sued for its own conduct, and not merely for the conduct or statements of Dr.\n\nBrewer. For example, Dr. Montoya’s Petition stated as follows:\n\n       The Defendants (SACMC) and Dr. Kirk Brewer, along with WTMA and Dr.\n       Brewer’s group of hospitalists, acting by and through its agents/employees/\n       principals/officers, acted together to carry out the improper and illegal\n       actions and therefore are jointly and severally liable for civil conspiracy in\n       carrying out their wrongful activities.\n\n\n                                       Page 27\n\f       Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, p. 5, ¶ 6.10 (CR 304). The Petition also\n\nincluded allegations against all of the Defendants in each of Plaintiff’s causes of\n\naction.   See, e.g., Id., p. 10 (“Defendant’s intentionally interfered with Dr.\n\nMontoya’s longstanding and continuous relationships with patients and referring\n\nphysicians from the emergency room/department in a concerted effort to restrain\n\ncompetition and monopolize the practice of nephrology            . . . in the relevant\n\nmarket.”) Id., p. 10, , ¶ 7.1 (CR 309).           Similar conduct was alleged against\n\nSACMC for each of Plaintiff’s causes of action against it. As there were only ever\n\ntwo Defendants in the lawsuit, Dr. Montoya’s allegations against the plural\n\n“Defendants” plainly included SACMC. SACMS’s suggestion that there were no\n\n“direct . . . liability” claims against it is simply false.\n\n       The causes of action against SACMC are all separate and independent of Dr.\n\nBrewer. For example, with regard to Dr. Montoya’s group boycott claim and\n\nclaims for monopolization and attempted monopolization, Dr. Montoya has alleged\n\nthat SACMC, Dr. Brewer, Dr. Brewer’s group of hospitalists (who will be named\n\nonce Defendants have responded to Dr. Montoya’s discovery), and West Texas\n\nMedical Associates conspired to monopolize the relevant markets defined in Dr.\n\nMontoya’s pleadings, and to keep Dr. Montoya from competing in those markets\n\nby a group boycott. See Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, paragraphs 12-12.8\n\n(CR 313-314) and 13-13.4 (CR 315-317). It is obvious that each member of a\n\n\n                                           Page 28\n\fconspiracy is liable for their participation in the conspiracy. A conspirator need\n\nnot have the same motives as the other conspirators, and need not be at the same\n\nmarket level of the other conspirators to be a participant in a conspiracy that is\n\nillegal under the Texas antitrust laws. See, e.g., Spectators' Communication\n\nNetwork Inc. v. Colonial Country Club, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24237\"><a href=\"/opinion/24237/spectators-comm-v-colonial-country/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220-221 (5th Cir. 2001)\n\n(“Antitrust law has never required identical motives among conspirators, and even\n\nreluctant participants have been held liable for conspiracy. For acquiescence in an\n\nillegal scheme is as much a violation of the Sherman Act as the creation and\n\npromotion of one.”)\n\n\nH.    The Court Improperly Granted a Motion to Dismiss Which\n      Masquerades as a Grant of Summary Judgment\n\n\n      While styled as an order on a summary judgment motion, the court in fact\n\ngranted a Motion to Dismiss in favor of SACMC, as the court effectively ruled that\n\nDr. Montoya’s pleadings did not state a claim against SACMC. The mere fact that\n\nDr. Brewer was dismissed from the case does not mean that SACMC could not be\n\nliable for its own conduct or the conduct of its other agents besides Dr. Brewer.\n\nSACMC did not present any evidence in support of its summary judgment motion\n\nwhich showed that it had not engaged in any of the conduct which Dr. Montoya\n\nsued it for; SACMC instead relied solely on the fact that Dr. Brewer was dismissed\n\nfrom the case under a Texas procedural rule. This “evidence” was in fact no\n                                      Page 29\n\fevidence at all, and it resulted in the court in effect granting summary judgment to\n\nSACMC based on Dr. Montoya’s pleadings.\n\n\n      At the hearing on SACMC’s summary judgment motion, the court\n\nrepeatedly stressed its belief that Dr. Montoya was required to plead specific\n\nwrongful acts by an agent of SACMC in order to be able to maintain its lawsuit\n\nagainst SACMC. However, there is simply no rule in Texas holding that in order\n\nto plead a valid cause of action against a business entity, one must list specific\n\ntortious or wrongful actions which company representatives undertook on behalf of\n\nthe organization. Texas pleading precedent clearly allows a party suing a business\n\nentity to merely allege that the business entity itself did something wrongful. See,\n\ne.g., Bank One, Texas, N.A. v. Stewart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433438/bank-one-texas-na-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430-31 (Tex.App.\n\nHouston [14 Dist.] 1998, pet. denied) (although no specific acts of company\n\nrepresentative were plead, court stated that “Although the allegations are broad,\n\nboth petitions raise a reasonable inference that Bank One and Weyerhaeuser\n\nparticipated in a conspiracy to defraud LRI by inducing Trendmaker to avoid\n\nliability on the Midland Note.

Obviously, a corporate entity itself can commit a\n\nwrong. Companies are liable for their own actions or failures to act, and Texas\n\nallows companies to be sued directly for those acts.

Texaco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1576028\"><a href=\"/opinion/1576028/transcontinental-gas-pipeline-v-texaco/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (Tex.App. Houston [1 Dist.] 2000, rev.\n\ndenied) (noting that “in usual business practice,” “companies are liable for their\n\nown acts.”)\n\n\n      For example, if one sues a construction company for failing to build a fence\n\nproperly, one does not have to name in the pleading the company employees who\n\nbuilt the inadequate fence. If one sues a grocery store for selling tainted meat, one\n\ndoes not have to name the individual butcher who packaged it. Such a rule would\n\nas a practical matter make most lawsuits impossible, as a plaintiff almost never\n\nknows at the pleading stage which employees or agents, if any, were involved in\n\nthe wrongful acts.    Because of this, every jurisdiction in the United States,\n\nincluding Texas, allows a company to be sued for the company’s own wrongful\n\nacts. So long as the lawsuit gives the company notice of what it is being sued for\n\nso that it can prepare a defense, the Texas pleading standards are satisfied. Dr.\n\nMontoya’s lawsuit against SACMC plainly satisfied the Texas notice pleading\n\nstandard, and the court’s decision to grant summary judgment to SACMC because\n\nno specific acts of SACMC’s agents were listed in the lawsuit after Dr. Brewer was\n\ndismissed was clear error.\n\n                                       Page 31\n\fI.     Dr. Montoya’s Petition Meets the Texas Notice Pleading Standard\n\n       As noted above, the court’s grant of summary judgment was actually a\n\ndismissal based on the pleadings. While the Defendants and the court persist in\n\ntheir belief that this case primarily involves defamatory statements, the central\n\nbasis of Dr. Montoya’s lawsuit is that the Defendants, along with WTMA and Dr.\n\nBrewer’s group of hospitalists, conspired to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals for\n\nnephrology patients. Dr. Montoya’s pleading is nearly identical to the plaintiff’s\n\npleading in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital System, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\n2015), a case in which the Supreme Court specifically held that that a physician\n\nhad stated valid claims against a hospital and its co-conspirators. Under Hermann\n\nMemorial, Dr. Montoya’s pleading is plainly sufficient under Texas law.\n\n     While the court need not look beyond Hermann Memorial, cases such as In re\n\nGarth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403851\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403851/in-re-garth/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (Tex.App. Beaumont, 2007) clearly show that Dr.\n\nMontoya’s pleadings for his conspiracy-based antitrust claims meet the Texas\n\nnotice pleading standard. The court in Garth stated as follows:\n\n       At the time the trial court entered its order, Plaintiff's First Amended Petition\n       was the pleading before the court. Although very broad, the First Amended\n       Petition clearly alleges a conspiracy by the individual defendants, asserts\n       that they committed overt acts, and seeks punitive damages against them . . .\n       Because we construe [Plaintiff’s] pleadings in her favor, we hold that her\n       pleadings are sufficient to notify the individual defendants that she sought to\n       hold them liable for punitive damages through a conspiracy theory. . .\n\n\n\n\n                                        Page 32\n\fId. at 192.

In that case, the court stated as follows:\n\n      Although rule 47(a) of the rules of civil procedure requires a pleading to\n      contain “a short statement of the cause of action sufficient to give fair notice\n      of the claim involved,” see tex.R.

Rather, it is sufficient\n      if the cause of action can be “reasonably inferred” from the pleading. See\n      Boyles, 855 S.W.2d at 601. In this case, Pacific's live pleading alleges that\n      Ernst & Young “conspired with, aided and abetted, associated with, and\n      assisted ... in the dissemination of false and misleading information or\n      omissions of material facts to prospective investors in First Republic backed\n      securities.” The petition also alleged that Ernst & Young's participation in\n      the fraud enabled First Republic to make misrepresentations to the public\n      after the merger. We have reviewed this language and, after doing so, we\n      conclude that (1) a claim for conspiracy or “aiding and abetting” may be\n      reasonably inferred from this language, and (2) the language was therefore\n      sufficient to support a conspiracy or “aiding and abetting” claim.\n\nPacific Mut.

Cruce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1719285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1719285/kirby-v-cruce/\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164 (Tex.App.—Dallas\n\n1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The agreement need not be formal, the understanding may\n\nbe tacit, and each conspirator need not know the details of the conspiracy. Id. at\n\n164; Bourland v. State of Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1524338\"><a href=\"/opinion/1524338/bourland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin\n\n1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Given the law on this subject, it makes no sense to grant a\n\nsummary judgment in favor of SACMC merely because Dr. Montoya has not\n\npleaded in detail exactly which representatives of SACMC entered into the\n\nconspiracy, whom they had conversations and agreements with, and so forth. It is\n\nridiculous to make Dr. Montoya plead such facts before even undertaking\n\ndiscovery in this matter.1              A conspiracy never needs to be proven with direct\n\nevidence if there is sufficient circumstantial evidence, but in dismissing SACMC\n\nbecause Dr. Montoya’s pleadings did not show a specific conspiratorial action by\n\nan agent of SACMC, the court effectively required Dr. Montoya to provide direct\n\nevidence of the antitrust conspiracy at the pleading stage. This holding is simply\n\nnot allowed under the Texas summary judgment rule, and would not even be\n\nallowed under Rule 91a motion to dismiss.\n1\n  Plaintiffs did send out Requests for Production and Interrogatories in this matter, but Defendants only tendered\nobjections and refused to provide a single substantive answer. Plaintiff was in the process of filing a Motion to\nCompel when the court granted SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n                                                    Page 36\n\fJ.    The Trial Court Erred When It Failed to Consider the Allegations in\n      Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition\n\n\n      Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition clearly brought claims against SACMC\n\ndirectly, and even under that pleading, a grant of summary judgment to SACMC\n\nwould have been erroneous. Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, however, made it\n\nclear beyond any doubt that SACMC was being sued for its own conduct, and not\n\nmerely for Dr. Brewer’s actions. The court thus erred when it failed to consider\n\nthe new allegations in Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition which was filed on May\n\n4, 2016, a week before the summary judgment hearing on May 11, 2016. This\n\nresulted in an erroneous grant of summary judgment to SACMC, as SACMC’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment was based on stale factual allegations which were\n\nsuperseded by the allegations in the Sixth Amended Petition.\n\n      SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment argued that because the court had\n\npreviously dismissed Dr. Brewer from the case, SACMC should also be dismissed\n\nbecause “Plaintiff alleges no direct or separate liability claims against SACMC\n\nabove and apart from the actions of its agent, Brewer.” SACMC’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment as a Matter of Law, p. 3 (hereafter “SACMC Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment”). SACMC based its argument on the statement in Plaintiffs’\n\nFourth Amended Petition that Brewer “was and is employed by and acting in\n\nfurtherance of the business of [SACMC] and its medical practices” and “at all\n\n\n                                     Page 37\n\ftimes acted for SACMC.” Id., p. 3. SACMC thus contended that “SACMC’s only\n\npotential liability sounds in the doctrine of respondeat superior.” Id.\n\n        While Dr. Montoya had no need to correct his previous pleading on this\n\nissue, as even the Fourth Amended Petition made it clear that Dr. Montoya sought\n\nto hold SACMC liable for its own conduct and not merely the conduct of Dr.\n\nBrewer2, Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amended Petition showed beyond doubt that SACMC is\n\nnot being sued only under a respondeat superior theory for Dr. Brewer’s actions.\n\nPlaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition thus includes the following statements:\n\n        Dr. Brewer is individually liable for his own illegal, improper acts and\n        omissions. At various times Dr. Brewer acted for himself, (SACMC) and/or\n        his group of hospitalists.\n\n        Each Defendant in this case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and\n        WTMA and Dr. Brewer’s group of hospitalists (eventual defendants)\n        are being sued for their individual roles and conduct in the\n        monopolization,       attempted    monopolization,      conspiracy     to\n        monopolize, and group boycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each\n        of these entities may have engaged in the illegal conduct through their\n        agents or representatives, they are being sued for their individual roles\n        and conduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of\n        liability due to actions by Dr. Brewer.\n\n        Plaintiff’s Sixth Amended Petition, p. 4, ¶ 6.6 and p. 14, ¶ 12.2 (CR 39).\n\nAfter this pleading was filed, the fact that SACMC was being sued for its own\n\nconduct became indisputable. The sole basis of SACMC’s Motion for Summary\n\n2\n  Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition repeatedly makes it clear that SACMC was being sued for its own conduct,\nand not merely for vicarious liability for statements made by Dr. Brewer. Paragraph 6.1 of Plaintiff’s Fourth\nAmended Petition, for example, clearly stated that “This case is for the anticompetitive actions of the Defendants\nposing a danger of monopolization or attempted monopolization of patient choice and causing patients to pay more\nfor medical care and injuring consumer patients.” Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition, p. 2, paragraph 6.2\n\n                                                    Page 38\n\fJudgment, that “SACMC’s only potential liability sounds in the doctrine of\n\nrespondeat superior,” did not exist even before the Sixth Amended Petition was\n\nfiled, and it certainly did not exist afterwards.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s opinion in Sosa v. Central Power & Light, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2452285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2452285/sosa-v-central-power-light/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 895 (Tex. 1995) shows that the trial court erred when it failed to consider the\n\nallegations in Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amended Petition. In Sosa, the Court stated as\n\nfollows:\n\n      Because the Sosas timely filed their second amended original petition, it\n      superseded their first amended original petition containing the statements on\n      which the defendants based their motion for summary judgment. Contrary to\n      statements in live pleadings, those contained in superseded pleadings are not\n      conclusive and indisputable judicial admissions. Drake Ins. Co. v. King, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1732321\"><a href=\"/opinion/1732321/drake-ins-co-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span>\n      <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (Tex.1980). Therefore, the basis for the defendants' motion\n      no longer existed and summary judgment was improper.\n\n      Id. at 895. Sosa has recently been reaffirmed by cases such as Lee Homes of\n\nLimestone County, Inc. v. First National Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5175469</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2\n\n(Tex.App.-Waco 2015, no pet.).

Southwest Bank,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7009956</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2014, pet. denied).              Myers\n\nsummarized the facts and holding from Sosa as follows:\n\n\n      The defendants in Sosa attempted to meet their burden by arguing that the\n      plaintiffs' own pleadings established that the plaintiffs' claims were barred\n      by limitations. The plaintiffs then amended their petition to remove the\n      statements on which the defendants had relied in their motion. The\n      defendants' motion, which was based entirely on the plaintiffs pleading\n      themselves out of court, no longer had any basis. Summary judgment was\n      therefore improper.\n                                         Page 39\n\f      Id. at *6. The same is true in this case, as Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amended Petition\n\nmade it clear that the entire basis for SACMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment no\n\nlonger existed after that amended pleading was filed.         The court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to SACMC was therefore improper.\n\n\nWhat is EMTALA (The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act\nCause of Action)?\n\n\n      The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (hereinafter\n\nEMTALA) is Section 1867(a) of the Social Security Act, and is codified within the\n\nsection of the U.S. Code which governs the Medicare program. (42 USC 1395cc)\n\nThe Healthcare Financing Administration (hereinafter HCFA) is the federal agency\n\nthat governs Medicare payments and has the statutory authority to issue regulations\n\nconcerning the implementation of EMTALA. (HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-\n\n15)\n\n\n      EMTALA is a statute which governs when and how a patient must be (1)\n\nexamined and offered treatment or (2) transferred from one hospital to another\n\nwhen he is in an unstable medical condition (3) the list of doctors on staff that are\n\non call and the fair assignment of patients to doctors. 42 USC 1395cc(a)(1)(I)(iii),\n\nHCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page 40\n\f      But in this case it does not involve patient dumping but the refusal to follow\n\nthe mandatory call list of EMTALA to fairly distribute the paying nephrology\n\npatients under Medicare or private insurance.\n\n\nL. Maintaining the Call List Requirement\n\n\n      Medicare –participating hospitals must maintain a list of physicians who are\n\non call to provide emergency care to individuals presenting to the emergency\n\nroom. (42 USC 1395cc(a)(1)(I)(iii))\n\nUnder EMTALA the hospital and its officers are responsible for maintaining an\n\non-call roster for the emergency department. (42 USC 1395cc(a)(1)(I)(iii))\n\n\n      San Angelo Community Medical Center is a Medicare –participating\n\nhospital.\n\n\n\nM. All nephrology patients that go on to dialysis are covered under Medicare-\nthus are paying patients for the doctor and hospital\n\n      The avowed purpose of the statute is to prevent hospitals from rejecting\n\npatients, refusing to treat them, or transferring them to \"charity hospitals\" or\n\n\"county hospitals\" because they are unable to pay or are covered under the\n\nMedicare or Medicaid programs and to fairly distribute patients coming to the\n\nemergency room between physicians so the physician receives paying and non-\n\n\n                                      Page 41\n\fpaying patients. (42 USC 1395cc (a)(1)(I)(iii)), HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-\n\n15.\n\n\nThis is a key in this case, the patients coming to the emergency room for\nnephrology care are guaranteed to pay the doctor for services through Medicare.\n\nDr. Brewer wants the paying patients to go to the other nephrologist in the hospital\nowned group and to not have Dr. Montoya receive his fair share of patients. Dr.\nBrewer is paid by the other nephrologist for coverage.\n\nThe purpose of the call list is to allow all physicians to equally receive call and\npaying and non-paying patients.\n\nA brief to the Trial Court an EMTALA was provided after the Motion to Dismiss\n\nhearing (CR 185). This brief has even more details.\n\n\n      Wherefore the Plaintiffs based upon EMTALA request the Orders\n\ndismissing Dr. Brewer be reversed and the Summary Judgment be reversed.\n\n\nN. Summary Judgment in favor of SACMC\n\n      Despite Appellants valid claims under In Re Memorial Hermann and the\n\nlegal arguments and facts proven in the response to the Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment (Supp. CR ____) the trial court committed reversible error by granting\n\nthe Defendant SACMC Summary Judgment (CR 336). Thus this Court should\n\nreverse the granting of the Summary Judgment and render judgment for Appellants\n\ndenying the Summary Judgment.\n\n      Summary Judgment for the Defendant is only proper if, as a matter of law,\n                                        Page 42\n\fthe Plaintiff cannot succeed on any theory pled.

Code\n\n§§27.001 et. seq.\n\n      The trial court erred in granting the Summary Judgment because Defendant\n\nSACMC did not show there was not genuine issue of material fact and/or\n\nPlaintiffs’ factual affidavits proved genuine issues of material facts.\n\n\n      The finding of the Court dismissing Dr. Brewer (CR 194 and 196) is not\n\ncontrolling to the causes of action brought against SACMC. The causes of action\n\nagainst SACMC cannot be controlled by the dismissal of Dr. Brewer without valid\n\nSummary Judgment evidence, which there is none.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Page 47\n\f      The Defendant SACMC does not even attach a single factual affidavit or any\n\naffidavit in support of their Summary Judgment (CR 208). The only thing relied\n\nupon is the Court prior Order of Dismissal of Dr. Brewer’s claims.\n\n\n      SACMC filed a Motion for Special Exceptions on August 14, 2015 (CR 17)\n\nand the court granted the Special Exceptions on December 3, 2015 (CR 75). The\n\nPlaintiffs Petition was amended to comply with the Court order. SACMC should\n\nhave filed a Motion to Dismiss when it filed the Special Exception. The Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment is a untimely Motion to Dismiss that has no evidence or\n\nproof attached (CR 208).\n\n\n      The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants\n\nConstitutional Rights to speak freely, associate freely and participate in\n\ngovernmental as permitted by law.

All the actions\n\nSACMC were untimely.\n\nIssue 3\n\n1.    Pursuant to Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a)3(b) a Motion to Dismiss must be filed at\n\n      least 21 days before the Motion is heard. The original Motion to Dismiss\n\n      was filed on July 7, 2016 (CR 119). The hearing was set by the Court for\n\n      January 12, 2016 (CR 91-93). An amended Notice of Hearing was set on\n\n      January 29, 2016 (CR 183). The amended Notice of the Motion to Dismiss\n\n      was sent on January 13, 2016 (CR 184). This notice was less than the 21\n\n      days required by Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a)3(b). The amended Motion to Dismiss\n\n      was filed on January 7, 2016 (CR 119).       Dr. Montoya objected to the\n\n      Amended Motion of Dr. Brewer as not being allowed without restarting the\n\n      period.   The Court erred in allowing the Motion to Dismiss under\n\n      Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a) to be heard. Dr. Montoya objected to the hearing in his\n\n      Supplemental Response to the Motion to Dismiss (CR 177). Tex.Civ.Proc.\n\n      91(a)5(d) require the hearing to be reset Tex.Civ.Proc.91(a)6.

Code §§27.001 et. seq. a Motion to\n\n      Dismiss a legal action under this section must be filed not later than the 60 th\n\n      day after the date of service of the legal action Tex.Civ.Prac.Remedies Code\n\n      §27.003(b). Dr. Brewer was originally served on October 9, 2015 (Supp.\n\n      CR_____). Dr. Brewer filed his Motion to Dismiss under Tex.Civ.Prac. &\n\n      Rem. Code §§27.001 et. seq. on December 8, 2015 which was within the 60\n\n      days after the date of service. Dr. Brewer then filed an Amended Motion to\n\n      Dismiss on June 7, 2015 (CR 119) which is outside the sixty day\n\n      requirement of Tex.Civ.Prac.Remedies Code §27.003(b).             Dr. Montoya\n\n      objected to the untimely filed affidavits and Amended Motion (CR 177).\n\n      The Court should strike the affidavits as untimely filed and thus the Motion\n\n      should be denied as not meeting the first proving of In Re Lipsky.\n\n\n                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n\n      The Appellants showed in their response to the Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and the factual affidavits in the response to Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment that this Court should (1) reverse the granting of the Summary Judgment\n\nand (2) remand the case to the trial court for trial.

This case should be conducted under Discovery Level Two until the Court enters a Level\n       Three Scheduling Order.\n\n2.     Plaintiff STEVE F. MONTOYA, JR., M.D. is an individual residing in Tom Green\n       County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Renal Care is a Texas Corporation with its principal\n       place of business in Tom Green County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Nephrology is a\n       Texas-Professional Association with its principal place of business in Tom Green County,\n       Texas.\n\n3.     Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center is a Delaware LLC that is registered\n       to do business in the State of Texas and has its principal place of business in San Angelo,\n       Tom Green· County, Texas. San Angelo Medical Center can be served by serving its\n       registered agent Corporation Service Company d/b/a CSC-Lawyers Incorporating Service\n       Company as its registered address, 211 E. 7ili Street, Suite 620, Austin, Texas 78701.\n\n       Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. is an individual whose principal place of business and\n       residence is in Tom Green County, Texas. Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. can be served\n       at his office at- San Angelo Medical Center at 3501 Knickerbocker Rd., San Angelo,\n       Texas 76904.\n\n4. :   Venue and Jurisdiction\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORI0Ilf18(JETIT10N                                        Page 1 of 13\n\f      Venue is proper in Tom Green County under Tex.Civ.Prac. & Remedies Code Section\n      15.002(a) (1) as all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this legal\n      action occurred in Tom Green County, Texas.\n\n5.    Dr. Montoya, West Texas Renal Care and West Texas Nephrology, PA have incurred and\n      sues for damages in the maximum amount of $ 6,400,000.00 plus three times for\n      exemplary damages plus attorneys and costs as allowed by law and jurisdiction is proper\n      in this Court.\n\n6.1   Dr. Steve F. Montoya has practiced as a nephrologist since 1979 in San Angelo, Texas.\n      Dr. Montoya has practiced at San Angelo Community Hospital since 1981. Dr. Montoya\n      in developing, building and keeping his practice has always taken patients as an on-call\n      staff attending physician from the emergency room/department of San Angelo\n      Community Medical Center.\n\n6.2   In developing and building a practice Dr. Montoya as a nephrologist wanted long term\n      kidney dialysis patients to treat in his practice.        Referral from hospitals and area\n      physicians is extremely important to a nephrologist to building and keeping a practice.\n      The ability to obtain referrals from a hospital and area physicians is a primary source of\n      patients with kidney disease. This case is for the anticompetitive actions of the\n      Defendants posing a danger of monopolization or attempted monopolization of patient\n      choice and causing patients to pay more for medical care and injuring consumer patients.\n\n6.3   Besides word of mouth and patient to patient referral Dr. Montoya built his patient base\n      from referring physicians, from referrals of patients who came to the emergency\n      room/department and hospital patients with kidney disease. A patient who lives in the\n      service area/relevant market of San Angelo Community Medical Center and needs long\n      term care which can include dialysis is one of the primary ways Dr. Montoya and his\n      entities succeed. Dr. Montoya during his 36 year career in San Angelo built his practice\n      including a dialysis unit that can serve 24 patients per shift.\n\n6.4   The service area/relevant market for San Angelo Community Medical Center is Tom\n      Green County and contiguous counties.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGilf'SfETITION                                           Page2 of 13\n\f6.5   Dr. Brewer is an employee of an entity owned and created by San Angelo Community\n      Medical Center. Dr. Brewer is the chief of staff of the hospital and head of the hospitalist\n      group that practices at San Angelo Community Medical Center. Dr. Montoya has been\n      denied the referral of patients . that come into the emergency room with kidney\n      problems/illness/disease. These patients are being referred to the hospital owned group.\n      Even Dr. Montoya's current patients are being referred to hospitalist/hospital owned\n      group. The group owned by the hospital is costing the patient money because the patients\n      have to pay for a hospitalist and are then being referred to a different nephrologist whose\n      group has a contract/agreement with the hospital and its owned entities. The patients are\n      denied the opportunity to save money. The hospitalist group charges the patients at a\n      higher comprehensive rate/code.\n\n6.6   At all relevant times Dr. Kirk Brewer, as a principal officer of Community Medical\n      Associates and Chief of Staff of San Angelo Community Medical Center (SACMC) and\n      head of the hospitalist system at (SACMC) with agents/employees of (SACMC) working\n      under his control, direction, or in furtherance of unlawful and improper actions was and is\n      employed by and acting in furtherance of the business of (SACMC) and its owned\n      medical practice(s). Dr. Brewer is individually liable for his own illegal, improper acts\n      and omissions. Dr. Brewer at all times acted for (SACMC). Dr. Brewer is also liable for\n      the improper acts and omissions as Chief of Staff of (SACMC). Dr. Brewer, as well as\n      the other agents/employees of (SACMC) and/or its owned practices are liable under the\n      doctrine of respondeat superior and vicarious liability.\n\n6.7   The Defendants (SACMC) and Dr. Kirk Brewer, acting by and through its\n      agents/employees/principals/officers acted together to carry out the improper and illegal\n      actions and therefore are jointly and severally liable for civil conspiracy in carrying out\n      their wrongful activities.\n\n6.8   All conditions precedent to Plaintiffs recovery have been performed or have occurred.\n      Dr. Montoya is a hard working member of the San Angelo Medical Community. Dr.\n      Montoya came out of San Antonio, Texas and received a full scholarship for his\n      undergraduate degree at Rice University. After graduating Rice University Dr. Montoya\n      then went on to medical school at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIODftr2ETITI0N                                         Page 3 of 13\n\f       in Dallas, Texas. After Dr. Montoya finished his residency and training he went to in\n       west Texas. Dr. Montoya built a stellar reputation for quality patient care, excellence in\n       the practice of nephrology and dialysis care of the long term illness of kidney\n       failure/disease.\n\n6.9    Dr. Montoya is the only nephrologist in San Angelo that speaks Spanish. Dr. Montoya\n       cares about his patients, his fellow medical professionals, and his community.             Dr.\n       Montoya's practice has expanded over the years including with the referral from local\n       physicians, the emergency room/department and hospital consultation because of his\n       well-deserved reputation for quality patient care.\n\n6.10   Dr. Montoya's skill as a nephrologist was until the hospital created its own medical\n       practice, a marketing asset for SACMC. Dr. Montoya received his rotating share of\n       referrals of patients with kidney disease/illness/failure until SACMC created its own\n       practice groups.\n\n6.11   The recommendation and referral through the emergency room/department directly\n       affects the patient's choice of doctor. The doctor in turn decides the patient's course of\n       treatment and what and how the patient is coded for billing on treatment.\n\n6.12   The choice of doctor directly affects the patient's costs and expenses both in the short\n       term and for long term care of kidney disease/illness/failure. Individuals with kidney\n       disease can require care for the rest of their life which may include dialysis.\n\n6.13   Improperly manipulating the doctor a patient receives care from creates a cost to the\n       patient and improperly distorts free and informed patient choice and options for medical\n       care.\n\n6.14   The correct and appropriate way for any health care provider of emergency hospital\n       services and nephrology service is to provide the highest quality of care to the patient.\n       Patients deserve to have lower costs. The illegal and unjust way of treating patients is to\n       manipulate their free choice in the market place. In this case it is to only refer a patient to\n       a hospitalist, in a group owned by the hospital, and to them only refer a patient to a\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED OR1Gllf~3ETITI0N                                              Page4 of 13\n\f       nephrologist in a hospital owned group and to malign and smear a highly qualified\n       nephrologist in the practice at the same hospital.\n\n6.15   The Defendants decided to then have a covert whisper campaign and not refer any\n       patients to Dr. Montoya.\n\n6.16   The Defendants illegal and anti-competitive acts unfairly and wrongfully have cast Dr.\n       Montoya's stellar reputation under a dark cloud. Also the patients of Dr. Montoya have\n       been refused the services of Dr. Montoya when the patient is in the hospital. The patients\n       are suffering in paying higher costs and expenses for their care.\n\n6.17   Dr. Montoya was brought up on charges of incompetent patient care for misspelled words\n       on a chart. These actions were just taken to discredit Dr. Montoya and his ability to\n       practice medicine in San Angelo and at San Angelo Community Medical Center. None\n       of the actions of the hospital were based on patient care but for retaliation after Dr.\n       Montoya complained about the Defendants anticompetitive actions. The actions also\n       were to hurt the reputation of Dr. Montoya in advanced abilities in nephrology. Dr.\n       Montoya corrected the \"misspelled words\" and harsh undeserved review of his charts\n       continued. Despite the efforts of Defendants the railroading of Dr. Montoya was not\n       successful.\n\n6.18   The actions of the Defendants have a tendency to reduce or eliminate competition that is\n       not offset by any countervailing procompetitive justification.\n\n       Causes of Action\n\n       The causes of action are only under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n7.     Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations\n\n7.1    The actions of the Defendants are tortiously interfering with patient choice and care. The\n       actions are being taken by the Defendants to keep the Plaintiff from having a successful\n       nephrology practice. Defendant's actions are such that they know that their interference\n       will cause the Plaintiff damage in excess of the minimum judicial limits of the Court.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGilf'84ETITION                                           Page 5 of 13\n\f      Defendants intentionally interfered with Dr. Montoya's longstanding and continuous\n      relationships with patients and referring physicians from the emergency room/department\n      in a concerted effort to restrain completion and monopolize the practice of nephrology\n      and the treatment of long term kidney disease in the relevant market described in this\n      petition.\n\n7.2   Every contract, combination or competition of the relevant defendants in restraint of trade\n      or commerce is unlawful and is just as it is unlawful for any person to monopolize,\n      attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\n\n7.3   The Plaintiff pleads a reduction of competition in the relevant market in general to\n      patients. A monopoly in this case is caused by the elimination of Dr. Montoya and is just\n      as harmful as it would be if driving out competition in large groups. Removal of Dr.\n      Montoya from the hospital and its relevant market will adversely affect and unreasonably\n      affect overall competitive conditions and cost patients money. The Defendants through\n      their actions are possessing or trying to possess monopoly power in the relevant market\n      and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power is distinguished from growth\n      through business acumen.\n\n7.4   The Defendants are engaging anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to\n      monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power and the\n      defendants' ability to lessen or destroy completion in the relevant market and cost\n      patients money.\n\n7.5   Patients are damaged by the actions of the Defendants by higher cost of care.\n\n      Patients have an absolute right under the patients Bill of Rights attached as Exhibit D to\n      \"Participate in decisions about your care, including developing your treatment plan,\n      discharge planning and having your family and personal physician promptly notified of\n      your admission. Select providers of goods and services to be received after discharge.\"\n      The Plaintiffs did not follow the Bill of· Rights and violated the patient choice and\n      damaged the Defendants in violating the Bill of Rights.\n\n7.6   The actions of the Defendants are illegal and anticompetitive.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGDf465ETITION                                           Page 6 of 13\n\f7. 7   San Angelo Community Medical Center created its own group of doctors owned by the\n       hospital in both hospitalist groups and in a group named Community Medical Associates.\n       These groups came into existence on or about 2006. Until these groups Dr. Montoya\n       received his share of new patients from the hospital and emergency room. After these\n       groups were formed Dr. Montoya received only one referral since 2007.\n\n       Facts for Cause of Action\n\n7.8    Realleges all facts in paragraph 6 above.\n\n7.9    Dr. Montoya was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical\n       Center in 1981. Dr. Montoya has full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at\n       San Angelo Community Medical Center. The facts of the case are that Kirk Brewer,\n       M.D. was during his actions an officer and/or Chief of Staff of the medical staff of San\n       Angelo Community Medical Center. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was hired by San Angelo\n       Community Medical Center to run the hospitalist service. As an officer of the staff and\n       Chief of Staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. owed Dr. Montoya as a member of the staff a fiduciary\n       duty to not interfere by direct or indirect action with his practice of nephrology at San\n       Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n7.10   Kirk Brewer, M.D. came to San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2007. Part of Dr.\n       Montoya and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a rotating\n       system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital and\n       emergency room.      When you are the named specialist you receive a call from the\n       emergency room physician that a doctor with your specialty is needed for a patient. A\n       big part of Dr. Montoya's practice was obtaining new patients and treating existing\n       patients that came to the emergency room and needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 Dr.\n       Montoya has obtained new patients from the emergency room.\n\n7.11   Until 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month\n       to treat either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n       Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or a\n       hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new\n       patient or existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED ORIGDfflgETITION                                         Page 7 of 13\n\f7.12   The one time for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 Dr. Montoya\n       was called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on\n       duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n       informed Dr. Montoya that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure.                 Dr.\n       Montoya was informed his name was on the call board in the emergency room as\n       nephrologist on call. Both of the above doctors asked Dr. Montoya to consult concerning\n       treatment for that patient. Dr. Montoya gave an initial consult advice/orders of treatment\n       to both doctors. This consultation call was to Dr. Montoya at 9:38 p.m. Dr. Montoya\n       informed them he would come see the patient and then review the test results and\n       determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as Exhibit A is a true and\n       correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n\n\n7.13   On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of the\n                                                                                               I\n       patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the patieft or\n       the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled Dr. Montoya consult and treatment byl Dr.\n                                                                                               I\n\n       Montoya and consulted another nephrologist. Dr. Montoya went to the call board! and\n       witnessed his name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014. !The\n       San Angelo Community Medical Center is required to have an official EMT!LA\n       Medicare call list for on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical C nter\n                                                                                               I\n       to take Medicare patients.

Kirk Brewer, M.D. was\n       aware that his actions would become known to the staff physicians of San Angelo\n       Community Medical Center and that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign saying\n       Dr. Montoya should not be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical\n       Center.\n\n7.15   Attached to this petition as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n       existing patient of Dr. Montoya, Mrs. Welch tried to see Dr. Montoya in the emergency\n       room of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not\n       call Dr. Montoya to treat his existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and Dr.\n       Montoya has treated her for at least 20 years.\n\n7.16   Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also over 90\n       years of age and has been Dr. Montoya patient for at least 10 years requested me when\n       she went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see Dr. Montoya.\n\n7.17   A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician. Both of the above\n       happened when Kirk Brewer, M.D. was President of the medical staff or an officer of the\n       medical staff and when he was head of the hospitalist service when the above happened.\n\n7.18   Again by the actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are\n       controlled by their supervisors or lead physicians Kirk Brewer, M.D. through this actions\n       defamed Dr. Montoya as a qualified physician or staff at San Angelo Community\n       Medical Center.\n\n7.19   Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary damages from the Defendant, because they\n       acted with malice required to support an award of exemplary damages.

Defamation Per Se\n\n9.1   The statements of the Defendant constitute defamation per se in that they suggest that the\n      Defendant is not a competent nephrologist and should not be referred patients.\n\n9.2   The Defendant has published the above statements on numerous occasions through a\n      whisper campaign and his conduct.\n\n9.3   The defamatory statements are false.

Malice\n\n        By reference Plaintiff adopts and realleges Paragraphs 6-9 of the Original Petition as if\n        they were set forth herein. For further cause of action, Defendant's conduct amounts to\n        malice under the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code§ 41.007 and the common law\n        of Texas because Defendant's actions have and are involving an extreme degree of risk\n        considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others.

MONTOYA, JR., M.D., West Texas Renal Care and West Texas\nNephrology file this Sixth Amended Original Petition and would show:\n\n1.     This case should be conducted under Discovery Level Two until the Court enters a Level\n       Three Scheduling Order.\n\n2.     Plaintiff STEVE F. MONTOYA, JR., M.D. is an individual residing in Tom Green\n       County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Renal Care is a Texas Corporation with its principal\n       place of business in Tom Green County, Texas. Plaintiff West Texas Nephrology is a\n       Texas Professional Association with its principal place of business in Tom Green County,\n       Texas.\n\n3.     Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center (SACMC) is a Delaware LLC that is\n       registered to do business in the State of Texas and has its principal place of business in\n       San Angelo, Tom Green County, Texas. San Angelo Medical Center can be served by\n       serving its registered agent Corporation Service Company d/b/a CSC-Lawyers\n       Incorporating Service Company as its registered address, 211 E. 7th Street, Suite 620,\n       Austin, Texas 78701.\n\n       Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. is an individual whose principal place of business and\n       residence is in Tom Green County, Texas. Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. can be served\n       at his office at San Angelo Medical Center at 3501 Knickerbocker Rd., San Angelo,\n       Texas 76904.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGINAL PEmION                                           Page 1 of25\n\n                                                JQQ\n\f      Other participants in the anticompetitive conspiracy against Plaintiffs include Dr.\n      Brewer's group of hospitalists (exact name unknown), West Texas Medical Associates\n      (\"WTMA\") and groups affiliated with the hospital. These entities and individuals are not\n      defendants at this time.\n\n4.    Venue and Jurisdiction\n      Venue is proper in Tom Green County under Tex.Civ.Prac. & Remedies Code Section\n      15.002(a) (1) as all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this legal\n      action occurred in Tom Green County, Texas.\n\n5.    Dr. Montoya, West Texas Renal Care and West Texas Nephrology, PA have incurred and\n      sues for damages in the maximum amount of$ 6,400,000.00 plus three times exemplary\n      damages plus attorneys' fees and costs as allowed by law. Until 2007 Dr. Montoya\n      would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat either new or\n      existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since 2008 Dr.\n      Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n      consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new or existing\n      patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused\n      substantial injury to Dr. Montoya and damaged his ability to compete, because he\n      depended on these referrals and consults to build his practice. A majority of patients who\n      need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney disease in a hospital later need continuing care\n      for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such continuing treatments is\n      kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need treatment for average of 6\n      years, and each such patient would mean revenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of\n      approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya estimates that he has lost at least 100\n      long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the present due to the Defendants'\n      anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient referrals or consults. He estimates\n      that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $3,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of\n      time.\n\n6.1   Dr. Steve F. Montoya has practiced as a nephrologist since 1979 in San Angelo, Texas.\n      Dr. Montoya has practiced at San Angelo Community Hospital since 1981. Dr. Montoya\n      in developing, building and keeping bis practice, has always taken patients as an on-call\n\n                                                                                        Page 2 of25\n PLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGI8~1PETITION\n\f      staff attending physician from the emergency room/department of San Angelo\n      Community Medical Center.\n\n6.2   In developing and building a practice Dr. Montoya as a nephrologist wanted long tenn\n      kidney dialysis patients to treat in his practice.     Referral from hospitals and area\n      physicians is extremely important to a nephrologist to building and keeping a practice.\n      The ability to obtain referrals from a hospital and area physicians is a primary source of\n      patients with kidney disease. Defendants in this case conspired to deprive Plaintiffs of\n      referrals needed for his nephrology practice. This case is for the anticompetitive actions\n      of the Defendants posing a danger of monopoliz.ation or attempted monopoliz.ation of\n      patient choice and causing patients to pay more for medical care and injuring consumer\n      patients.\n\n6.3   Besides word of mouth and patient to patient referral Dr. Montoya built his patient base\n      from referring physicians, from referrals of patients who came to the emergency\n      room/department and hospital patients with kidney disease. Dr. Montoya,s practice\n      depends on finding a patient who lives in the service area/relevant market of San Angelo\n      Community Medical Center and needs long tenn care which can include dialysis.\n      Dialysis care is one of the primary ways Dr. Montoya and his entities succeed. Dr.\n      Montoya during his 36 year career in San Angelo built his practice including a dialysis\n      unit that can serve 24 patients per shift.\n\n6.4   The service area/relevant market for San Angelo Community Medical Center is Tom\n      Green County and contiguous counties. The service area/relevant geographic market, for\n      the purposes of all of Plaintiff's claims for antitrust violations and other anticompetitive\n      conduct, is Tom Green County and contiguous counties. Patients needing emergency\n      care for kidney ailments are not likely to travel far from their homes for such treatment,\n      so the relevant geographic market for hospital nephrology services and for nephrology\n      consults and referrals is therefore Tom Green County and contiguous counties. Patients\n      needing longer term nephrology services, such as kidney. dialysis, often need repeated\n      and frequent care from a doctor or dialysis clinic near their home or residence. Such care\n      is often required multiple times per week. Because patients are not likely to travel far for\n      such repeated and frequent doctor and clinic visits, doctors and clinics located far from\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN3'cf2TITION                                          Page 3 of25\n\f      Tom Green County are not a substitute for nephrology services in the Tom Green County\n      area, and the relevant geographic market is therefore Tom Green County and contiguous\n      counties. Patients needing emergency care for kidney ailments are also not likely to\n      travel far from their homes for such treatment, so the relevant geographic market for\n      hospital nephrology services and for nephrology consults and referrals is therefore Tom\n      Green County and contiguous counties.\n6.5   Dr. Brewer is thought be an employee and/or owner of a group of hospitalists affiliated\n      with, and possibly created by, SACMC. Dr. Brewer is the chief of staff of the hospital\n      and head of the hospitalist group that practices at San Angelo Community Medical\n      Center.   Dr. Montoya has been denied the referral of patients that come into the\n      emergency room with kidney problems/illness/disease. These patients are being referred\n      to the hospital affiliated group. Even Dr. Montoya's current patients are being referred to\n      the hospitalist/hospital affiliated group. The group affiliated with the hospital is costing\n      the patient money because the patients have to pay for a hospitalist and are then being\n      referred to a different nephrologist whose group has a contract/agreement with the\n      hospital and its affiliated entities. The patients are denied the opportunity to save money.\n      The hospitalist group charges the patients at a higher comprehensive rate/code.\n\n6.6   At all relevant times Dr. Kirk Brewer, himself, as a principal officer of Community\n      Medical Associates, San Angelo Community Medical Center and Chief of Staff of San\n      Angelo Community Medical Center (SACMC) and head of the hospitalist system at\n      (SACMC) with agents/employees of (SACMC) working under his control, direction, or\n      in furtherance of unlawful and improper actions was and is employed by and acting in\n      furtherance of the business of (SACMC) and its affiliated medical practice(s). Dr.\n      Brewer is individually liable for his own illegal, improper acts and omissions. At various\n      times Dr. Brewer acted for himself, (SACMC) and/or his group of hospitalists. Dr.\n      Brewer is also liable for the improper acts and omissions as Chief of Staff of (SACMC).\n      Dr. Brewer, as well as the other agents/employees of (SACMC) and/or its affiliated\n      practices are liable under the doctrine ofrespondeat superior and vicarious liability.\n\n6.7   The Defendants (SACMC) and Dr. Kirk Brewer, along with WTMA and Dr. Brewers\n      group of hospitalists acting by and through its agents/employees/principals/officers acted\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~jTITION                                             Page4 of25\n\f       together to carry out the improper and illegal actions and therefore are jointly and\n       severally liable for civil conspiracy in carrying out their wrongful activities.\n\n6.8    All conditions precedent to Plaintiffs recovery have been performed or have occurred.\n       Dr. Montoya is a hard working member of the San Angelo Medical Community. Dr.\n       Montoya came out of San Antonio, Texas and received a full scholarship for his\n       undergraduate degree at Rice University. After graduating Rice University Dr. Montoya\n       then went on to medical school at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School\n       in Dallas, Texas. After Dr. Montoya finished his residency and training he went to in\n       west Texas. Dr. Montoya built a stellar reputation for quality patient care, excellence in\n       the practice of nephrology and dialysis care of the long term illness of kidney\n       failure/disease. Dr. Montoya's reputation in the medical community in the San Angelo\n       areaffom Green County allowed him to regularly obtain referrals for nephrology work\n       from the emergency room at SACMC, as well as consults for nephrology work from\n       other doctors at SACMC. These referrals and consults were and are necessary for Dr.\n       Montoya's continued presence as a competitor in the market for nephrology services in\n       the San Angelo/fom Green County area. Dr. Montoya relied on these consults and\n       referrals to build his nephrology practice, for once he had consulted on a patient, that\n       patient was likely to remain a patient of Dr. Montoya's if that patient needed continuing\n       kidney care such as dialysis.\n\n6.9    Dr. Montoya is the only nephrologist in San Angelo that speaks Spanish. Dr. Montoya\n       cares about his patients, his fellow medical professionals, and his community.             Dr.\n       Montoya's practice has expanded over the years including with the referral from local\n       physicians, the emergency room/department and hospital consultation because of his\n       well-deserved reputation for quality patient care. These referrals are necessary for Dr.\n       Brewer to compete.\n\n6.10   Dr. Montoya's skill as a nephrologist was, until the hospital created its affiliated medical\n       practice or entered into an exclusive contract with the group of hospitalists affiliated\n       and/or managed by Dr. Brewer, a marketing asset for SACMC. Dr. Montoya received his\n       rotating share of referrals of patients with kidney disease/illness/failure until SACMC\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~4TITION                                                  Page S of25\n\f       created its affiliated practice groups and/or entered into an exclusive contract with the\n       group ofhospitalists affiliated and/or managed by Dr. Brewer.\n\n6.11   The recommendation and referral through the emergency room/department directly\n       affects the patient's choice of doctor. The doctor in turn decides the patient's course of\n       treatment and what and how the patient is coded for billing on treatment.\n\n6.12   The choice of doctor directly affects the patient's costs and expenses both in the short\n       term and for long term care of kidney disease/illness/failure. Individuals with kidney\n       disease can require care for the rest of their life which may include dialysis.\n\n6.13   Improperly manipulating the doctor a patient receives care from creates a cost to the\n       patient and improperly distorts free and informed patient choice and options for medical\n       care.\n\n6.14   The correct and appropriate way for any health care provider of emergency hospital\n       services and nephrology service is to provide the highest quality of care to the patient.\n       Patients deserve to have lower costs. The illegal and unjust way of treating patients is to\n       manipulate their free choice in the market place. In this case the Defendants only\n       referred a patient to a hospitalist; in a group affiliated with the hospital, then only refer a\n       patient to a nephrologist in a hospital affiliated group. Defendants also maligned and\n       then smeared a highly qualified nephrologist in practice at the same hospital.\n\n6.15   Starting in 2008 Defendants decided to then have a covert whisper campaign and not\n       refer any patients to Dr. Montoya.\n\n6.16   The Defendants illegal and anti-competitive acts unfairly and wrongfully have cast Dr.\n       Montoya's stellar reputation under a dark cloud. Also the patients of Dr. Montoya have\n       been refused the services of Dr. Montoya when the patient is in the hospital. The patients\n       are suffering in paying higher costs and expenses for their care.\n\n6.17   Dr. Montoya was brought up on charges of incompetent patient care for misspelled words\n       on a chart. These actions were just taken to discredit Dr. Montoya and his ability to\n       practice medicine in San Angelo and at San Angelo Community Medical Center. None\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~STITION                                                 Page 6 of25\n\f         of the actions of the hospital were based on patient care but for retaliation after Dr.\n         Montoya complained about the Defendants anticompetitive actions. The actions also\n         were done to hurt the reputation of Dr. Montoya in advanced abilities in nephrology. Dr.\n         Montoya corrected the \"misspelled words\" and harsh undeserved review of his charts\n         continued. Despite the efforts of Defendants the railroading of Dr. Montoya was not\n         successful.\n\n6.18     The actions of the Defendants have a tendency to reduce or eliminate competition that is\n         not offset by any countervailing procompetitive justification.\n\n\n6.19     Dr. Montoya was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical\n         Center in 1981. Dr. Montoya has full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at\n         San Angelo Community Medical Center. The facts of the case are that Kirk Brewer,\n         M.D. was during his actions an officer and/or Chief of Staff of the medical staff of San\n         Angelo Community Medical Center. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was hired by San Angelo\n         Community Medical Center to run the hospitalist service. As an officer of the staff and\n         Chief of Staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. owed Dr. Montoya as a member of the staff a fiduciary\n         duty to not interfere by direct or indirect action with his practice of nephrology at San\n         Angelo Community Medical Center.\n6.20     Kirk Brewer, M.D. came to San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2007. Dr.\n         Montoya has long relied on obtaining patients is the fact hospital emergency room uses a\n         rotating system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital and\n         emergency room.      When you are the named specialist you receive a call from the\n         emergency room physician that a doctor with your specialty is needed for a patient. A\n         big part of Dr. Montoya's practice was obtaining new patients and treating existing\n         patients that came to the emergency room and needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 Dr.\n         Montoya has obtained new patients from the emergency room.\n\n\n6.21     The one timeDr.Montoya received a consult for a new patient is described below. On\n       January 24, 2014 Dr. Montoya was called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center\n       emergency room physician on duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the\n       emergency room physician informed Dr. Montoya that a patient was diagnosed with acute\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGINWSTITION                                                Page 7 of25\n\f   renal failure. Dr. Montoya was informed his name was on the call board in the emergency\n   room as nephrologist on call. Both of the above doctors asked Dr. Montoya to consult\n   concerning treatment for that patient Dr. Montoya gave initial consult advice/orders of\n   treatment to both doctors. This consultation call was to Dr. Montoya at 9:38 p.m. Dr.\n   Montoya informed them he would come see the patient and then review the test results and\n   determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as Exhibit A is a true and\n   correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n   Until 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to\n   treat either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new patient or existing\n   patient that suffered with kidney problems. The lack of referrals caused substantial injury to\n   Dr. Montoya and damaged his ability to compete, because he depended on these referrals\n   and consults to build his business. Many patients who need kidney treatment in a hospital\n   later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such\n   continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need\n   treatment for four to eight years, and each such patient would mean revenue to Dr.\n   Montoya's practice of approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya estimates that he has\n   lost 10-12 long term kidney dialysis patients.per year from 2008 to the present due to the\n   Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient referrals or consults. He\n   estimates that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $3,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that\n   period of time. All referrals now go to the nephrologist at an affiliated group of the hospital.\n   This damage estimate is specifically incorporated by reference into all of Plaintiffs causes\n   of action set forth infra.\n\n\n6.22     On January 25, 2014 at 8: 10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of the\n   patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the patient or the\n   chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled Dr. Montoya's consult and treatment by Dr. Montoya\n   and consulted another nephrologist. Dr. Montoya went to the call board and witnessed his\n       name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014. The San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center is required to have an official EMTALA Medicare call list for\n   on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical Center to take Medicare patients.\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGINWtTITION                                               Page 8 of25\n\f   This is the list my name was on and was intentionally ignored. This also violates a patient's\n   right to choose their physician. This list was followed until Dr. Brewer came to San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brough~ in\n   for consult is one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services.\n   Dr. Brewer did not see the patient when he removed me as the treating nephrologist he\n   issued the change via a telephone order (see Exhibit B). Kirk Brewer, M.D. without seeing\n   the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change ofnephrologist was for Kirk\n   Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused Dr. Montoya economic loss. Attached as Exhibit\n   Bis a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts on January 25,\n   2014.\n   Kirk Brewer, M.D. by his actions of removing Dr. Montoya as the nephrologist published a\n   statement that Dr. Montoya was not a competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the\n   San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was aware\n   that his actions would become known to the staff physicians of San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center and that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign saying Dr. Montoya\n       should not be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. These\n       remarks caused hospitalists and other doctors at SACMC, as well as doctors and nurses in\n       the SACMC emergency department, to cease and refuse to (a) admit patients to the care of\n       Dr. Montoya, and (b) refer patients to Dr. Montoya for nephrology consults.\n\n\n6.23      Attached to this petition as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n       existing patient of Dr. Montoya, Mrs. Welch tried to see Dr. Montoya in the emergency\n       room of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not\n       call Dr. Montoya to treat his existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and Dr.\n       Montoya has treated her for at least 20 years.\n6.24      Another patient of Dr. Montoya, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also\n       over 90 years of age and has been a Dr. Montoya patient for at least 10 years requested Dr.\n       Montoya when she went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see Dr.\n       Montoya.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                                  Page 9 of25\n\f6.25      A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician. Both of the above\n       happened when Kirk Brewer, M.D. was President of the medical staff or an officer of the\n       medical staff and when he was head of the hospitalist service when the above happened.\n\n6.26      Again by the actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are\n       controlled by their supervisors or lead physicians Kirk Brewer, M.D. through this actions\n       defamed Dr. Montoya as a qualified physician or staff at San Angelo Community Medical\n       Center.\n\n6.27      Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary damages from the Defendant, because they\n       acted with malice required to support an award of exemplary damages. Defendants have\n       acted with a specific intent to cause injury to the Plaintiff.\n\n6.28      Plaintiff sues under this cause of action for anticompetitive conduct and/or effect. The\n       Plaintiff sues for damages that are within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n          Causes of Action\n\n          The causes of action are only under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n7.        Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations\n\n7.1       The actions of the Defendants are tortiously interfering with patient choice and care. The\n          actions are being taken by the Defendants to keep the Plaintiff from having a successful\n          nephrology practice. Defendant's actions are such that they know that their interference\n          will cause the Plaintiff damage in excess of the minimum judicial limits of the Court.\n\n          Defendants intentionally interfered with Dr. Montoya's longstanding and continuous\n          relationships with patients and referring physicians from the emergency room/department\n          in a concerted effort to restrain completion and monopolize the practice of nephrology\n          and the treatment of long term kidney disease in the relevant market described in this\n          petition.\n\n7.2       Every contract, combination or competition of the relevant defendants in restraint of trade\n          or commerce is unlawful and is just as it is unlawful for any person to monopolize,\n          attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                                     Page 10 of25\n\f7.3   The Plaintiff pleads a reduction of competition in the relevant market in general to\n      patients. A monopoly in this case is caused by the elimination of Dr. Montoya and is just\n      as harmful as it would be if driving out competition in large groups. Removal of Dr.\n      Montoya from the hospital and its relevant market will adversely affect and unreasonably\n      affect overall competitive conditions and cost patients money. The Defendants through\n      their actions are possessing or trying to possess monopoly power in the relevant market\n      and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power is distinguished from growth\n      through business acumen.\n\n7.4   The Defendants are engaging in anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to\n      monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power and the\n      defendants' ability to lessen or destroy completion in the relevant market and cost\n      patients money.\n\n7.5   Patients are damaged by the actions of the Defendants by higher costs of care.\n\n      Patients have an absolute right under the patients Bill of Rights attached as Exhibit D to\n      \"Participate in decisions about your care, including developing your treatment plan,\n      discharge planning and having your family and personal physician promptly notified of\n      your admission. Select providers of goods and services to be received after discharge.\"\n      The Plaintiffs did not follow the Bill of Rights and violated the patient choice and\n      damaged the Defendants in violating the Bill of Rights.\n\n7.6   The actions of the Defendants are illegal and anticompetitive.\n\n7.7   San Angelo Community Medical Center created its affiliated group of doctors affiliated\n      with the hospital in both hospitalist groups and in a group named Community Medical\n      Associates. These groups came into existence on or about 2006. Before these groups\n      existed Dr. Montoya received his share of new patients from the hospital and emergency\n      room. After these groups were formed Dr. Montoya received only one referral since\n      2007.\n\n\n8.

The Plaintiff is entitled to and\n      sues for exemplary damages within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n      Plaintiff sues under this cause of action for anticompetitive conduct and/or effect.\n\n9.    Defamation Per Se\n\n9.1   The statements of the Defendants constitute defamation per se in that they suggest that\n      the Plaintiff is not a competent nephrologist and should not be referred patients.\n\n9.2   The Defendants have published the above statements on numerous occasions through a\n      whisper campaign and their conduct.\n\n9.3   The defamatory statements are false. Defendants have and are publishing the remarks to\n      individuals and entities to harm the Plaintiff and to remove all competition illegally in an\n      anti-competitive action.\n\n9.4   The statements and actions of the Defendants were published by their conduct. The\n      actions were referring to Dr. Montoya as a non-competent nephrologist.                  The\n      statement(s)/ actions were defamatory and caused Dr. Montoya economics loss.\n\n9.5   The total loss is between $3,000,000.00 and $6,500,000.00 from not receiving any\n      referrals from the emergency room or hospitalists. Until 2007 Dr. Montoya would receive\n      10-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat either new or existing patients at\n      the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received\n      one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist,\n      except for one time for treatment of a new or existing patient that suffered with kidney\n      disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused substantial injury to Dr. Montoya and\n      damaged his ability to compete, because he depended on these referrals and consults to\n      build his practice. A majority of patients who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney\n      disease in a hospital later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems; the\n      most common of such continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis\n      patient will need treatment for at least ten years, and each such patient would mean\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~PfTITION                                            Page 12 of25\n\f      revenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya\n      estimates that he has lost at least 100 long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the\n      present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient\n      referrals or consults. He estimates that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $3,000,000\n      to $6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n\n9.6   The defamatory statements are untrue.        Dr. Montoya is a competent and qualified\n      nephrologist to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n9.7   The actions of the Defendants were intentional or done with negligence when the\n      Defendants knew that the statement was false and his actions would lead a reasonable\n      prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory potential.\n\n9.8   All officers and President of the medical staff and the medical staff must follow the rules\n      at San Angelo Community Medical Center and staff of San Angelo Community Medical\n      Center and have a new patient in the emergency room or hospital that needs a specialist\n      consultation assigned to the name off the rotating consultation list. By the Defendants.\n      not following this procedure Dr. Montoya did not receive any consultation requests from\n      the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2008-\n      present and one in 2014.\n\n\n10.   Malice\n\n      By reference Plaintiff adopts and realleges the acts stated above as if they were set forth\n      herein. For further cause of action, Defendant's conduct amounts to malice under the\n      Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 41.007 and the common law of Texas because\n      Defendant's actions have and are involving an extreme degree of risk considering the\n      probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others.           Plaintiff is entitled to\n      exemplary damages and does hereby sue for them.\n\n11.   Business Disparagement\n\n      The Plaintiffs reallege the allegations and facts set forth above.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~P2TITI0N                                            Page 13 of25\n\f       The Defendants published disparaging comments and allegations about Dr. Montoya and\n       his practice. Defendants took the action(s) to harm the Plaintiff's business interests.\n       Defendants knew the disparagement was false and the actions were done with malice.\n\n12.    Restraint of trade      (Monopolization/Attempted Monopolization/ Conspiracy to\n       Monopolize)\n\n12.1   The Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations and facts set forth\n       above.\n\n12.2   Plaintiff makes claim under the Texas Business and Commerce Code Sections 15.0S(b)\n       and 15.21 known as the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act as it recognizes as illegal\n       improper attempts to abuse the patient referral of the emergency room/department and\n       hospital patients, as well as conspiracies to limit patient choices by concerted illegal\n       action as engaged by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs seek relief for this anticompetitive\n       action(s) solely under the laws established by the State of Texas concerning\n       anticompetitive misconduct affecting Texas citizens and patients. The Defendants (along\n       with WTMA and Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists) have monopolized and/or attempted\n       to monopolize the relevant markets of nephrology services and/or referrals and consults\n       for nephrology services by conspiring to deprive Plaintiffs of consults and referrals for\n       nephrology services. By conspiring against Dr. Montoya, the Defendants and unindicted\n       co-conspirators are attempting to remove him as a competitor to monopolize the markets\n       for themselves.\n\n12.3   In Tom Green County the Plaintiffs are in competition with the Defendants. Defendants\n       have derived or attempted to derive illegal benefit and patient choice and option for care\n       was improperly limited in Tom Green and contiguous counties. The area of service the\n       Defendants are trying to control is Tom Green and contiguous counties. The Defendants\n       are trying to restrain competition in these counties\n\n12.4   Defendants actions are in furtherance of the combination and conspiracy and with the\n       purpose and intent of excluding the Plaintiffs from the patient care market in the relevant\n       market described above and destroying competition from Dr. Montoya and causing a\n       resulting loss and cost to patients. These acts were done with the specific intent to harm\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                            Page 14 of25\n\f       both Dr. Montoya and patients in the relevant market.      These acts were done with the\n       specific intent to weaken or eliminate competition from the Plaintiffs and injure patients\n       and obtain market dominance in the relevant market.\n\n12.5   The actions also hurt the patient population in the relevant market by removing or trying\n       to remove completion in the practice of nephrology.\n\n12.6   The concerted actions of the Defendants were flagrant and willful and done for the\n       purpose of harming Dr. Montoya, the Plaintiffs and patients. Defendants illegally and\n       improperly diverted the patients to the hospital affiliated practice. Each Defendant in this\n       case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and WTMA and Dr. Brewer's group of hospitalists\n       (eventual defendants) are being sued for their individual roles and conduct in the\n       monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to monopolize, and group\n       boycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each of these entities may have engaged in the\n       illegal conduct through their agents or representatives, they are being sued for their\n       individual roles and conduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of\n       liability due to actions of Dr. Brewer.\n\n12.7   The acts of the Defendants constitute illegal monopolization, attempted monopolization\n       and /or conspiracy to monopolize under applicable Texas law. The Defendants have\n       monopolized or have a dangerous chance of monopolizing the relevant product markets\n       of nephrology services and referrals and consults for nephrology services. This case is\n       for the anticompetitive actions of the Defendants posing a danger of monopolization and\n       injuring consumer patients.        By restricting competition the Defendants are hurting\n       patients in the relevant market.\n\n12.8   Plaintiff sues under this cause of action for anticompetitive conduct and/or effect. While\n       the Defendants' monopolization and attempted monopolization has harmed Dr. Montoya\n       and his professional practice, it has also harmed consumers and others who pay for\n       nephrology services in the relevant market by increasing the costs of those services. This\n       is demonstrated by the chart attached hereto as Exhibit B.

Even if the hospitalists could do the same work as Dr.\n       Montoya or his partner used to provide, the patient still faces increased cost for the same\n       nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services than Dr.\n       Montoya charges. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare\n       allowable rate, which adds up to average charges of$506.85 per day. See Exhibit. E. Dr.\n       Mont~ya, however, charges at the \"Moderate,, Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to\n       an average cost of $346.13 per day. The difference between these charges is $160.72 per\n       nephrology patient per average hospital stay.            Over the course of a year,\n       consumers/payors for nephrology services have thus paid thousands more for the\n       hospitalists' physician and nephrology services than they would have paid for care from\n       Dr. Montoya who is a physician specialist in nephrology. This is a classic example of an\n       antitrust injury, i.e. an injury to competition which the antitrust laws were made to\n       prevent. This antitrust injury arises from the Defendants monopolization and attempted\n       monopolization of the relevant markets for (a) nephrology services in the San\n       Angelo/Tom Green County area, and {b) the market for referrals and consults for\n       nephrology services in the San Angelo/Tom Green County area.\n\n13.    Group Boycott and Conspiracy in Restraint of trade\n\n13.1   SACMC, Dr. Kirk Brewer, Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists, and West Texas Medical\nAssociates (\"WTMA\") entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in\nviolation of Section 15.0S(a) of the Texas Antitrust Act. See Tex.Bus. & Com. Code Ann.§\n15.0S(a). In furtherance of this conspiracy, the conspirators entered into an agreement by which\nall new nephrology patients entering the SACMC emergency room would be admitted to a\nhospitalist working in Dr. Brewer,s group ofhospitalists. The patients were admitted to these\nhospitalists even when they were already a patient of Dr. Montoya, and even if they specifically\nrequested Dr. Montoya to be their attending physician. The hospitals would then refer the\npatients to groups affiliated with the hospital. This combination deprived Dr. Montoya of patient\nreferrals he should have received for (a) new patients entering the hospital through the\nemergency room, and (b) nephrology consults for patients already in the hospital. By favoring\nhospitalists over Dr. Montoya, Dr. Brewer increased financial remuneration for himself because\nthese patients were being treated by hospitalists in his own group. Dr. Brewer and his group also\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~~TITION                                             Page 16 of25\n\fbenefited by referring the patients groups affiliated with the hospital for nephrology services,\nbecause Dr. Brewer and his hospitalist group receive payments from WTMA for providing\n\"coverage\" at the SACMC emergency room for nephrology patients. In return for these\npayments, Dr. Brewer and his hospitalists insure that all referrals and consults at SACMC for\nnephrology services are made to groups affiliated with the hospital such as WTMA.\n\n\n\n13.2   The combination between SACMC, Dr. Kirk Brewer, Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists,\nand WTMA constitutes a concerted refusal to deal with Dr. Montoya which is a per se violation\nof the Section 15.0S(a) of the Texas Antitrust Act. See Tex.Bus. & Com. Code Ann.§ 15.0S(a).\nIt would also violate the \"rule of reason\" as it unreasonably restrained trade and commerce in the\nrelevant market of nephrology services in the San Angelo area, as well as in the markets for\nreferrals and consults for nephrology services in the San Angelo area. This anticompetitive\nconspiracy decreased patient choice and raised the price of care for those needing nephrology\nservices. Each Defendant in this case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and WTMA and Dr.\nBrewer's group of hospitalists (eventual defendants) are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct in the monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to monopolize, and group\nboycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each of these entities may have engaged in the illegal\nconduct through their agents or representatives, they are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of liability.\n\n\n\n13.3   The conspiracy is a horizontal agreement in restraint of trade, as it involves a direct\ncompetitor of Dr. Montoya (WTMA, a group affiliated with SACMC) that employs a\nnephrologist for the provision of nephrology services in the San Angelo geographic market.\nSACMC (along with Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists) has a dominant position and\nmarket power in the market for nephrology services in the San Angelo area, and in the market for\nreferrals and consults for nephrology services in the San Angelo area. SACMC, Dr. Brewer and\nDr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists hold a dominant position in the relevant market, in that these\nentities control the referral of all nephrology patients from within the SACMC hospital and\nemergen~y room to specialists such as Dr. Montoya; these entities thus control access to an\nelement necessary to enable Dr. Montoya to compete. There are no pro-competitive effects from\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN3½P6TITION                                            Page 17 of25\n\fthis arrangement. The hospitalists and emergency room doctors at SACMC have agreed with\nSACMC, Dr. Brewer, and Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists to only refer patients to, and ask for\nconsults from, nephrology doctors in groups affiliated with the hospital who are \"approved\" by\nDr. Brewer because they make payments to Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists. This\ncourse of dealing increases the profits of Dr. Brewer, groups affiliated with the hospital and Dr.\nBrewer's group ofhospitalists at the expense of competitors such as Dr. Montoya and is not\nintended to enhance overall efficiency or to make markets more competitive. These allegations\nare sufficient to raise a per se violation claim.\n\n13.4   Each Defendant in this case (i.e., SACMC and Dr. Brewer), and WTMA and Dr.\nBrewer's group of hospitalists (eventual defendants) are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct in the monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to monopolize, and group\nboycott/concerted refusal to deal. While each of these entities may have engaged in the illegal\nconduct through their agents or representatives, they are being sued for their individual roles and\nconduct and not simply under a respondeat superior theory of liability.\n\n\n\n13.5    While the conspirators' concerted refusal to deal has harmed Dr. Montoya and his\nprofessional practice, it has also banned consumers and others who pay for nephrology services\nin the relevant market by increasing the costs of those services. This is demonstrated by the\nchart attached hereto as Exhibit E. Before Dr. Brewer's group ofhospitalists became the\nattending physicians for all nephrology patients at SACMC, nephrology patients would be\nreferred to Dr. Montoya who would serve as the attending physician for the patient. This\narrangement avoided the \"middle man\" which now exists, as the hospitalists now usually serve\nas an additional charging entity between the patient and the nephrology specialist. Even if the\nhospitalists could do the same work as Dr. Montoya or his partner used to provide, the patient\n(and/or insurance and taxpayer-funded Medicare/Medicaid) still faces increased cost for the\nsame nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services than Dr. Montoya\ncharges. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare allowable rate,\nwhich adds up to average charges of $506.85 per day. See Exhibit E. Dr. Montoya, however,\ncharges at the \"Moderate\" Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to an average cost of $346.13\nper day.

Over the course of a year, consumers/payors for nephrology services have thus\npaid thousands more for the hospitalists' physician and nephrology services than they would\nhave paid for care from Dr. Montoya who is a physician specialist in nephrology. This is a\nclassic example of an antitrust injury, i.e. an injury to competition which the antitrust laws were\nmade to prevent. This antitrust injury arises from the conspirators' group boycott/concerted\nrefusal to deal with Dr. Montoya, as well as with the Defendants' monopolization and attempted\nmonopolization of the relevant market.\n\n14.    Restraint of Trade/ Tortious Interference by Violating EMTALA-\n\n14.1   The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (hereinafter EMTALA) is\nSection 1867(a) of the Social Security Act, and is codified within the section of the U.S. Code\nwhich governs the Medicare program. (42 USC 1395cc)                    The Healthcare Financing\nAdministration (hereinafter HCFA) is the federal agency that governs Medicare payments and\nhas the statutory authority to issue regulations concerning the implementation of EMTALA.\n(HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15)\n\n\n14.2   EMTALA is a statute which governs when and how a patient must be (1) examined and\noffered treatment or (2) transferred from one hospital to another when he is in an unstable\nmedical condition (3} the list of doctors on staff that are on call and the fair assignment of\npatients to doctors.     42 USC JJ95cc(a){l)(I)(iii), HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15 ,\nEmergency Dept. Compliance and Reimbursement Insider, May 2000,1-5.                  The statute is\nsometimes referred to as the anti-patient dumping act.\n\n\nBut in this case it does not involve patient dumping but the refusal to follow the mandatory call\nlist of EMTALA to fairly distribute the paying nephrology patients under Medicare or private\ninsurance.\n\n\n14.3    San Angelo Community Medical Center is Required to Maintain the Call List\n\n\nMedicare -participating hospitals must maintain a list of physicians who are on call to provide\nemergency care to individuals presenting to the emergency room. (42 USC 1395cc(a)(J)(I)(iii))\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~P~TITION                                              Page 19 of25\n\fUnder EMTALA the hospital and its officers are responsible for maintaining an on-call roster for\nthe emergency department. (42 USC J395cc(a)(l)(/)(iii))\n\n\nSan Angelo Community Medical Center is a Medicare -participating hospital.\n\n\nThe governing board and staff of the hospital must set standards for on-call services and a call\nlist and require that medical staff bylaws appropriately address the issue of call rotation, the call\nlist, and ensure the staff is properly accountable for the enforcement and compliance with the\nrequirements ofEMTALA. 42 USC 1395cc(a)(l)(l)(iii) ,42 CFR 482.11 and 42 CFR 482.22.\n\n\n14.4   All nephrology patients that go on to dialysis are covered under Medicare- thus are\npaying patients for the doctor and hospital\n\n\nPhysicians on staff are required to take all the referrals in their specialty. (HCFA Interpretive\nGuidelines V-15)\n\n\nA patient presenting for nephrology care is automatically placed under Medicare after their\ninitial diagnosis and Medicare pays the nephrology care even if the patient is under 65 and would\nordinarily be Medicare eligible. While in a hospital, inpatient hemodialysis is available, which would\nbe covered by Medicare Part A. This coverage by Medicare Part A is temporary and when the patient\nleaves the hospital the patient is covered by Medicare Part B for hemodialysis in dialysis facilities\n(Medicare      Coverage        of     Kidney       Dialysis      and      Transplant       Services\".·\nwww.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdj)\nThus all nephrology care is paid for either by private insurance or Medicare and is a financial\nbenefit to the hospital and on call physician.\n\n\n14.5 EMTALA apply in this case\n\n\nEMTALA applies to \"participating hospitalstt under Medicare -          i.e., to hospitals which have\nentered into \"provider agreementstt under which they will accept payment from the Department\nof Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the\nMedicare program for services provided to beneficiaries of that program. In practical terms, this\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~,TIT!ON                                                Page20 of25\n\fmeans that it applies to virtually all hospitals in the U.S., with the exception of the Shriners'\nHospital for Crippled Children and many military hospitals. Its provisions apply to all patients,\nand not just to Medicare patients. Thus the requirements apply to San Angelo Community\nMedical      Center      hospital      as     a     participating       hospital   under     Medicare.\n\n\nThe avowed purpose of the statute is to prevent hospitals from rejecting patients, refusing to treat\nthem, or transferring them to \"charity hospitals\" or \"county hospitals\" because they are unable to\npay or are covered under the Medicare or Medicaid programs and to fairly distribute patients\ncoming to the emergency room between physicians so the physician receives paying and non-\npaying patients. (42 USC 1395cc (a)(l)(l)(iii)), HCFA Interpretive Guidelines V-15.\n\n\n14.6 Does EMTALA apply only to people without insurance?\nNo. The statute expressly provides that the Act's provisions apply to all patients \"whether or not\neligible for Medicare benefits\". 42 USC 1395dd(a). Thus the facts of this case are subject to the\nfair distribution of patients to all nephrologists that are on staff.\n\n\nDespite the fact that the purpose of the statute is to prevent ''patient dumping\", there is no\nrequirement that the patient in fact be unable to pay his bills or that there be an economic\nmotivation behind the decision to transfer the patient. Cooper v. Gulf Breeze Hospital, 839 F.\nSupp. 1538 (1993). This is a key in this case, the patients coming to the emergency room for\nnephrology care are guaranteed to pay the doctor for services through Medicare.\n\n\n14.7    San Angelo Community Medical Center wants the paying patients to go to the other\nneghrologist in the hospital owned or affiliated group and to not have Dr. Montoya receive his\nfair share ofpatients.\n\n\n14.8    The pumose of the call list is to allow all physicians to egually receive call and paying\nand non-paying patients.\n\nIn this case the kidney disease patients are all paying patients under the government Medicare\nprogram.\n\n14.9 Fair Use of the Call List by the Hospital and Staff\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~tf!TION                                                   Page 21 of25\n\fThe HCFA (Health Care Financing Administration) is concerned that the call list fairly rotate\nbetween the specialty physicians that practice in the hospital.

Dr. Brewer and the hospital\nviolated EMTALA and interfered with Dr. Montoya receiving patients through the call list as\nrequired by EMTALA.\n\nAll the actions of both Dr. Brewer and the hospital were for monetary gain to have the hospital\naffiliated groups prosper and squeeze out the physician Dr. Montoya who is not part of the\nhospital affiliated group.\n\n14.9 Additional regulatory provisions - the \"snitch rule\"\nThe regulations do include a provision which imposes a very significant obligation on receiving\nhospitals. The regulation, at 42 CFR 489.20(m), obligates a participating hospital \"to report to\n[CMS] or the State survey agency any time it has reason to believe it may have received an\nindividual who has been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another\nhospital in violation of the requirements of Section 489.24(d).\" This regulation became effective\non September 29, 1995. Note that it requires reporting only when a patient has been improperly\ntransferred; it does not require reporting other known or suspected violations.\nSan Angelo Community Medical Center has violated this provision.\n\n14.10 Summary of violations of EMTALA-\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S SIXTH AMENDED ORIGIN~fTITION                                             Page22 of25\n\fSan Angelo Community Medical Center has violated EMTALA to the economic harm of the\nPlaintiff Dr. Montoya.\n\nI .EMTALA requires a fair and rotating call list for all specialists at the hospital.\n\n2.

Since 2008 Dr. Montoya has only received one call from the emergency room or\n    a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new\n    or existing patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals\n    caused substantial injury to Dr. Montoya and damaged his ability to compete, because he\n    depended on these referrals and consults to build his practice. A majority of patients\n    who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney disease in a hospital later need continuing\n    care for their kidneys or related problems; the most common of such continuing\n    treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney dialysis patient will need treatment for at\n    least six years, and each such patient would mean revenue to Dr. Montoya's practice of\n    approximately $100,000 per year. Dr. Montoya estimates that he has lost at least 100\n    long tenn kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the present due to the Defendants'\n    anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give him patient referrals or consults. He estimates\n    that this lack of referrals has thus cost him $1,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of\n    time.\n\n                                      Prayer for Relief\n\n\n    For these reasons Plaintiff requests that:\n    1.

Motion Timely Filed\n\n         Section 27.003, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code and Rule 9la.3, Tex. R. Civ. P. requires\n\nthis motion to be filed within 60 days after the first pleading containing the challenged cause of\n\naction is served on the movant. The petition in this case was served upon Defendant Brewer on\n\nOctober 9, 2015. Accordingly, this motion is timely filed.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                      Page 1 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                 76\n\f                          II. Causes of Action Asserted Against Brewer\n\n       The causes of action alleged in the Plaintiffs' Petition are:\n\n       (1)     Tortious Interference with Current and Prospective Business/Patient\nRelations (pp. 5-6);\n       (2)     Tortious Interference with Current and Prospective Business/Patient\nRelations- Exemplary Damages (p. 7);\n       (3)     Defamation Per Se (p. 7);\n       (4)     Malice (p. 7);\n       (5)     Business Disparagement (pp. 7-8)\n       (6)     Restraint of Trade (Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act) (p. 8-9).\n\n       As demonstrated below, none of the causes of action pleaded have any basis in law or in\n\nfact against Brewer.\n\n                                   III. No Legal Basis for Claims\n\nA.     The Court should dismiss Plaintifr s claim pursuant to the Texas Citizens\n       Participation Act.\n\n       This Court should dismiss Plaintiffs claims pursuant to the Texas Citizens Participation\n\nAct (\"TCPA\") because his claims are based on, relate to, or are in response to Defendant's\n\nexercise of his right to free speech. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 27.00S(b) (\"[A]\n\ncourt shall dismiss a legal action against the moving party if the moving party shows by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the legal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to the\n\nparty's exercise of: (1) the right of free speech ....\"). To avoid dismissal, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish \"by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of [its\n\nclaims].\" Id. at § 27.00S(c). If a plaintiff fails to meet this burden, the court must dismiss the\n\naction and award attorneys' fees to the moving party. Id. at § 27.009. Plaintiff cannot meet this\n\ndemanding burden; dismissal of his claims is therefore warranted.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                        Page 2 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  77\n\f       1. Plaintiffs' Claims Arise Out ofDefendant's Exercise of His Right to Free Speech\n\n       Plaintiffs claims are premised on Defendant's communications regarding a matter of\n\npublic concern. Such statements are squarely within the TCP A. Plaintiffs claims should\n\ntherefore be dismissed with prejudice. The TCPA defines \"[e]xercise of the right of free speech\n\n[as] communication made in connection with a matter of public concern.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code Ann. at§ 27.001(3). A '\"matter of public concern' includes an issue related to: (A)\n\nhealth or safety; [or] (B) environmental, economic, or community well-being.\" Id. at §\n\n27.0001(7).\n\n       Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: 1) engaged in a covert whisper campaign\n\nand decided not to refer any patients to Plaintiff and 2) brought charges against Plaintiff relating\n\nto incompetent patient care. Importantly, Plaintiff does not identify any actual statements in\n\nwhich Defendant ever disparaged Plaintiff, or suggested that any entity should refrain from doing\n\nbusiness with Plaintiff. In fact, the only specific action alleged to have harmed Plaintiff - the\n\ncharges brought against Plaintiff relating to incompetent patient care - is statutorily protected\n\nconduct pursuant to the medical committee privileges and immunities provided by the Texas\n\nOccupations Code, §§160.001 et seq., 160.010 (and especially subsection (c) of that section), and\n\n161.001 et seq., the Texas Health & Safety Code, §161.001 et seq. and 161.033, and the Federal\n\nHealth Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.SC., § 1110 I et seq.\n\n       Furthermore, these charges relating to Plaintifrs patient care constitute free speech under\n\nthe TCPA because it fits within TCPA's definition of \"communication[s] made in connection\n\nwith a matter of public concern,\" including: \"health or safety\" (Plaintiff is a:physician);\n\n\"community well-being\" (Plaintiff practices medicine in the community in which Defendants\n\nwork and live); or \"service in the marketplace\" (Plaintiff provides medical services to the\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.D. 'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND                                       Page 3 of IS\nFOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                                  78\n\fcommunity in which Defendant works and lives).

Plaintiff alleges generally that\n\nDefendants interfered with Plaintiffs relationships with patients and referring physicians;\n\nhowever, Plaintiff alleges no specific tortious or unlawful conduct against Brewer which, if true,\n\nconstitutes tortious interference with Plaintiffs ability to enter into a relationship with patients\n\nand referring physicians, nor does Plaintiff allege that he is under a current contract with any\n\npatients or physicians with which Brewer could interfere, nor has Plaintiff alleged any facts\n\n\nDEFENDANT KIRK BREWER.

Without establishing what the defamatory statement was that allegedly defamed\n\nPlaintiff, innuendo is required to determine whether it is in fact defamatory, preventing\n\nPlaintiff from prevailing on his claim for defamation per se. Plaintifrs defamation per se\n\nclaim should be dismissed accordingly.\n\n3. Malice\n\n         Plaintiff claims that he is entitled to exemplary damages for his claims for tortious\n\ninterference and defamation per se under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.007 because\n\nBrewer's conduct involved an \"extreme degree of risk considering the probability and magnitude\n\nof the potential harm to others.\" Pl. Pet. p. 7. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.

Prac. & Rem. Code.\n\n       Moreover, even if the Court allows Plaintiff to correct, what may be a typographical error\n\nin the statute cited, Plaintiffs claim for exemplary damages for Malice fails because Plaintiff\n\ndoes not allege that Brewer acted with malice, which means \"a specific intent by the defendant to\n\ncause substantial injury or harm to the claimant;\" rather, Plaintiff alleges that Brewer acted with\n\nan extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to\n\nothers, which is an element of gross negligence.

Plaintiffs allegations\n\nthat Brewer brought him up on charges of incompetent patient care, and started a whisper\n\ncampaign to not refer business to Plaintiff does not support a claim for business disparagement.\n\nA whisper campaign not to refer patients to Plaintiff, taken as true, does not imply that false\n\nstatements were made about Plaintiff in the alleged \"whisper campaign,\" and any charges\n\nBrewer brought against Plaintiff were brought as part of a medical peer review process which is\n\nprotected under the TCPA, and the privileges and immunities as set forth in the Texas\n\nOccupations Code, §§160.001 et seq., 160.0IO(and especially subsection (c) of that section), and\n\n161.001 et seq., the Texas Health & Safety Code, §161.001 et seq., and 161.033, and the Federal\n\nHealth Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U .S.C., §1110 I et seq.

As\n\ndiscussed above, Plaintiff's Petition fails to allege facts sufficient to entitle him to a finding of\n\nmalice against Brewer.

P. r-equii:es a\n\nmotion to dismiss be filed within 60 days after the first pleading containing the challenged cause\n\nof action is served on the movant. The first pleading in this case was served upon Defendant\n\nBrewer on October 9, 2015, a first amended pleading was filed November 12, 2015, and\n\nDefendant Brewer originally filed his motion to dismiss on December 8, 201 S, and set it for\n\n hearing on January 12, 2016. On January 4, 2016, the Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended\n\n DEFENDANT KJRK BREWER, M.D.'S AMENDED MOTION to DISMISS                                     Pagel of 19\n AND FOR RJ:::COVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                             119\n\fOriginal Petition, with additional ailegations, but no additional claims. Further, Plaintiffs tiled a\n\ncespaose ta the motion ta dismiss on January 4, 2016, as well. Pursuant to TRCP 91a.5, this\n\namended motion responsive to the latest pleading is timely filed. ·\n\n       Further, in support of this motion, attached hereto as Exhibit \"I\" is the affidavit of\n\nDefendant Kirk Brewer, M.D. Attached hereto as Exl.ibit ''2\" is the affidai·it efRebert 't'lagstaff\n\nin support of attorneys' fees.\n\n                         II. Causes of Action Asserted Against Brewer\n\n       The causes of action alleged in each of the Plaintiffs' Petitions, including the Second\n\nAmended Original Petition are:\n\n        (1)    Tertieus lnterfei=ee~e with Current and Prospective Business/Patient\n               Relatiens (pp. 5 ());\n        (2)    Tortious Interference with Current and Prospective Business/Patient\n               Relations- Exemplary Damages (p. 7);\n        (3)    Defamation Per Se (p. 7-10);\n        (4)    Malice (p. 10);\n        (5)    Business Disparagement (pp. 11);\n        (6)    Restramt of Trade ( lexas Free Enterprise and Anutrust Act) (p. t 1-12),\n        (7)    Cause of action thrown in with the factual dissertation - civil conspiracy\n               and joint and several liability (p.3).\n\n        Despite Plaintiffs attempts to somehow plead around the Defendant's motion to dismiss,\n\nas demonstrated below, none of the causes of action pied have sufficient basis in law or in fact\n\nagainst Brewer.\n\n                                  m. No Legal Basis fer Claims\nA.      The Court should dismiss Plaintifrs claim pursuant to the Texas Citizens\n        Participation Act.\n\n        This Court should dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to the Texas Citizens Participation\n\n Act (''TCPN') because his claims are based on, relate to, or are m response to Defendant's\n\n exercise of his right to free speech. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 27.005(b) (\"[A]\n\n\n DEFENDANT KIRK BREWER, M.0.'S AMENOED MOIION 10 DISMISS                                     Pagel ufl~\n ANO FOR RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ATIORNEY'S FEES\n\n\n                                              120\n\fcourt shall dismiss a legal action against the moving party if the moving party shows by a\n\nprepaoderance nftbe evidence that the legal action is based on, relates to. or is in response to the\n\nparty's exercise of: (1) the right of free speech ....\"). To avoid dismissal, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish \"by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of [its\n\nclaims).\" id. at § 27.00S(c). If a plaintiff fails to meet this burden, the court must dismiss the\n\naction and award attorneys' fees to the moving party. Id. at§ 27.009. Plaintiff cannot meet this\n\ndemanding burden and dismissal of his claims is therefore warranted.\n\nPlaintiffs' Claims Arise Out ofDefendant's Exercise of His Right to Free Speech\n\n        Plaintiffs claims are premised on Defendant's communications regarding a matter of\n\npablie eeAeem. PlaiRtiff aetes in his latest pleading on page 3 that \"Dr Brewer at all times acted\n\nfor (SACMC).\" Further, in Defendant Brewer's attached affidavit, he states that \"[F]urther, any\n\ndiscussions I have had concerning Dr. Montoya, regardless of the context, have been within the\n\nhospital, and either directly concemmg patient care andtor associated with the pee1 1eview\n\nprocess.\" As such, any claimed statements are squarely within the TCPA. Plaintiffs claims\n\nshould therefore be dismissed with prejudice. The TCPA defines \"[e]xercise of the right of free\n\nspeech [as] communication made io connection with a matter of public concern.\" Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code Ann. at§ 27.001(3). A \"'matter of public concern' includes an issue related to: (A)\n\nhealth or safety; [or] (B) environmental, economic, or community well-being.\" Id at §\n\n27.0061(1}.\n\n         Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: l) engaged in a covert whisper campaign\n\n and decided not to refer any patients to Plaintiff and 2) brought charges against Plaintiff relating\n\n to incompetent patient care. Importantly, Plaintiff does not 1dent1fy any actual statements m\n\n which Defendant ever disparaged Plaintiff, or suggested that any entity should refrain from doing\n\n\n Dt:F.ENDANT KIRK BREWER.

In fact, one action alleged to have hanned Plaintiff - the charges brought\n\nagainst Plaintiff relating to incompetent patient care is statutorily protected conduct pursuant to\n\nthe medical committee privileges and immunities provided by the Texas Occupations Code,\n\n§§160.001 et seq., 160.010 (and especially subsection (c) of that section), and 161.001 et seq.,\n\nthe Texas Health & Safety Code, §161.881 et seq. and 161.033, and the Federal Heeltk Care\n\nQuality Improvement Act. 42 U.SC., §11101 et seq. The other harm is centered on the\n\ndefamation per se claim which is discussed in more detail below.\n\n       Furthermore, these charges relating to Plaintiffs patient care constitute free speech under\n\nthe TCPA because it fits within TCPA's definition of \"communication[s] made in connection\n\nwith a matter ef public cgacefR,\" including· \"health or safety\" (Plaintiff is a physician);\n\n\"community well-being'' (Plaintiff practices medicine in the community in which Defendants\n\nwork and live); or \"service in the marketplace\" (Plaintiff provides medical services to the\n\ncommunity m which Defendant works and hves).

I am over the age of eighteen (18) years, have never\nbeen convicted of a crime, and I am otherwise qualified to make this affidavit.

I have handled civil litigation cases in Tom\nGreen County since J 996 I am board <'terti:6ed in Persona] lnjucy Trial l aw by the Texas Board\nof Legal Specialization (since 1995) and as a Civil Trial Advocate by the National Board of Trial\nAdvocacy (since 2001). As such, I am familiar with the prosecution and defense of cases such as\nthis and what is reasonable and necessary for attorneys' fees and expenses. Further, I am\nfamiliar witJ1 the case law and Texas Disciplioary Rules of Professional Conduct concerning\nreasonable and necessary attorneys' fees and expenses. In reaching my opinions, l considered\nthe various rectors as required in making my determination, including the complexity of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          E~IT2\n\fmattert the amount of damages claimed, all lawyers involved on all sides, the time and skill\nrequired. my ability and reputation, a11d also the experience of my partner, Jessica Hat le~ who has\nassisted in the case. I believe that a reasonable and necessary hourly rate for this type of work in\na civil defamation/business interruption case in Tom Green County is no less than $250. 00 per\nhour. We have ex.pended a total of 26.8 hours in this case through the filing of the amended\nmotio1t to dismiss. It is antieipated the.t an additional l heYrs will bu spetit traveling to and fi:om\nSan Angelo and arguing the motion to dismiss, plus reasonable and necessary expenses.\nAccordingly, it is my opinion that the reasonable and nec.essary attorneys~ fees and expenses for\nDefeadaat Boower tlu:ough January 1, 20J6, are $67QQ oo and likely an additional $1250,00\nthrough the hearing plus $89.64 in expenses.\n       Finally, the work on each cause of action bas been so intertwined as to be difficult to\nseparate one cause from the other.

The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the Texas\n         Statute includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In Re Lipsky, 2015 WL1870073).\n         This evidence of Dr. Montoya meets the standard.\n\n      7. In this case th~ evidence is both direct, actual and circumstantial.

Montoya, Jr. M.D. and after\nbeing duly sworn under oath stated.\n\n      \"My name is Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D. I am the Plaintiff in this case. I have\nknowledge of all the facts of this affidavit as Plaintiff and all facts are within my personal\nknowledge true and correct and that I was involved with facts stated.\n\n       I have not used any patient name, except where authorized by the patient or their agent, to\navoid any HIPAA or privacy violation.\n\n       1. I was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical Center in\n           1981. I have full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center. This case does not involve the rights of Defendant Kirk\n           Brewer, M.D. to speak freely, associate freely, and participate in government as\n           permitted by law. The facts of the case are that Kirk Brewer, M.D. was during his\n           actions an officer and/or Chief of Staff of the medical staff of San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center.         Kirk Brewer, M.D. was hired by San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center to run the hospitalist service. As an officer of the staff\n           and Chief of Staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. owed me a member of the staff a fiduciary duty\n           to not interfere by direct or indirect action with my practice of nephrology at San\n           Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n       2. Kirk Brewer, M.D. came to San Angelo Community Medical Center in 2007. Part of\n           my practice and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a rotating\n           system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital and\n           emergency room. When you are the named specialist you receive a call from the\n           emergency room physician that a doctor with your specialty is needed for a patient.\n          A big part of my practice was obtaining new patients and treating existing patients\n          that came to the emergency room and needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 I have\n          gotten new patients from the emergency room.\n\n\n\n\n                                               96\n\f3. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to treat\n   either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 I have received only one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new patient or\n   existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\n4. The one time for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 I was called\n   by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on duty\n   and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels.    Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n   informed me that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure. I was informed my\n   name was on the call board in the emergency room as nephrologist on call. Both of\n   the above doctors asked me to consult concerning treatment for that patient. I gave\n   my initial consult advice/orders of treatment to both doctors. This consultation call\n   was to me at 9:38 p.m. I informed them I would come see the patient and then review\n   the test results and determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as\n   Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record showing the facts\n   on January 24, 2014.\n\n5. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the\n   patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult and treatment by me and\n   consulted another nephrologist. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is one that\n   is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Kirk Brewer,\n   M.D. without seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of\n   nephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D. 's economic gain and caused me economic\n   loss. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record\n   showing the facts on January 25, 2014.\n\n\n6. Kirk Brewer, M.D. by his actions of removing me as the nephrologist published a\n   statement that I was not a competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room. Kirk Brewer, M.D. was aware\n   that his actions would become known to the staff physicians of San Angelo\n\n\n\n                                       97\n\f   Community Medical Center and that he was by conduct and a whisper campaign\n   saying I should not be allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center.\n\n7. The statements and actions of Kirk Brewer, M.D. were published by his conduct. The\n   actions were referring to me as a non-competent nephrologist. The statement(s) were\n   defamatory and caused me economics loss.\n\n8. The total loss is between $1,000,000.00 and $6,500,000.00 from not receiving any\n   referrals from the emergency room or hospitalists.\n\n9. The defamatory statements are untrue. I am a competent and qualified nephrologist\n   to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n10. The actions of Kirk Brewer, M.D. were intentional or done with negligence when\n   Kirk Brewer, M.D. knew that the statement was false and his actions would lead a\n   reasonable prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory\n   potential.\n\n\n11. As officer and as President of the medical staff Kirk Brewer, M.D. must follow the\n   rules at San Angelo Community Medical Center and staff of San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center and have a new patient in the emergency room or hospital that needs\n   a specialist consultation assigned to the name off the rotating consultation list. By\n   Kirk Brewer, M.D. not following this procedure I did not receive any consultation\n   requests from the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center in 2008-present and one in 2014.\n\n\n12. Attached to this affidavit as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n   existing patient of mine Mrs. Welch tried to see me in the emergency room of San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not call me\n   to treat my existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and I have treated her\n   for at least 20 years.\n\n\n\n                                       98\n\f    ----~-·--·----···---                                          -   -   -   .\n\n\n\n\n         13, Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privaoy rights, who is also over\n             90 years of age and has been my patient fo1· a.t least lOyears requested roe when she\n             went to t~ emergency room and she also was refused to see me,\n\n         14.

BACKGROUND & SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n           Plaintiff originally filed this lawsuit in July of 2015 against Dr. Kirk Brewer (\"Brewer\")\n\nand the moving defendant, San Angelo Community Medical Center (\"SACMC\"), alleging\n\nnumerous causes of action related to supposed ill-treatment of Plaintiff and his medical\n\npractice's reputation. 2 After a several amendments to his Original Petition, this Court granted\n\nBrewer's Motion to Dismiss and ordered the case against Brewer to be dismissed under Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure rule 91(a) and the Texas Citizens Participation Act on February 8,\n\n\n\n1\n    For judicial economy, this Motion is concurrently filed with Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and Motion for leave\nto File Its Motion to Dismiss.\n2\n  See Plaintiffs Original Petition.\n\n\nSACMC's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                                         Page 1\n\n                                                       208\n\f2016. 3 As explained more fully below, because all of Plaintiff's claims of liability against\n\nSACMC derive from Brewer's alleged bad acts and Brewer has been dismissed from this case,\n\nSACMC now moves this Court to dismiss all claims for relief, with prejudice.\n\n                                              ARGUMENT\n\n    A.      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Traditional summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c) is proper\n\nwhen a movant establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter oflaw.

SACMC IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ALL OF PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS\n            BECAUSE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS AGAINST BREWER HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.\n\n         As best SACMC can glean, Plaintiff's Fourth Amended Petition, his current live\n\npleading, alleges six causes of action:\n\n    1) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations (Pl.' s 4th\n       Am. Pet. ,r,r 7-7.7);\n    2) Tortious Interference with current and prospective business/patient relations - Exemplary\n       Damage (Id. at ,r 8);\n    3) Defamation Per Se (Id. at ,r,r 9-9.8);\n    4) Malice (Id. at ,r 1O);\n    5) Business Disparagement (Id. at ,r 11 ); and\n    6) Restraint of trade (Id. at ,r 12-12.8).\n\n\n\n\n3\n See Order On Defendant Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s Motion to Dismiss Per The Texas Citizens Participation Act,\nattached as Exhibit A.\n\n\nSACMC's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                                    Page2\n\n                                                   209\n\f       The gravamen of Plaintiffs allegations concern Brewer's supposed \"whisper campaign\"\n\nto \"wrongly ... cast Dr. Montoya's stellar reputation under a dark cloud\" and the bringing up of\n\nPlaintiff on charges of improper care \"to discredit Dr. Montoya and his ability to practice\n\nmedicine in San Angelo and at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\" Id. at           11 6.15-17.\nPlaintiff further alleges that Brewer \"was and is employed by and acting in furtherance of the\n\nbusiness of (SACMC) and its medical practices\" and \"at all times acted for (SACMC).\" Id. at ,I\n\n6.6. Aside from Brewer, Plaintiff does not specifically allege in his live pleading any other\n\nindividuals who took part in the alleged various defamatory and conspiratorial schemes Brewer\n\nsupposedly perpetrated. Further, Plaintiff alleges no direct or separate liability claims against\n\nSACMC above and apart from the actions of its agent, Brewer.           Instead, SACMC's only\n\npotential liability sounds in the doctrine of respondeat superior.\n\n       Under Texas law, a master can only be held liable for the servant's misdeeds if the\n\nservant committed misdeeds. The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly made this clear. See\n\nKnutson v.

As such, it has held that Brewer's\n\nactions or omissions were 1) constitutionally protected and/or 2) had \"no basis in law or in fact.\"\n\nIn other words, Brewer, like the employee in G & H Towing, committed no tortious act.\n\nTherefore, under plain and settled Texas law, SACMC cannot be held liable for Plaintiffs claims\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant SACMC respectfully requests\n\nthat this grant this Motion for Summary Judgment and that judgment be entered dismissing all of\n\nPlaintiffs claims against Defendant with prejudice, and for such other and further relief at law or\n\nin equity as may be shown that Defendant is justly entitled to receive.\n\n\n\n\nSACM C's Motion For Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law                                       Page4\n\n                                                 211\n\f                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                         CARR MCGOLDRICK, LLP\n\n                                                             f'Ld,.o\n                                                J         .

MONTOYA, JR., M.D., WEST TEXAS RENAL CARE AND\nWEST TEXAS NEPHROLOGY ask the Court to deny Defendant SAN ANGELO\nCOMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER'S Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n                                       INTRODUCTION\n\n1.      The Plaintiffs are Steve F. Montoya, Jr., M.D., West Texas Renal Care and West Texas\nNephrology. The Plaintiffs sued the hospital based tipon causes of action that were approved by\nthe Texas Supreme Court in a case of a doctor suing the hospital where he had a medical\npractice. The exact same causes of action were approved by the Texas Supreme Court in In Re\nMemorial Hermann Hospital System. 464 S.W. 3d 6'86 (2015). The justices in Memorial\nHermailn case stated \"We hold that Dr. Gomez's petition presents multiple viable anti-competent\nactions;' Id at 713. Attached as Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the pleading of Dr. Gomez from\nthe Memorial Hermann case that was specifically approved by as viable the Texas Supreme\nCourt causes of action. The causes of action approved by the Texas Supreme Court in Memorial\nHermann are:\n\n        ( 1)   Business Disparagement\n        (2)    Defamation\n        (3)    Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations\n        (4)    Improper Restraint of Trade under the Texas Fire Enterprises and Anti-Trust Act\n               of 1983.\n\n        Id. At 695-696\n\n        The Petition of the Plaintiffs followed the approved Petition of Dr. Gomez.\n\n\n\nPLAINTlFFS RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-\nPAGE l OF4\n\f       The Plaintiffs ask the Court to take judicial notice of the Original Petition of the Plaintiffs\nand the Amended Petitions on file to verify that the Plaintiffs are alleging the approved causes of\naction of the Texas Supreme Court, by a physician and his entities in which he practices suing\nthe hospital where he practices medicine. This case is exactly the Memorial Hermann case\napproved by the Texas Supreme Court. The Texas Supreme Court determined Memorial\nHermann in 2015 and has not changed its opinion in the year following the ruling.\n\n       This Traditional Motion for Summary is nothing more than a thinly vailed attempt to get\naround the untimely filing of the Motion to Dismiss under 9I(a) and the Anti-Slapp Motion.\n\n       The finding of the Court concerning Dr. Brewer has no relevance to the causes of action\nbrought against San Angelo Community Medical Center. The causes of action against San\nAngelo Community Medical Center are all separate and independent of Dr. Brewer.\n\n        The Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center does not even attach a single\nfactual affidavit or any affidavit in support of the Summary Judgment.\n\n       The Motion for Summary Judgment is a untimely Motion to Dismiss that has no evidence\nor proof attached.\n\n       San Angelo Community Medical Center filed a Motion for Special Exceptions on August\n14, 2015 the court granted the Special Exceptions on December 3, 2015. The Plaintiffs Petition\nwas amended to comply with the Court order.\n\n       Since the Order of Dismissal of Defendant Dr. Brewer hearing the Plaintiffs have added\nAnti-Trust violations concerning group boycott and violations of the EMTALA standards against\nSan Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n       The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants Constitutional Rights\nto speak freely, associate freely and participate in governmental as permitted by law. These are\nthe requirements to meet in filing a Motion under the Anti-Slapp Statute Tex. C.P.R. C.§27. 005(b)\nand as set out in Paulsen v. Yarrell </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.-App.-Houston [1 st Dist.] 2014, no pet.)\n(quoting In Re Estate o,[Check 438 SW3d at 836).\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the Texas Anti-\nSlapp Statute Chapter 27 includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In Re Lipsky, 2015\nWLJ870073). The evidence of the Plaintiff meets the standard.\n\n      The Defendant San Angelo Community Medical Center did not even join in Dr. Brewer's\nMotion to Dismiss w1der 9l(a) or his Anti-Slapp motion.\n\n                                    Request to Strike/Objection\n\n       No Summary Judgment evidence is presented by the Defendant San Angelo Community\nMedical Center. Respondents to the Motion for Summary Judgment object to the Motion\nbecause there is no evidence attached to the Motion. The statements in the body of the argument\n\nPLAINTIFFS RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-\nPAGE20F 4\n\fare heresay and Respondents request the Court to strike those statements as defective and not\nmeeting the standard for Summary Judgment evidence. The statements in the argument are\nconclusory and without factual basis as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP\n166a(c)).\n\n        The Respondents further object to the argument because it does not meet the standard set\nforth for an affidavit in the Texas Supreme Court Radio Station KSCS v. Jennings </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436645\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436645/radio-station-kscs-v-jennings/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1988). The Supreme Court held that affidavit for summary judgment failed to\nestablish that it was based on personal knowledge and was thus inadequate summary judgment\nproof. The argument in the Motion is not a factual affidavit showing proof.\n\n        The Plaintiff objects to the argument because it is not an affidavit which must state\nfacts and cannot merely recite legal conclusions. Brownlee v. Brownlee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112\n(Tex. 1984). In this case the argument does not meet the KSCS or Brownlee standards.\n\n            SUMMARY-JUDGMENT EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY PLAINTIFF\n\n2.     To support the facts in this response, Plaintiffs offer the following summary-judgment\nevidence attached to this response and incorporates the evidence into this response by reference.\n\n       Exhibit 1: Certified copy of Pleading approved by the Texas Supreme Court as valid\ncauses of action in Memorial Hennann Hospital System.\n\n        Exhibit 2: Is the affidavit of Steve F. Montoya, Jr., M.D. one of the Plaintiffs. In the\naffidavit he states the facts and refutes the allegations for the dismissal under TRCP 9l(a) and\nthe Anti-Slapp allegations.\n\n       Exhibit 3: Is the affidavit of Dr. Hunt that confirms the causes of actions and the facts of\nthe Anti-Trust actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\nA.     Defendant did not disprove plaintiff's cause of action as a matter of law.\n\n3.      A defendant is entitled to summary judgment on a plaintiff's cause of action if the\ndefendant can disprove at least one element of the cause of action as a matter of law. Sw. Elec.\nPower Co. v. Grant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2105618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2105618/southwestern-elec-power-co-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (Tex. 2002); see Tello v.

For these reasons, Plaintiffs ask the Court to deny Defendant's Motion for Summary\nJudgment. Plaintiffs ask the Court to grant Plaintiffs objections so they will be preserved for\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-\nPAGE 3 OF4\n\f                                                    Respectfully Submitted\n\n                                                    Paul Craig Laird II Law Firm, PLLC\n\n                                                    Isl Paul Craig Laird II\n                                                    By: Paul Craig Laird II\n                                                    800 W.

The su1·geon in turn\n\n           determines, based upon the quality of the surgical and post-surgical equipment, staff,\n\n           and facilities, the hospital in which the surgical care is delivered. The surgeon's\n\n           decisions as tu whel'e tu perform his or her surgeries directly impact the profitability of\n\n           the h08pitals in the specific conununity (in the West Houston and Katy community, the\n\n           surgical market is primarily at Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center and\n\n           The Methodist We.st Houston Hospital). As a result, the ability to fairly compare the\n\n           reputations of surgeons in a medical market community such as West Houston and\n\n                                                       -5-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22AM                    713-755-1451                           Page 7 / 18\n\n\n\n\n          Katy affects patient choice and the continued availability of the highest quality patient\n\n          care. Improperly manipulating comparative information and reputations of suxgeons in\n\n          a medical market such as West Houston and Katy creates an improper distortion of free\n\n          and informed patient choice and options for medical care.\n\n          5.4   The appropriate way for any health ca1·e provider to attract patients in a\n\n          competitive market is by actually providing and being known for providing the highest\n\n          quality of care. The illegal and unjust way (11utti11g patients and their free choice in the\n\n          market in jeopardy) is to malign., spread w1true 01\" misleading ill.formation, or othe1wise\n\n          smear the reputation of a highly qualified surgeon in the same medical community.\n\n          5.5   With new management and operational changes at Memorial City Memorial\n\n          Hermann, including the arrival of Mr. Alexander as CEO, Dr. Gomez became\n\n          increasingly concerned about a decline in the quality of patient care at the hospital The\n\n          decline in patient care arose from the understaffing of qualified nurses in the hospital's\n\n          intensive care unit (ICU), general care units and the emergency room; the lack of\n\n          consistent procedurnl safeguards fo1· monitoring patients; and the failure to update\n\n          critical equipment. Memmial Hermann also began deliberate efforts to restrict surgical\n\n          care for the most critically ill patients, pushing for abandonment of \"salvage\" cases (for\n\n          example, eme1·gency surgery on patients in active cardiac arrest, able to be saved ill\n\n          some but not all cfrcumstances by a qualified surgeon).       \\I\\Jhat this meant to patients\n\n          most in need of a surgeon with Dr. Gomez' unique qualifications was the elimination of\n\n          patient choice and poten.tially life-saving prncedw·es ill favor of potentially higher\n\n          statistical ranking for Memorial Hermann as calculated by U. S. News and World\n\n                                                        -6-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                          Page 8 / 18\n\n\n\n\n           Report.\n\n           5.6   In response to D1·. Gomez repeatedly speaking out about these concerns, as well\n\n           as the likelihood Dr. Gomez would move his surgeries to The Methodist Hospital-\n\n           West Houston as the staffing and equipment dysfun.ctions contm.ued, Dr. Macris and\n\n           Mr. Alexander, and others, joined in a calculated and deliberate scheme to destroy\n\n           Dr. Gomez' reputation and ability to practice medicine in the West Houston and Katy\n\n           conununity. Dr. Macris wanted to disadvantage a skilled competitor, and Memorial\n\n           Hermann needed to avoid losing patients by working with D1·. MaCI\"is in capturing the\n\n           patients that would have otherwise been treated by Dr. Gomez at another facility.\n\n           5.7    Quality patient care is the most important goal of any legitimate health care\n\n           provider.     Under both fedel'al and state law, hospitals and their medical staff are\n\n           required to follow st1·ict standards for peer review evaluation and monitoring. These\n\n           peer review standards rely upon a consistent and well-developed process to ensure that\n\n           favoritism, improper motives, a:t'ld manipulation for unjust purposes play no role.\n\n           Memorial Hermann had such a process in place at all relevant timesr but Defendants\n\n           acted to evade and avoid its safeguards while manipulating the rules for peer review\n\n           and utilization review for their own wrongful purposes.\n\n           5.8    In order to disa·edit Dr. Gomez and Cl'ush his ability to practice medicine in the\n\n           We~t Houston and Katy comm.unity, Dr. Macri::; and Memorial Hermann began\n\n           com.piling (and distorting) statistical data related to the mortality rates of Dr. Gomez's\n\n           patients.   The manipulated data, which was reported using neither the generally\n\n           accepted methodologies for proper peer review comparison nor basic scientific\n\n                                                        -7-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                          Page 9 I 18\n\n\n\n\n           principles, was intended to create the appearance that patients were more likely to die\n\n           in Dr. Gomez's care as compared to other surgeons at Memorial Hermann. At bottom,\n\n           the statistical information compiled and manipulated by Dr. Macris and Memorial\n\n           Hermann was geared to demonstrating a fa1sehood: that Dr. Gomez was an\n\n           incompetent physician undersel'ving of his reputation and the trust his hard work had\n\n           earned in the West Houston and Katy medical commwlity.\n\n           5.9    Rather than comply with the medical peer review process and its safeguards\n\n           against im.prnper :i1-ulue11ce, Defendants attempted to evade these well-e.stablished\n\n           protocols and the standing medical peer review committee at the hospital. Defendants\n\n           then set up an emergency \"meeting\" and presented Dr. Gomez with the option of either\n\n           immediately suspending his practice or agreemg to active interventional monitoring\n\n           under Defendants' supervision.      Both \"options\" would have effectively destroyed\n\n           Dr. Gomez' reputati011. iJ.1 the medical community, severely curtailing patient choice, as\n\n           well as the opportunity for these and future patients to benefit from Dr. Gomez'\n\n           advanced abilities in cardiothoracic and surgical procedures.\n\n           5.10   At the time Dr. Gomez was presented with these \"options\" by Defendants, he\n\n -\n (\"-.\n           was also told that he would not be able to review at any meaningful level the alleged\n\n           data supporting the emergency action outside the usual peer review process (the data\n\n           that ultimately proved to be improperly manipulated and without a basic medical and\n\n           scientific grounding). Defendants also refused Dr. Gomez the opportunity to meet with\n\n           or present any information. to Defendants and those acting with Defendants, and\n\n           instead insisted that Dr. Gomez' quahty of care could not be evaluated by the\n\n                                                        -8-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                           Page 10 / 18\n\n\n\n\n           established medical peer l'eview committee.\n\n           5.11   Fortuitously, and despite Defendants' best efforts to continue the railroading of\n\n           Dr. Gomez, the actual peer review committee at Memorial Hermann intervened to\n\n           require Defendants to present their data, and other alleged reasons for attempting to\n\n           block Dr. Gomez' continued practice at Memol'ial Hermann, to the peer 1·eview process.\n\n           Notwithstanding Defendants' presentation of the manipulated patient data, the\n\n           evaluation of the peer 1·eview committee exunernted D1·. Gomez. During the process,\n\n           Defeudants were provided with clear and convincing evidence that the manipulated\n\n           data used to\" compare\" Dr. Gomez could not be relied upon for any legitimate purpose.\n\n           5.12   After completing its comprehensive evaluation, including comparison with\n\n           D1·. Macris' own patient care outcome statistics, the pee1· review committee's rejection of\n\n           Defendants' anti-competitive and unlawful abuse of the peer review process should\n\n           have deterred Defendants from. their continued misconduct. Unfortunately, Defendants\n\n           elected to instead continue a whisper campaign of selective and improper\n\n           dissemination of both the manipulated data and othe1· misinformation within the\n\n           medical community. The first indication Dr. Gomez received that Defendants' smear\n\n           campaign had continued w1.abated was when the same type of manipulated and\n\n           misleading data was presented by Dr. Macris on November 1, 2011 at a non-peer review\n\n           meeting organized by MHMD i11. a publicly displayed \"comparison\", readily\n\n           identifiable with Dr. Gomez and intended to be seen as such.       The circumstances and\n\n           details uf this public defamation are set forth in greate1· detail in Paragraph 7.3 below,\n\n           based on the infmmation available at this time.\n\n                                                        -9-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                      713-755-1451                         Page 11 / 18\n\n\n\n\n           5.13   Mark Twain once noted that, \"A lie can travel around the world before the truth\n\n           can even finish putting on its pants.\" Defendants' illegal and anti-competitive acts\n\n          unfairly cast Dr. Gomez' stellar reputation under a dark cloud. As could be anticipated,\n\n           if not intended, Defendants' calculated wrongdoing also imposed substantial economic,\n\n           emotional, and physical impacts upon Dr. Gomez.

The~e acts wel'e done with the specific intent to weaken or eliminate\n\n          competition from Dr. Gomez, and because of the market dominance that would 1·esult\n\n          had a dangerous probability uf success.\n\n\n          9.5    Defendants' willful actions have also harmed and threatened the general public\n\n          by inte1·feri11g with the urdedy practice of medicine in the conunw'lity, by reducing the\n\n          number uf ~urgeons activd.y practicing in cardiuthOl'acic and general surgery in the\n\n          community, and by depriving patients of the highest quality of medical care they would\n\n          have been able to receive but for Defendants' concerted actions against Defendants.\n\n\n          9.4    This concerted conduct was flagrant and willful, and was done for the specific\n\n          purpose of harming Dr. Gomez, illegally and improperly taking Dr. Gomez' practice,\n\n          and diverting it tu Dr. Macris and others p1·acti.cing solely at Memorial Hermaru1.\n\n          9.5    The     acts   of   Defendants   constitute   illegal   monopolization,   attempted\n\n          monopulizatiun, and/or conspiracy tu monopolize under applicable Texas law.\n\n\n                                                      -14-\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                 713-755-1451                          Page 16 / 18\n\n\n\n\n                                       RESULTING LEGAL DAMAGES\n\n          10.1   Dr. Gomez is entitled to the actual damages re~mlting from Defendants'\n\n          violations of the law.

Montoya, Jr. M.D. and after\nbeing duly sworn under oath stated.\n\n      \"My name is Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D. I am the Plaintiff in this case. I have\nknowledge of all the facts of this affidavit as Plaintiff and all facts are within my personal\nknowledge true and correct and that I was involved with facts stated.\n\n       I have not used any patient name, except where authorized by the patient or their agent, to\navoid any HIP AA or privacy violation.\n\n       1. I was admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical Center in\n           1981.   I have full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at San Angelo\n           Community Medical Center. This case does not involve the rights of Defendant San\n           Angelo Community Medical Center to speak freely, associate freely, and participate\n           in government as permitted by law. The facts of the case are that I have full staff\n           privileges to practice nephrology medicine at San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\n\n       2. Part of my practice and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a\n           rotating system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital\n           and emergency room pursuant to the EMTALA Medicare call list. When you are the\n           named specialist you receive a call from the emergency room physician that a doctor\n           with your specialty is needed for a patient. A big part of my practice was obtaining\n           new patients and treating existing patients that came to the emergency room that\n           needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 I have gotten new patients from the emergency\n           room.\n\n\n       3. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to treat\n           either new or existing patients for nephrology care at the San Angelo Community\n           Medical Center. Since 2008 I have received only one call from the emergency room\n           or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist. A nephrologist treats patients with\n           kidney problems and or disease. The one call I received was for treatment of a new\n           patient or existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\f4. The one time call for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 I was\n   called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on\n   duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n   informed me that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure. I was informed my\n   name was on the call board in the emergency room as nephrologist on call. Both of\n   the above doctors asked me to consult concerning treatment for that patient. I gave\n   my initial consult advice/orders of treatment to both doctors. This consultation call\n   was to me at 9:38 p.m. I informed them I would come see the patient and then review\n   the test results and determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as\n   Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record, removing the\n   name of the patient for HIPPA privacy, showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n\n5. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the\n   patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult and treatment by me and\n   consulted another nephrologist. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is one that\n   is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Kirk Brewer,\n   M.D. without seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of\n   nephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic\n   loss. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record\n   showing the facts on January 25, 2014.\n\n\n6. In removing me as the nephrologist the hospital published a statement that I was not a\n   competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center emergency room. San Angelo Community Medical Center through\n   its agents and representatives was aware that its actions would become known to the\n   staff physicians of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that there was by\n   conduct and a whisper campaign saying I (Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D.) should not be\n   allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\f7. The statements and actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and\n   through its agents and representatives were published by conduct. The actions were\n   referring to keep from treating my own patients and any new patient coming to the\n   San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room.                The statement(s) and\n   actions were defamatory and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n8. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat\n   either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 I have only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new or existing\n   patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused\n   substantial injury to the Plaintiffs and damaged their ability to compete, because the\n   Plaintiffs depend on these referrals and consults to build and maintain the nephrology\n   practice. A majority of patients who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney\n   disease in a hospital later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems;\n   the most common of such continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney\n   dialysis patient will need treatment for six years, and each such patient would mean\n   revenue to the Plaintiffs practice of approximately $100,000 per year. I estimates that\n   the Plaintiffs have lost at least I 00 long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the\n   present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give me patient\n   referrals or consults. I estimate that this lack of referrals has thus cost Plaintiffs\n   $1,000,000 to $6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n9. The defamatory statements and actions are untrue. I am a competent and qualified\n   nephrologist to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. If I were\n   not a competent and qualified nephrologist I would have been removed from the staff\n   of the hospital.\n\n\n10. The actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and through its agents and\n   representatives were intentional or done with negligence when San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center knew that the statement was false and the actions would\n   lead a reasonable prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory\n\f   potential. The actions interred with my ability to make a living as a nephrologist on\n   staff at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n11. The rules at San Angelo Community Medical Center and of the staff of San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center are to have a new patient in the emergency room or\n   hospital that needs a specialist consultation assigned to the name off the rotating\n   consultation list. The consultation list is kept by San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center by and through its agents and representatives. By San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center not following this procedure I did not receive any consultation\n   requests from the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center in 2008-present and one in 2014.\n\n\n12. Attached to this affidavit as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n   existing patient of mine Mrs. Welch tried to see me in the emergency room of San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not call me\n   to treat my existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and I have treated her\n   for at least 20 years. These actions interfered with my right to treat my patient and to\n   the patient's rights to pick her physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of\n   rights (see attached Exhibit D) and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached\n   Exhibit E)\n\n\n13. Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also over\n   90 years of age and has been my patient for at least 10 years requested me when she\n   went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see me. This action\n   interfered with my right to treat my patient and to the patient's rights to pick her\n   physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of rights (see attached Exhibit D)\n   and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached exhibit E)\n\n\n\n14. A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician.   Attached as Exhibit\n   F is a true and correct copy of the patient bill of rights posted at the San Angelo\n\f   Community Medical Center. Attached as Exhibit E a true and correct copy of the\n   dialysis patient bill of rights concerning care of a dialysis patient. Both of these\n   patient bills of rights were violated by San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n15. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient referred in Exhibits A and B as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then\n   without ever seeing the patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult\n   and treatment and consulted another nephrologist.        I went to the call board and\n   witnessed my name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014.\n   The San Angelo Community Medical Center is required to have an official EMTALA\n   Medicare call list for on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center to take Medicare patients.       This is the list my name was on and was\n   intentionally ignored. This also violates a patient's right to choose their physician.\n   This list was followed until Dr. Brewer came to San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is\n   one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Dr.\n   Brewer did not see the patient when he removed me as the treating nephrologist he\n   issued the change via a telephone order (see Exhibit B). Kirk Brewer, M.D. without\n   seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of nephrologist\n   was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n16. By the actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are controlled\n   by their supervisor or lead physician Kirk Brewer, M.D. through the above actions\n   intentionally interfered with my practice of medicine at San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center to keep me from receiving patients as required by the EMTALA\n   Medicare call list.\n\n\n17. The Defendants' anticompetitive conduct has harmed consumers and others who pay\n   for nephrology services in the relevant market by increasing the costs of those\n   services. This is demonstrated by the chart attached hereto as Exhibit G. Before Dr.\n   Brewer's group of hospitalists became the attending physicians for all nephrology\n\f          patients at SA.CMC, nephrology patients would be referred to nie (Dr. Montoya) who\n          would serve as the attending physician for the patient. This arrangement avoided the\n          \"middle man\" which now exists, as the hospitalists now usually serve as an additional\n          charging entity between the patient and the nephrology specialist. Even if the\n          hospitalists could do the same work as me or my partner used to provide, the patient\n          (and/or insurance and taxpayer-funded Medicare/Medicaid) still faces increased cost\n          for the same nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services\n          than I charge. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare\n          allowable rate, which adds up to average charges of $506.85 per day. See Exhibit\n          G. In approximately 2010, at the SACMC emergency room, Dr. Brewer\n          explicitly told me that he and his group of hospitalists will always charge at the\n          comprehensive rate, regardless of medical necessity, because those charges\n          maximize revenue for Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists. · I, however,\n          charge at the \"Moderate\" Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to an average cost\n          of $346.13 per day. The difference between these charges is $160.72 per nephrology\n          patient per average hospital stay. Over the course of a year, consumers/payors for\n          nephrology services have thus paid thousands more for the hospitalists' physician and\n          nephrology services than they would have paid for care from me who is a physician\n          specialist in nephrology.\n     All of the actions described in this affidavit are done by or for the Defendant San Angelo\nCommunity Medical Center.\n\n       Further affiant saith not.\"\n\n       Signed this 4th day of May, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n         Subscribed and sworn to me the undersigned notary by Steve F.

The Motion to Dismiss is based upon Texas Anti-Slapp Statute, Chapter 27 Actions\n         invoking the exercise of certain Constitutional Rights.\n\n      2. No affidavits are attached to the Motion.\n\n      3. Attached as Exhibit 2 hereto is the affidavit of Dr. Montoya as evidence in support of\n         his response.\n\n      4. The purpose of this lawsuit has nothing to do with the Defendants Constitutional\n         Rights to speak freely, associate freely and participate in governmental as permitted\n         by law. These are the requirements to meet in filing a Motion under the Anti-Slapp\n         Statute Tex.C.P.R.C.§27.005(b) and as set out in Paulsen v. Yarrell </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n         (Tex.-App.-Houston [1 st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (quoting In Re Estate of Check 438\n         SW3d at 836).\n\n      5. The evidence presented by Dr. Montoya is that this case deals with the same standard\n         as setforth in the recent Texas Supreme Court of In Re Memorial Herman Hospital et\n         al </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695-696 2015. This case is on concerning anti-trust, business\n         damages and a campaign to stop competition by Dr. Montoya at San Angelo\n         Community Medical Center. Attached as Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the pleading\n         approved by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n      6. The Texas Supreme Court agreed that clear and specific evidence under the Texas\n         Statute includes relevant circumstantial evidence. (In Re Lipsky, 2015 Wll 870073).\n         This evidence of Dr. Montoya meets the standard.\n\n\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGE I OF7\n\n                                           225\n\f                  ---        -    -    ..   -------·-·---·----·-------~---·-----···---        .\n\n\n\n\n       7. In this case the evidence is both direct, actual and circwnstantial. The pleadings and\n          affidavit of Dr. Montoya prove that his case is real and not a continually protected\n          case.\n\n       8. Attached to this Response is the affidavit of John Hunt, M.D. (Exhibit 3) attached\n          hereto as if setforth at length that proves the whisper campaign and that the call list is\n          a requirement of Medicare rules and that the actions of San Angelo Community\n          Medical Center were to hurt Dr. Montoya economically and professionally.\n\n       9. Plaintiffs Business Disparagement and Defamation Claims Should Not Be\n          Dismissed\n\n         \"The TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits designed only to\nchill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.\" In re Lipsky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n589 (Tex. 2015) (emphasis added), citing Tex.

Code § 27.002 (balancing \"the\nconstitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise\nparticipate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law\" against \"the rights of a\nperson to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury\"). The TCPA is not applicable to this\ncase, as Plaintiffs causes of action are primarly concerned with Defendants' anticompetitive\nactions, and injury to competition in the relevant markets of nephrology services and referrals for\nnephrology services in San Angelo, Texas. As Plaintiff's Fifth Amended Petition makes clear,\nthe conspiracy which Defendants perpetrated to deprive Dr. Montoya of referrals began in 2007.\nAlthough Plaintiff details some specific defamations which occurred in 2014, those defamations\nare merely representative of the anticompetitive scheme to which Dr. Montoya was being\nsubjected. Defendants' group boycott and monopolization/attempted monopolization of the\nrelevant market began much earlier, so even if Plaintiff's pleadings do not set forth a prima facie\ncase of defamation and business disparagement, Plaintiff's antitrust claims should not be\ndismissed because they are not based on those instances of defamation.\n\n        In any event, Plaintiff has set forth a prima facie case of defamation and business\ndisparagement by clear and specific evidence in his affidavit and Fifth Amended Petition. The\n\"clear and specific\" evidence which is required to pass a TCP A challenge can be contained in the\nplaintiff's pleadings or in affidavits.

As shown in Plaintiff's Fifth Amended\nPetition, Dr. Brewer's defamation was published by conduct when he removed Dr. Montoya\nfrom consulting with a patient on January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. The defamation was published\nto the hospitalist overseeing that patient, and the nephrologists who was eventually called in to\nconsult as a replacement for Dr. Montoya. The defamation was eventually spread to all\nhospitalists and emergency room doctors at SACMC. Dr. Montoya has also set forth a detailed\ncalculation and ·explanation of the damages he has suffered as a result of the Defendants' scheme\nto deprive him of nephrology referrals and consults. See Plaintifr s Fifth Amended Petition,\nparagraph 5. With regard to the January 2014 defamation, Plaintiff has established his prima\nfacie case with clear and specific evidence.\n\n       10.     Even if Plaintifrs Defamations Are Dismissed, Plaintiff's Remaining Claims\n               Are Not Subject to the TCPA\n\n        The TCPA is clearly meant to apply to individual claims, not to an entire lawsuit when\nallegedly defamatory lawsuits are only important to certain claims. Breach of contract claims,\nfor example, would not ordinarily be dismissed merely because a Plaintiff failed to plead a prima\nfacie defamation case under the TCPA.\n\n        The TCPA's definition of \"legal action\" makes this clear. The TCPA states that \"If a\nlegal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to a party's exercise of the right of free\nspeech, right to petition, or right of association, that party may file a motion to dismiss the legal\naction.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 27.003(a).\n\nThe TCPA then defines a \"Legal action\" as \"a lawsuit, cause of action, petition, complaint,\ncross-claim, or counterclaim or any other judicial pleading or filing that requests legal or\nequitable relief.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 27.003(a).\n        The only cases which have interpreted the TCAP's definition of \"legal action\" have held\nthat the term \"is broad and evidences a legislative intent to treat any claim by any party on an\nindividual and separate basis.\" Hicks v.

Blunt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393-94\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2015, no pet.), Justice Pemberton wrote that where a \"'legal action' is based\non, relates to, or is in response to\" (whatever that phrase may mean) both expression protected by\nthe Act and other unprotected activity, the \"legal action\" is subject to dismissal only to the extent\nit 'is based on, relates to, or is in response to' the protected conduct, as opposed to being subject\nto dismissal in its entirety\" Id. at 394. Justice Pemberton then pointed to this result finds support\nin several features of the the TCPA's text, and he explained as follows:\n\n       The first is that the TCPA defines \"legal action\"-that which is subject to dismissal-\n       both expansively and variously, as previously noted, referring to everything from an\n       entire action or proceeding to particular facts that underlie a claim or cause of action.\n       This nomenclature contemplates the drawing of distinctions not only between claims, but\n       also between factual theories, as here.\n\n       Adding further support to this construction are the dual overarching purposes that the\n       Legislature has declared the TCPA is to serve: \"encourage and safeguard the\n       constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise\n       participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law, at the same time,\n       protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\"\n       Neither purpose is advanced by holding that a claim is wholly subject to dismissal merely\n       because it partly \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to\" protected expression under\n       the Act. Nor would these purposes be served by the converse holding that the claim is\n       wholly beyond the Act merely it \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to\" some\n       unprotected activity.\n\nId. at 393-394. The Serafine court later cited to \"longstanding principles of Texas jurisprudence\"\ncounsel against \"a construction of the TCPA that would mandate presumptive dismissal of an\nentire claim merely because its factual underpinnings might include even one allegation that\nimplicates the Act's protections.\" Id. at 394.\n\nSeveral cases have applied the TCPA as Justice Pemberton interprets it. For example, in Tervita,\nUC v. Sutterfield, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286-87 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2015, pet. denied), the court\ndismissed some of the plaintiffs claims based on conduct that occurred during a TOI-WC\nhearing, but refused to dismiss other claims because the movant had not shown \"by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that [plaintiffs] allegations were based on [defendant's] exercise\nof its right to petition or its right of association.\" Id. at 287. The Tervita court thus held that the\nTCPA did not apply to the plaintiffs \"employment discrimination based on (1) creating a hostile\nwork environment, (2) representing that he was \"not entitled to pursue benefits\" under the Texas\nWorker's Compensation Act, and (3) wrongful discharge.\" Id. at 286; see also Serafine v. Blunt,\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGE 4 OF 7\n\n                                                228\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359-60 (Tex.App.-Austin 2015) (\"to the extent that the Blunts' tortious-\ninterference counterclaim is based in part on Serafine's alleged threats made outside the context\nof the lawsuit, Serafine has not satisfied her initial burden to show that these portions of the\nBlunts' counterclaims are subject to the [TCPA].\")\n\n        The same result occurred in Sloat v.

In that case, the court rejected the defendants' argument that plaintiffs\nentire suit was based on conduct protected under the TCP A, when the plaintiff had also plead\nfacts which showed stalking and other tortious conduct. The court rejected application of the\nTCPA and stated as follows:\n\n       [Plaintiffs claims] are garden-variety tort claims based on specific conduct that the\n       [Defendants] have failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, implicates\n       the exercise of their rights of \"free speech,\"\" association,\" or \"to petition.\"\n\nSloat v.

Plaintiff Has Valid Causes of Action for Antitrust Violations\n\n        As noted above, Plaintiffs defamation claims are examples of how Defendant enforced\nits anticompetitive scheme to deprive Dr. Montoya of nephrology referrals, but Plaintiff's\nantitrust claims are primarily based on the illegal scheme itself and not individual defamatory\nstatements. Plaintiff has plainly set forth valid antitrust claims as they largely mirror the causes\nof action which the Supreme Court held to be valid in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital System,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2015).\n\n        The causes of action in this case, along with the underlying facts, are very similar to the\ncauses of action approved by the Supreme Court in In re Memorial Hermann Hospital. In both\ncases a doctor who has privileges at a hospital has alleged that the defendants conspired to\nprevent him from obtaining patient referrals. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711;\nPlaintiff 's Fifth Amended Petition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5. In both cases, the alleged\nconspirators consist of the hospital itself, a physician practice group, and individual doctors who\npractice at the hospital In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 695; Plaintiff's Fifth Amended\nPetition. In both cases, the doctors have explained how other doctors how other doctors are a\nprimary source of referrals, and that these referrals are required for a doctor to be able to\ncompete. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711; Fifth Amended Petition, pp. 6.2, 6.3, 6.8-\nRESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OF SAN ANGELO COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER-\nPAGES OF 7\n\n                                              229\n\f6.11. Both lawsuits allege that the defendants intentionally interfered with the plaintiff's\nlongstanding practice for obtaining referrals from other doctors in the community, and that the\ndefendants' acts constituted a \"concerted effort ... to restrain competition in and monopolize\"\nthe relevant market. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 708; Plaintiffs Fifth Amended\nPetition, paragraphs 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 7.1, 12.7. Both lawsuits allege that the defendants impugned\nthe reputation of the plaintiff doctors through a covert whisper campaign which convinced other\ndoctors not to refer patients to the plaintiff doctors. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 696;\nPlaintiff's Fifth Amended Petition, paragraph 6.15-6.17. Both lawsuits allege that the plaintiff\ndoctor lost a substantial amount of business from referrals due to the anticompetitive conspiracy\nagainst them. In re Memorial Hermann Hospital at p. 711 (plaintiff alleged that \"referral patterns\nchanged\" so that he was no longer the \"number one\" physician, and that following the conduct\nat issue, another physician received more referrals); Plaintiff's Fifth Amended Petition,\nparagraph 7.11 and 13.3-13.4 (Dr. Montoya received 10-20 calls per month from the SACMC\nemergency room to treat new or existing patients before the anticompetitive conspiracy began,\nbut he has only received a single call from emergency room for a new patient since then; all\nreferrals now go to the nephrologists at WTMA). In both this case and in In re Memorial\nHermann Hospital, the plaintiff doctor alleges that the defendants' acts \"constitute illegal\nmonopolization, attempted monopolization, and/or conspiracy to monopolize under Texas law.\"\nin In re Memorial Hermann Hospital, ; Plaintifrs Fifth Amended Petition, paragraph 12.7.\nPlaintiff has plainly stated a valid cause of action under the antitrust laws of Texas which is in no\nway designed only to chill Defendants' First Amendment rights. \"\" In re Lipsky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (Tex. 2015) (\"The TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits\ndesigned only to chill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.\") (emphasis\nadded).

FACTUAL BACI<GROUND\n\n\n             5.1    Since returning after advanced training to practice medicine in his hometown of\n\n             Houston, Texas, Dr. Gomez worked hard to build a stellar reputation for quality patient\n\n             care, technical excellence, and outstanding professionalism in cardiothoracic and\n\n             genernl surgery in the West Houston and Katy community. Dr. Gomez cares about his\n\n             patients, his fellow medical professionals, and his conununity, and his practice\n\n             expanded over a number of years with continuing referrals from medical professionals\n\n                                                              -4-\n\n\n                                                              235\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                            Page 6 / 18\n\n\n\n\n          aware of his well-dese1·ved reputation for outstanding patient care.\n\n          5.2    Dr. Gomez's skills and specialized abilities for patients requiring cardio-thoracic\n\n                                         11\n          and general surgeries, from basic\" open heart surgery to advanced robotic-assisted\n\n          surgical procedures, were actively promoted for many years by Memorial He1·mann as\n\n          part of its own marketing efforts in the West Houston and Katy medical community.\n\n          Dr. Gomez's practice was further enhanced by his pioneering implementation of \"off\n\n          the pump\" surgel'y and robotic-assisted ca1·diuthoracic procedures in. the Houston .\n\n          medical community. \"Off the pump surgery\" eliminates the need for the U8e of a heart-\n\n          lung machine by-pass during surgery and gi·eatly enhanced patient care and outcomes.\n\n          Robotfo-assisted s~gery, which typically eliminates the need to crack open the patient's\n\n          sternum in favor of much smaller entry ports for the robotic surgical tools, likewise led\n\n          to better outcomes and quicker recoveries for patients for~te enough to come under\n\n          Dr. Gomez' care.\n\n          5.3   The recommendation of the referring physicians to the patient directly impacts\n\n          the choice of the specific smgeon entrw,1:ed with patient care. The sw·geon in turn\n\n          determines, based upon the quality of the surgical and post-surgical equipment, staff,\n\n         and facilities, the hospital in which the surgical care is delivered. The surgeon's\n\n          decisions as to whei·e to perform his or her surgeries directly impact the profitability of\n\n         the hospitals in the specific conununity (in the West Houston and Katy community, the\n\n         surgical market is primarily at Memorial Hem1ann Memorial City Medical Center and\n\n         The Methodist West Houston Huspital). As a result, the ability tu fairly compare the\n\n         reputations of surgeons in a medical market community such as West Houston and\n\n                                                     -5-\n\n                                                    236\n\f12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                   713-755-1451                           Page 7 / 18\n\n\n\n\n          Katy affects patient choice and the co11tinued availability of the highest quality patient\n\n          care. Improperly manipulating comparative information and reputations of surgeons in\n\n          a medical market such as West Houston and Katy creates an improper distortion of free\n\n          and informed patient choice and options for medical care.\n\n          5.4    The appropriate way for any health ca1·e provider to attract patients in a\n\n          competitive market is by actually providing and being known for providing the highest\n\n          quality uf care. The illegal ,md unjust way (putti11g patients and their free choice hl the\n\n          market h1 jeopardy) is to malign, spread w,true 01· misleading information, or othe1wise\n\n          smear the reputation of a highly qualified surgeon in the same medical community.\n\n          5.5    With new management and operational changes at Memorial City Memorial\n\n          Hermann, including the arrival of Mr. Alexander as CEO, Dr. Gomez became\n\n          increasingly concerned about a decline in the quality of patient care at the hospital. The\n\n          decline in patient care arose from the understaffing of qualified nurses in the hospital's\n\n          intensive care unit (ICU), general care units and the emergency room; the lack of\n\n          consistent procedural safeguards for monitoring patients; and the failure to update\n\n          critical equipment. Memorial Hermann also began deliberate efforts to restrict surgical\n\n          care for the most critically ill patients, pushing for abandonment of \"salvage\" cases (for\n\n          example, eme1·gency surgery on patients in active cardiac arrest, able tu be saved in\n\n         some but not all circull'lbiances by a qualified surgeon).   What this meant to patients\n\n         most in need of a surgeon with Dr. Gomez' unique qualifications was the elimination of\n\n         patient choice and potentially life-saving procedw·es in favor uf potentially higher\n\n         statistical ranking for Memorial Hermann as calculated by U. S. News and World\n\n                                                     -6-\n\n                                                    237\n\f-----·-·····--··---------·\n\n  12/26/2012 09:19:22 AM                  713-755-1451                          Page 8 / 18\n\n\n\n\n            Report.\n\n            5.6    In response to D1·. Gomez repeatedly speaking out about these concerns, as well\n\n            as the likelihood Dr. Gomez would move his surgeries to The Methodist Hospital-\n\n            West Houston as the staffing and equipment dysfunctions continued, Dr. Macris and\n\n            Mr. Alexander, and others, joined in a calculated and deliberate scheme to destroy\n\n            Dr. Gomez' reputation and ability to practice medicine in the West Houston and Katy\n\n            conmmnity. _Dr. Mac_ris wal'~ted to disadv~ntage a skilled competitor, and Memorial\n\n            Hermann needed to avoid losing patit'llts by working with 01·. Macri::; in capturing the\n\n            patients that would have otherwise been treated by Dr. Gomez at another facility.\n\n            5.7   Quality patient care is ·the most important goal of any legitimate health care\n\n            provider.   Under both federal_ and state law, hospitals and their medical staff are\n\n            required to follow stl'ict standards for peer review evaluation and monitoring. These\n\n            peer review standards rely upon a consistent and well-developed process to ensure that\n\n            favoritism, improper motives, and manipulation for unjust purposes play no role.\n\n            Memorial Hermann had such a process in place at all relevant times, but Defendants\n\n            acted to evade and avoid its safeguards while manipulating the rules for peer review\n\n            and utilization review for their own wrongful purposes.\n\n           5.8    ht order to discredit Dr. Gomez and crush his ability tu practice medicine in the\n\n           West HoUb1on and Katy conuuunity, Dr. Macris and Mell\\orial Hermann began\n\n           compiling (and distorting) statistical data related to the mortality rates of Dr. Gomez's\n\n           patients.

At bottom,\n\n                the statistical information compiled and manipulated by Dr. Macris and Memorial\n\n                Hermann was geared to demonstrating a falsehood: that Dr. Gomez was an\n\n                incompetent physician undersel'ving of his reputation and the ti·ust his hard work had\n\n                earned in the West Houston and Katy medical community.\n\n                5.9    Rather than comply with the medical peer review process and its safeguards\n\n                against im.proper :influence, Defendants attempted to evade these well-established\n\n                protocols and the standing medical peer review committee at the hospital Defendants\nj .\n                then set up an emerge11cy \"meeting'' and presented Dr. Gomez with the option of either\n\n                immediately suspending his practice or agreeing to active interventional monitoring\n\n                under Defendants' supervision.      Both \"options'' would have effectively destroyed\n\n                Dr. Gomez' reputation i.l1 the medical community, severely curtailing patient choice, as\n\n                well as the opportunity for these and future patients to benefit from Dr. Gomez'\n\n                advanced abilities in cardiothorncic and surgical procedures.\n\n                5.10   At the time Dr. Gomez was presented with these \"options\" by Defendants, he\n\n      -\n      I'\n      c....\n       0\n      00\n                was also told that he would not be able to review at any meaningful level the alleged\n\n\n      l   I\n                data supporting the emergency action outside the usual peer review process (the data\n      0\n      0\n      0         that ultimately proved to be improperly manipulated and without a basic medical and\n      VI\n\n\n      ~L:\n               scientific grounding).

Montoya, Jr. M.D. and after\n       being duly sworn under oath stated.\n\n             \"My name is Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D. I am the Plaintiff in this case. I have\n       knowledge of all the facts of this affidavit as Plaintiff and all facts are within my personal\n       knowledge true and correct and that I was involved with facts stated.\n\n              I have not used any patient name, except where authorized by the patient or their agent, to\n       avoid any HIPAA or privacy violation.\n\n              1. I ·was ·admitted to practice nephrology at San Angelo Community Medical Center in\n                  1981.   I have full staff privileges for the practice of nephrology at San Angelo\n                  Community Medical Center. This case does not involve the rights of Defendant San\n                  Angelo Community Medical Center to speak freely, associate freely, and participate\n                  in government as permitted by law. The facts of the case are that I have full staff\n                  privileges to practice nephrology medicine at San Angelo Community Medical Center\n\n              2. Part of my practice and obtaining patients is that the hospital emergency room uses a\n                 rotating system of specialists admitted in that practice to see patients in the hospital\n                 and emergency room pursuant to the EMTALA Medicare call list. When you are the\n                 named specialist you receive a call from the emergency room physician that a doctor\n                 with your specialty is needed for a patient. A big part of my practice was obtaining\n                . new patients and treating existing patients that came to the emergency room that\n                 needed a nephrologist. Since 1981 I have gotten new patients from the emergency\n                 room.\n\n              3. Until 2007 I would receive 10-20 calls from the emergency room, per month to treat\n                 either new or existing patients for nephrology care at the San Angelo Community\n                 Medical Center. Since 2008 I have received only one call from the emergency room\n                 or a hospitalist for consultation as a nephrologist. A nephrologist treats patients with\n                 kidney problems and or disease. The one call I received was for treatment of a new\n                 patient or existing patient that suffered with kidney problems.\n\n\n\n\n                              £.1. Ji; bi f L        250\n\f     ·-------·--·····-·--·-------··--· -- •....\n\n\n\n\n4. The one time call for a new patient is described below. On January 24, 2014 I was\n    called by the San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room physician on\n    duty and the hospitalist Dr. Bartels. Dr. Bartels and the emergency room physician\n    informed me that a patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure. I was informed my\n    name was on the call board in the emergency room as nephrologist on call. Both of\n    the above doctors asked me to consult concerning treatment for that patient. I gave\n    my initial consult advice/orders of treatment to both doctors. This consultation call\n   was to me at 9:38 p.m. I informed them I would come see the patient and then review\n   the test results and determine any additional treatment for the patient. Attached as\n   Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record, removing the\n   name of the patient for HIPPA privacy, showing the facts on January 24, 2014.\n\n5. On January 25, 2014 at 8:10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then without ever seeing the\n   patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult and treatment by me and\n   consulted another nephrologist. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is one that\n   is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Kirk Brewer,\n   M.D. without seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of\n   nephrologist was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic\n   loss. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the redacted hospital record\n   showing the facts on January 25, 2014.\n\n\n6. In removing me as the nephrologist the ~ospital published a statement that I was not a\n   competent nephrologist to treat patients coming to the San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center emergency room. San Angelo Community Medical Center through\n   its agents and representatives was aware that its actions would become known to the\n   staff physicians of San Angelo Community Medical Center and that there was by\n   conduct and a whisper campaign saying I (Steve F. Montoya, Jr. M.D.) should not be\n   allowed to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n\n\n                                           251\n\f7. The statements and actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and\n    through its agents and representatives were published by conduct. The actions were\n    referring to keep from treating my own patients and any new patient coming to the\n   San Angelo Community Medical Center emergency room.               Toe statement(s) and\n   actions were defamatory and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n8. Until 2007 I would receive l 0-20 calls from the emergency room per month to treat\n   either new or existing patients at the San Angelo Community Medical Center. Since\n   2008 I have only received one call from the emergency room or a hospitalist for\n   consultation as a nephrologist, except for one time for treatment of a new or existing\n   patient that suffered with kidney disease/problems. The lack of referrals caused\n   substantial injury to the Plaintiffs and damaged their ability to compete, because the\n   Plaintiffs depend on these referrals and consults to build and maintain the nephrology\n   practice. A majority of patients who need kidney treatment/ suffer from kidney\n   disease in a hospital later need continuing care for their kidneys or related problems;\n   the most common of such continuing treatments is kidney dialysis. A typical kidney\n   dialysis patient will need treatment for six years, and each such patient would mean\n   revenue to the Plaintiffs practice of approximately $100,000 per year. I estimates that\n   the Plaintiffs have lost at least 100 long term kidney dialysis patients from 2007 to the\n   present due to the Defendants' anticompetitive scheme to refuse to give me patient\n   referrals or consults. I estimate that this lack of referrals has thus cost Plaintiffs\n   $1,000,000 to-$6,500,000 over that period of time.\n\n9. The defamatory statements and actions are untrue. I am a competent and qualified\n   nephrologist to treat patients at San Angelo Community Medical Center. If I were\n   not a competent and qualified nephrologist I would have been removed from the staff\n   of the hospital.\n\n\n10. The actions of San Angelo Community Medical Center by and through its agents and\n   representatives were intentional or done with negligence when San Angelo\n   Community Medical Center knew that the statement was false and the actions would\n   lead a reasonable prudent physician or patient knowing/believing of its defamatory\n\n\n\n                                      252\n\f    potential. The actions interred with my ability to make a living as a nephrologist on\n    staff at San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n11. The rules at San Angelo Community Medical Center and of the staff of San Angelo\n    Community Medical Center are to have a new patient in the emergency room or\n    hospital that needs a specialist consultation assigned to the name off the rotating\n    consultation list. The consultation list is kept by San Angelo Community Medical\n    Center by and through its agents and representatives. By San Angelo Community\n    Medical Center not following this procedure I did not receive any consultation\n    requests from the emergency room or hospitalist at San Angelo Community Medical\n    Center in 2008-present and one in 2014.\n\n\n12. Attached to this affidavit as Exhibit C is the true and correct sworn statement that an\n    existing patient of mine Mrs. Welch tried to see me in the emergency room of San\n   Angelo Community Medical Center and that the emergency room would not call me\n   to treat my existing patient Mrs. Welch is over 90 years of age and I have treated her\n   for at least 20 years. These actions interfered with my right to treat my patient and to\n   the patient's rights to pick her physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of\n   rights (see attached Exhibit D) and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached\n   Exhibit E)\n\n\n13. Another patient of mine, whose name is withheld per privacy rights, who is also over\n   90 years of age and has been my patient for at least 10 years requested me when she\n   went to the emergency room and she also was refused to see me. This action\n   interfered with my right to treat my patient and to the patient's rights to pick her\n   physician and to her rights under the patients' bill of rights (see attached Exhibit D)\n   and the patients' dialysis bill of rights (see attached exhibit E)\n\n\n\n14. A patient has the absolute right to be treated by their physician.   Attached as Exhibit\n   F is a true and correct copy of the patient bill of rights posted at the San Angelo\n\n\n\n\n                                        253\n\f    Community Medical Center. Attached as Exhibit E a true and correct copy of the\n   dialysis patient bill of rights concerning care of a dialysis patient. Both of these\n   patient bills of rights were violated by San Angelo Community Medical Center.\n\n\n15. On January 25, 2014 at 8: 10 a.m. Kirk Brewer, M.D. took over the hospitalists care of\n   the patient referred in Exhibits A and B as his rotation as the hospitalist started. Then\n   without ever seeing the patient or the chart Kirk Brewer, M.D. cancelled my consult\n   and treatment and consulted another nephrologist.        I went to the call board and\n   witnessed my name on call as the nephrologist on call on January 24 and 25, 2014.\n   The. San Angelo Community. Medical Center is required to have. an official EMTALA\n   Medicare call list for on call physicians for the San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center to take Medicare patients.       This is the list my name was on and was\n   intentionally ignored. This also violates a patient's right to choose their physician.\n   This list ·was· followed until Dr.· Brewer came to San Angelo Community Medical\n   Center and took charge of hospitalists. The nephrologist he brought in for consult is\n   one that is in a group that Kirk Brewer, M.D. has a contract for paid services. Dr.\n   Brewer did not see the patient when he removed me as the treating nephrologist he\n   issued the change via a telephone order (see Exhibit B). Kirk Brewer, M.D. without\n   seeing the patient, or chart changed the patient's doctor. This change of nephrologist\n   was for Kirk Brewer, M.D.'s economic gain and caused me economic loss.\n\n\n16. By the. actions of the hospitalists and emergency room physicians who are controlled\n   by their supervisor or lead physician Kirk Brewer, M.D. through the above actions\n   intentionally interfered with my practice of medicine at San Angelo Community\n   Medical Center to keep me from receiving patients as required by the EMTALA\n   Medicare call list.\n\n\n17. The Defendants' anticompetitive conduct has harmed consumers and others who pay\n   for nephrology services in the relevant market by increasing the costs of those\n   services. This is demonstrated by the chart attached hereto as Exhibit G. Before Dr.\n   Brewer's group of hospitalists became the attending physicians for all nephrology\n\n\n\n\n                                      254\n\f            patients at SACMC, nephrology patients would be referred to rrie (Dr. Montoya) who\n            would serve as the attending physician for the patient. This arrangement avoided the\n            \"middle man'' which now exists, as the hospitalists now usually serve as an additional\n            charging entity between the patient and the nephrology specialist. Even if the\n           hospitalists could do the same work as me or my partner used to provide, the patient\n           (and/or insurance and taxpayer-funded Medicare/Medicaid) still faces increased cost\n           for the same nephrology work, as the hospitalists charge more for physician services\n           than I charge. The SACMC hospitalists charge at the \"Comprehensive\" Medicare\n           allowable rate, which adds up to average charges of $506.85 per day. See Exhibit\n          ·-·G.· In· approximately , 2010, at· the SACMC · emergency room, -Dr. ·Brewer · · ·\n           explicitly told me that he and his group of hospitalists will always charge at the\n           comprehensive rate, regardless of medical necessity, because those charges\n           maximize revenue for Dr. Brewer and his group of hospitalists.            I, however,\n          ·charge· at the \"Moderate\" Medicare allowable rate, which adds up to an average cost\n           of $346.13 per day. The difference between these charges is $160. 72 per nephrology\n           patient per· average hospital stay. Over the course of a year, consumers/payors for\n           nephrology services have thus paid thousands more for the hospitalists' physician and\n           nephrology services than they would have paid for care from me who is a physician\n           specialist in nephrology.\n    All of the actions described in this affidavit are done by or for the Defendant San Angelo\nCommunity Medical Center.\n\n       Further affiant saith not.\"\n\n       Signed this 4th day of May, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n         Subscribed and sworn to me the undersigned notary by Steve F.

Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1686897\"><a href=\"/opinion/1686897/memorial-hospital-the-woodlands-v-mccown/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">2 (Tex.1996), forecloses\n      argument that section 160.007(b)'s anticompetitive action exception encompasses routine business torts, including\n      interference with prospective business relations. In Brooks, we noted that ''the statute provides that if a court makes a\n      preliminary finding that a medical peer review committee's proceedings, records, or communications are relevant to an\n      anticompetitive action ... they are not confidential,\" but that \"a similar provision for a libel action in which the plaintiff claims\n      malice\" was \"[n]oticeably absent from the statute.\" 927 S.W.2d at 16. We also held that the statute did not \"explicitly\n      exclude from its confidentiality provisions any of [the plaintiff's] other causes of action.\" Id.\n          The plaintiff in Brooks sued for libel, slander, \"intentional infliction of mental anguish,\" and interference with business\n          relations. Id. at 14-15. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had \"Intentionally and maliciously supplied false\n          information, thereby damaging or destroying [the plaintiff's] ability to gain admittance to the medical staffs of the\n          hospitals to which he applied.\" Id. Thus, Brooks did not require us to review the applicability of subsection (b), because\n          the trial court never made the required preliminary finding of relevance to an anticompetitive action. Furthermore,\n          aithough the plaintiff's \"other causes of action,\" Included an allegation that the defendant tortiously interfered with\n          prospective business relations, the plaintiff did not allege that the conduct was independently wrongful because the\n          provision of false information had a negative effect on competition and constituted an antitrust violation.

For example, ensuring that the data cannot be challenged might delay the hospital's ability to\n      respond to concerns raised by the data.
