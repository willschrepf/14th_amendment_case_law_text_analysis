This statute prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court concluded Cult Awareness was not a place of public accommodation within the meaning of the statute, and dismissed Clegg's federal civil rights claim with prejudice and without leave to amend pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

Sec. 1291, and we affirm.  The allegations of Clegg's complaint do not tend to show that Cult Awareness is a place, establishment, lodging or facility open to the public, or that it is an organization which provides access to an otherwise public place, within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.

His letter further stated if he did not receive a response within ten working days, he would consider his request for membership denied on the basis that he is a Scientologist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cult Awareness failed to respond to Clegg's letter.  Clegg later telephoned the director of Cult Awareness-L.A., explaining he desired membership in the organization to discuss the link between racial bigotry and religious intolerance.  Cult Awareness denied his request for membership.  Clegg then filed his complaint in this action, and appeals from the district court's judgment of dismissal for failure to state a claim.

All allegations of material fact in the complaint are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Buckey, 968 F.2d at 794;  Love, 915 F.2d at 1245.   A complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.  Buckey, 968 F.2d at 794;  Love, 915 F.2d at 1245.   However, the court is not required to accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations if those conclusions cannot reasonably be drawn from the facts alleged.  Papasan v.

Fifteen examples of such \"places of public accommodation\" are offered within the text of the law:  inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, cafeterias, lunch rooms, lunch counters, soda fountains, retail establishments, gas stations, movie houses, theaters, concert halls, sports arenas and stadiums.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a.  Nowhere does the statute refer to membership organizations, or otherwise indicate congressional intent to regulate anything other than public facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the plain language of the statute, it is clear Congress' intent in enacting Title II was to provide a remedy only for discrimination occurring in facilities or establishments serving the public:  to conclude otherwise would obfuscate the term \"place\" and render nugatory the examples Congress provides to illuminate the meaning of that term.  See Welsh v. Boy Scouts of Am., 993 F.2d 1267, 1269 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 602, 126 L.Ed.2d 567 (1993);  see also Ardestani v. I.N.S., --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 515, 520, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991) (\"The 'strong presumption' that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent is rebutted only in 'rare and exceptional circumstances,' when a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed.\")  (citation omitted);   Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 9, 82 S.Ct. 585, 591, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962) (\"the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used\").  This interpretation is in full accord with  Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 307-08, 89 S.Ct. 1697, 1702, 23 L.Ed.2d 318 (1969), in which the Supreme Court determined that the \"overriding purpose of Title II was 'to [re]move the daily affront and humiliation involved in discriminatory denials of access to facilities ostensibly open to the general public.' \"  (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 18) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Organizations fall under the purview of Title II when entry into a facility open to the public is dependant on membership in the organization governing the facility.  See, e.g., Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.S. 229, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969) (membership share in corporation chartered to operate a community swimming pool governed by Title II);  Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 89 S.Ct. 1697, 23 L.Ed.2d 318 (1969) (Title II governs when membership fee exists to enter recreational facility containing boating, swimming, miniature golf, dancing facilities and snack bar);  Smith v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n of Montgomery, Inc., 462 F.2d 634 (5th Cir.1972) (YMCA membership governed by Title II);  Nesmith v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n of Raleigh, N.C., 397 F.2d 96 (4th Cir.1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To conclude, however, that Title II covers organizations having no affiliation with any public facility would be tantamount to finding that an organization is a \"place.\"   Such an interpretation would be at odds with the express language of the statute.  See Welsh, 993 F.2d at 1275 (\"While it is true that 'people' and not 'places' are the source of discrimination, in Title II Congress focused exclusively on prohibiting discrimination in places of public accommodation and not in every conceivable social relationship.\")  (emphasis in original).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the language of the statute, we hold that Title II covers only places, lodgings, facilities and establishments open to the public, and applies to organizations only when they are affiliated with a place open to the public and membership in the organization is a necessary predicate to use of the facility.  When the organization is unconnected to entry into a public place or facility, the plain language of Title II makes the statute inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Clegg alleges in conclusory fashion that Cult Awareness is a place of public accommodation, he fails to allege sufficient facts to support that conclusion.  Nor does he allege facts from which it could be concluded that Cult Awareness is closely connected to a \"place\" or \"facility.\"   Instead, he alleges in some detail that Cult Awareness is an organization that offers the public a variety of goods and services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Clegg alleges that Cult Awareness sells books, provides speakers and seminars, owns a library of resource materials, and performs counseling and consulting services.  These facts are insufficient to establish that the goods or services are sold, purchased, performed or engaged in from any public facility or establishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor may Title II coverage be inferred from Clegg's allegation that Cult Awareness provides speakers for \"meetings, classes, conferences and conventions held at colleges, schools, clubs, churches and associations.\"   The facilities where these events take place no doubt are \"places,\" but Clegg fails to allege that Cult Awareness has any connection to a particular place of public accommodation.  Cf. Welsh, 993 F.2d at 1269.   Merely providing speakers who lecture at a variety of locations cannot be construed as having a connection to a \"place of public accommodation\" within the meaning of Title II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clegg fails to allege facts tending to show Cult Awareness' activities depend upon or emanate from any particular facility or location, or that Cult Awareness is an organization closely connected with a \"place of public accommodation.\"   Clegg's claims of discrimination are not covered by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a (1988).  The district court's order dismissing Clegg's complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for disposition without oral argument.

See Welsh v. Boy Scouts of Am., 787 F.Supp. 1511, 1523-30 (N.D.Ill.1992) (analyzing state court decisions under state laws analogous to Title II to determine whether a private organization unconnected to any facility was a place of public accommodation);  aff'd 993 F.2d 1267 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 602, 126 L.Ed.2d 567 (1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is consistent with the \"private club\" exception to Title II, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a(e).  This provision states:</p>\n        <p>The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to a private club or other establishment not in fact open to the public, except to the extent that the facilities of such establishment are made available to the customers or patrons of an establishment within the scope of subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n        <p>42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a(e).  Congress thus has drawn a distinction between the organization--a private club--and the facilities the organization operates.  Only when the facilities are open to the public at large does Title II govern.  See Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In support of his claim that Cult Awareness is subject to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.

Fifteen examples of such \"places of public accommodation\" are offered within the text of the law:  inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, cafeterias, lunch rooms, lunch counters, soda fountains, retail establishments, gas stations, movie houses, theaters, concert halls, sports arenas and stadiums.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a.  Nowhere does the statute refer to membership organizations, or otherwise indicate congressional intent to regulate anything other than public facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the plain language of the statute, it is clear Congress' intent in enacting Title II was to provide a remedy only for discrimination occurring in facilities or establishments serving the public:  to conclude otherwise would obfuscate the term \"place\" and render nugatory the examples Congress provides to illuminate the meaning of that term.

See Welsh, 993 F.2d at 1275 (\"While it is true that 'people' and not 'places' are the source of discrimination, in Title II Congress focused exclusively on prohibiting discrimination in places of public accommodation and not in every conceivable social relationship.\")  (emphasis in original).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the language of the statute, we hold that Title II covers only places, lodgings, facilities and establishments open to the public, and applies to organizations only when they are affiliated with a place open to the public and membership in the organization is a necessary predicate to use of the facility.  When the organization is unconnected to entry into a public place or facility, the plain language of Title II makes the statute inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Clegg alleges in conclusory fashion that Cult Awareness is a place of public accommodation, he fails to allege sufficient facts to support that conclusion.

Cf. Welsh, 993 F.2d at 1269.   Merely providing speakers who lecture at a variety of locations cannot be construed as having a connection to a \"place of public accommodation\" within the meaning of Title II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clegg fails to allege facts tending to show Cult Awareness' activities depend upon or emanate from any particular facility or location, or that Cult Awareness is an organization closely connected with a \"place of public accommodation.\"   Clegg's claims of discrimination are not covered by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.
