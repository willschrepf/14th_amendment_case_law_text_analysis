The Cammacks contend that the trial court misconstrued the parties'\r\nlease agreement in granting Eastburn's motion for summary judgment and in denying the Cammacks'\r\npartial motion for summary judgment.  We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part for\r\nadjudication of the Cammacks' remaining counterclaims.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tFactual and Procedural Background </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEastburn leased several rooms in her interior decorating store to the Cammacks for use as a\r\nrestaurant and catering facility.  Despite the relatively short term of the lease, the Cammacks\r\nextensively remodeled the property in order to convert it into a functioning restaurant.<sup> (1)</sup>  The\r\nremodeling took two months, cost between $60,000.00 to $70,000.00, and included changes made\r\nto the concrete structure, and plumbing and electrical systems.  A \"gigantic,\" 1,500-gallon \"grease\r\ntrap was put in the backyard using a crane.\"  Holes were cut into:  the ceiling and roof to attach\r\nequipment for exhaust fans, the floor and tile to install several eight-by-eight-inch floor drains and\r\nkitchen sinks emptying into the sewer system, and the walls to make space for gas and water pipes. \r\nCan lights were discarded and replaced with fluorescent lights, interior walls were removed and\r\nreplaced with new drywall covered with FRP,<sup> (2)</sup></span><span> and stainless steel was mounted or glued on the wall\r\nbehind the stove in order to shield it from heat. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks were able to make timely rental payments for the first four months after the\r\nrenovations were complete.  However, late rental payments began in January 2006 and continued\r\nuntil August 2006.  Exasperated with these late payments, Eastburn increased the Cammacks' initial\r\nsecurity deposit of $3,115.00 to $6,230.00.  The additional deposit failed to deter the Cammacks\r\nfrom making further late rental payments in September, October, and November 2006. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPursuant to the lease, Eastburn immediately accelerated the due date of all rents.  A written\r\nnotification of default, notice of acceleration, and demand for payment was sent to the Cammacks\r\non October 12, 2006.  They did not comply with the notice, the lease was terminated, and Eastburn\r\nclaimed the Cammacks did not vacate the premises in a timely fashion.  She filed a petition in county\r\ncourt for breach of lease of the holdover provision, failure to make timely rental payments, and\r\nfailure to remove improvements and return the premises to its previous condition.  Eastburn further\r\nalleged the Cammacks left the property in a \"filthy, deplorable condition,\" and, in violation of lease\r\nterms, failed to remove alterations, decorations, and additions in order to return the premises to the\r\ncondition in which it previously existed.  Included in the laundry list of complaints were:  vents on\r\nthe roof which were not removed, holes in the roof, missing or damaged molding, damaged tile and\r\nflooring, a damaged window, a grease trap in the backyard which had to be removed and required\r\nthe ground to be restored, plumbing and gas fixtures which should have been capped and covered,\r\nabandoned items, and general failure to clean the premises.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks' answer denied holdover tenancy, arguing that the lease expired by its own\r\nterms on July 30, 2007, that all kitchen renovations were completed with Eastburn's consent, that\r\nthey had no duty to restore the premises, and that some of the repairs requested were not authorized\r\nby the lease.  They also counterclaimed for return of the security deposit and alleged under\r\nChapter 92 of the Texas Property Code, which only applies to residential leases, that Eastburn was\r\nretaliating against them for failure to repair air conditioning, despite the Cammacks' repeated\r\ndemands, and that they were entitled to attorney's fees.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. §§ 92.331-.333\r\n(Vernon 2007). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks next filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing Eastburn had no\r\nevidence to demonstrate they were holdover tenants.  Also, since most of the work completed\r\nincluded permanent changes to the structure, and \"[l]ogic and reality dictates that these items cannot\r\nbe removed without damage to either the property, the building or the premises,\" the Cammacks\r\nargued that the lease provisions did not require them to restore the premises as Eastburn demanded. \r\nEastburn also filed a motion for summary judgment on her own claims, taking the obverse position. \r\nShe provided bid proposals demonstrating that it would cost $19,155.00 to restore the premises and\r\n$16,914.06 to remove the grease trap and fill the hole in the ground.  She attached the deposition of\r\nJason Cammack, who testified no work was done to refurbish or restore the facility.  He admitted\r\nthat the lease required the Cammacks to take FRP off the walls and clean the space and that neither\r\ntask was completed.  Jason also admitted that he \"had an obligation to remove all of my fixtures.\" \r\nNext, he described the condition in which the Cammacks left the property.  Jason clarified cardboard\r\ncovered a large hole in the ceiling leading to the attic because the vent was removed, that gas and\r\nwater pipes were not capped and were visible in the wall, that an electrical conduit was coming out\r\nof the floor, and that the stainless steel wall shield was not removed.  Last, Jason testified the 1,500-\r\ngallon grease trap still contained collections from the kitchen drains. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 5, 2008, the Cammacks filed amended counterclaims under Chapter 93 of the\r\nTexas Property Code, which applies to commercial leases.  They alleged Eastburn wrongfully\r\nwithheld the security deposit, wrongfully excluded them from the premises, and also alleged a cause\r\nof action called \"failure of consideration,\" seeking credit for the weeks of rent in which Eastburn\r\nallegedly failed to repair the air conditioning.  On December 19, they filed a \"Response to Eastburn's\r\n[Partial] Motion for Summary Judgment Motion to Renew the Cammacks' Motion for Partial\r\nSummary Judgment.\"  While the new counterclaims were briefly mentioned, no summary judgment\r\nwas sought on the counterclaims.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court considered the motions for summary judgment on December 30, 2008, and\r\nrendered final judgment awarding Eastburn $36,069.06.  Consistent with the affidavit of attorney's\r\nfees and costs, the trial court awarded $19,945.00 in fees and $1,067.10 in costs.  On appeal, the\r\nCammacks essentially argue, in a brief which challenges the reader, that the trial court erred because\r\nthe unambiguous lease agreement did not require them to remove improvements made to the\r\nproperty and restore the premises and that Eastburn did not sufficiently prove damages and attorney's\r\nfees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks also label the following as points of error:  (1) \"Appellants present an action\r\nagainst appellee pursuant to Texas Property Code § 93.011\"; (2) \"Appellants present an action\r\nagainst appellee pursuant to Texas Property Code § 93.002\"; (3) \"Appellants present a breach of\r\ncontract action against appellee and a defense of failure of consideration from appellee\"; (4) \"As a\r\nmatter of law, appellee is barred from pursuing any holdover claim against appellants.  And the final\r\nsummary judgment denies appellee's holdover and cleaning claims, to which she fails to object\"; and\r\n(5) \"Appellants' written objections, to appellee's motion for summary judgment and to her response\r\nto appellants' motion for partial summary judgment, address matters that are not relevant, that do not\r\nauthorize summary judgment for appellee and which are not a defense to summary judgment against\r\nher.\"  At a minimum, \"[a] complaint on appeal must address specific errors.\"  <em>Velasquez v. Waste\r\nConnections, Inc.</em>, 169 S.W.3d 432, 439 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2005, no pet.); <em>Hollifield v. Hollifield</em>,\r\n925 S.W.2d 153, 155 (Tex. App.--Austin 1996, no pet.).  Because these statements, as well as the\r\ncorresponding portion of argument, fail to address specific errors made by the trial court, we overrule\r\nthese \"points of error.\"<strong> </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>II.\tFinality of the Summary Judgment </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTypically, \"[a]n order that adjudicates only the plaintiff's claims against the defendant does\r\nnot adjudicate a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third party claim.\"  <em>Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp.</em>, 39\r\nS.W.3d 191, 205 (Tex. 2001).<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>  Thus, before we address the merits of this appeal, we must determine\r\nwhether the trial court's summary judgment was final such that it \"actually dispose[d] of every\r\npending claim and party or . . . clearly and unequivocally state[d] that it finally dispose[d] of all\r\nclaims and all parties.\"  <em>Id. </em> \"[T]he language of an order or judgment <em>can</em> make it final, even though\r\nit should have been interlocutory, if that language expressly disposes of all claims and all parties.\" \r\n<em>Id. </em>at 200.  \"[I]ntent to finally dispose of the case must be unequivocally expressed in the words of\r\nthe order itself.\"  <em>Id.  </em>If that intent is clear from the order, then the order is final and appealable, even\r\nthough the record does not provide an adequate basis for rendition of judgment.  <em>Id. </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tLehmann</em> explained that a \"statement like, 'This judgment finally disposes of all parties and\r\nall claims and is appealable,' would leave no doubt about the court's intention.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 206.  The\r\nsummary judgment mirrors the <em>Lehmann </em>language, stating \"[a]ll relief requested by any party in this\r\ncase that is not expressly granted by this judgment is denied.  This judgment finally disposes of all\r\nparties and claims in this action, is a final judgment, and is therefore appealable.\" In such a case,\r\nwhere the language of the order suggests the court intended the summary judgment to be final, but\r\nadjudicated counterclaims which were not brought by summary judgment, the judgment is \"final-erroneous, but final.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 200. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA judgment that grants more relief than requested is \"subject to reversal, but it is not, for that\r\nreason alone, interlocutory.\"  <em>Id.  </em>\"In those circumstances, the order must be appealed and reversed.\" \r\n<em>Id. </em>at 206.  If we determine Eastburn was not entitled to summary judgment on her claims, the entire\r\njudgment of the trial court will be reversed. <em> Page v. Geller</em>, 941 S.W.2d 101, 102 (Tex. 1997). \r\nHowever, if we determine that \"the summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on its claims was\r\nproper, [we must] affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse in part since only a partial\r\nsummary judgment should have been rendered, and remand the case\" for further proceedings in the\r\ntrial court.  <em>Bandera Elec. Coop. v. Gilchrist</em>, 946 S.W.2d 336, 336 (Tex. 1997); <em>Page</em>, 941 S.W.2d\r\nat 102; <em>Jones v. Ill. Employers Ins. of Wausau</em>, 136 S.W.3d 728, 743-44 (Tex. App.--Texarkana\r\n2004, no pet.);<em> Pinnacle Data Servs. v. Gillen</em>, 104 S.W.3d 188, 199 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2003,\r\nno pet.); <em>Klevin v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice--I.D.</em>, 69 S.W.3d 341, 344 (Tex. App.--Texarkana\r\n2002, no pet.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>III.\tStandard of Review </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's summary judgment is reviewed de novo.  <em>Laidlaw v. Waste Sys. v. City of\r\nWilmer</em>, 904 S.W.2d 656, 660 (Tex. 1995); <em>Lamar Corp. v. City of Longview</em>, 270 S.W.3d 609, 613\r\n(Tex. App.--Texarkana 2008, no pet.).  Summary judgment is proper when a movant establishes that\r\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 166a(c); <em>French v. Gill</em>, 252 S.W.3d 748, 751 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2008, pet. denied);<em>\r\nPowers v. Adams</em>, 2 S.W.3d 496, 497 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.) (citing <em>Nixon\r\nv. Mr. Property Mgmt. Co.</em>, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985)).  In deciding whether there is a\r\ndisputed material fact issue which precludes summary judgment, proof favorable to the nonmovant\r\nwill be taken as true.<em>  Nixon</em>, 690 S.W.2d at 548-49.  We indulge every reasonable inference in favor\r\nof the nonmovant. <em> Limestone Prods. Distribution, Inc. v. McNamara</em>, 71 S.W.3d 308, 311 (Tex.\r\n2002). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>IV.\tSummary Judgment on Eastburn's Breach of Contract Claim Was Proper</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tA.\tThe Unambiguous Lease Provisions</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth parties believe the lease's unambiguous language supports their position.  We must first\r\nanswer the question of whether this lease contract is ambiguous.  This is a question of law which we\r\nreview de novo.  <em>Lopez v. Munoz, Hockema &amp; Reed, L.L.P.</em>, 22 S.W.3d 857, 861 (Tex. 2000).  We\r\ncannot ignore the clear language of an unambiguous contract.  <em>Consol. Petroleum Partners, I, LLC\r\nv. Tindle</em>,<em> </em>168 S.W.3d 894, 899 (Tex. App.--Tyler 2005, no pet.).  If the lease provision above can\r\nbe given a certain or definite meaning or interpretation, it is not ambiguous, and we must simply\r\napply the language in the lease.  <em>Lopez</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 861.  However, where there are two reasonable\r\ninterpretations of the same language in a document, ambiguity arises.  <em>Id.</em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConstruction of the lease provisions was key in resolving the summary judgment.  Section\r\n5.2 of the lease stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tUpon receipt of Landlord's prior written approval, Tenant may from time to\r\ntime, at its own expense, alter, renovate or improve the interior of the Premises . . . so\r\nas not to weaken or impair the strength or lessen the value of the Building . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . .\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the expiration or other termination of this Lease, and upon obtaining the\r\nprior written consent of Landlord, Tenant shall remove such alterations, decorations,\r\nadditions and improvements and restore the Premises as provided in Section 5.5, and\r\nif Tenant fails to do so and moves from the Premises, all such alterations,\r\ndecorations, additions and improvements shall become the property of Landlord and\r\nLandlord may, at Tenant's expense, remove all such alterations, decorations,\r\nadditions and improvements.<span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Section 5.5 entitled \"Trade Fixtures\" provided:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTenant shall have the right, at the termination of this Lease, to remove any and all\r\ntrade fixtures, equipment and other items of personal property not constituting a part\r\nof the freehold which it may have stored or installed in the Premises, including, but\r\nnot limited to, counters, shelving, showcases, chairs and movable machinery\r\npurchased or provided by Tenant and which are susceptible of being moved without\r\ndamage to the Property . . . ; and provided further that Tenant, at its own cost and\r\nexpense, shall repair any damage to the Premises caused thereby.  . . .  Further, upon\r\ntermination of this Lease, or within five (5) days thereafter, Tenant shall replace the\r\nwall surfaces in the kitchen are [sic] of the Premises with taped and floated sheet\r\nrock.  The right granted Tenant in this Section shall not include the right to remove\r\nany plumbing or electrical fixtures or equipment, heating or air conditioning\r\nequipment, floor coverings (including wall-to-wall carpeting) glued or fastened to the\r\nfloors or any paneling, tile or other materials fastened or attached to walls or ceilings,\r\nall of which shall be deemed to constitute a part of the freehold, and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, shall not include the right to remove any fixtures or machinery that were\r\nfurnished or paid for by Landlord.  The Premises and the immediate areas in front,\r\nbehind and adjacent to it shall be left in a broom-clean condition, and in the condition\r\nin which they existed as of the Lease Commencement Date, normal wear and tear\r\nexcepted.  . . . If Tenant shall fail to remove its trade fixtures or other property at the\r\ntermination of this Lease or within five (5) days thereafter, such fixtures and other\r\nproperty not removed by Tenant shall be deemed abandoned by Tenant, and, at the\r\noption of Landlord, shall become the property of Landlord, and Landlord may, at\r\nTenant's expense, remove such trade fixtures and other property and store or dispose\r\nof the same, at Tenant's sole cost and expense. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSection 10.5, entitled \"Surrender of Premises and Holding Over,\" stated:<span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>\t</span>\tAt the expiration of the tenancy, Tenant shall surrender the Premises in good\r\ncondition, reasonable wear and tear excepted . . . Tenant shall remove all its trade\r\nfixtures and any alterations or improvements, subject to the provisions of Section 5.5,\r\nbefore surrendering the Premises, and shall repair, at its own expense, any damage\r\nto the Premises caused thereby. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWhen read as a whole, we believe the language in the contract is unambiguous for the\r\nreasons discussed below.  The Cammacks suggest that they were not responsible for removing the\r\nitems complained of because Section 5.5 of the lease, entitled \"Trade Fixtures,\" does not give them\r\nthe right to remove:  trade fixtures which they may have installed, plumbing, electrical heating or\r\nair conditioning equipment, floor coverings, tiles, or other materials <em>constituting a part of the\r\nfreehold.</em>  \"Trade Fixtures\" have been defined many times by the courts to include:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tsuch articles as may be annexed to the realty by the tenant to enable him properly or\r\nefficiently to carry on the trade, profession, or enterprise contemplated by the tenancy\r\ncontract or in which he is engaged while occupying the premises, <em>and which can be\r\nremoved without material or permanent injury to the freehold</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Boyett v. Boegner</em>, 746 S.W.2d 25, 27 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no pet.); <em>see\r\nAshford.Com, Inc. v. Crescent Real Estate Funding III, L.P.</em>, No. 14-04-00605-CV, 2005\r\nWL 2787014, at *9 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 27, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.) (citing\r\n<em>Connelly v. Art &amp; Gary, Inc.</em>, 630 S.W.2d 514, 515 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1982, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.)).  In other words, trade fixtures are those that are only removable without permanent or\r\nmaterial injury to the premises.  <em>Ashford.Com</em>, 2005 WL 2787014, at *9; <em>Connelly</em>, 630 S.W.2d at\r\n515.  We must reject the Cammacks' argument because the items Eastburn required to be removed\r\nare improvements or alterations, as admitted by Jason Cammack in his affidavit, and, by definition,\r\nare not trade fixtures such that they could be covered by Section 5.5. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe harmonize and give effect to all the lease provisions in relation to the whole instrument\r\nso that none will be rendered meaningless.  <em>Coker v. Coker</em>, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983).  Here,\r\nSections 5.2 and 10.5 set forth the general requirement that the Cammacks must surrender the\r\npremises in good condition, remove all trade fixtures and alterations and improvements, restore the\r\npremises, and repair any damage to the property caused due to removal at their own expense.  Even\r\nSection 5.5 reiterates the general requirement that the Cammacks are to leave the property in\r\n\"broom-clean condition, and in the condition in which they existed as of the Lease Commencement\r\nDate.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B.\tThe Cammacks' Breach </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen reviewing the laundry list of complaints in Eastburn's demand notice, it is clear that\r\nseveral of Eastburn's complaints involved failure to clean the premises, a duty that Jason realized he\r\nhad, but, by his admission, failed to perform.  Although the Cammacks removed their trade fixtures,\r\naccording to Eastburn's affidavit, they did nothing to remove their improvements and restore the\r\npremises.  Specifically, Jason admitted to not removing the 1,500-gallon grease trap, stainless steel\r\non the wall behind the stove, vents on the roof of the kitchen area, and the FRP from the walls.  He\r\nalso admitted to throwing away Eastburn's can lights and replacing them with fluorescent lighting. \r\nEastburn's uncontroverted affidavit stated the walls had not been repaired with taped and floated\r\ndrywall as required by Section 5.5.  Eastburn's affidavit also mentioned the Cammacks failed to\r\nmake repairs to restore the premises to its condition prior to the lease, including the following\r\nadmitted by Jason:  failure to repair holes in the roof, ceiling, floor and tile, replace Eastburn's lights\r\nwhich were thrown away, and cap and cover various gas and plumbing fixtures and an electrical\r\nconduit.  Eastburn's uncontroverted affidavit also complains of the Cammacks' failure to repair\r\ndamaged or missing molding, a damaged window, and restore the ground where the grease trap was\r\nplaced after its removal.  Photographs submitted in support of the summary judgment motions\r\nconfirm the condition in which the property was left. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, Eastburn's affidavit also established that the Cammacks continually failed to pay rent\r\non time, a fact that was never contested by the Cammacks.  Also, Section 10.5 of the lease, entitled\r\n\"Surrender of Premises and Holding Over,\" provided:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTenant shall remove all its trade fixtures and any alterations or improvements,\r\nsubject to the provisions of Section 5.5, before surrendering the Premises, and shall\r\nrepair, at its own expense, any damage to the Premises caused thereby.  Tenant's\r\nobligations to observe or perform this covenant shall survive the expiration or other\r\ntermination of this lease.  If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the\r\nexpiration of the tenancy created hereunder, whether or not with the consent or\r\nacquiescence of the Landlord, and without the execution of a new lease, Tenant, at\r\nthe option of landlord, shall be deemed to be occupying the Premises as a tenant at\r\nwill on a month-to-month tenancy. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Because the Cammacks failed to remove their improvements and restore the premises, they were\r\nsubject to the holdover provision under the lease.  The affidavit of Jason states the lease terminated\r\non June 30, 2007, and that Eastburn changed the locks on July 1, 2007, and only allowed entry onto\r\nthe premises during her business hours, as stated in the lease.  He complains that the Cammacks\r\nshould not be held liable for holdover damages because Section 5.5 of the lease allowed a five-day\r\nperiod to remove trade fixtures.  However, this five-day period was allowed only if the Cammacks\r\nwere not in default, and did not guarantee twenty-four-hour access.  Thus, the Cammacks failed to\r\npresent a genuine issue of material fact to counter Eastburn's holdover claim.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn sum, the summary judgment evidence left no issue of material fact regarding the\r\nCammacks' breach of lease.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tDamages and Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>On appeal, the Cammacks do not challenge the amount of damages, but simply claim\r\nEastburn was not entitled to recover them because she was not entitled to summary judgment.  We\r\noverrule this point of error.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe lease agreement provided attorney's fees to the prevailing party for any litigation arising\r\nout of enforcement of the lease.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 2008). \r\nThe Cammacks complain that Eastburn's attorney's fees are not reasonable or necessary, especially\r\nsince counsel did not furnish a time record.  Production of a time record is not essential when\r\nrequesting attorney's fees.  While reasonableness of an attorney's fee award often presents a question\r\nof fact, an \"affidavit filed by the movant's attorney that sets forth his qualifications, his opinion\r\nregarding reasonable attorney's fees, and the basis for his opinion will be sufficient to support\r\nsummary judgment, if uncontroverted.\"<em>  In re Estate of Tyner</em>, No 12-08-00232-CV, 2009 WL\r\n1609963, at *4 (Tex. App.--Tyler June 10, 2009, no pet.) (citing <em>Basin Credit Consultants, Inc. v.\r\nObregon</em>, 2 S.W.3d 372, 373 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1999, pet. denied)); <em>Haden v. Sacks</em>, No 01-01-00200-CV, 2009 WL 1270372, at *5 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] May 7, 2009, no pet. h.). \r\nCounsel submitted an affidavit of attorney's fees totaling $19,945.00.  It detailed the involvement\r\nwith the case, stated counsel's associate worked 43.8 hours at the rate of $125.00 per hour, and that\r\nhe worked 84 hours, 9.2 hours of which were billed at $150.00 per hour and 74.8 hours of which\r\nwere billed at $175.00 per hour.  Eastburn's affidavit established that she was required to pay these\r\nfees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on a false assumption that the final order denied the \"holdover and cleaning claims,\"\r\nthe Cammacks argue Eastburn should not receive attorney's fees because their counsel did not\r\nsegregate the \"cleaning and holdover claims\" from the restoration claims.<sup> (6)</sup></span><span>  When a plaintiff seeks\r\nto recover attorney's fees where at least one claim supports an award of attorney's fees and at least\r\none does not, segregation is required unless the claims arise out of the same transaction and are so\r\ninterrelated that the award or denial depends on the same facts.  <em>Cotten v. Weatherford Bancshares,\r\nInc.</em>, 187 S.W.3d 687, 709 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied);<em> Lesikar v. Rappeport</em>, 33\r\nS.W.3d 282, 317 (Tex.

All of Eastburn's\r\nclaims were for breach of the lease, any of which would support an award for attorney's fees. \r\nFurther, the claims all arose from the same transaction and involved essentially the same facts. \r\nSegregation of the breach of lease claims was not needed in this case. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, unless the necessity for or the reasonableness of attorney's fees was controverted by\r\nraising a fact question in a manner which would successfully preclude the summary judgment award\r\nof attorney's fees, Eastburn was entitled to have them awarded to her.  \"[A] summary judgment\r\naward of attorney's fees is improper where the nonmovant produces a controverting affidavit\r\nregarding fees.\"  <em>AU Pharm., Inc. v. Boston</em>, 986 S.W.2d 331, 338 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1999, no\r\npet.).  To constitute proper summary judgment evidence, an affidavit must be made on personal\r\nknowledge, set forth facts which would be admissible in evidence, and show the affiant's\r\ncompetence.  <em>Id.</em>;<em> see </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(f).  \"Conclusory statements or statements based purely\r\non opinion are not competent summary judgment evidence.\"  <em>Hawthorne v. Star Enter., Inc.</em>, 45\r\nS.W.3d 757, 759 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2001, pet. denied); <em>see</em> <em>Haden</em>, 2009 WL 1270372, at *5. \r\nAlthough an expert witness's opinion testimony in a summary judgment affidavit can defeat a\r\nsummary judgment claim, it is the basis of the expert's claim, and not the expert's bare opinions\r\nalone, that can settle a question as a matter of law. <em> See Burrow v. Arce</em>, 997 S.W.2d 229, 235 (Tex.\r\n1999).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the affidavit submitted by the Cammacks' attorney attempting to controvert the merit\r\nof the movant's summary judgment affidavit supporting an award of attorney's fees which had been\r\nincurred stated, \"[t]he attorney fees plaintiff's attorney claims are not necessary or reasonable, and\r\nthey are an excessive and bad faith demand\" without providing a rationale upon which the statement\r\nwas based.  The affidavit contains no recitation that the hourly rates charged by Eastburn's attorneys\r\nwere unreasonably high, that the time alleged to have been expended was excessive to accomplish\r\nthe work which was provided, that work performed by her attorneys was unnecessary to prosecute\r\nthe case, or that the work as alleged was not performed.  In sum, there is no evidence underlying the\r\nconclusion that Eastburn's requested attorney's fees at the trial level are unreasonable or unnecessary. \r\nTherefore, since the affidavit does not provide any basis for the statement made, the statement is\r\nsimply conclusory in nature.  The remainder of the affidavit claims that the fees are unreasonable\r\nbecause the lease did not support an award for Eastburn, the claims were not segregated, and\r\nEastburn's summary judgment motion was groundless.  These are legal arguments, not facts, which\r\nare resolved in Eastburn's favor.  The controverting affidavit makes no mention of Eastburn's\r\nanticipated attorney's fees on appeal, and those fees remain uncontested. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>V.\tConclusion </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>We affirm the summary judgment of the trial court on Eastburn's claims, and by implication,\r\nagainst the Cammacks' counterclaim regarding the security deposit.  However, because the trial court\r\ndid not adjudicate the Cammacks' remaining counterclaims, we reverse and remand in part for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tBailey C.

R. Civ. P. 166a(c). \r\nWe do not construe the Cammacks' brief references to its counterclaims in a motion filed less than\r\ntwenty-one days before the summary judgment hearing as a proper motion for summary judgment\r\non the counterclaims.  Also, it appears to us that the Cammacks mistakenly argued, through\r\nreferences such as \"[t]here is at least a fact issue whether Eastburn is entitled to keep all of the\r\ndeposit,\" that summary judgment on Eastburn's claims should be precluded because fact issues\r\nexisted regarding the Cammacks' amended counterclaims. \r\n<p>4. </p></span><span>Disposition of a particular issue may be inferred from other provisions of a judgment,\r\nprovided that the inference follows as a necessary implication.  <em>Matelski v.

While we believe the trial court's grant of Eastburn's breach\r\nof lease claim necessarily implied a ruling that Eastburn did not wrongfully withhold the security\r\ndeposit under the lease, we do not believe the same is true of the wrongful exclusion, and alleged\r\n\"failure of consideration,\" wherein the Cammacks sought credit for the weeks of rent in which\r\nEastburn allegedly failed to repair the air conditioning. \r\n<p>5. </p></span><span>The trial court awarded $36,069.06 in damages.  </span><span>This was supported by the uncontroverted\r\naffidavit of Bala Duszik, owner of a construction company, who provided itemized bids and stated\r\nthe cost to restore the premises would be $19,155.00, with an additional $16,914.06 to remove the\r\ngrease trap and restore the ground. \r\n<p>6. </p></span><span>The final order simply denied the Cammacks' motion for summary judgment and granted\r\nEastburn's motion.

The Cammacks contend that the trial court misconstrued the parties'\r\nlease agreement in granting Eastburn's motion for summary judgment and in denying the Cammacks'\r\npartial motion for summary judgment.  We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part for\r\nadjudication of the Cammacks' remaining counterclaims.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tFactual and Procedural Background </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEastburn leased several rooms in her interior decorating store to the Cammacks for use as a\r\nrestaurant and catering facility.  Despite the relatively short term of the lease, the Cammacks\r\nextensively remodeled the property in order to convert it into a functioning restaurant.<sup> (1)</sup>  The\r\nremodeling took two months, cost between $60,000.00 to $70,000.00, and included changes made\r\nto the concrete structure, and plumbing and electrical systems.  A \"gigantic,\" 1,500-gallon \"grease\r\ntrap was put in the backyard using a crane.\"  Holes were cut into:  the ceiling and roof to attach\r\nequipment for exhaust fans, the floor and tile to install several eight-by-eight-inch floor drains and\r\nkitchen sinks emptying into the sewer system, and the walls to make space for gas and water pipes. \r\nCan lights were discarded and replaced with fluorescent lights, interior walls were removed and\r\nreplaced with new drywall covered with FRP,<sup> (2)</sup></span><span> and stainless steel was mounted or glued on the wall\r\nbehind the stove in order to shield it from heat. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks were able to make timely rental payments for the first four months after the\r\nrenovations were complete.  However, late rental payments began in January 2006 and continued\r\nuntil August 2006.  Exasperated with these late payments, Eastburn increased the Cammacks' initial\r\nsecurity deposit of $3,115.00 to $6,230.00.  The additional deposit failed to deter the Cammacks\r\nfrom making further late rental payments in September, October, and November 2006. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPursuant to the lease, Eastburn immediately accelerated the due date of all rents.  A written\r\nnotification of default, notice of acceleration, and demand for payment was sent to the Cammacks\r\non October 12, 2006.  They did not comply with the notice, the lease was terminated, and Eastburn\r\nclaimed the Cammacks did not vacate the premises in a timely fashion.  She filed a petition in county\r\ncourt for breach of lease of the holdover provision, failure to make timely rental payments, and\r\nfailure to remove improvements and return the premises to its previous condition.  Eastburn further\r\nalleged the Cammacks left the property in a \"filthy, deplorable condition,\" and, in violation of lease\r\nterms, failed to remove alterations, decorations, and additions in order to return the premises to the\r\ncondition in which it previously existed.  Included in the laundry list of complaints were:  vents on\r\nthe roof which were not removed, holes in the roof, missing or damaged molding, damaged tile and\r\nflooring, a damaged window, a grease trap in the backyard which had to be removed and required\r\nthe ground to be restored, plumbing and gas fixtures which should have been capped and covered,\r\nabandoned items, and general failure to clean the premises.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks' answer denied holdover tenancy, arguing that the lease expired by its own\r\nterms on July 30, 2007, that all kitchen renovations were completed with Eastburn's consent, that\r\nthey had no duty to restore the premises, and that some of the repairs requested were not authorized\r\nby the lease.  They also counterclaimed for return of the security deposit and alleged under\r\nChapter 92 of the Texas Property Code, which only applies to residential leases, that Eastburn was\r\nretaliating against them for failure to repair air conditioning, despite the Cammacks' repeated\r\ndemands, and that they were entitled to attorney's fees.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. §§ 92.331-.333\r\n(Vernon 2007). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks next filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing Eastburn had no\r\nevidence to demonstrate they were holdover tenants.  Also, since most of the work completed\r\nincluded permanent changes to the structure, and \"[l]ogic and reality dictates that these items cannot\r\nbe removed without damage to either the property, the building or the premises,\" the Cammacks\r\nargued that the lease provisions did not require them to restore the premises as Eastburn demanded. \r\nEastburn also filed a motion for summary judgment on her own claims, taking the obverse position. \r\nShe provided bid proposals demonstrating that it would cost $19,155.00 to restore the premises and\r\n$16,914.06 to remove the grease trap and fill the hole in the ground.  She attached the deposition of\r\nJason Cammack, who testified no work was done to refurbish or restore the facility.  He admitted\r\nthat the lease required the Cammacks to take FRP off the walls and clean the space and that neither\r\ntask was completed.  Jason also admitted that he \"had an obligation to remove all of my fixtures.\" \r\nNext, he described the condition in which the Cammacks left the property.  Jason clarified cardboard\r\ncovered a large hole in the ceiling leading to the attic because the vent was removed, that gas and\r\nwater pipes were not capped and were visible in the wall, that an electrical conduit was coming out\r\nof the floor, and that the stainless steel wall shield was not removed.  Last, Jason testified the 1,500-\r\ngallon grease trap still contained collections from the kitchen drains. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 5, 2008, the Cammacks filed amended counterclaims under Chapter 93 of the\r\nTexas Property Code, which applies to commercial leases.  They alleged Eastburn wrongfully\r\nwithheld the security deposit, wrongfully excluded them from the premises, and also alleged a cause\r\nof action called \"failure of consideration,\" seeking credit for the weeks of rent in which Eastburn\r\nallegedly failed to repair the air conditioning.  On December 19, they filed a \"Response to Eastburn's\r\n[Partial] Motion for Summary Judgment Motion to Renew the Cammacks' Motion for Partial\r\nSummary Judgment.\"  While the new counterclaims were briefly mentioned, no summary judgment\r\nwas sought on the counterclaims.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court considered the motions for summary judgment on December 30, 2008, and\r\nrendered final judgment awarding Eastburn $36,069.06.  Consistent with the affidavit of attorney's\r\nfees and costs, the trial court awarded $19,945.00 in fees and $1,067.10 in costs.  On appeal, the\r\nCammacks essentially argue, in a brief which challenges the reader, that the trial court erred because\r\nthe unambiguous lease agreement did not require them to remove improvements made to the\r\nproperty and restore the premises and that Eastburn did not sufficiently prove damages and attorney's\r\nfees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Cammacks also label the following as points of error:  (1) \"Appellants present an action\r\nagainst appellee pursuant to Texas Property Code § 93.011\"; (2) \"Appellants present an action\r\nagainst appellee pursuant to Texas Property Code § 93.002\"; (3) \"Appellants present a breach of\r\ncontract action against appellee and a defense of failure of consideration from appellee\"; (4) \"As a\r\nmatter of law, appellee is barred from pursuing any holdover claim against appellants.  And the final\r\nsummary judgment denies appellee's holdover and cleaning claims, to which she fails to object\"; and\r\n(5) \"Appellants' written objections, to appellee's motion for summary judgment and to her response\r\nto appellants' motion for partial summary judgment, address matters that are not relevant, that do not\r\nauthorize summary judgment for appellee and which are not a defense to summary judgment against\r\nher.\"  At a minimum, \"[a] complaint on appeal must address specific errors.\"  <em>Velasquez v.

The\r\nsummary judgment mirrors the <em>Lehmann </em>language, stating \"[a]ll relief requested by any party in this\r\ncase that is not expressly granted by this judgment is denied.  This judgment finally disposes of all\r\nparties and claims in this action, is a final judgment, and is therefore appealable.\" In such a case,\r\nwhere the language of the order suggests the court intended the summary judgment to be final, but\r\nadjudicated counterclaims which were not brought by summary judgment, the judgment is \"final-erroneous, but final.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 200. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA judgment that grants more relief than requested is \"subject to reversal, but it is not, for that\r\nreason alone, interlocutory.\"  <em>Id.  </em>\"In those circumstances, the order must be appealed and reversed.\" \r\n<em>Id. </em>at 206.

We must reject the Cammacks' argument because the items Eastburn required to be removed\r\nare improvements or alterations, as admitted by Jason Cammack in his affidavit, and, by definition,\r\nare not trade fixtures such that they could be covered by Section 5.5. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe harmonize and give effect to all the lease provisions in relation to the whole instrument\r\nso that none will be rendered meaningless.  <em>Coker v.

Here,\r\nSections 5.2 and 10.5 set forth the general requirement that the Cammacks must surrender the\r\npremises in good condition, remove all trade fixtures and alterations and improvements, restore the\r\npremises, and repair any damage to the property caused due to removal at their own expense.  Even\r\nSection 5.5 reiterates the general requirement that the Cammacks are to leave the property in\r\n\"broom-clean condition, and in the condition in which they existed as of the Lease Commencement\r\nDate.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B.\tThe Cammacks' Breach </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen reviewing the laundry list of complaints in Eastburn's demand notice, it is clear that\r\nseveral of Eastburn's complaints involved failure to clean the premises, a duty that Jason realized he\r\nhad, but, by his admission, failed to perform.  Although the Cammacks removed their trade fixtures,\r\naccording to Eastburn's affidavit, they did nothing to remove their improvements and restore the\r\npremises.  Specifically, Jason admitted to not removing the 1,500-gallon grease trap, stainless steel\r\non the wall behind the stove, vents on the roof of the kitchen area, and the FRP from the walls.  He\r\nalso admitted to throwing away Eastburn's can lights and replacing them with fluorescent lighting. \r\nEastburn's uncontroverted affidavit stated the walls had not been repaired with taped and floated\r\ndrywall as required by Section 5.5.  Eastburn's affidavit also mentioned the Cammacks failed to\r\nmake repairs to restore the premises to its condition prior to the lease, including the following\r\nadmitted by Jason:  failure to repair holes in the roof, ceiling, floor and tile, replace Eastburn's lights\r\nwhich were thrown away, and cap and cover various gas and plumbing fixtures and an electrical\r\nconduit.  Eastburn's uncontroverted affidavit also complains of the Cammacks' failure to repair\r\ndamaged or missing molding, a damaged window, and restore the ground where the grease trap was\r\nplaced after its removal.  Photographs submitted in support of the summary judgment motions\r\nconfirm the condition in which the property was left. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, Eastburn's affidavit also established that the Cammacks continually failed to pay rent\r\non time, a fact that was never contested by the Cammacks.  Also, Section 10.5 of the lease, entitled\r\n\"Surrender of Premises and Holding Over,\" provided:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTenant shall remove all its trade fixtures and any alterations or improvements,\r\nsubject to the provisions of Section 5.5, before surrendering the Premises, and shall\r\nrepair, at its own expense, any damage to the Premises caused thereby.  Tenant's\r\nobligations to observe or perform this covenant shall survive the expiration or other\r\ntermination of this lease.  If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the\r\nexpiration of the tenancy created hereunder, whether or not with the consent or\r\nacquiescence of the Landlord, and without the execution of a new lease, Tenant, at\r\nthe option of landlord, shall be deemed to be occupying the Premises as a tenant at\r\nwill on a month-to-month tenancy. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Because the Cammacks failed to remove their improvements and restore the premises, they were\r\nsubject to the holdover provision under the lease.  The affidavit of Jason states the lease terminated\r\non June 30, 2007, and that Eastburn changed the locks on July 1, 2007, and only allowed entry onto\r\nthe premises during her business hours, as stated in the lease.  He complains that the Cammacks\r\nshould not be held liable for holdover damages because Section 5.5 of the lease allowed a five-day\r\nperiod to remove trade fixtures.  However, this five-day period was allowed only if the Cammacks\r\nwere not in default, and did not guarantee twenty-four-hour access.  Thus, the Cammacks failed to\r\npresent a genuine issue of material fact to counter Eastburn's holdover claim.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn sum, the summary judgment evidence left no issue of material fact regarding the\r\nCammacks' breach of lease.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tDamages and Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>On appeal, the Cammacks do not challenge the amount of damages, but simply claim\r\nEastburn was not entitled to recover them because she was not entitled to summary judgment.  We\r\noverrule this point of error.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe lease agreement provided attorney's fees to the prevailing party for any litigation arising\r\nout of enforcement of the lease.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 2008). \r\nThe Cammacks complain that Eastburn's attorney's fees are not reasonable or necessary, especially\r\nsince counsel did not furnish a time record.  Production of a time record is not essential when\r\nrequesting attorney's fees.  While reasonableness of an attorney's fee award often presents a question\r\nof fact, an \"affidavit filed by the movant's attorney that sets forth his qualifications, his opinion\r\nregarding reasonable attorney's fees, and the basis for his opinion will be sufficient to support\r\nsummary judgment, if uncontroverted.\"<em>  In re Estate of Tyner</em>, No 12-08-00232-CV, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1609963</span></span>, at *4 (Tex.

The affidavit contains no recitation that the hourly rates charged by Eastburn's attorneys\r\nwere unreasonably high, that the time alleged to have been expended was excessive to accomplish\r\nthe work which was provided, that work performed by her attorneys was unnecessary to prosecute\r\nthe case, or that the work as alleged was not performed.  In sum, there is no evidence underlying the\r\nconclusion that Eastburn's requested attorney's fees at the trial level are unreasonable or unnecessary. \r\nTherefore, since the affidavit does not provide any basis for the statement made, the statement is\r\nsimply conclusory in nature.  The remainder of the affidavit claims that the fees are unreasonable\r\nbecause the lease did not support an award for Eastburn, the claims were not segregated, and\r\nEastburn's summary judgment motion was groundless.  These are legal arguments, not facts, which\r\nare resolved in Eastburn's favor.  The controverting affidavit makes no mention of Eastburn's\r\nanticipated attorney's fees on appeal, and those fees remain uncontested. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>V.\tConclusion </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>We affirm the summary judgment of the trial court on Eastburn's claims, and by implication,\r\nagainst the Cammacks' counterclaim regarding the security deposit.
