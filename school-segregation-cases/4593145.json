The Texas Youth Council was created by the 55th Legis-\n    lature in 1957.    Article 5143d, V. T. C. S. The title of the Act (Acts 1957,\n    55th Leg.,   ch. 281, p. 660) provides:\n\n                  “An Act creating a Texas Youth Council for the\n                  protection,  care, training and supervision   of\n                  certain classes   of children and youth of the state,\n                  and, among other things, defining its powers,\n                  duties and functions.    . . .I’\n\n           Section   2 of the Article   5L43d provides   that:\n\n                  “This Act shall be liberally construed         to accomplish\n                  the purpose herein   sought. ”\n\n          Section 5, in which the powers and responsibilities           of the Texas   Youth\n    Council are set forth, states in part that:\n\n\n\n\n                                           p.   742\n\f                                                                                          ..\n\n\nThe Honorable    Ron Jackson,    page 2     (H-160)\n\n\n\n\n             “(b) The Texas Youth Council shall be responsible\n             for the adoption of all policies and shall make e\n             rules appropriate  tohe   proper accomplishment   of\n             its functions. ” (emphasis added)\n\n       The major duties and functions of the Texas Youth Council are declared\nin $6, which provides in part that the Texas Youth Council shall:\n\n             “(d) Administer      the diagnostic treatmentand trainingand\n             stipervisbryfacilities    and s&vices of the state for delinquent\n             children committed        to the state.   Manage and direct\n             state training school facilities       and provide for the coor-\n             dination and combination of such facilities,as         deemed\n             advisable by the Texas Youth Council,           and for the crea-\n             tion of new facilities     within the total appropriation    pro-\n             vided by the Legislature;        exercise  administrative    con-\n             trol over all other institutions and facilities       under its\n             jurisdiction.   ” (emphasis added)\n\n        By virtue of the foregoing    sections to Article   5143d, we are of the\nopinion that the Legislature     intended to vest in the Youth Council as much\nauthority as possible in determining        the policies and rules for treatment\nand disposition    of juveniles committed to the Council.       We conclude that\nArticle   5143d provides the Youth Council with the power to authorize the\nassignment     of students to state training schools on a coeducational     basis if,\nin the opinion of the Council,     it will help facilitate the accomplishment    of\nthe purpose of such institutions.\n\n       We are of the opinion that the Legislature       did not intend to require\nsexually segregated  training institutions.\n\n      Sections of Article   5143d, in addition to those quoted heretofore,      support\nour opinion by implication.     Section 20, for example,     relates to the appoint-\nment of superintendents    for the schools and institutions.      It provides in part\nthat:\n\n             “The superintendent     of any school or other facility\n             for the care of girls   exclusively  shall be a woman.”\n             (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n                                      p.   743\n\f.\n\n\n\n\n    The Honorable      Ron Jackson,      page 3        (H-160)\n\n\n\n\n    By use of the word “exclusively, ” we believe that the Legislature  anticipated\n    that males and females  might be assigned to state training schools on a\n    coeducational basis.\n\n          Section     26(b) states   in part:\n\n                 “When funds are available             for the purpose,     the Youth\n                 Council may: . . .\n\n                         “(b) Establish and operate additional treatment\n                 and training facilities,  including forestry   or parks-\n                 maintenance     camps and boys’ ranches,     necessary   to\n                 classify and segregate    and handle iuvenile delinquents\n                 of different ages, habits and mental and physical con-\n                 dition according to their needs. ” (emphasis added)\n\n    Despite the reference  to the establishment     of boys’ ranches,   we conclude\n    that $26(b) does not require classification    and segregation of juvenile delinquents\n    on the basis of the sex of said juveniles   alone.\n\n            We have found nothing in legislation    enacted prior to the passage of\n    Article   5143d concerning the treatment and custody of children judicially\n    declared to be juvenile delinquents expressly       prohibiting the assignment     of\n    children to state training schools on a coeducational         basis.  Some earlier\n    statutory   provisions  have, however,   reflected the traditional separate treat-\n    ment and custody of males and females.         In view of our opinion that Article\n    5143d vests in the Youth Council the authority and power to determine all\n    policies and rules of the state training institutions,       and hence to assign\n    students to said institutions  on a coeducational      basis, we conclude that any\n    inferences    possibly drawn from such earlier      statutes detracting from that\n    power and authority are rendered inapplicable         to the Youth Council by 5 39\n    of Acts 1957, 55>th Legis.,   p; 660,  ch.  281  (Article    5143d) which provides that:\n\n                    “All   laws and parts   of laws in conflict       with the\n                 provisions  of this Act are hereby              repealed   to the\n                 extent of such conflict only. ”\n\n\n\n\n                                                p.   744\n\f.\n\n\n\n                                                                             ‘.\n\n\n\n\n    The Honorable   Ron Jackson,   page 4     (H-160)\n\n\n\n\n                                   SUMMARY\n\n                      Article  5143d, creating the Texas Youth Council,\n               vests in the Council the authority to promulgate all\n               policies and rules appropriate    to the rehabilitation of\n               juvenile delinquents committed to the Council, including\n               the assignment    of juveniles to state training schools on\n               a coeducational   basis.\n\n                                              Very      truly yours,\n\n\n\n\n    DAVID M.
