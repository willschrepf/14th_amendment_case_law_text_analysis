Proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, Lasko\n\fappeals from the District Court’s denial of his habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we will affirm.\n\n                                               I.\n\n       In short, Lasko had refused to leave the office of the Clinical Director of Health\n\nServices at FCI-Schuylkill, in spite of direct orders to do so by prison staff. On July 26,\n\n2006, Lasko received an incident report charging him with “Refusing to Obey an Order of\n\nany Staff Member” in violation of Code 307. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, Table 3. The Unit\n\nDiscipline Committee referred the charge to Disciplinary Hearing Officer Kevin\n\nBittenbender (“DHO Bittenbender”). A disciplinary hearing was held, and DHO\n\nBittenbender concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that Lasko\n\nviolated Code 307. As a result, Lasko was sanctioned with fifteen days in disciplinary\n\nsegregation, ten days disallowance of good conduct time (“GCT”), forfeiture of thirty\n\ndays non-vested GCT, and loss of telephone and visitation privileges for four months.\n\n       Lasko then filed this petition for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\nTherein, he claimed that his disciplinary hearing was constitutionally infirm for want of\n\ndue process, and that the incident report was issued against him in retaliation for his prior\n\nfiling of a § 1983 action against the report’s complainant.1 The District Court denied the\n\n\n  1\n    That action, Lasko v. Hendershot, No. 05-0991, 2006 WL 2828787 (M.D. Pa. Sept.\n29, 2006), was dismissed by the District Court for failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies. However, Lasko renewed the suit, and the District Court granted the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment. The case is currently pending on appeal. See\n\n                                               2\n\fpetition, and denied Lasko’s motion to compel. Lasko timely appealed.\n\n                                              II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2253(a). A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal from the denial of Lasko’s\n\n§ 2241 petition. See Burkey v. Marberry, 556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir. 2009). We exercise\n\nplenary review over the District Court’s legal conclusions, and review its factual findings\n\nfor clear error. See Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                                              III.\n\n       Lasko raises four claims on appeal: 1) he was not permitted to review documentary\n\nevidence or call witnesses; 2) DHO Bittenbender was biased; 3) there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support DHO Bittenbender’s adverse disciplinary determination; and 4) the\n\nincident report was issued in retaliation for Lasko’s filing of a civil rights action against\n\nprison officials.2 We address these claims in that order.\n\n       The due process rights of an inmate facing loss of GCT are limited to: 1) an\n\n\n\n\nLasko v. Watts, CA No. 08-3615.\n  2\n     To the extent that Lasko also attempts to advance an Eighth Amendment medical\nneglect claim on appeal, we cannot consider it. This claim, if successful, would not “spell\nspeedier release,” and therefore does not “lie[] at ‘the core of habeas corpus.’” Wilkinson\nv. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 82 (2005) (quoting Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489\n(1973)). Lasko himself seems to recognize that § 1983 is the proper vehicle for such a\nclaim, see Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 543 (3d Cir. 2002), as he is already pursuing\nit in his pending civil suit. We express no opinion on the merits of that claim at this time.\n\n                                               3\n\fimpartial decision-making body; 2) twenty-four hour advance notice of the charges; 3) an\n\nopportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; 4) assistance from a\n\nrepresentative; and 5) a written decision explaining the evidence relied upon. See Wolff\n\nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-71 (1974).\n\n       Notably absent from the Wolff list of due process rights is a prisoner’s right to\n\nreview all potentially inculpatory evidence prior to the disciplinary hearing, and thus\n\nLasko’s first claim must fail. Moreover, the documentary evidence that Lasko complains\n\nof not receiving (a memorandum of Physician’s Assistant Ortiz, who witnessed the events\n\nleading up to the incident report) was apparently provided to Lasko orally. In addition,\n\nLasko’s claim that he was denied the right to call witnesses is belied by the fact that he\n\ndid call a witness, Physician Assistant Hubble. Further, Lasko does not offer any names\n\nof witnesses that he was prevented from calling. Thus, the District Court was correct in\n\nfinding that Lasko’s first due process claim is without merit.3\n\n\n  3\n     Lasko’s brief also indicates that he was effectively denied staff representation at the\nhearing, as he was threatened by DHO Bittenbender with placement in “the Hole” (a\nSegregated Housing Unit) should he try to postpone the hearing until he retained such\nrepresentation. (App. Br. at 2, 13.) As Appellee notes, this claim was not raised before\nthe District Court, and we generally do not review claims raised for the first time on\nappeal. See United States v. Garth, 188 F.3d 99, 106 n.7 (3d Cir. 1999). But even if we\nwere to consider it, we would find the claim lacking in merit. First, Wolff provides a\nright to staff representation at a prison disciplinary hearing only when the inmate is\nilliterate or the issue to be adjudicated is complex. See 418 U.S. at 570. Neither of those\nconditions is present in this case. Second, while DHO Bittenbender’s alleged threat, if he\nmade the threat, is quite troubling, the overwhelming evidence of Lasko’s violation of\nCode 307 precludes him from being able to show that he suffered any prejudice rising to\nthe level of a due process violation from the threat. Cf. Burkett v. Cunningham, 826 F.2d\n\n                                              4\n\f       Lasko’s second claim, regarding DHO Bittenbender’s alleged bias, implicates the\n\ndue process right to an impartial decision-making body. This claim requires little\n\ndiscussion. Lasko merely offers generalized critiques of DHO Bittenbender, calling him\n\n“immoral, not impartial and not unbiased,” without providing any substantive support for\n\nhis argument. This is wholly insufficient, and the District Court correctly concluded that\n\nLasko had failed to demonstrate partiality under Meyers v. Aldredge, 492 F.2d 296, 306\n\n(3d Cir. 1974), or non-conformity with the relevant BOP regulations. See 28 C.F.R. §\n\n541.16(b) (“In order to insure impartiality, the DHO may not be the reporting officer,\n\ninvestigating officer, or UDC member, or a witness to the incident or play any significant\n\npart in having the charge(s) referred to the DHO.”).\n\n       We also reject Lasko’s third claim, concerning the sufficiency of the evidence. A\n\nprison disciplinary determination comports with due process if it is based on “some\n\nevidence.” See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454-56 (1985)\n\n(“[T]he relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support\n\nthe conclusion reached by the disciplinary board”). This standard is minimal and does not\n\nrequire examination of the entire record, an independent assessment of the credibility of\n\nwitnesses, or even a weighing of the evidence. See id. at 455; Thompson v. Owens, 889\n\nF.2d 500, 501-02 (3d Cir. 1989). The District Court pointed to several pieces of evidence\n\n\n\n\n1208, 1221 (3d Cir. 1987) (“proof of prejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient\nelement of a due process claim”) (citation omitted).\n\n                                             5\n\fthat support DHO Bittenbender’s decision, including the allegations in the incident report,\n\nLasko’s own incriminating statements, and the contents of the Ortiz memorandum. (Dist.\n\nCt. Op. at 2-3, 7.) These findings of fact are not “clearly erroneous,” and we find no\n\nflaws in the District Court’s application of the law with regard to this claim. We thus\n\nagree with the District Court that there was “some evidence” of Lasko’s violation of BOP\n\nCode 307, and therefore no violation of his due process rights.\n\n       Finally, we turn to Lasko’s First Amendment retaliation claim. Such a claim is\n\nproper in the habeas context if, for example, a petitioner’s success will necessarily imply\n\nthe invalidity of his deprivation of GCT. See Wilkinson, 544 U.S. at 81; Queen v. Miner,\n\n530 F.3d 253, 255 n.2 (3d Cir. 2008); see also Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 648\n\n(1997). This is so in this case. As to the merits of the claim, because we agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that sufficient evidence supported DHO Bittenbender’s disciplinary\n\ndetermination, Lasko’s retaliation claim must fail. See Carter v. McGrady, 292 F.3d 152,\n\n159 (3d Cir. 2002); Henderson v. Baird, 29 F.3d 464, 469 (8th Cir. 1994) (stating that\n\nwhen “some evidence” supports disciplinary determination, that finding “checkmates”\n\nprisoner’s retaliation claim).4\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    We express no opinion, however, on the merits of the closely related retaliation claim\nthat Lasko raised in his contemporaneous civil suit. Nor do we express any opinion on\nwhether such a claim is cognizable in a § 1983 action.\n\f",

Watts, CA No. 08-3615.\n  2\n     To the extent that Lasko also attempts to advance an Eighth Amendment medical\nneglect claim on appeal, we cannot consider it. This claim, if successful, would not “spell\nspeedier release,” and therefore does not “lie[] at ‘the core of habeas corpus.’” Wilkinson\nv.

Lasko himself seems to recognize that § 1983 is the proper vehicle for such a\nclaim, see Leamer v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777473\"><a href=\"/opinion/777473/charles-a-leamer-jr-v-william-h-fauver-william-f-plantier-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 543 (3d Cir. 2002), as he is already pursuing\nit in his pending civil suit. We express no opinion on the merits of that claim at this time.\n\n                                               3\n\fimpartial decision-making body; 2) twenty-four hour advance notice of the charges; 3) an\n\nopportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; 4) assistance from a\n\nrepresentative; and 5) a written decision explaining the evidence relied upon. See Wolff\n\nv. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563-71 (1974).\n\n       Notably absent from the Wolff list of due process rights is a prisoner’s right to\n\nreview all potentially inculpatory evidence prior to the disciplinary hearing, and thus\n\nLasko’s first claim must fail. Moreover, the documentary evidence that Lasko complains\n\nof not receiving (a memorandum of Physician’s Assistant Ortiz, who witnessed the events\n\nleading up to the incident report) was apparently provided to Lasko orally. In addition,\n\nLasko’s claim that he was denied the right to call witnesses is belied by the fact that he\n\ndid call a witness, Physician Assistant Hubble. Further, Lasko does not offer any names\n\nof witnesses that he was prevented from calling. Thus, the District Court was correct in\n\nfinding that Lasko’s first due process claim is without merit.3\n\n\n  3\n     Lasko’s brief also indicates that he was effectively denied staff representation at the\nhearing, as he was threatened by DHO Bittenbender with placement in “the Hole” (a\nSegregated Housing Unit) should he try to postpone the hearing until he retained such\nrepresentation. (App. Br. at 2, 13.) As Appellee notes, this claim was not raised before\nthe District Court, and we generally do not review claims raised for the first time on\nappeal. See United States v. Garth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765744\"><a href=\"/opinion/765744/united-states-v-marlon-garth/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 n.7 (3d Cir. 1999). But even if we\nwere to consider it, we would find the claim lacking in merit. First, Wolff provides a\nright to staff representation at a prison disciplinary hearing only when the inmate is\nilliterate or the issue to be adjudicated is complex. See 418 U.S. at 570. Neither of those\nconditions is present in this case. Second, while DHO Bittenbender’s alleged threat, if he\nmade the threat, is quite troubling, the overwhelming evidence of Lasko’s violation of\nCode 307 precludes him from being able to show that he suffered any prejudice rising to\nthe level of a due process violation from the threat. Cf. Burkett v. Cunningham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492516\"><a href=\"/opinion/492516/united-states-v-john-e-crooks-united-states-of-america-v-joseph-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n                                              <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f       Lasko’s second claim, regarding DHO Bittenbender’s alleged bias, implicates the\n\ndue process right to an impartial decision-making body. This claim requires little\n\ndiscussion. Lasko merely offers generalized critiques of DHO Bittenbender, calling him\n\n“immoral, not impartial and not unbiased,” without providing any substantive support for\n\nhis argument. This is wholly insufficient, and the District Court correctly concluded that\n\nLasko had failed to demonstrate partiality under Meyers v. Aldredge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"317142\"><a href=\"/opinion/317142/joel-meyers-v-noah-alldredge-warden-united-states-penitentiary-at/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306\n\n(3d Cir. 1974), or non-conformity with the relevant BOP regulations. See 28 C.F.R. §\n\n541.16(b) (“In order to insure impartiality, the DHO may not be the reporting officer,\n\ninvestigating officer, or UDC member, or a witness to the incident or play any significant\n\npart in having the charge(s) referred to the DHO.”).\n\n       We also reject Lasko’s third claim, concerning the sufficiency of the evidence. A\n\nprison disciplinary determination comports with due process if it is based on “some\n\nevidence.” See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454-56 (1985)\n\n(“[T]he relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support\n\nthe conclusion reached by the disciplinary board”). This standard is minimal and does not\n\nrequire examination of the entire record, an independent assessment of the credibility of\n\nwitnesses, or even a weighing of the evidence. See id. at 455; Thompson v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532052\"><a href=\"/opinion/532052/david-thompson-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501-02 (3d Cir. 1989). The District Court pointed to several pieces of evidence\n\n\n\n\n1208, 1221 (3d Cir. 1987) (“proof of prejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient\nelement of a due process claim”) (citation omitted).\n\n                                             5\n\fthat support DHO Bittenbender’s decision, including the allegations in the incident report,\n\nLasko’s own incriminating statements, and the contents of the Ortiz memorandum. (Dist.\n\nCt. Op. at 2-3, 7.) These findings of fact are not “clearly erroneous,” and we find no\n\nflaws in the District Court’s application of the law with regard to this claim. We thus\n\nagree with the District Court that there was “some evidence” of Lasko’s violation of BOP\n\nCode 307, and therefore no violation of his due process rights.\n\n       Finally, we turn to Lasko’s First Amendment retaliation claim. Such a claim is\n\nproper in the habeas context if, for example, a petitioner’s success will necessarily imply\n\nthe invalidity of his deprivation of GCT. See Wilkinson, 544 U.S. at 81; Queen v. Miner,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189274\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189274/queen-v-miner/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 n.2 (3d Cir. 2008); see also Edwards v. Balisok, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118112\"><a href=\"/opinion/118112/edwards-v-balisok/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648\n\n(1997). This is so in this case. As to the merits of the claim, because we agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that sufficient evidence supported DHO Bittenbender’s disciplinary\n\ndetermination, Lasko’s retaliation claim must fail. See Carter v. McGrady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777863\"><a href=\"/opinion/777863/richard-carter-sci-mahanoy-para-legal-assistant-on-behalf-of-himself-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n159 (3d Cir. 2002); Henderson v. Baird, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673923\"><a href=\"/opinion/673923/andre-t-henderson-v-david-baird-jointly-and-severally-in-their-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469 (8th Cir. 1994) (stating that\n\nwhen “some evidence” supports disciplinary determination, that finding “checkmates”\n\nprisoner’s retaliation claim).4\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    We express no opinion, however, on the merits of the closely related retaliation claim\nthat Lasko raised in his contemporaneous civil suit. Nor do we express any opinion on\nwhether such a claim is cognizable in a § 1983 action.\n\f</pre>",
