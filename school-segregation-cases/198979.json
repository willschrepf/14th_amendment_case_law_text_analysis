We affirm the district\ncourt’s holding with respect to coverage under the employer’s liability policy, but\nwe vacate the district court’s judgment and remand for determination of the\nallocation of liability.\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In October 2004, two employees of Cooper B-Line, Inc. (“B-Line”) were\nkilled in the course and scope of their employment at a B-Line plant in Texas.\nSubsequently, representatives of the two decedents sued B-Line and its parent\ncorporation, Cooper Industries, LLC (“Cooper”), asserting various negligence and\ngross negligence claims against both entities (the “underlying suit”). Cooper and\nB-Line timely submitted the claims of the underlying suit to their employer’s\nliability insurer and excess liability insurer.1 Cooper and its subsidiaries,\nincluding B-Line, carried primary employer’s liability insurance from ACE\nAmerican Insurance Company (“ACE”) at the time of the underlying suit. The\nACE employer’s liability policy provided the “insured” with a $1 million primary\ncoverage limit and a $1 million deductible. As such, it was merely a fronting\npolicy, and the $1 million deductible was considered a self-insured retention.\n       During the relevant time period, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (“CBE”), the\nparent corporation of Cooper,2 carried comprehensive excess liability coverage\nfrom defendant-appellee American International Speciality Lines Insurance\nCompany (“AISLIC”). The AISLIC policy, issued to CBE, covered CBE and over\none hundred worldwide subsidiaries, including Cooper and B-Line, and had an\naggregate limit of $25 million. Significantly, the AISLIC policy provided excess\ncoverage to: (1) the $1 million ACE employer’s liability policy; and (2) a $5\n\n\n       1\n        The policies at issue covered Cooper Industries, Inc., but this case was brought by its\nsuccessor in interest, Cooper Industries, LLC.\n       2\n          CBE is a publicly-traded company engaged in manufacturing, marketing, and sales\nof electrical products and tools.\n\n                                              2\n\f                                    No. 07-20468\n\nmillion self-insured retention for general commercial liability (“GCL”) coverage.\nThus, Cooper maintained employer’s liability coverage from the ACE primary\npolicy with a $1 million deductible and the AISLIC excess policy, and it\nmaintained GCL coverage from the AISLIC excess policy (over and above a self-\ninsured retention of $5 million).\n      On August 19, 2005, AISLIC informed Cooper and B-Line that the claims\nasserted in the underlying suit must be bifurcated relative to each entity’s\nprimary insurance coverage. Specifically, AISLIC admitted that the claims\nasserted against B-Line in the underlying suit are covered by the ACE\nemployer’s liability policy because B-Line was the employer of the decedents.\nThus, after satisfaction of the $1 million deductible, B-Line would be entitled to\nindemnification from AISLIC for any excess employer’s liability. However,\naccording to AISLIC, the claims asserted against Cooper in the underlying suit\nfall under Cooper’s GCL policy, not the ACE employer’s policy. As such, AISLIC\ntook the position that Cooper must satisfy its $5 million self-insured retention\nfor GCL claims to trigger coverage under the AISLIC excess liability policy.\n       The underlying suit was settled for an amount which is confidential.\nCooper and B-Line paid the $1 million agreed upon deductible under the ACE\nemployer’s policy. AISLIC then paid $2.6 million, the additional amount it\nattributed to B-Line’s liability. To finalize the settlement, Cooper and AISLIC\neach agreed to pay half of the remaining amount, $1.35 million—the amount\nthat AISLIC attributed to Cooper as GCL. However, each party funded this\nportion of the settlement with a reservation of its right to recover in later\nproceedings.\n       On March 30, 2006, Cooper and B-Line brought a breach of contract suit\nagainst AISLIC, arguing that they are jointly covered as a single collective\ninsured under the ACE employer’s policy and seeking $683,250—fifty percent of\nthe $1.35 million and ad litem fees that the entities paid in settlement of the\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                                        No. 07-20468\n\nunderlying suit. On July 24, 2006, AISLIC counterclaimed for a declaratory\njudgment that Cooper’s liability in the underlying suit is not covered by the ACE\nemployer’s policy and for reimbursement of its payment of $683,250.\nSubsequently, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n       On May 31, 2007, the district court granted AISLIC’s motion for summary\njudgment after determining that the ACE employer’s policy is not susceptible to\nCooper’s single collective insured interpretation. Specifically, the district court\nreasoned that in order to find that the word “employer” referred to more than\none entity, as Cooper urged, “employer” must be a collective noun. Since\n“employer” is customarily considered a singular noun when standing alone, see\nDICTIONARY OF COLLECTIVE NOUNS AND GROUP TERMS 75–76, 233 (2d ed. 1985)\n(a compendium of more than 1,800 collective nouns, group terms, and phrases\nthat includes the word employee but not employer), the district court concluded\nthat it is unreasonable to construe it as a collective noun here. Then, relying on\nthe legal definition of employer, the district court stated that “the plain meaning\nof the word employer—‘one [entity that] pays the worker’s salary or\nwages’—supports AISLIC’s position that only B-Line, the entity that paid the\ndecedent’s salary,3 is the ‘employer named in [I]tem 1’ of the ACE employer\nliability policy.”4 Because the policy refers to coverage of employees employed by\nan employer,5 the district court determined that “the policy provides coverage\n\n       3\n         See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 565 (8th ed. 2004) (providing that the definition of\nemployer is “a person who controls and directs a worker under an express or implied contract\nof hire and who pays the worker’s salary or wages”).\n       4\n        The General Section of the ACE policy states that the policy “is a contract of insurance\nbetween you (the employer named in Item 1 of the Information Page) and us (the insurer named\non the Information Page).” (Emphasis added).\n       5\n           The relevant coverage provisions state:\n\n                PART TWO - EMPLOYERS LIABILITY INSURANCE\n\n                A.     How This Insurance Applies\n\n                                               4\n\f                                     No. 07-20468\n\nonly to the employer who paid the wages of the employee, not other entities\ncovered under the policy who have their own employees.” Since “the parties\nagree that Cooper [ ] is not the employer of the decedents in the underlying suit,”\nthe district court found “as a matter of law that [Cooper] is not the insured under\nthe ACE employer’s liability policy in the instant action.” In the end, the district\ncourt ordered Cooper to pay AISLIC $683,250. On June 19, 2007, Cooper and\nB-Line filed their notice of appeal.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n      A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, applying the same\nstandard as the district court. Stotter v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, 508 F.3d\n812, 820 (5th Cir. 2007). “A party is entitled to summary judgment only if ‘the\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.’” Id. (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)). The facts are viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion and all\nreasonable inferences are drawn in that party’s favor. Id.\n           A. Coverage Under the ACE Employer’s Liability Policy\n\n\n\n                    This employers liability insurance applies to bodily injury\n                    by accident or bodily injury by disease. Bodily injury\n                    includes resulting death.\n\n                    1.     The bodily injury must arise out of and in the\n                           course of the injured employee’s employment by you.\n\n                                                 ***\n            B.      We will Pay\n                    We will pay all sums you legally must pay as damages\n                    because of bodily injury to your employees, provided the\n                    bodily injury is covered by this Employers Liability\n                    Insurance.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n                                             5\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\n      Cooper argues that the district court erred by denying joint coverage to\nCooper and B-Line under the ACE employer’s liability and the AISLIC excess\nliability policies for the claims asserted against them in the underlying suit.\nCooper maintains that the language in the ACE policy creates a single collective\ninsured—Cooper and its subsidiaries, including B-Line—and that the purpose\nof this structure is to avoid paying multiple deductibles when the parent\ncompany, Cooper, is sued along with one or more of its subsidiaries for liabilities\narising out of the same incident. Thus, Cooper posits that after it satisfied the\nACE primary policy’s $1 million limit, the AISLIC excess policy covers all claims\nagainst both Cooper and B-Line, up to the $25 million limit, which would\nencompass the amount Cooper paid to settle the underlying lawsuit, namely,\n$683,250.\n      AISLIC contends that Cooper’s liability is not covered by the ACE\nemployer’s liability policy because only B-Line, the corporate subsidiary that\nemployed the decedents, is the insured under said policy. Under AISLIC’s\ninterpretation, the ACE employer’s policy only insures an entity for claims\nbrought by that entity’s employees and does not jointly insure all entities for\nclaims by employees of other covered entities. Because the decedents in the\nunderlying suit were employees of B-Line, not Cooper, AISLIC argues that\nCooper must rely on its GCL policy to cover the settlement of the claims asserted\nagainst it. According to AISLIC, since the settlement amount attributable to\nCooper is $1.35 million, which is less than the $5 million deductible under\nCooper’s GCL policy, AISLIC is not obligated to indemnify Cooper. Rather,\nCooper must reimburse AISLIC the amount it paid on behalf of Cooper.\n      In diversity cases, such as this one, federal courts look to the substantive\nlaw of the forum state. Texas Indus., Inc. v. Factory Mut. Ins. Co., 486 F.3d 844,\n846 (5th Cir. 2007). Under Texas law, insurance policies are governed by the\nsame rules of construction that apply to contracts generally. Valmont Energy\n\n                                        6\n\f                                   No. 07-20468\n\nSteel, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 359 F.3d 770, 773 (5th Cir. 2004);\nBalandran v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 972 S.W.2d 738, 740–41 (Tex. 1998). The\nprimary goal is to give effect to the written expression of the parties’ intent. Id.\nat 741. “The terms used in an insurance policy are to be given their ordinary\nand generally accepted meaning, unless the policy shows that the words were\nmeant in a technical or different sense.” Canutillo Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Nat’l\nUnion Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., 99 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing\nSec. Mut. Cas. Co. v. Johnson, 584 S.W.2d 703, 704 (Tex. 1979)). The policy\nshould be considered as a whole so as to give effect and meaning to each part.\nId.; Valmont Energy Steel, Inc., 359 F.3d at 773; see also Balandran, 972 S.W.2d\nat 741 (“We must read all parts of the contract together, . . . striving to give\nmeaning to every sentence, clause, and word to avoid rendering any portion\ninoperative.”).\n      “Texas contract interpretation law indicates that ‘[i]f policy language is\nworded so that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning, it is not\nambiguous and we construe it as a matter of law.’” Texas Indus., Inc., 486 F.3d\nat 846 (quoting Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 157 (Tex.\n2003)). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to\ndecide. Id. “The fact that the parties offer different contract interpretations\ndoes not create an ambiguity.” Id. An ambiguity exists only if the contract\nlanguage is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Id.; Nat’l\nUnion Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520\n(Tex. 1995).      “[I]f a contract of insurance is susceptible of more than one\nreasonable interpretation, we must resolve the uncertainty by adopting the\nconstruction that most favors the insured.”        Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of\nPittsburgh, Pa. v. Hudson Energy Co., 811 S.W.2d 552, 555 (Tex. 1991).\n      As support for its argument that the ACE policy establishes joint coverage,\nCooper points to the fact that the policy lists one “Named Insured,” Cooper\n\n                                         7\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\nIndustries, Inc. (the predecessor to Cooper), and then contains a unique\n“Extension of Named Insured” endorsement that lists all other Cooper entities,\nincluding B-Line, as additional workplaces.         According to Cooper, this\nendorsement creates coverage for the Cooper group of companies as a single,\ncollective insured for claims brought by employees of the Cooper group. Cooper\nhighlights specific provisions and language in the ACE policy that purportedly\nrequire this construction. In particular, the ACE policy: (1) uses the word\n“extension,” to broaden who is to be considered the Named Insured rather than\nto add additional separate insureds; (2) explicitly refers to the subsidiaries as\nCooper’s “other workplaces,” rather than additional corporate entities, additional\nemployers, or additional named insureds; (3) contains no separation of interests\nclause distinguishing Cooper’s subsidiaries from Cooper; and (4) defines “you”\nas “the employer named in Item 1 of the Information Page,” i.e., Cooper, and then\nuses the words “you” and “your” to refer to the insured when describing covered\nclaims throughout the policy. In addition, Cooper argues that case-law supports\nits single collective insured construction. And, although Cooper admits that it\nwas not the decedents’ common law employer, Cooper contends that the lack of\nan employment relationship has no bearing on the issue whether the Extension\nof Named Insured endorsement reasonably creates a single insured entity.\n      According to AISLIC, Cooper misconstrues the Extension of Named\nInsured endorsement to argue that it “extends” coverage to any Cooper entity for\nclaims by any other entities’ employees.         AISLIC argues that Cooper’s\ninterpretation is nonsensical and contrary to the unambiguous policy language.\nFor example, AISLIC points out that under Cooper’s interpretation, Cooper\nPower Tools, Inc. would be covered for claims by Cooper Bussman, Inc.’s\nemployees, since both subsidiaries are listed in the Extension of Named Insured\nendorsement.      AISLIC submits, therefore, that the only reasonable\ninterpretation is that the Extension of Named Insured endorsement merely adds\n\n                                        8\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\nvarious Cooper entities as named insureds to the policy for claims brought\nagainst each Cooper entity by its own employees.\n      Before conducting our review, we note that because Cooper admits that it\nwas not the decedents’ employer, the only issue is whether the policy language\neither unambiguously or reasonably creates a single collective insured, so that\nan employee of any of the covered entities is considered an employee of the single\ncollective insured under the ACE policy. For the following reasons, we agree with\nthe district court’s determination that the ACE employer’s policy does not\nsupport a single insured construction.\n      To begin, the policy is defined in the General Section as a contract of\ninsurance between the insurer and “you (the employer named in Item 1 of the\nInformation Page).” (Emphasis added). The General Section further states that\n“you are insured if you are an employer named in Item 1 of the Information\nPage.” (Emphasis added). Thus, in order to answer the question whether the\npolicy covers a single collective insured, we must determine which entities are\nemployers under Item 1.\n      Item 1 lists the Named Insured as Cooper and provides the corporation’s\nmailing address. Item 1 further states that “[o]ther workplaces not shown\nabove” are located in the “Extension of Named Insured.” As the district court\nnoted, because the phrase “other workplaces not shown above” is what\nreferences the Extension of Named Insured endorsement, the word “Extension”\nin that provision may reasonably refer to workplace locations, which includes\nlocations in thirty-five states, rather than additional corporate entities. Based\non that construction, Cooper and its listed workplace locations would be one\ninsured employer under Item 1, but its listed subsidiaries would be separate\nemployers under Item 1 and thus separate insureds under the ACE policy.\n      The General Section of the policy supports this interpretation by\ndistinguishing workplaces from employers.        Under subsection B “Who is\n\n                                         9\n\f                                      No. 07-20468\n\nInsured,” the policy states “you are insured if you are an employer named in Item\n1 of the information page.” (Emphasis added). Then, under subsection E\n“Locations,” the policy provides coverage to “all of your workplaces listed in Items\n1 or 4 of the Information Page.” (Emphasis added). These provisions reveal that\nthe designations of “employer” and “workplace” are mutually exclusive, that\nworkplaces are a subset of an employer, and that Item 1 of the information page,\nthe Named Insured section, will list them both. The question then becomes\nwhether Cooper’s named subsidiaries are considered employers or workplaces\nof Cooper. If they are employers, they are separate insureds under the policy.\nHowever, if they are workplaces, they are a subset of Cooper, which would\nsupport the theory of a single collective insured.\n       The Named Insured’s reference to “other workplaces not shown above”\noffers guidance. Taken in context, the word “other” seems to indicate that under\nItem 1 on the information page, at least one workplace is shown. See AMERICAN\nHERITAGE DICTIONARY 880 (2d ed. 1982) (defining other as “[b]eing or\ndesignating the remaining ones of several”) (emphasis added). Since Cooper is\nthe only entity listed on that Information Page, and we know that it is an\ninsured employer, “other workplace” must refer to the location, or address,\nprovided for Cooper. Thus, Cooper’s other listed addresses in the Extension of\nNamed Insured endorsement would be Cooper’s other workplaces. However, the\nsubsequent list of legal entities, or subsidiaries, need not be classified as\nCooper’s workplaces, since their listings are not simply enumerated addresses\nof Cooper. Instead, those legal entities are more appropriately considered\nemployers because they, like Cooper, are also capable of having a number of\nworkplace addresses.6         Thus, contrary to Cooper’s theory of coverage, a\n\n\n       6\n         For example, the following subsidiaries have more than one workplace location listed\nin the ACE policy: Cooper B-Line, Cooper Bussman, Cooper Lighting, and Cooper Wiring\nDevices.\n\n                                             10\n\f                                         No. 07-20468\n\nreasonable construction borne out by the policy language is that the subsidiaries\nare employers, like Cooper, and not merely workplaces, or extensions, of Cooper.\n       Moreover, although Cooper relies on the distinction between the meanings\nof the words “extension” and “addition” to bolster its single insured theory,7 the\npolicy’s use of “extension” is also reconcilable with a separate insured\nconstruction. The word Extension is used in the phrase “Extension of Named\nInsured” and each page of the Extension is entitled “ITEM 1 OF THE\nINFORMATION PAGE IS EXTENDED AS FOLLOWS.” Notably, “extension”\nin both those phrases refers to the heading from the information page, i.e., “Item\n1. Named Insured,” and not to the employer listed under “Item 1. Named\nInsured” on the information page, which would be Cooper. Thus, considering\nthat the “Item 1. Named Insured” section on the information page only provides\nenough space to include one employer and its mailing address, the Extension\nwas likely incorporated to extend that section and provide space for a complete\nlist of employers to be included as Named Insureds under the policy. This\ninterpretation accords with one of Cooper’s suggested definitions of the word\n“extend,” as “to cause to be of greater area or volume.” (Emphasis added).\nConsequently, the “Extension of Named Insured” endorsement does not\nnecessarily support Cooper’s argument that Cooper is the single insured under\nthe policy and its subsidiaries are mere extensions of it.\n       Additionally, at least two provisions of the policy indicate that there is\nmore than one insured covered. First, in the general section, it states, “You are\ninsured if you are an employer named in Item 1 of the Information Page.”\n\n\n\n       7\n         Cooper informs the court that the dictionary definition of “extension” is “the act of\nextending; state of being extended; an enlargement in scope or operation,” and that the\ndefinition of “extend” is “to spread or stretch forth . . . to stretch out to fullest length . . . to\ncause to be of greater area or volume . . . to increase the scope, meaning, or application of.”\nThus, Cooper contends that the words “extension” and “extend” refer to “the broadening of an\nitem rather than the addition of a separate item.” (Emphasis added).\n\n                                                11\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\n(Emphasis added). The words “an employer” signify that there is more than one\nemployer listed in that section. Second, in “Part Six—Conditions,” the policy\nexplains that the “Sole Representative” is “[t]he insured first named in Item 1 of\nthe Information Page [who] will act on behalf of all insureds to change the policy,\nreceive return premium, and give or receive notice of cancellation.” (Emphasis\nadded).\n      In short, by reading its provisions in context and giving effect to all parts,\nthe ACE employer’s policy is reasonably interpreted as treating Cooper’s\nsubsidiaries as separate additional insureds.       Therefore, we next consider\nwhether the separate additional insured theory is the only reasonable\ninterpretation of the policy language or whether Cooper’s single insured theory\nis also reasonable, thereby creating an ambiguity in the ACE policy.\n      Cooper cites Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Holland-American Insurance Co.\nas support for the reasonableness of its single insured construction. 671 S.W.2d\n829 (Tenn. 1984).     The Supreme Court of Tennessee determined in Blue\nDiamond that, under the insurance policies issued to the parent company in that\ncase, it would be reasonable to infer that the parties intended to treat the parent\ncompany and its two subsidiary corporations as one insured entity indemnified\nagainst liability to employees of any one of its three companies. Id. at 834. The\ncourt noted that the insurance policies’ use of the word “employer” in the phrase\nlimiting liability coverage to an “employee in the immediate service of the\nemployer” created a latent ambiguity in the policy because of the “ambiguous\nstate of extrinsic circumstances” to which that word referred. Id. at 833. These\nextrinsic circumstances included that the parent company functioned as a mere\nholding company for its two subsidiaries, that the parent company and its two\nsubsidiaries had identical directors and officers, and that the named insured in\nthe policy listed all three entities joined by the words “and/or.” Id. at 830–33.\nThe Blue Diamond court concluded that the policy could reasonably be read to\n\n                                        12\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\ninsure all three companies as a single entity or that it could be interpreted as\nextending coverage only to the corporate entity whose employees were injured\nin its immediate service. Id. at 834. Consequently, that court reversed and\nremanded the case to the trial court, stating that it was “not a proper case for\ndisposition on motions for summary judgment.” Id. at 835.\n      Although Cooper’s theory of coverage is the same as that in Blue Diamond,\nnamely, that the parties intended to create a single insured entity composed of\nthe parent company and its subsidiaries, Blue Diamond’s “ambiguous state of\nextrinsic circumstances” is not present in Cooper’s case. First, Cooper does not\nmaintain that its parent companies and subsidiaries all have the same officers\nand directors. Second, Cooper has not alleged that it is merely a holding\ncompany for all of its subsidiaries. Third, the Named Insured section in the ACE\npolicy lists Cooper and its subsidiaries separately, rather than connected by the\nphrase “and/or.” Fourth and most significantly, Cooper has six times as many\nsubsidiaries listed in its insurance policy as the parent company had in Blue\nDiamond. As such, it is far less reasonable to infer that the parties in the case\nat bar intended to cover a total of thirteen separate legal entities, five of which\nhave more than one workplace, as a single insured, without ever saying so\nexplicitly. Thus, Cooper’s case does not accord with Blue Diamond and the\nreasoning of the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n      Cooper also relies on Texas automobile insurance cases to argue that the\nabsence of a severability clause in the ACE policy is consistent with a collective\ninsured construction. However, these cases are sufficiently dissimilar and would\nnot be controlling in Cooper’s case. Specifically, the Texas cases consider\nwhether a provision that excludes coverage for claims by the insured’s employees\nwould also exclude coverage for claims by the insured’s employees against the\nnon-employer omnibus insured. In the earliest cited case, American Fidelity &\nCasualty Co. v. St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity, this court determined that, absent\n\n                                        13\n\f                                        No. 07-20468\n\na severability of interests clause, the employee exclusion applied not only to the\nnamed insured, but also to the omnibus insured, thereby excluding coverage\nunder the policy. 248 F.2d 509, 516–18 (5th Cir. 1957). Significantly, though,\nin St. Paul-Mercury, this court noted the difference between automobile\ninsurance, or public liability coverage, and employer’s liability coverage, stating\nthat “[t]he two present different hazards of frequency and severity and\ntraditionally are underwritten separately.” Id. at 516 (emphasis added). Thus,\ncases considering the effect of exclusionary provisions under automobile policies\nare poor precedent for cases, like Cooper’s, considering coverage provisions under\nemployer’s liability policies.8\n       Moreover, there are persuasive employer liability cases from other states\nconsidering the effect of the same employer coverage language on multiple\ninsureds. For example, in Kenosha Beef International v. North River Insurance\nCo., the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin held that the parent and subsidiary\ncompanies were separate insureds and liability under the employer’s liability\npolicy could not be premised upon an employee of one insured suing another\ninsured. 445 N.W.2d 703, 706 (Wis. Ct. App. 1984). In that case, the policy\nlisted, as insureds, the parent company and two wholly-owned subsidiaries of\nthe parent. Id. at 705. First, the court determined that the plain language of\n\n\n       8\n         However, even if those automobile insurance cases were controlling, the reasoning in\nthe later cases, such as Float-Away Door Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., 372 F.2d 701, 708\n(5th Cir. 1966), would not support Cooper’s theory. In Float-Away Door, this court determined\nthat an employee exclusion in an automobile policy lacking a severability clause would not\napply to all insureds collectively. Id. at 708–09. In making that determination, this court\nstated: “The better reasoned cases adopt a restrictive interpretation of the insured as referring\nonly to the party seeking coverage under the policy.” Id. at 708 (emphasis added and citations\nomitted); see also Commercial Standard Ins. Co. v. Am. Gen. Ins., 455 S.W.2d 720, 720 (Tex.\n1970) (stating that even before the addition of the severability of interests provision, “there\nwas substantial authority in support of the construction that the rights of each insured under\nthe policy are to be determined as if there were no other person protected thereby”).\nConsequently, even in the absence of a severability clause, the restrictive reading approach\nfrom Float-Away Door would suggest that this court treat each “insured” in the ACE\nemployer’s policy separately from the other insureds under the policy.\n\n                                              14\n\f                                   No. 07-20468\n\nthe policy recognized that the companies were separate insureds, citing, in\nparticular, the following provision from that policy:\n\n              The insured first named in item 1 of the Information\n              Page will act on behalf of all insureds to change this\n              policy . . . .\n\nId. Second, the Kenosha Beef case discussed the applicable policy language,\nwhich covered damages because of bodily injury to “your employee that arises\nout of and in the course of employment, claimed against you . . . .” Id. at 704–05.\nBecause the parent company’s construction permitting claims by an employee\nof one insured against another insured would have interpreted the pronouns\n“you” and “your” in that provision to have different meanings in different places\nwithin the same paragraph, without a change in antecedent, the court\ndetermined the parent company’s construction was unreasonable. Id. at 705.\nThat case concluded with this statement:\n              We reiterate that this policy is one for worker’s\n              compensation and employers’ liability only. Because\n              [the parent company] was not [the injured plaintiff’s]\n              employer, coverage was more appropriately provided\n              through its comprehensive general liability carrier, . . .\n              including [the parent corporation’s] retained limit . . .\n              under that policy.\n\nId. at 706.\n      The Cooper case is strikingly similar to Kenosha Beef. Both policies\ninclude worker’s compensation and employer’s liability coverage. The same\ncoverage language is at issue. And the employer’s policy in this case contains\nthe identical provision that was cited in Kenosha Beef for its plain recognition\nof separate additional insureds under the policy there. Thus, although the\nKenosha Beef case did not deal with an Extension of Named Insured\nendorsement, the facts are sufficiently similar to be persuasive precedent for this\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\ncourt. See also Producers Dairy Delivery Co., Inc. v. Sentry Ins. Co., 718 P.2d\n920, 922, 925–26 (Cal. 1986) (holding that an employer’s liability policy that\ncovered the insured and a closely related corporation and that indemnified for\ndamages sustained “by an employee of the insured arising out of and in the\ncourse of his employment” did not extend coverage to the insured for an injury\nsuffered by the employee of the closely related corporation).\n      Furthermore, as the district court noted in its order, it is well-established\nunder Texas law that, absent exceptional circumstances, parent and subsidiary\ncorporations are recognized separate entities. Valero S. Tex. Processing Co. v.\nStarr County Appraisal Dist., 954 S.W.2d 863, 866 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n1997, pet. denied) (“In Texas, for the purposes of legal proceedings, subsidiary\ncorporations and parent corporations are separate and distinct ‘persons’ as a\nmatter of law; the separate entity of corporations will be observed by the courts\neven in instances where one may dominate or control, or may even treat it as a\nmere department, instrumentality, or agency of the other.”); see also Sims v. W.\nWaste Indus., 918 S.W.2d 682, 684 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1996, writ denied)\n(finding Texas law does not allow a parent corporation to assert Worker’s\nCompensation immunity through its subsidiary’s immunity by means of reverse\npiercing because the parent and corporation are separate legal entities).\nAccordingly, we agree with the district court that Cooper’s single collective\ninsured construction is unreasonable—the plain language of the ACE employer’s\npolicy only covers the claims of the decedents’ representatives against the\ndecedents’ employer B-Line, not B-Line’s parent company, Cooper.\n                        B. Allocation of the Settlement\n      Alternatively, Cooper argues that even if the ACE employer’s policy only\ncovers B-Line’s exposure, the district court still erred by failing to address the\nissue of allocation and granting AISLIC summary judgment for the full amount\nthat it paid allegedly on behalf of Cooper. According to Cooper, although the\n\n                                        16\n\f                                    No. 07-20468\n\nparties each agreed to pay half of the disputed $1.35 million in order to settle the\nunderlying case, Cooper never agreed that this amount should be attributed to\nCooper as opposed to B-Line. Instead, Cooper submits that AISLIC unilaterally\nallocated the entire $1.35 million to Cooper’s potential liability. Thus, Cooper\ncontends that a genuine issue of material fact exists precluding summary\njudgment on this issue. In response, AISLIC asserts that the district court did\nnot review the allocation of the $1.35 million from the underlying settlement\nbecause: (1) Cooper did not affirmatively request a judicial determination of the\nallocation in its pleadings; and (2) the proper allocation was already established\nby the parties’ letter agreement.\n      We find that Cooper’s complaint sufficiently raised the issue of allocation.\n“The notice pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and case\nlaw do not require an inordinate amount of detail or precision.” St. Paul\nMercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 434 (5th Cir. 2000); see FED. R.\nCIV. P. 8 (“A pleading . . . must contain . . . a short and plain statement of the\nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief . . . .”). “The function of a\ncomplaint is to give the defendant fair notice of the plaintiff's claim and the\ngrounds upon which the plaintiff relies.” Id. (citing Doss v. S. Cent. Bell Tel.\nCo., 834 F.2d 421, 424 (5th Cir. 1987)). And the “form of the complaint is not\nsignificant if it alleges facts upon which relief can be granted, even if it fails to\ncategorize correctly the legal theory giving rise to the claim.” Id. (quoting\nDussouy v. Gulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 604 (5th Cir. 1981)).\n      Here, the standard was satisfied because in Texas the segregation of\ninsurance settlement amounts between covered and uncovered claims is based\non the doctrine of concurrent causes. Comsys Info. Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Twin, 130\nS.W.3d 181, 198 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied). Under that\ndoctrine, when covered and non-covered perils combine to create a loss, the\ninsured is entitled to recover that portion of the damage caused solely by the\n\n                                         17\n\f                                       No. 07-20468\n\ncovered peril. Id. Significantly, the doctrine “embod[ies] the basic principle that\ninsureds are not entitled to recover under their insurance policies unless they\nprove their damage is covered by the policy.” Id. Thus, the allocation of an\ninsurance settlement between covered and non-covered claims coincides with the\ninsured’s burden to prove coverage under the policy and damages from the\ninsurer’s breach of that policy and is not a separate theory of recovery that must\nbe affirmatively pled. Cf. id. (“The doctrine of concurrent causation is not an\naffirmative defense or an avoidance issue.”). Therefore, Cooper’s complaint\nsufficiently raised the issue of allocation by seeking damages from AISLIC for\nallegedly breaching its insurance policy with B-Line, the covered entity, and\nCooper, the (potentially) uncovered entity, when AISLIC refused to pay the total\ndifference between the underlying settlement amount and the agreed upon $1\nmillion deductible.9\n       Moreover, we note, Cooper argued in its briefs to the district court, on at\nleast two separate occasions, that the allocation of liability and settlement\namounts between Cooper and B-Line is a disputed issue of material fact,\nprecluding summary judgment. See Vogel v. Veneman, 276 F.3d 729, 733 (5th\nCir. 2002) (“Except in cases of extraordinary circumstances, we do not consider\nissues raised for the first time on appeal. A party must have raised an argument\nto such a degree that the trial court may rule on it.”) (internal citations and\nquotations omitted). Consequently, the issue of allocation was adequately\nraised, and we may consider it on appeal.\n\n\n       9\n         Furthermore, we note that AISLIC had fair notice from the beginning of the suit\nthrough the discovery period that Cooper disagreed with the allocation of the settlement\nbetween Cooper and B-Line. In particular, Cooper’s complaint twice stated that AISLIC only\npaid the portion of the settlement that it, alone, attributed to B-Line’s liability exposure. A\nfurther review of the record also reveals that many of Cooper’s discovery requests centered on\nAISLIC’s apportionment of the settlement. And, finally, AISLIC, in its own counterclaim,\nadmitted to paying the settlement amount that it, not Cooper, attributed to B-Line’s liability\nexposure.\n\n                                              18\n\f                                   No. 07-20468\n\n      Nor are we persuaded that the district court did not address\napportionment because Cooper had agreed with attributing $1.35 million of the\nsettlement to its potential liability in the parties’ letter agreement. We first note\nthat the district court could not have relied on the letter agreement in granting\nsummary judgment to AISLIC because AISLIC neither mentioned it in any of\nits summary judgment briefs, nor otherwise included it as part of its summary\njudgment evidence. Additionally, Cooper never consented to AISLIC’s allocation\nof liability in that letter. Instead, Cooper only agreed to pay the $1 million\ndeductible under the ACE employer’s liability policy. Beyond that, the letter\nexplicitly states that there “remains a dispute” and that Cooper “reserve[s] all\nof [its] rights and nothing in this agreement shall constitute an admission\nagainst interest.” And while the letter provides that “Cooper and AIGDC [the\nparent company of AISLIC] will each fund approximately $700,000 above the\nundisputed $3.6 million,” it does not state that one party may recover only the\nexact amount it paid, but that each party may recover an amount “up to\n$700,000.” (Emphasis added). Thus, the letter reveals that the parties clearly\ncontemplated the possibility of a lesser recovery. In short, Cooper reserved its\nright to argue that an allocation of the disputed settlement amount—$1.35\nmillion—is required.\n      Nonetheless, in the context of summary judgment, “where the non-movant\nbears the burden of proof at trial, the movant may merely point to an absence\nof evidence, thus shifting to the non-movant the burden of demonstrating by\ncompetent summary judgment proof that there is an issue of material fact\nwarranting trial.” Lindsey v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 16 F.3d 616, 618 (5th Cir.\n1994). In this case, although the insurer, AISLIC, counterclaimed seeking\nreimbursement for the amount it attributed to and paid on behalf of Cooper’s\nalleged liability exposure, AISLIC does not bear the burden of proving the proper\nallocation of damages between the covered entity, B-Line, and the uncovered\n\n                                         19\n\f                                     No. 07-20468\n\nentity, Cooper, in order to recover. In an insurance coverage dispute, the\ninsureds, Cooper and B-Line, bear that burden. See Winn v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 494\nS.W.2d 601, 606 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1973, no writ) (“The burden of apportioning\ndamages between coverage and non-coverage is on the insured.”). Thus, when\nAISLIC asserted in its motion for summary judgment that the allocation of $1.35\nmillion to Cooper’s liability was undisputed by the parties, Cooper was required\nto provide some evidence that this allocation was in fact disputed, and that the\nportion of settlement damages attributable to Cooper is less than $1.35 million,\nor alternatively, that B-Line’s liability exposure exceeds the undisputed $3.6\nmillion already apportioned to it.\n      In Cooper’s response to AISLIC’s motion for summary judgment, Cooper\npresented the district court with the declaration of Ryan Chadwick, a senior\nlitigation counsel member for Cooper, who negotiated the agreement with\nAISLIC and allegedly has first-hand knowledge of the parties’ agreement.10\nChadwick stated:\n             Cooper never agreed with either the underlying\n             plaintiffs or with AISLIC as to the allocation between\n             Cooper Industries and [ ] B-Line regarding the amounts\n             paid to settle the underlying case. In fact, Cooper\n             believed that most, if not all, of the liability in the case\n             was [ ] B-Line’s and that [ ] B-Line’s potential exposure\n             was $5.1 million.        Cooper believed that Cooper\n             Industries had little, if any, real liability exposure but\n             entered the settlement because of the prospect of\n             continued, protracted and unpredictable litigation.\n\n(Emphasis added). Cooper also included as summary judgment evidence the\nThird Amended Petition from the underlying suit, which was the live pleading\nbefore settlement. That petition set forth the various allegations asserted\n\n\n      10\n         In the district court, AISLIC moved to strike Chadwick’s declaration as improper\nsummary judgment evidence. Because the district court did not rely on the declaration, it\ndeclared the issue moot. AISLIC has refrained from making the same argument on appeal.\n\n                                           20\n\f                                    No. 07-20468\n\nagainst Cooper and B-Line, as well as all facts and grounds in support of those\nclaims. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant\nCooper, we conclude that a genuine fact issue exists as to the proper allocation.\nSee Enserch Corp. v. Shand Morahan & Co., Inc., 952 F.2d 1485, 1494 (5th Cir.\n1992) (explaining that there were several possible sources available in allocating\nclaimant’s damages such as the allegations contained in the complaint in the\nunderlying lawsuit, the facts that would have been the subject of the lawsuit had\nit been tried, and the settlement itself). As such, we reverse the summary\njudgment with respect to damages, namely, the district court’s order that Cooper\npay AISLIC $683,250, and remand so that the district court can properly allocate\nthe $1.35 million settlement amount between B-Line and Cooper.\n      On remand, if the district court can “apportion damages solely by applying\nthe terms of the settlement, then the decision would be one of law, not requiring\na jury.”11 Id. at 1495 (emphasis in original). Or, if the “allegations alone could\nsufficiently justify an allocation of damages. . . . the [district court can] compare\nthe insurance contract with the complaint and determine as a matter of law\nwhat portion of the damages were covered.” Id. at 1494.\n             [But] [i]f the apportionment cannot be made as a\n             matter of legal interpretation of either the allegations\n             in the complaint or the settlement agreement itself,\n             then the trial court will have to call a jury to allocate\n             damages through the most limited trial it considers\n             necessary . . . . The jury can consider any facts that\n             could have been considered in the underlying lawsuit\n             itself. The trial court, of course, will have considerable\n             leeway in deciding what facts are truly relevant to the\n             apportionment decision, and can thereby (we hope)\n             prevent a full-blown retrial of the [underlying] law suit.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        We note that the underlying settlement agreement with the representatives of the\ndecedents was neither found in the record nor provided on appeal.\n\n                                          21\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\nId. at 1495 (addressing the apportionment of a settlement between covered and\nuncovered losses under an insurance policy).\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s holding with\nrespect to coverage under the employer’s liability policy, but we VACATE the\ndistrict court’s judgment and remand for allocation of liability. Each party shall\nbear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f",

We affirm the district\ncourt’s holding with respect to coverage under the employer’s liability policy, but\nwe vacate the district court’s judgment and remand for determination of the\nallocation of liability.\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In October 2004, two employees of Cooper B-Line, Inc. (“B-Line”) were\nkilled in the course and scope of their employment at a B-Line plant in Texas.\nSubsequently, representatives of the two decedents sued B-Line and its parent\ncorporation, Cooper Industries, LLC (“Cooper”), asserting various negligence and\ngross negligence claims against both entities (the “underlying suit”). Cooper and\nB-Line timely submitted the claims of the underlying suit to their employer’s\nliability insurer and excess liability insurer.1 Cooper and its subsidiaries,\nincluding B-Line, carried primary employer’s liability insurance from ACE\nAmerican Insurance Company (“ACE”) at the time of the underlying suit. The\nACE employer’s liability policy provided the “insured” with a $1 million primary\ncoverage limit and a $1 million deductible. As such, it was merely a fronting\npolicy, and the $1 million deductible was considered a self-insured retention.\n       During the relevant time period, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (“CBE”), the\nparent corporation of Cooper,2 carried comprehensive excess liability coverage\nfrom defendant-appellee American International Speciality Lines Insurance\nCompany (“AISLIC”). The AISLIC policy, issued to CBE, covered CBE and over\none hundred worldwide subsidiaries, including Cooper and B-Line, and had an\naggregate limit of $25 million. Significantly, the AISLIC policy provided excess\ncoverage to: (1) the $1 million ACE employer’s liability policy; and (2) a $5\n\n\n       1\n        The policies at issue covered Cooper Industries, Inc., but this case was brought by its\nsuccessor in interest, Cooper Industries, LLC.\n       2\n          CBE is a publicly-traded company engaged in manufacturing, marketing, and sales\nof electrical products and tools.\n\n                                              2\n\f                                    No. 07-20468\n\nmillion self-insured retention for general commercial liability (“GCL”) coverage.\nThus, Cooper maintained employer’s liability coverage from the ACE primary\npolicy with a $1 million deductible and the AISLIC excess policy, and it\nmaintained GCL coverage from the AISLIC excess policy (over and above a self-\ninsured retention of $5 million).\n      On August 19, 2005, AISLIC informed Cooper and B-Line that the claims\nasserted in the underlying suit must be bifurcated relative to each entity’s\nprimary insurance coverage. Specifically, AISLIC admitted that the claims\nasserted against B-Line in the underlying suit are covered by the ACE\nemployer’s liability policy because B-Line was the employer of the decedents.\nThus, after satisfaction of the $1 million deductible, B-Line would be entitled to\nindemnification from AISLIC for any excess employer’s liability. However,\naccording to AISLIC, the claims asserted against Cooper in the underlying suit\nfall under Cooper’s GCL policy, not the ACE employer’s policy. As such, AISLIC\ntook the position that Cooper must satisfy its $5 million self-insured retention\nfor GCL claims to trigger coverage under the AISLIC excess liability policy.\n       The underlying suit was settled for an amount which is confidential.\nCooper and B-Line paid the $1 million agreed upon deductible under the ACE\nemployer’s policy. AISLIC then paid $2.6 million, the additional amount it\nattributed to B-Line’s liability. To finalize the settlement, Cooper and AISLIC\neach agreed to pay half of the remaining amount, $1.35 million—the amount\nthat AISLIC attributed to Cooper as GCL. However, each party funded this\nportion of the settlement with a reservation of its right to recover in later\nproceedings.\n       On March 30, 2006, Cooper and B-Line brought a breach of contract suit\nagainst AISLIC, arguing that they are jointly covered as a single collective\ninsured under the ACE employer’s policy and seeking $683,250—fifty percent of\nthe $1.35 million and ad litem fees that the entities paid in settlement of the\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                                        No. 07-20468\n\nunderlying suit. On July 24, 2006, AISLIC counterclaimed for a declaratory\njudgment that Cooper’s liability in the underlying suit is not covered by the ACE\nemployer’s policy and for reimbursement of its payment of $683,250.\nSubsequently, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n       On May 31, 2007, the district court granted AISLIC’s motion for summary\njudgment after determining that the ACE employer’s policy is not susceptible to\nCooper’s single collective insured interpretation. Specifically, the district court\nreasoned that in order to find that the word “employer” referred to more than\none entity, as Cooper urged, “employer” must be a collective noun. Since\n“employer” is customarily considered a singular noun when standing alone, see\nDICTIONARY OF COLLECTIVE NOUNS AND GROUP TERMS 75–76, 233 (2d ed. 1985)\n(a compendium of more than 1,800 collective nouns, group terms, and phrases\nthat includes the word employee but not employer), the district court concluded\nthat it is unreasonable to construe it as a collective noun here. Then, relying on\nthe legal definition of employer, the district court stated that “the plain meaning\nof the word employer—‘one [entity that] pays the worker’s salary or\nwages’—supports AISLIC’s position that only B-Line, the entity that paid the\ndecedent’s salary,3 is the ‘employer named in [I]tem 1’ of the ACE employer\nliability policy.”4 Because the policy refers to coverage of employees employed by\nan employer,5 the district court determined that “the policy provides coverage\n\n       3\n         See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 565 (8th ed. 2004) (providing that the definition of\nemployer is “a person who controls and directs a worker under an express or implied contract\nof hire and who pays the worker’s salary or wages”).\n       4\n        The General Section of the ACE policy states that the policy “is a contract of insurance\nbetween you (the employer named in Item 1 of the Information Page) and us (the insurer named\non the Information Page).” (Emphasis added).\n       5\n           The relevant coverage provisions state:\n\n                PART TWO - EMPLOYERS LIABILITY INSURANCE\n\n                A.     How This Insurance Applies\n\n                                               4\n\f                                     No. 07-20468\n\nonly to the employer who paid the wages of the employee, not other entities\ncovered under the policy who have their own employees.” Since “the parties\nagree that Cooper [ ] is not the employer of the decedents in the underlying suit,”\nthe district court found “as a matter of law that [Cooper] is not the insured under\nthe ACE employer’s liability policy in the instant action.” In the end, the district\ncourt ordered Cooper to pay AISLIC $683,250. On June 19, 2007, Cooper and\nB-Line filed their notice of appeal.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n      A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, applying the same\nstandard as the district court. Stotter v.

Thus, Cooper posits that after it satisfied the\nACE primary policy’s $1 million limit, the AISLIC excess policy covers all claims\nagainst both Cooper and B-Line, up to the $25 million limit, which would\nencompass the amount Cooper paid to settle the underlying lawsuit, namely,\n$683,250.\n      AISLIC contends that Cooper’s liability is not covered by the ACE\nemployer’s liability policy because only B-Line, the corporate subsidiary that\nemployed the decedents, is the insured under said policy. Under AISLIC’s\ninterpretation, the ACE employer’s policy only insures an entity for claims\nbrought by that entity’s employees and does not jointly insure all entities for\nclaims by employees of other covered entities. Because the decedents in the\nunderlying suit were employees of B-Line, not Cooper, AISLIC argues that\nCooper must rely on its GCL policy to cover the settlement of the claims asserted\nagainst it. According to AISLIC, since the settlement amount attributable to\nCooper is $1.35 million, which is less than the $5 million deductible under\nCooper’s GCL policy, AISLIC is not obligated to indemnify Cooper. Rather,\nCooper must reimburse AISLIC the amount it paid on behalf of Cooper.\n      In diversity cases, such as this one, federal courts look to the substantive\nlaw of the forum state.

(the predecessor to Cooper), and then contains a unique\n“Extension of Named Insured” endorsement that lists all other Cooper entities,\nincluding B-Line, as additional workplaces.         According to Cooper, this\nendorsement creates coverage for the Cooper group of companies as a single,\ncollective insured for claims brought by employees of the Cooper group. Cooper\nhighlights specific provisions and language in the ACE policy that purportedly\nrequire this construction. In particular, the ACE policy: (1) uses the word\n“extension,” to broaden who is to be considered the Named Insured rather than\nto add additional separate insureds; (2) explicitly refers to the subsidiaries as\nCooper’s “other workplaces,” rather than additional corporate entities, additional\nemployers, or additional named insureds; (3) contains no separation of interests\nclause distinguishing Cooper’s subsidiaries from Cooper; and (4) defines “you”\nas “the employer named in Item 1 of the Information Page,” i.e., Cooper, and then\nuses the words “you” and “your” to refer to the insured when describing covered\nclaims throughout the policy. In addition, Cooper argues that case-law supports\nits single collective insured construction. And, although Cooper admits that it\nwas not the decedents’ common law employer, Cooper contends that the lack of\nan employment relationship has no bearing on the issue whether the Extension\nof Named Insured endorsement reasonably creates a single insured entity.\n      According to AISLIC, Cooper misconstrues the Extension of Named\nInsured endorsement to argue that it “extends” coverage to any Cooper entity for\nclaims by any other entities’ employees.         AISLIC argues that Cooper’s\ninterpretation is nonsensical and contrary to the unambiguous policy language.\nFor example, AISLIC points out that under Cooper’s interpretation, Cooper\nPower Tools, Inc. would be covered for claims by Cooper Bussman, Inc.’s\nemployees, since both subsidiaries are listed in the Extension of Named Insured\nendorsement.      AISLIC submits, therefore, that the only reasonable\ninterpretation is that the Extension of Named Insured endorsement merely adds\n\n                                        8\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\nvarious Cooper entities as named insureds to the policy for claims brought\nagainst each Cooper entity by its own employees.\n      Before conducting our review, we note that because Cooper admits that it\nwas not the decedents’ employer, the only issue is whether the policy language\neither unambiguously or reasonably creates a single collective insured, so that\nan employee of any of the covered entities is considered an employee of the single\ncollective insured under the ACE policy. For the following reasons, we agree with\nthe district court’s determination that the ACE employer’s policy does not\nsupport a single insured construction.\n      To begin, the policy is defined in the General Section as a contract of\ninsurance between the insurer and “you (the employer named in Item 1 of the\nInformation Page).” (Emphasis added). The General Section further states that\n“you are insured if you are an employer named in Item 1 of the Information\nPage.” (Emphasis added). Thus, in order to answer the question whether the\npolicy covers a single collective insured, we must determine which entities are\nemployers under Item 1.\n      Item 1 lists the Named Insured as Cooper and provides the corporation’s\nmailing address. Item 1 further states that “[o]ther workplaces not shown\nabove” are located in the “Extension of Named Insured.” As the district court\nnoted, because the phrase “other workplaces not shown above” is what\nreferences the Extension of Named Insured endorsement, the word “Extension”\nin that provision may reasonably refer to workplace locations, which includes\nlocations in thirty-five states, rather than additional corporate entities. Based\non that construction, Cooper and its listed workplace locations would be one\ninsured employer under Item 1, but its listed subsidiaries would be separate\nemployers under Item 1 and thus separate insureds under the ACE policy.\n      The General Section of the policy supports this interpretation by\ndistinguishing workplaces from employers.        Under subsection B “Who is\n\n                                         9\n\f                                      No. 07-20468\n\nInsured,” the policy states “you are insured if you are an employer named in Item\n1 of the information page.” (Emphasis added). Then, under subsection E\n“Locations,” the policy provides coverage to “all of your workplaces listed in Items\n1 or 4 of the Information Page.” (Emphasis added). These provisions reveal that\nthe designations of “employer” and “workplace” are mutually exclusive, that\nworkplaces are a subset of an employer, and that Item 1 of the information page,\nthe Named Insured section, will list them both. The question then becomes\nwhether Cooper’s named subsidiaries are considered employers or workplaces\nof Cooper. If they are employers, they are separate insureds under the policy.\nHowever, if they are workplaces, they are a subset of Cooper, which would\nsupport the theory of a single collective insured.\n       The Named Insured’s reference to “other workplaces not shown above”\noffers guidance. Taken in context, the word “other” seems to indicate that under\nItem 1 on the information page, at least one workplace is shown. See AMERICAN\nHERITAGE DICTIONARY 880 (2d ed. 1982) (defining other as “[b]eing or\ndesignating the remaining ones of several”) (emphasis added). Since Cooper is\nthe only entity listed on that Information Page, and we know that it is an\ninsured employer, “other workplace” must refer to the location, or address,\nprovided for Cooper. Thus, Cooper’s other listed addresses in the Extension of\nNamed Insured endorsement would be Cooper’s other workplaces. However, the\nsubsequent list of legal entities, or subsidiaries, need not be classified as\nCooper’s workplaces, since their listings are not simply enumerated addresses\nof Cooper. Instead, those legal entities are more appropriately considered\nemployers because they, like Cooper, are also capable of having a number of\nworkplace addresses.6         Thus, contrary to Cooper’s theory of coverage, a\n\n\n       6\n         For example, the following subsidiaries have more than one workplace location listed\nin the ACE policy: Cooper B-Line, Cooper Bussman, Cooper Lighting, and Cooper Wiring\nDevices.\n\n                                             10\n\f                                         No. 07-20468\n\nreasonable construction borne out by the policy language is that the subsidiaries\nare employers, like Cooper, and not merely workplaces, or extensions, of Cooper.\n       Moreover, although Cooper relies on the distinction between the meanings\nof the words “extension” and “addition” to bolster its single insured theory,7 the\npolicy’s use of “extension” is also reconcilable with a separate insured\nconstruction. The word Extension is used in the phrase “Extension of Named\nInsured” and each page of the Extension is entitled “ITEM 1 OF THE\nINFORMATION PAGE IS EXTENDED AS FOLLOWS.” Notably, “extension”\nin both those phrases refers to the heading from the information page, i.e., “Item\n1. Named Insured,” and not to the employer listed under “Item 1. Named\nInsured” on the information page, which would be Cooper. Thus, considering\nthat the “Item 1. Named Insured” section on the information page only provides\nenough space to include one employer and its mailing address, the Extension\nwas likely incorporated to extend that section and provide space for a complete\nlist of employers to be included as Named Insureds under the policy. This\ninterpretation accords with one of Cooper’s suggested definitions of the word\n“extend,” as “to cause to be of greater area or volume.” (Emphasis added).\nConsequently, the “Extension of Named Insured” endorsement does not\nnecessarily support Cooper’s argument that Cooper is the single insured under\nthe policy and its subsidiaries are mere extensions of it.\n       Additionally, at least two provisions of the policy indicate that there is\nmore than one insured covered. First, in the general section, it states, “You are\ninsured if you are an employer named in Item 1 of the Information Page.”\n\n\n\n       7\n         Cooper informs the court that the dictionary definition of “extension” is “the act of\nextending; state of being extended; an enlargement in scope or operation,” and that the\ndefinition of “extend” is “to spread or stretch forth . . . to stretch out to fullest length . . . to\ncause to be of greater area or volume . . . to increase the scope, meaning, or application of.”\nThus, Cooper contends that the words “extension” and “extend” refer to “the broadening of an\nitem rather than the addition of a separate item.” (Emphasis added).\n\n                                                11\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\n(Emphasis added). The words “an employer” signify that there is more than one\nemployer listed in that section. Second, in “Part Six—Conditions,” the policy\nexplains that the “Sole Representative” is “[t]he insured first named in Item 1 of\nthe Information Page [who] will act on behalf of all insureds to change the policy,\nreceive return premium, and give or receive notice of cancellation.” (Emphasis\nadded).\n      In short, by reading its provisions in context and giving effect to all parts,\nthe ACE employer’s policy is reasonably interpreted as treating Cooper’s\nsubsidiaries as separate additional insureds.       Therefore, we next consider\nwhether the separate additional insured theory is the only reasonable\ninterpretation of the policy language or whether Cooper’s single insured theory\nis also reasonable, thereby creating an ambiguity in the ACE policy.\n      Cooper cites Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Holland-American Insurance Co.\nas support for the reasonableness of its single insured construction. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2367238\"><a href=\"/opinion/2367238/blue-diamond-coal-v-holland-america-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1984).     The Supreme Court of Tennessee determined in Blue\nDiamond that, under the insurance policies issued to the parent company in that\ncase, it would be reasonable to infer that the parties intended to treat the parent\ncompany and its two subsidiary corporations as one insured entity indemnified\nagainst liability to employees of any one of its three companies. Id. at 834. The\ncourt noted that the insurance policies’ use of the word “employer” in the phrase\nlimiting liability coverage to an “employee in the immediate service of the\nemployer” created a latent ambiguity in the policy because of the “ambiguous\nstate of extrinsic circumstances” to which that word referred. Id. at 833. These\nextrinsic circumstances included that the parent company functioned as a mere\nholding company for its two subsidiaries, that the parent company and its two\nsubsidiaries had identical directors and officers, and that the named insured in\nthe policy listed all three entities joined by the words “and/or.” Id. at 830–33.\nThe Blue Diamond court concluded that the policy could reasonably be read to\n\n                                        12\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\ninsure all three companies as a single entity or that it could be interpreted as\nextending coverage only to the corporate entity whose employees were injured\nin its immediate service. Id. at 834. Consequently, that court reversed and\nremanded the case to the trial court, stating that it was “not a proper case for\ndisposition on motions for summary judgment.” Id. at 835.\n      Although Cooper’s theory of coverage is the same as that in Blue Diamond,\nnamely, that the parties intended to create a single insured entity composed of\nthe parent company and its subsidiaries, Blue Diamond’s “ambiguous state of\nextrinsic circumstances” is not present in Cooper’s case. First, Cooper does not\nmaintain that its parent companies and subsidiaries all have the same officers\nand directors. Second, Cooper has not alleged that it is merely a holding\ncompany for all of its subsidiaries. Third, the Named Insured section in the ACE\npolicy lists Cooper and its subsidiaries separately, rather than connected by the\nphrase “and/or.” Fourth and most significantly, Cooper has six times as many\nsubsidiaries listed in its insurance policy as the parent company had in Blue\nDiamond. As such, it is far less reasonable to infer that the parties in the case\nat bar intended to cover a total of thirteen separate legal entities, five of which\nhave more than one workplace, as a single insured, without ever saying so\nexplicitly. Thus, Cooper’s case does not accord with Blue Diamond and the\nreasoning of the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n      Cooper also relies on Texas automobile insurance cases to argue that the\nabsence of a severability clause in the ACE policy is consistent with a collective\ninsured construction. However, these cases are sufficiently dissimilar and would\nnot be controlling in Cooper’s case. Specifically, the Texas cases consider\nwhether a provision that excludes coverage for claims by the insured’s employees\nwould also exclude coverage for claims by the insured’s employees against the\nnon-employer omnibus insured. In the earliest cited case, American Fidelity &\nCasualty Co. v. St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity, this court determined that, absent\n\n                                        13\n\f                                        No. 07-20468\n\na severability of interests clause, the employee exclusion applied not only to the\nnamed insured, but also to the omnibus insured, thereby excluding coverage\nunder the policy. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"243193\"><a href=\"/opinion/243193/american-fidelity-casualty-company-inc-v-st-paul-mercury-indemnity/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516–18 (5th Cir. 1957).

Thus,\ncases considering the effect of exclusionary provisions under automobile policies\nare poor precedent for cases, like Cooper’s, considering coverage provisions under\nemployer’s liability policies.8\n       Moreover, there are persuasive employer liability cases from other states\nconsidering the effect of the same employer coverage language on multiple\ninsureds. For example, in Kenosha Beef International v. North River Insurance\nCo., the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin held that the parent and subsidiary\ncompanies were separate insureds and liability under the employer’s liability\npolicy could not be premised upon an employee of one insured suing another\ninsured. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (Wis.

In Float-Away Door, this court determined\nthat an employee exclusion in an automobile policy lacking a severability clause would not\napply to all insureds collectively. Id. at 708–09. In making that determination, this court\nstated: “The better reasoned cases adopt a restrictive interpretation of the insured as referring\nonly to the party seeking coverage under the policy.” Id. at 708 (emphasis added and citations\nomitted); see also Commercial Standard Ins.

Second, the Kenosha Beef case discussed the applicable policy language,\nwhich covered damages because of bodily injury to “your employee that arises\nout of and in the course of employment, claimed against you . . . .” Id. at 704–05.\nBecause the parent company’s construction permitting claims by an employee\nof one insured against another insured would have interpreted the pronouns\n“you” and “your” in that provision to have different meanings in different places\nwithin the same paragraph, without a change in antecedent, the court\ndetermined the parent company’s construction was unreasonable. Id. at 705.\nThat case concluded with this statement:\n              We reiterate that this policy is one for worker’s\n              compensation and employers’ liability only. Because\n              [the parent company] was not [the injured plaintiff’s]\n              employer, coverage was more appropriately provided\n              through its comprehensive general liability carrier, . . .\n              including [the parent corporation’s] retained limit . . .\n              under that policy.\n\nId. at 706.\n      The Cooper case is strikingly similar to Kenosha Beef.

Thus, although the\nKenosha Beef case did not deal with an Extension of Named Insured\nendorsement, the facts are sufficiently similar to be persuasive precedent for this\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\ncourt.

Thus, Cooper\ncontends that a genuine issue of material fact exists precluding summary\njudgment on this issue. In response, AISLIC asserts that the district court did\nnot review the allocation of the $1.35 million from the underlying settlement\nbecause: (1) Cooper did not affirmatively request a judicial determination of the\nallocation in its pleadings; and (2) the proper allocation was already established\nby the parties’ letter agreement.\n      We find that Cooper’s complaint sufficiently raised the issue of allocation.\n“The notice pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and case\nlaw do not require an inordinate amount of detail or precision.” St. Paul\nMercury Ins.

Under that\ndoctrine, when covered and non-covered perils combine to create a loss, the\ninsured is entitled to recover that portion of the damage caused solely by the\n\n                                         17\n\f                                       No. 07-20468\n\ncovered peril. Id. Significantly, the doctrine “embod[ies] the basic principle that\ninsureds are not entitled to recover under their insurance policies unless they\nprove their damage is covered by the policy.” Id. Thus, the allocation of an\ninsurance settlement between covered and non-covered claims coincides with the\ninsured’s burden to prove coverage under the policy and damages from the\ninsurer’s breach of that policy and is not a separate theory of recovery that must\nbe affirmatively pled. Cf. id. (“The doctrine of concurrent causation is not an\naffirmative defense or an avoidance issue.”). Therefore, Cooper’s complaint\nsufficiently raised the issue of allocation by seeking damages from AISLIC for\nallegedly breaching its insurance policy with B-Line, the covered entity, and\nCooper, the (potentially) uncovered entity, when AISLIC refused to pay the total\ndifference between the underlying settlement amount and the agreed upon $1\nmillion deductible.9\n       Moreover, we note, Cooper argued in its briefs to the district court, on at\nleast two separate occasions, that the allocation of liability and settlement\namounts between Cooper and B-Line is a disputed issue of material fact,\nprecluding summary judgment. See Vogel v. Veneman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"26463\"><a href=\"/opinion/26463/vogel-v-veneman/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733 (5th\nCir. 2002) (“Except in cases of extraordinary circumstances, we do not consider\nissues raised for the first time on appeal.

Consequently, the issue of allocation was adequately\nraised, and we may consider it on appeal.\n\n\n       9\n         Furthermore, we note that AISLIC had fair notice from the beginning of the suit\nthrough the discovery period that Cooper disagreed with the allocation of the settlement\nbetween Cooper and B-Line. In particular, Cooper’s complaint twice stated that AISLIC only\npaid the portion of the settlement that it, alone, attributed to B-Line’s liability exposure. A\nfurther review of the record also reveals that many of Cooper’s discovery requests centered on\nAISLIC’s apportionment of the settlement. And, finally, AISLIC, in its own counterclaim,\nadmitted to paying the settlement amount that it, not Cooper, attributed to B-Line’s liability\nexposure.\n\n                                              18\n\f                                   No. 07-20468\n\n      Nor are we persuaded that the district court did not address\napportionment because Cooper had agreed with attributing $1.35 million of the\nsettlement to its potential liability in the parties’ letter agreement. We first note\nthat the district court could not have relied on the letter agreement in granting\nsummary judgment to AISLIC because AISLIC neither mentioned it in any of\nits summary judgment briefs, nor otherwise included it as part of its summary\njudgment evidence. Additionally, Cooper never consented to AISLIC’s allocation\nof liability in that letter. Instead, Cooper only agreed to pay the $1 million\ndeductible under the ACE employer’s liability policy. Beyond that, the letter\nexplicitly states that there “remains a dispute” and that Cooper “reserve[s] all\nof [its] rights and nothing in this agreement shall constitute an admission\nagainst interest.” And while the letter provides that “Cooper and AIGDC [the\nparent company of AISLIC] will each fund approximately $700,000 above the\nundisputed $3.6 million,” it does not state that one party may recover only the\nexact amount it paid, but that each party may recover an amount “up to\n$700,000.” (Emphasis added). Thus, the letter reveals that the parties clearly\ncontemplated the possibility of a lesser recovery. In short, Cooper reserved its\nright to argue that an allocation of the disputed settlement amount—$1.35\nmillion—is required.\n      Nonetheless, in the context of summary judgment, “where the non-movant\nbears the burden of proof at trial, the movant may merely point to an absence\nof evidence, thus shifting to the non-movant the burden of demonstrating by\ncompetent summary judgment proof that there is an issue of material fact\nwarranting trial.” Lindsey v.

In this case, although the insurer, AISLIC, counterclaimed seeking\nreimbursement for the amount it attributed to and paid on behalf of Cooper’s\nalleged liability exposure, AISLIC does not bear the burden of proving the proper\nallocation of damages between the covered entity, B-Line, and the uncovered\n\n                                         19\n\f                                     No. 07-20468\n\nentity, Cooper, in order to recover.

Thus, when\nAISLIC asserted in its motion for summary judgment that the allocation of $1.35\nmillion to Cooper’s liability was undisputed by the parties, Cooper was required\nto provide some evidence that this allocation was in fact disputed, and that the\nportion of settlement damages attributable to Cooper is less than $1.35 million,\nor alternatively, that B-Line’s liability exposure exceeds the undisputed $3.6\nmillion already apportioned to it.\n      In Cooper’s response to AISLIC’s motion for summary judgment, Cooper\npresented the district court with the declaration of Ryan Chadwick, a senior\nlitigation counsel member for Cooper, who negotiated the agreement with\nAISLIC and allegedly has first-hand knowledge of the parties’ agreement.10\nChadwick stated:\n             Cooper never agreed with either the underlying\n             plaintiffs or with AISLIC as to the allocation between\n             Cooper Industries and [ ] B-Line regarding the amounts\n             paid to settle the underlying case. In fact, Cooper\n             believed that most, if not all, of the liability in the case\n             was [ ] B-Line’s and that [ ] B-Line’s potential exposure\n             was $5.1 million.        Cooper believed that Cooper\n             Industries had little, if any, real liability exposure but\n             entered the settlement because of the prospect of\n             continued, protracted and unpredictable litigation.\n\n(Emphasis added). Cooper also included as summary judgment evidence the\nThird Amended Petition from the underlying suit, which was the live pleading\nbefore settlement. That petition set forth the various allegations asserted\n\n\n      10\n         In the district court, AISLIC moved to strike Chadwick’s declaration as improper\nsummary judgment evidence. Because the district court did not rely on the declaration, it\ndeclared the issue moot.

As such, we reverse the summary\njudgment with respect to damages, namely, the district court’s order that Cooper\npay AISLIC $683,250, and remand so that the district court can properly allocate\nthe $1.35 million settlement amount between B-Line and Cooper.\n      On remand, if the district court can “apportion damages solely by applying\nthe terms of the settlement, then the decision would be one of law, not requiring\na jury.”11 Id. at 1495 (emphasis in original). Or, if the “allegations alone could\nsufficiently justify an allocation of damages. . . . the [district court can] compare\nthe insurance contract with the complaint and determine as a matter of law\nwhat portion of the damages were covered.” Id. at 1494.\n             [But] [i]f the apportionment cannot be made as a\n             matter of legal interpretation of either the allegations\n             in the complaint or the settlement agreement itself,\n             then the trial court will have to call a jury to allocate\n             damages through the most limited trial it considers\n             necessary . . . . The jury can consider any facts that\n             could have been considered in the underlying lawsuit\n             itself. The trial court, of course, will have considerable\n             leeway in deciding what facts are truly relevant to the\n             apportionment decision, and can thereby (we hope)\n             prevent a full-blown retrial of the [underlying] law suit.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        We note that the underlying settlement agreement with the representatives of the\ndecedents was neither found in the record nor provided on appeal.\n\n                                          21\n\f                                  No. 07-20468\n\nId. at 1495 (addressing the apportionment of a settlement between covered and\nuncovered losses under an insurance policy).\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s holding with\nrespect to coverage under the employer’s liability policy, but we VACATE the\ndistrict court’s judgment and remand for allocation of liability. Each party shall\nbear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f</pre>",
