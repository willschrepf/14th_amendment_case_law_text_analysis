Temporary orders were entered in July 2001, and the final decree of divorce,\r\nincorporating their agreement, was signed in September 2003.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In 2004 Nancy filed a motion for enforcement.  Her amended motion for\r\nenforcement was heard by the trial court, eventually resulting in the judgment made the\r\nsubject of this appeal.  The court made findings of fact and conclusions of law.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In her amended motion for enforcement, Nancy contended that Mike had violated\r\ntheir agreed divorce decree in three respects, by (1) failing to pay some yard care\r\nexpenses incurred in June 2003 at the residence awarded to Nancy; (2) failing to honor the\r\ndecree’s provision making him solely liable for taxes on income earned during the\r\nmarriage, and (3) failing to transfer to Nancy security deposits paid by tenants of a rental\r\nproperty awarded to her.  The trial court agreed with Nancy as to the yard care expenses\r\nand the income taxes, agreed with Mike as to the security deposits, rendered judgment\r\naccordingly, and awarded Nancy attorney’s fees.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Mike presents twelve issues on appeal.  His first three issues challenge the trial\r\ncourt’s rulings on the yard care and income tax issues, and its award of attorney’s fees to\r\nNancy.  His remaining issues challenge specific findings of fact.  In her appeal, Nancy\r\npresents a single issue contesting the court’s ruling on the security deposits.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>Applicable Law</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>As noted, the parties entered into an agreed final decree of divorce containing\r\nprovisions and obligations about which they later disagreed.  Contract principles control\r\nconstruction of an agreed property division incorporated into a divorce decree.  <i>See</i> \r\n<i>Appleton v. Appleton,</i> 76 S.W.3d 78, 84 (Tex.App.–Houston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 2002, no pet.),\r\n<i>citing</i>  <i>McGoodwin v. McGoodwin,</i> 671 S.W.2d 880 (Tex. 1984).  <i>See also Ex Parte Jones,</i>\r\n358 S.W.2d 370, 375 (1962).   To the extent we are required to engage in contract\r\nconstruction here, we review the trial court’s actions under a <i>de novo </i>standard.  <i>Wright v.\r\nEckhardt,</i> 32 S.W.3d 891, 894 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.); <i>Able v. Able,</i> 725\r\nS.W.2d 778, 779 (Tex.App.–Houston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 1987, writ ref’d n.r.e.). </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>When construing a written contract, the court’s primary concern is to ascertain and\r\ngive effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.  <i>Appleton,</i> 76\r\nS.W.3d at 84.  To ascertain the true intentions of the parties to the contract, “courts should\r\nexamine and consider <i>the entire writing </i>in an effort to harmonize and give effect to <i>all of\r\nthe provisions</i> of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.”  <i>Id., citing Buys\r\nv. Buys,</i> 924<i> </i>S.W.2d 369, 372 (Tex. 1996) (emphasis in original).  <i>See also Questa Energy\r\nCorp. v. Vantage Point Energy, Inc.,</i> 887 S.W.2d 217, 221 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 1994, writ\r\ndenied).  When a written contract is so worded that it can be given a certain or definite\r\nlegal meaning or interpretation, it is not ambiguous and we construe it as a matter of law.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> \r\n<i>Lopez v. Munoz, Hockema &amp; Reed, L.L.P., </i>22 S.W.3d 857, 861 (Tex. 2000); <i>Buys,</i> 924\r\nS.W.2d at 372.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Analysis<i>Issue One - Yard Care Expenses</i><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>The temporary orders gave Nancy possession of their residence but required Mike\r\nto pay certain household expenses.  That list included homeowners insurance, utilities and\r\n“[a]ll necessary and normal repairs to the residence . . . and normal weekly lawn\r\nmaintenance and maid service at the residence of twelve hours per week.”   The final\r\ndecree provides that Mike is responsible for “[a]ll unpaid debts of the parties incurred\r\nduring the marriage, including those known debts incurred prior to the date of separation\r\nof the Parties, the same being May 27, 2001, Save and Except the debts specifically\r\nagreed to be paid by wife as set forth herein . . . .”</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  It provides that Nancy is responsible\r\nfor “[a]ll unpaid debts, charges, liabilities and other obligations incurred solely by [her]\r\nwhich were not the obligation of the husband under Temporary Orders and which have\r\nbeen incurred since May 27, 2001.”  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The dispute is over two bills, totaling $2,239.91, from yard care companies for\r\nbedding plants planted in the front and back yards of the residence in June 2003.  The\r\nrecord contains evidence that the parties commonly had similar seasonal flowers planted. \r\nDuring his testimony at the hearing, Mike acknowledged he paid for similar plantings in\r\nprevious years.  Nancy testified they had a “standing order” with the yard care companies\r\nfor such plantings twice a year, and that neither she nor Mike “ordered” the plantings in\r\nquestion.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>         </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>We agree with Nancy that the issue is resolved by the language of the final decree. \r\nUnder its terms, Nancy is responsible for obligations “incurred solely by [her.]”  Although\r\nNancy had possession of the residence at the time, we think the trial court could have\r\ndetermined that the debts incurred for the June 2003 plantings were not incurred solely by\r\nher under the language of the final decree.  Under those circumstances, the decree made\r\nMike responsible for the debt.  We overrule Mike’s first issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Issue Two - Tax Liability</i><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>Among the final decree’s provisions under the heading “federal income tax” are the\r\nfollowing:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that W. Mike Klein shall be solely\r\nresponsible for all federal income tax liabilities, whether personal or\r\ncorporate, of the parties incurred on income through the date of divorce and\r\nshall timely pay any deficiencies, assessments, penalties, or interest due\r\nthereon and shall indemnify and hold Nancy J. Klein and her property\r\nharmless therefrom.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that, for the calendar year 2003, each\r\nparty shall file an individual income tax return in accordance with the Internal\r\nRevenue Code.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that each party shall use as a credit\r\nagainst his or her tax liability for 2003 all estimated tax payments and\r\nwage/salary withholding made by him or her, 50 percent of the parties’ prior\r\nyear overpayments and credits, and 50 percent of the estimated payments\r\nmade in the names of both parties.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>As required by the temporary orders, Mike made estimated tax payments in both\r\nparties’ names in April, June and September 2003.  They totaled $35,625.  In accordance\r\nwith the final decree, Nancy reported half the estimated payments on her 2003 return,\r\ntogether with half of the parties’ overpayment in 2002, a total of $18,790.  Her total tax for\r\n2003 was $12,597, giving her an overpayment for 2003 of $6,193.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Nancy contends that the decree’s provisions that Mike be “solely responsible for all\r\nfederal income tax liabilities . . . of the parties incurred on income through the date of\r\ndivorce” and “hold Nancy and her property harmless therefrom” mean that Mike was to\r\nreimburse her for the amount of tax on her share of the parties’ income through the date\r\nof divorce, without regard to the estimated payments.  Thus, she contended, Mike was in\r\nviolation of the decree’s tax provisions even though the required estimated payments paid\r\nthe taxes on her share of the parties’ pre-divorce income, leaving her with no liability for\r\nsuch taxes.  The trial court found that, under the decree’s provisions, Nancy “was to\r\nreceive as part of the property division one-half of all pre-divorce payments and refunds”\r\nand that Mike violated them by “failing to be solely responsible for all federal income tax\r\nliabilities,” and gave Nancy judgment for $14,597, the amount her accountant calculated\r\nas the tax that would have been owed on Nancy’s half of the pre-divorce income. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>We disagree with the trial court’s construction of the decree.  In our judgment, the\r\nrequirement that Mike “shall be solely responsible for all federal income tax liabilities”\r\ncannot reasonably be read as the equivalent of a provision that Nancy “receive as part of\r\nthe property division one-half of all pre-divorce payments and refunds.”  As Mike points out,\r\nthe estimated tax payments are not addressed in the decree’s provisions for division of the\r\nmarital estate.  The only reference in the agreed decree to the estimated payments and\r\nprior years’ overpayment is the provision, quoted above, that each party use half of the\r\nestimated payments and overpayments as a credit against the party’s 2003 income tax\r\nliability.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Mike contends the only reasonable reading of the decree is that he would be\r\nresponsible for the tax liability, if any, due after the estimated payments were applied as\r\nordered.  Nancy responds that it would have been easy enough for the parties to have said\r\nso if that had been their agreement. Our task is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\nintentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument<i>.  See, e.g., Appleton,</i> 76 S.W.3d\r\nat 84.  Especially in view of the temporary order’s requirement that Mike make estimated\r\npayments, and considering the decree’s provisions for income taxes as a whole, we agree\r\nwith Mike that the “liabilities” for which he agreed to be “solely responsible” must mean any\r\nliability after the estimated payments are taken into account.  Because no tax liability\r\nremained after the estimated payments, he did not violate the decree’s terms.  We sustain\r\nMike’s issue two.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><i></i></span></span><span><span><i>Cross-Appeal - Tenant Security Deposits</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>As noted, Nancy also appeals from the trial court’s ruling.  In one issue, she\r\nchallenges the court’s failure to find that Mike violated the final decree by failing to deliver\r\nto her deposits paid by tenants in a commercial property awarded to her.  The parties refer\r\nto the property as Yorktown.  Evidence showed Mike acknowledges he has not paid the\r\ndeposited amounts to Nancy. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The final decree contains this language: </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that the wife, NANCY J. KLEIN, is awarded the\r\nfollowing as her sole and separate property, and the husband is divested of all right, title,\r\ninterest, and claim in and to that property:</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>W-1.The following real property, including but not limited to any escrow\r\nfunds, prepaid insurance, utility deposits, keys, house plans, home\r\nsecurity access and code, garage door opener, warranties and\r\nservice contracts, and title and closing documents:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                     </span>. . .</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>(b) 5020 50<sup>th</sup> Street, Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas (Yorktown)</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Kuykendall Hts N 194.5' of E 371.84' and W 28' of E 213' of S 263' of L  534</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>This property includes all rents due and payable on rental agreements from\r\ntenants occupying the Yorktown locations at 5020 50<sup>th</sup> Street, Lubbock,\r\nTexas commencing within the month of September 2003 and thereafter,\r\ntogether with all contract rights, inclusive of tenant deposits, if any, held in\r\ntrust or escrow.  Wife shall assume the obligations of Landlord under any\r\nsuch Yorktown tenant agreements and hold and indemnify husband as to the\r\nsame.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their arguments, the parties focus on the decree’s language describing the\r\nYorktown property as including “all contract rights, inclusive of tenant deposits, if any, held\r\nin trust or escrow.”  It is undisputed none of the Yorktown security deposits were held in\r\nformal trust or escrow accounts.  In fact, the parties did not segregate the security deposits\r\nfrom their other funds at all, but deposited them into their joint account.   Mike contends\r\nthis fact is dispositive of the issue, arguing that the “held in trust or escrow” phrase limits\r\nthe tenant deposits included as contract rights to those held in trust or escrow\r\narrangements.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  We disagree.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At the same time the parties executed the agreed decree, they executed an\r\nassignment of the Yorktown leases.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The assignment makes reference to the obligation \r\nunder the leases to repay tenants’ security deposits.  To determine the parties’ intent with\r\nregard to the security deposits, we will construe the documents together.  <i>See In re\r\nWaggoner Estate,</i> 163 S.W.3d 161, 166 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2005, no pet.), <i>citing Jones\r\nv. Kelley,</i> 614 S.W.2d 95, 98 (Tex. 1981) (separate instruments or contracts executed at\r\nthe same time, for the same purpose, and in the course of the same transaction are to be\r\nconsidered as one instrument, and are to be read and construed together).  <i>See also Fort\r\nWorth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City of Fort Worth,</i> 22 S.W.3d 831, 840 (Tex. 2000).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The leases with Yorktown tenants set forth the landlord’s authority to apply the\r\nsecurity deposit to a tenant’s breaches of the lease, and the obligation to return the deposit\r\nif the tenant has performed the lease obligations.  In addition, a landlord’s obligations to\r\naccount for and refund security deposits in commercial tenancies are governed by statute. \r\nTex. Prop. Code Ann. § 93.004, <i>et seq</i>. (Vernon 2007).  Subject to other terms of the\r\nstatute, the landlord may deduct from the deposit damages and charges for which the\r\ntenant is liable under the lease.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 93.006(a).  A new owner of the\r\nproperty becomes liable for the return of the deposit.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 93.007(a).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Neither the Yorktown leases nor the Texas statute requires security deposits to be\r\nheld in escrow or trust accounts.  Neither the provisions of the leases nor those of the\r\nlease assignment distinguish between deposits held in escrow or trust and those held\r\notherwise.  Under the terms of the documents before us, we are unable to see that such\r\na distinction has any bearing on the landlord’s rights with respect to the deposits, or on the\r\nlandlord’s obligations to account for and return them.  Our Supreme Court has noted that\r\na court should construe contracts from a utilitarian standpoint, bearing in mind the\r\nparticular business activity sought to be served.  <i>Frost Nat’l Bank v. L &amp; F Distributors, Ltd.</i>,\r\n165 S.W.3d 310, 312 (Tex. 2005), <i>quoting Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc</i>. 727 S.W.2d 527,\r\n530 (Tex. 1987).  In this instance, we think the parties used the phrase “tenant deposits,\r\nif any, held in trust or escrow” not to distinguish some deposits from others but simply to\r\nrefer to deposits held subject to the obligations of the law and the leases.  Such deposits,\r\nunder the agreed final decree, are “contract rights,” required to be transferred along with\r\nthe Yorktown property.  We sustain Nancy’s issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Attorney’s Fees</i><span><span>      </span></span>In his third point of error, Mike challenges the award of attorney’s fees to Nancy in\r\nthe amount of $5,000.   His argument is that she was the prevailing party only because the\r\ntrial court erroneously granted part of the relief she requested in her motion for\r\nenforcement.  The Family Code expressly provides for an award of attorney’s fees in\r\nproceedings to enforce the decree.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 9.014 (Vernon 2006); <i>In re\r\nMarriage of Malacara</i>, 223 S.W.3d 600, 603 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2007, no pet.).  We review\r\nthe trial court’s award of attorney’s fees for an abuse of discretion.  <i>See Chavez v. Chavez,</i>\r\n12 S.W.3d 563, 566 (Tex.App.–San Antonio 1999, no pet.) (review of award of attorney’s\r\nfees in an enforcement proceeding is under an abuse of discretion standard); <i>Schneider v.\r\nSchneider,</i> 5 S.W.3d 925, 930 (Tex.App.–Austin 1999, no pet.) (same).  A trial court abuses\r\nits discretion when it acts arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without reference to any guiding\r\nprinciples. <i>Goode v. Shoukfeh,</i> 943 S.W.2d 441, 446 (Tex. 1997).  We see no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the trial court’s award, and overrule Mike’s third issue. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Findings of Fact</i><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>Our dispositions of Mike’s first three issues make it unnecessary that we consider the\r\nchallenges to the findings of fact presented in his issues 4-12.  Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>We reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of Nancy with regard to the 2003\r\nfederal income tax payments, and render judgment that Nancy take nothing under her claim\r\nunder the federal income tax provisions of the final decree.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  We reverse the trial court’s\r\njudgment with regard to Nancy’s award of the Yorktown security deposits</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> and, finding that\r\nthe state of the record does not permit us to render judgment with respect to that claim,\r\nremand it to the trial court.  In all other respects, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                                           </span>James T.

Temporary orders were entered in July 2001, and the final decree of divorce,\r\nincorporating their agreement, was signed in September 2003.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In 2004 Nancy filed a motion for enforcement.  Her amended motion for\r\nenforcement was heard by the trial court, eventually resulting in the judgment made the\r\nsubject of this appeal.  The court made findings of fact and conclusions of law.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In her amended motion for enforcement, Nancy contended that Mike had violated\r\ntheir agreed divorce decree in three respects, by (1) failing to pay some yard care\r\nexpenses incurred in June 2003 at the residence awarded to Nancy; (2) failing to honor the\r\ndecree’s provision making him solely liable for taxes on income earned during the\r\nmarriage, and (3) failing to transfer to Nancy security deposits paid by tenants of a rental\r\nproperty awarded to her.  The trial court agreed with Nancy as to the yard care expenses\r\nand the income taxes, agreed with Mike as to the security deposits, rendered judgment\r\naccordingly, and awarded Nancy attorney’s fees.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Mike presents twelve issues on appeal.  His first three issues challenge the trial\r\ncourt’s rulings on the yard care and income tax issues, and its award of attorney’s fees to\r\nNancy.  His remaining issues challenge specific findings of fact.  In her appeal, Nancy\r\npresents a single issue contesting the court’s ruling on the security deposits.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>Applicable Law</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>As noted, the parties entered into an agreed final decree of divorce containing\r\nprovisions and obligations about which they later disagreed.

That list included homeowners insurance, utilities and\r\n“[a]ll necessary and normal repairs to the residence . . . and normal weekly lawn\r\nmaintenance and maid service at the residence of twelve hours per week.”   The final\r\ndecree provides that Mike is responsible for “[a]ll unpaid debts of the parties incurred\r\nduring the marriage, including those known debts incurred prior to the date of separation\r\nof the Parties, the same being May 27, 2001, Save and Except the debts specifically\r\nagreed to be paid by wife as set forth herein . . . .”</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  It provides that Nancy is responsible\r\nfor “[a]ll unpaid debts, charges, liabilities and other obligations incurred solely by [her]\r\nwhich were not the obligation of the husband under Temporary Orders and which have\r\nbeen incurred since May 27, 2001.”  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The dispute is over two bills, totaling $2,239.91, from yard care companies for\r\nbedding plants planted in the front and back yards of the residence in June 2003.  The\r\nrecord contains evidence that the parties commonly had similar seasonal flowers planted. \r\nDuring his testimony at the hearing, Mike acknowledged he paid for similar plantings in\r\nprevious years.  Nancy testified they had a “standing order” with the yard care companies\r\nfor such plantings twice a year, and that neither she nor Mike “ordered” the plantings in\r\nquestion.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>         </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>We agree with Nancy that the issue is resolved by the language of the final decree. \r\nUnder its terms, Nancy is responsible for obligations “incurred solely by [her.]”  Although\r\nNancy had possession of the residence at the time, we think the trial court could have\r\ndetermined that the debts incurred for the June 2003 plantings were not incurred solely by\r\nher under the language of the final decree.  Under those circumstances, the decree made\r\nMike responsible for the debt.  We overrule Mike’s first issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Issue Two - Tax Liability</i><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>Among the final decree’s provisions under the heading “federal income tax” are the\r\nfollowing:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that W. Mike Klein shall be solely\r\nresponsible for all federal income tax liabilities, whether personal or\r\ncorporate, of the parties incurred on income through the date of divorce and\r\nshall timely pay any deficiencies, assessments, penalties, or interest due\r\nthereon and shall indemnify and hold Nancy J. Klein and her property\r\nharmless therefrom.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that, for the calendar year 2003, each\r\nparty shall file an individual income tax return in accordance with the Internal\r\nRevenue Code.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that each party shall use as a credit\r\nagainst his or her tax liability for 2003 all estimated tax payments and\r\nwage/salary withholding made by him or her, 50 percent of the parties’ prior\r\nyear overpayments and credits, and 50 percent of the estimated payments\r\nmade in the names of both parties.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>As required by the temporary orders, Mike made estimated tax payments in both\r\nparties’ names in April, June and September 2003.  They totaled $35,625.  In accordance\r\nwith the final decree, Nancy reported half the estimated payments on her 2003 return,\r\ntogether with half of the parties’ overpayment in 2002, a total of $18,790.  Her total tax for\r\n2003 was $12,597, giving her an overpayment for 2003 of $6,193.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Nancy contends that the decree’s provisions that Mike be “solely responsible for all\r\nfederal income tax liabilities . . . of the parties incurred on income through the date of\r\ndivorce” and “hold Nancy and her property harmless therefrom” mean that Mike was to\r\nreimburse her for the amount of tax on her share of the parties’ income through the date\r\nof divorce, without regard to the estimated payments.  Thus, she contended, Mike was in\r\nviolation of the decree’s tax provisions even though the required estimated payments paid\r\nthe taxes on her share of the parties’ pre-divorce income, leaving her with no liability for\r\nsuch taxes.  The trial court found that, under the decree’s provisions, Nancy “was to\r\nreceive as part of the property division one-half of all pre-divorce payments and refunds”\r\nand that Mike violated them by “failing to be solely responsible for all federal income tax\r\nliabilities,” and gave Nancy judgment for $14,597, the amount her accountant calculated\r\nas the tax that would have been owed on Nancy’s half of the pre-divorce income. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>We disagree with the trial court’s construction of the decree.  In our judgment, the\r\nrequirement that Mike “shall be solely responsible for all federal income tax liabilities”\r\ncannot reasonably be read as the equivalent of a provision that Nancy “receive as part of\r\nthe property division one-half of all pre-divorce payments and refunds.”  As Mike points out,\r\nthe estimated tax payments are not addressed in the decree’s provisions for division of the\r\nmarital estate.  The only reference in the agreed decree to the estimated payments and\r\nprior years’ overpayment is the provision, quoted above, that each party use half of the\r\nestimated payments and overpayments as a credit against the party’s 2003 income tax\r\nliability.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Mike contends the only reasonable reading of the decree is that he would be\r\nresponsible for the tax liability, if any, due after the estimated payments were applied as\r\nordered.  Nancy responds that it would have been easy enough for the parties to have said\r\nso if that had been their agreement. Our task is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\nintentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument<i>.  See, e.g., Appleton,</i> 76 S.W.3d\r\nat 84.  Especially in view of the temporary order’s requirement that Mike make estimated\r\npayments, and considering the decree’s provisions for income taxes as a whole, we agree\r\nwith Mike that the “liabilities” for which he agreed to be “solely responsible” must mean any\r\nliability after the estimated payments are taken into account.  Because no tax liability\r\nremained after the estimated payments, he did not violate the decree’s terms.  We sustain\r\nMike’s issue two.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><i></i></span></span><span><span><i>Cross-Appeal - Tenant Security Deposits</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>As noted, Nancy also appeals from the trial court’s ruling.  In one issue, she\r\nchallenges the court’s failure to find that Mike violated the final decree by failing to deliver\r\nto her deposits paid by tenants in a commercial property awarded to her.  The parties refer\r\nto the property as Yorktown.  Evidence showed Mike acknowledges he has not paid the\r\ndeposited amounts to Nancy. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The final decree contains this language: </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that the wife, NANCY J. KLEIN, is awarded the\r\nfollowing as her sole and separate property, and the husband is divested of all right, title,\r\ninterest, and claim in and to that property:</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>W-1.The following real property, including but not limited to any escrow\r\nfunds, prepaid insurance, utility deposits, keys, house plans, home\r\nsecurity access and code, garage door opener, warranties and\r\nservice contracts, and title and closing documents:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                     </span>. . .</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>(b) 5020 50<sup>th</sup> Street, Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas (Yorktown)</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Kuykendall Hts N 194.5' of E 371.84' and W 28' of E 213' of S 263' of L  534</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>This property includes all rents due and payable on rental agreements from\r\ntenants occupying the Yorktown locations at 5020 50<sup>th</sup> Street, Lubbock,\r\nTexas commencing within the month of September 2003 and thereafter,\r\ntogether with all contract rights, inclusive of tenant deposits, if any, held in\r\ntrust or escrow.  Wife shall assume the obligations of Landlord under any\r\nsuch Yorktown tenant agreements and hold and indemnify husband as to the\r\nsame.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their arguments, the parties focus on the decree’s language describing the\r\nYorktown property as including “all contract rights, inclusive of tenant deposits, if any, held\r\nin trust or escrow.”  It is undisputed none of the Yorktown security deposits were held in\r\nformal trust or escrow accounts.  In fact, the parties did not segregate the security deposits\r\nfrom their other funds at all, but deposited them into their joint account.   Mike contends\r\nthis fact is dispositive of the issue, arguing that the “held in trust or escrow” phrase limits\r\nthe tenant deposits included as contract rights to those held in trust or escrow\r\narrangements.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  We disagree.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At the same time the parties executed the agreed decree, they executed an\r\nassignment of the Yorktown leases.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The assignment makes reference to the obligation \r\nunder the leases to repay tenants’ security deposits.  To determine the parties’ intent with\r\nregard to the security deposits, we will construe the documents together.  <i>See In re\r\nWaggoner Estate,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1684457\"><a href=\"/opinion/1684457/in-re-waggoner-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 166 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2005, no pet.), <i>citing Jones\r\nv.

In addition, a landlord’s obligations to\r\naccount for and refund security deposits in commercial tenancies are governed by statute. \r\nTex. Prop. Code Ann. § 93.004, <i>et seq</i>. (Vernon 2007).  Subject to other terms of the\r\nstatute, the landlord may deduct from the deposit damages and charges for which the\r\ntenant is liable under the lease.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 93.006(a).  A new owner of the\r\nproperty becomes liable for the return of the deposit.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 93.007(a).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Neither the Yorktown leases nor the Texas statute requires security deposits to be\r\nheld in escrow or trust accounts.  Neither the provisions of the leases nor those of the\r\nlease assignment distinguish between deposits held in escrow or trust and those held\r\notherwise.  Under the terms of the documents before us, we are unable to see that such\r\na distinction has any bearing on the landlord’s rights with respect to the deposits, or on the\r\nlandlord’s obligations to account for and return them.  Our Supreme Court has noted that\r\na court should construe contracts from a utilitarian standpoint, bearing in mind the\r\nparticular business activity sought to be served.  <i>Frost Nat’l Bank v.

In this instance, we think the parties used the phrase “tenant deposits,\r\nif any, held in trust or escrow” not to distinguish some deposits from others but simply to\r\nrefer to deposits held subject to the obligations of the law and the leases.  Such deposits,\r\nunder the agreed final decree, are “contract rights,” required to be transferred along with\r\nthe Yorktown property.  We sustain Nancy’s issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Attorney’s Fees</i><span><span>      </span></span>In his third point of error, Mike challenges the award of attorney’s fees to Nancy in\r\nthe amount of $5,000.   His argument is that she was the prevailing party only because the\r\ntrial court erroneously granted part of the relief she requested in her motion for\r\nenforcement.  The Family Code expressly provides for an award of attorney’s fees in\r\nproceedings to enforce the decree.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 9.014 (Vernon 2006); <i>In re\r\nMarriage of Malacara</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273619\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273619/in-re-marriage-of-malacara/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 603 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2007, no pet.).
