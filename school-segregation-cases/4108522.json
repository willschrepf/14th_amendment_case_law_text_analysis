The jury found that State Farm breached its policy\nwhen it refused to cover physical loss to Hanson’s roof caused by a wind event in\nJune 2012. In addition to awarding Hanson damages for the cost to repair or\nreplace her physical loss, the jury awarded attorney’s fees.      State Farm: (1)\nchallenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s finding that\n\fState Farm failed to comply with the policy, (2) contends that the evidence\nconclusively established an exclusion to coverage, and (3) argues that Hanson\nfailed to produce evidence showing she was entitled to replacement cost benefits.\nWith regard to attorney’s fees, State Farm argues that: (a) the evidence is legally\ninsufficient to support the award; (b) under rule 167, State Farm is entitled to an\noffset for litigation costs accruing after Hanson rejected its settlement offer and\nHanson is precluded from receiving post-rejection attorney’s fees; (c) Hanson\nfailed to properly segregate; and (d) the award is excessive. We affirm.\n\n                I.       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Ginger Hanson closed on the house at issue in July 2011. At the time, the\nroof was approximately 15 years old with 30-year shingles fastened to the decking\nwith staples. The house underwent a purchase inspection, which did not reveal any\nconcerns with the roof. The seller’s disclosure did not indicate any roof damage.\n\n       Hanson sought coverage for the house from her longtime State Farm agent.\nHer agent prepared an underwriting report for Hanson’s policy. There was no\nindication that the roof had “possible hail damage,” “curled shingles,”\n“loose/missing shingles,” “wear in valleys,” “missing/replaced ridge row,”\n“patched area[s],” or “stain/rotting under eaves.” There were no “interior leaks.”\nThe report did not identify any possible concerns. According to Shannon Kimmel,\none of Hanson’s experts with experience working as a claims adjuster for State\nFarm and currently working as a public adjuster,1 the underwriting report indicated\nthere were “no issues with that roof less than a year before this reported storm.”\nAnother of Hanson’s experts with experience working for State Farm as a claims\nadjuster, Kerry Freeman, stated that the report reflected a “clean bill of health” for\n\n       1\n         A public adjuster is an adjuster who is licensed to represent the public against an\ninsurance company when there is a problem with the claim.\n\n                                             2\n\fHanson’s roof.\n\n      Under “Section I – Coverages,” Hanson’s homeowner’s policy with State\nFarm provides:\n\n      COVERAGE A – DWELLING\n      1. Dwelling. We cover the dwelling used principally as a private\n      residence on the residence premises shown in the Declarations.\n            Dwelling includes:\n            a. structures attached to the dwelling;\n            b. materials and supplies located on or adjacent to the residence\n            premises for use in the construction, alteration or repair of the\n            dwelling or other structures on the residence premises;\n            c. foundation, floor slab and footings supporting the dwelling;\n            and\n            d. wall-to-wall carpeting attached to the dwelling.\nUnder “Section I – Losses Insured,” the policy provides:\n\n      COVERAGE A – DWELLING\n      We insure for accidental direct physical loss to the property described\n      in Coverage A, except as provided in SECTION I - LOSSES NOT\n      INSURED.\nUnder “Section I – Losses Not Insured,” the policy provides:\n\n      1. We do not insure for any loss to the property described in Coverage\n      A which consists of, or is directly and immediately caused by, one or\n      more of the perils listed in items a. through n. below, regardless of\n      whether the loss occurs suddenly or gradually, involves isolated or\n      widespread damage, arises from natural or external forces, or occurs\n      as a result of any combination of these: . . .\n            g. wear, tear, marring, scratching, deterioration, inherent vice,\n            latent defect or mechanical breakdown . . . .\n\n      3. We do not insure under any coverage for any loss consisting of one\n      or more of the items below. Further, we do not insure for loss\n      described in paragraphs 1. and 2. immediately above regardless of\n                                         3\n\f         whether one or more of the following: (a) directly or indirectly cause,\n         contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the same\n         time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss: . . .\n                  b. defect, weakness, inadequacy, fault or unsoundness in: . . .\n                          (2) design, specifications, workmanship, construction,\n                          grading, compaction . . . .\n\n         Hanson was not at home during the June 1, 2012 storm. On the day after the\nstorm, Roy Campbell, who sells roofs for Telge Roofing, tarped roofs and made\nadjuster appointments for houses in Hanson’s neighborhood. Kimmel discussed\nthe June 1, 2012 storm with Hanson’s neighbors and the greenskeeper for the golf\ncourse around the corner from Hanson’s house. After the storm, the golf course\nhad to shut down due to “a tremendous amount” of fallen trees blocking golf cart\npaths. Several of Hanson’s neighbors received new roofs after the June 1, 2012\nstorm.\n\n         In early October 2012, Campbell inspected Hanson’s roof. Campbell found\n“pulled through fasteners” and “lots of wind lift”: “Basically, [Hanson] has staples\non her roof and where the wind had lifted it up, it made a clean pull through of the\nshingle. The shingle was actually still in place but it’s basically flapping in the\nwind.” Campbell found areas of Hanson’s roof where the edges of the top layer of\nshingles were not sealed to the underlying layers and could be lifted by hand.\nCampbell suggested that Hanson file an insurance claim.\n\n         Hanson and Campbell called in a claim to State Farm for wind damage to\nHanson’s roof.2 State Farm assigned claims representative Jon Flores. Campbell\naccompanied Flores onto the roof for the inspection. Campbell showed Flores\nareas of pulled-through shingles and creased shingles. Flores only walked the\n\n\n         2\n             Hanson’s claim initially also included hail damage.\n\n                                                   4\n\fridge3 of the roof and did not go down any of the slopes. According to Campbell,\nFlores indicated there was not “enough damage” and that despite any “lift” there\nwere “no missing shingles.”               Flores concluded that Hanson’s roof had not\nsustained an accidental direct physical loss.\n\n       Flores’s inspection did not satisfy Hanson. Campbell referred Hanson to\nKimmel. Hanson requested another inspection from State Farm. State Farm next\nassigned claims representative Andrew Traise. Campbell accompanied Traise onto\nthe roof for the inspection. Kimmel also was present. Campbell described Traise’s\ninspection as uncharacteristically quick. Traise “traversed” about ten percent of\nthe roof and made no effort to ask any of Hanson’s neighbors about, or to observe,\ntheir properties. Campbell showed Traise areas of lifted shingles “pretty much all\nover the roof”—pulled-through fasteners and unsealed shingles. According to\nCampbell, Traise wanted to find “some more missing shingles, you know,\ndamaged shingles.” Traise informed Hanson that he found no accidental direct\nphysical loss. State Farm denied Hanson’s claim for wind damage.\n\n       In November 2012, Hanson filed suit against State Farm and Traise.\nAgainst State Farm, Hanson alleged breach of contract and violation of the Prompt\nPayment of Claims Statute, see Tex. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 542.051–.061 (West 2009).\nAgainst both State Farm and Traise, Hanson alleged “bad faith/DTPA” in the form\nof violations of chapter 541 of the Insurance Code, see id. §§ 541.051, 541.060,\n541.061 (West 2009).4 State Farm and Traise served Hanson with a settlement\noffer in November 2013. State Farm and Traise offered Hanson $30,000, with an\n\n       3\n           The ridge is the top of the roof, where the slopes intersect.\n       4\n          In May 2014, the trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of State Farm\non the “section 542 claims and common law duty of good faith and fair dealing.” The trial court\nalso granted partial summary judgment in favor of Traise on “any common law duty of good\nfaith causes of action.”\n\n                                                    5\n\fexpiration date of December 4, 2013. Hanson did not accept the offer.\n\n      At trial, Kimmel testified about his inspection of Hanson’s roof.            He\ndescribed accidental direct physical loss as “any damage to the shingle. It could be\ncreasing. It could be torn. In this instance, in her roof, it’s pulled through that\nfastener so it’s actually torn right there at the fastener. So it is damage, it’s got\nactual direct physical loss.”    Kimmel located pulled-through shingle damage,\nwhere a shingle is “pulled through that fastener so it’s actually torn right there at\nthe fastener,” exposing the plywood decking underneath. According to Kimmel,\npulled-through shingles indicate “wind damage” and comprise “accidental direct\nphysical loss” covered under Hanson’s policy.         Kimmel also located “wind-\ncreased” shingle damage, where the shingle “was actually bent over” because “the\nwind has been flapping that thing up and creased it.” Wind-creased shingles also\nare “accidental direct physical loss” covered by Hanson’s policy. Kimmel further\nfound shingle damage caused either by flying debris or “tree damage where the\ntree’s blown into the roof during the storm and messed up the edging.”             He\nindicated that such damage was covered by Hanson’s policy.             According to\nKimmel, Hanson’s roof “absolutely” sustained covered wind damage on “all\nsides.” He opined Hanson’s roof required replacement—there were “way too\nmany shingles that are damaged on the roof, and the cost of repairing that would\noutweigh the cost of replacing that.”\n\n      Freeman also inspected Hanson’s roof and agreed with Kimmel’s\nassessment of wind damage. Freeman described pulled-through shingle damage—\n“[w]hat that is, where that fastener originally was put into that top one, it has been\npulled up and torn from wind.” Freeman acknowledged that he saw a “handful” of\noverdriven staples, as there are on any given roof, but that he saw pulled-through\nshingle tears throughout Hanson’s roof. He stated that if the staples had been\n\n                                          6\n\foverdriven, then there would not be tearing; instead, “it would go straight through\nlike a bullet hole.” Freeman opined that the roof was unrepairable because the\nrepairs would risk causing more damage to the shingles. Freeman further testified\nregarding his Xactimate5 estimate totaling approximately $39,687 as the reasonable\nand necessary cost to replace Hanson’s roof.\n\n       State Farm’s expert Mark West, a general contractor, inspected Hanson’s\nroof with Eric Green, a civil engineer also serving as State Farm’s expert. West\ndid not walk the back slope of Hanson’s roof.                     West acknowledged that\n“potentially the ridge was displaced by wind.” There were approximately five to\nten “displaced shingle tabs” and shingle tabs with a tear, crease, or “stripe,” which\ncould have been damaged by a wind event or from impact with tree limbs. West\nagreed that a windstorm could cause shingles to unseal or pull through their\nfasteners. He opined that the damaged shingle tabs could be repaired for under\n$500. West, who has experience with Xactimate, went through Kimmel’s estimate\nand noted several areas of unnecessary and duplicative charges. West estimated\nthat the cost to replace Hanson’s roof was approximately $15,000 to $16,000.\n\n       According to Green, wind measurements from the closest airport to\nHanson’s house (approximately eight miles away) indicated gusts up to 49 mph on\nJune 1, 2012. This wind speed can blow over small trees and cause tree branches\nto fall. Green testified that wind can cause physical damage to roofs such as\nshingles ripping off, tearing, and creasing. He physically examined a “sampling”\nof about five to eight percent of the surface of Hanson’s roof.                          Green\nacknowledged finding some shingles on the ridge and on the eaves that had\nsustained wind damage or “wind-blown debris damage.” Also, “wind forces”\n\n       5\n         Xactimate is software widely used in the insurance industry to estimate a cost basis for\nproperty replacement, including roofs.\n\n                                               7\n\fpossibly contributed to some staple failures. Green agreed that Kimmel’s photos\nrevealed “conditions consistent with wind damage.” When asked whether there\nwas wind damage to Hanson’s roof, Green answered “yes.” Green indicated that\nthe damaged shingles could be replaced without replacing the entire roof and could\nbe repaired for less than the policy’s $4000 deductible. Green opined that the\nunsealed condition of Hanson’s roof was not caused by a wind event, but rather by\nthermal expansion and contraction. Although Green stated Hanson’s roof was in\n“excellent” condition and was “aging extremely well,” he also opined it was a “bad\nroof” that had been defectively installed because 80 to 85 percent of the staples had\nbeen overdriven. Green also stated it was “true” that Hanson’s roof needed to be\nreplaced.\n\n      One of Hanson’s trial counsel, Richard Daly, testified regarding attorney’s\nfees. He described the case as “difficult,” involving as many as fifteen raised\ndefenses, at least five depositions, discovery disputes, legal challenges, and\nmultiple experts on each side. Daly described his firm’s method of keeping time\nrecords in a certain computer program.        The trial court admitted a summary\ncontaining billing entries in Hanson’s case from October 22, 2012 through May 15,\n2014. The summary contains line items with information about the date, the\nbilling professional, description of tasks performed, the hours and rate, and the\namount. The summary totaled just over $157,000. Daly described the work spent\non Hanson’s contract and bad faith claims as inextricably intertwined and\nestimated that five percent of the time was spent solely on bad faith issues. Daly\ntestified that attorney’s fees of $149,224.11 were fair, reasonable, and necessary.\n\n      State Farm’s expert on attorney’s fees, Charles Levy, opined that Hanson’s\ncase was “a plain run-of-the-mill lawsuit” and could have been tried for fewer\nhours at lower rates for approximately $30,000 to $40,000.\n\n                                          8\n\f      Question 1 of the jury charge asked whether State Farm failed to comply\nwith the terms of the insurance policy issued to Hanson. The jury was instructed\nthat: the insurance policy covers physical loss to Hanson’s property caused by a\nJune 1, 2012 wind event; the policy does not cover wear and tear, marring,\nscratching, deterioration, inherent vice, latent defect, or mechanical breakdown;\nand the policy does not cover defect, weakness, inadequacy, fault or unsoundness\nin design, specifications, workmanship, construction, grading, compaction,\nmaterials used in construction or repair, or maintenance. The jury answered “yes”\nto question 1.\n\n      Question 2 asked the jury what sum of money would fairly and reasonably\ncompensate Hanson for her damages resulting from State Farm’s failure to comply\nwith the policy. The jury awarded $12,878 as “the cost to repair or replace any\nphysical loss to Ginger Hanson’s property as a result of a wind event on June 1,\n2012, less the deductible of $4,000.”\n\n      Question 3 asked the jury what is a reasonable fee for the necessary services\nof Hanson’s attorneys in the current lawsuit. For representation prior to and\nthrough trial, the jury awarded $70,000.        The jury awarded $45,000 for\nrepresentation in an appeal in the court of appeals, and a total of $35,000 for\nrepresentation in the Supreme Court of Texas.       For representation before the\nsettlement offer’s deadline, the jury awarded $15,000.\n\n      The trial court rendered final judgment in favor of Hanson and against State\nFarm consistent with the jury’s verdict, and rendered that Hanson recover nothing\nfrom Traise. State Farm timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                                II.      ANALYSIS\n\nA. State Farm’s first issue\n\n      In what we construe as its first issue, State Farm presents three distinct\nsubparts. First, State Farm contends there is no proof that Hanson’s roof sustained\na covered physical loss on June 1, 2012. Second, State Farm asserts any physical\nloss was not covered because it conclusively established that an exclusion applied.\nThird, State Farm argues that Hanson cannot recover replacement costs as damages\nbecause she did not prove she was entitled to them.\n\n      1. Standard of review\n\n      The test for legal sufficiency is whether the evidence at trial “would enable\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.” City of\nKeller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). In making this determination,\nwe must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, crediting any\nfavorable evidence if a reasonable factfinder could and disregarding any contrary\nevidence unless a reasonable factfinder could not. Id. at 827. We assume jurors\nmade all inferences in favor of their verdict if reasonable minds could, and\ndisregarded all other inferences. Id. at 821. We cannot substitute our judgment for\nthat of the jury, so long as the evidence falls within the zone of reasonable\ndisagreement. Id. at 822. The factfinder is the only judge of witness credibility\nand the weight to give to testimony. Id. at 819.\n\n      We will sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only when: (1) the record\ndiscloses the complete absence of a vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules of law\nor evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact,\n(3) the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla,\nor (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact. Id. at 810.\n\n\n                                          10\n\fMore than a scintilla of evidence exists if the evidence “rises to a level that would\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.” Service\nCorp. Int’l v. Guerra, 348 S.W.3d 221, 228 (Tex. 2011). Evidence is conclusive\nonly if reasonable people could not differ in their conclusions. City of Keller, 168\nS.W.3d at 816. To successfully challenge the legal sufficiency of an adverse\nfinding on an issue on which it has the burden of proof, a party must conclusively\nestablish all vital facts in support of that issue. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46\nS.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001) (per curiam).\n\n       2. Legally sufficient evidence supports the jury’s answer to question 1.\n\n       State Farm first argues Hanson did not prove that her shingles were in a\n“satisfactory state,” or sealed, before the June 1, 2012 storm.6 State Farm points to\nHanson’s testimony that she did not ask her inspector to check for unsealed\nshingles when she purchased the house, and did not know whether they were\nsealed in 2011 or whether any other weather event had affected the sealing.\n\n       The evidence presented, however, reasonably supports the jury’s finding that\nHanson’s shingles were sealed prior to June 1, 2012. The inspection of Hanson’s\nhouse prior to closing found only cosmetic issues, no substantive damage, “nothing\nreally wrong with the roof that required repair.” The seller’s disclosure did not\nindicate any roof damage. State Farm generated an underwriting report in June\n2011 to determine whether to issue a policy on Hanson’s house. The report\nindicated that there were no concerns regarding the roof—no hail damage, no\n\n       6\n          State Farm cites Lennar Corp. v. Great American Insurance Co., 200 S.W.3d 651, 678–\n79 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied), abrogated by Gilbert Texas\nConstruction, L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327 S.W.3d 118 (Tex. 2010). However,\nunlike here, the circumstances in Lennar revealed that the exterior insulation and finish system at\nissue had not been physically injured or changed to constitute property damage, but rather was\n“already in an unsatisfactory state when applied to the homes because it is inherently defective.”\nId. at 679.\n\n                                                11\n\fcurled shingles, no loose or missing shingles, no valley wear, no missing or\nreplaced ridge row, no patched areas, no stain or rotting under the eaves, and no\ninterior leaks. Kimmel’s and Freeman’s testimony supports that State Farm found\nno issues in 2011 precluding roof coverage. State Farm’s corporate representative,\nRandy Teufel, the team manager who supervised both Flores and Traise, testified\nthe report showed that Hanson’s roof was in “good condition.”            Traise also\ntestified that the report indicated “no problems noted with the roof.”\n\n      State Farm also argues there is no evidence that a wind event caused the\nunsealed condition of Hanson’s roof. State Farm contends that Campbell and\nKimmel did not testify regarding what caused the sealant to fail, only that the wind\nlifted the shingles so that they pulled and tore through the staples. However, State\nFarm’s expert Green, when asked “what are the scientifically recognized causes of\nunsealed shingles,” testified that shingles “can become loose because of wind” and\nagreed “wind can cause sealant failure.” West agreed that a windstorm could\ncause shingles to “flap in the wind.” In any event, the evidence was not limited to\nunsealed shingles, or even pulled-through shingles.         Even assuming without\ndeciding solely for purposes of our analysis that purely unsealed shingles are not\nevidence of accidental direct physical loss due to wind, there is no dispute that\n“torn, ripped, folded, creased,” “missing,” or “displaced” shingles can constitute\nevidence of accidental direct physical loss due to wind. Campbell indicated that\nTraise wanted to find “more missing shingles”; in other words, Traise located some\nmissing shingles. Kimmel located “wind-creased” shingle damage and areas of\n“messed-up” edging caused by flying debris or by a tree “blown into the roof\nduring the storm.” Freeman saw the same damage as Kimmel. West observed\n“displaced” shingle tabs. He agreed that photos taken by Kimmel showed shingle\ntabs with tears and creases. Green located a missing ridge shingle and “wind-\n\n\n                                         12\n\fblown debris damage” on eave shingles. Green also agreed that Kimmel’s photos\nshowed creased shingles. This evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s\nfinding of physical loss.\n\n       Next, State Farm asserts Hanson produced no evidence that a wind event\ncaused pulled-through damage to the shingles. State Farm argues that Campbell’s\nand Kimmel’s expert testimony was not probative because it is conclusory or\nspeculative.7      State Farm essentially contends that Campbell’s and Kimmel’s\nopinions amount to no evidence because they did not adequately explain or link\ntheir opinions to the facts.8 State Farm also complains that Campbell and Kimmel\ndid not rule out alternate causes of the purported pulled-through shingle damage.9\nState Farm contends that the pulled-through shingle damage was instead caused by\na construction defect: overdriven staples. Again, setting aside the pulled-through\nshingles,10 State Farm’s position completely fails to recognize that the jury was\npresented with evidence of other types of shingle damage—such as creases,\n“stripes,” edging tears, and displacement—which Teufel acknowledged “would be\nconsidered a covered loss, that would be accidental direct physical loss and we\nwould have considered repairing or replacing the roof.”\n\n       Finally, State Farm argues that there was no evidence Hanson’s roof\n\n\n       7\n          Hanson correctly notes that she did not designate Campbell as an expert and that the\ntrial court sustained State Farm’s objection to any expert opinion testimony by Campbell.\n       8\n          See City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d 809, 818 (Tex. 2009); Coastal Transp.\nCo., Inc. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 232 (Tex. 2004).\n       9\n           See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 313 S.W.3d 837, 840 (Tex. 2010) (per curiam).\n       10\n           Even if pulled-through shingles were the sole type of damage at issue, there was\nevidence that wind can unseal shingles, can lift unsealed shingles, and can pull shingles through\ntheir fasteners. There was also evidence that the wind event on June 1, 2012 was strong enough\nto topple trees and cause tree branches to fall. Moreover, there was evidence from Freeman\nexplaining that overdriven staples “go straight through [the shingle] almost like a bullet hole”\ncompared to when wind pulls the shingle through the staple resulting in tearing.\n\n                                                13\n\fsustained physical loss on June 1, 2012.           We disagree.      We already have\ndetermined there was evidence to support that the shingles were in a satisfactory\nstate prior to the June 1, 2012 storm. We already have determined that there was\nevidence to support that Hanson’s shingles were damaged by wind. Moreover,\nthere was evidence that a wind event occurred on June 1, 2012. Campbell testified\nregarding his response to the June 1, 2012 wind event; he was tarping houses and\nwas making claims and adjuster appointments in Hanson’s neighborhood the next\nday. Kimmel confirmed the date of the storm with Hanson’s neighbors, several of\nwhom sustained roof damage, and with the neighborhood golf course’s\ngreenskeeper. The wind was powerful enough to knock over a “tremendous”\nnumber of trees. According to Kimmel, State Farm uses precisely this type of\nevidence to determine the date of loss when adjusting claims.              State Farm’s\noperation guidelines list observation of neighboring properties as a factor in\ndetermining a loss. Further, wind speeds of almost 50 mph recorded at Hooks\nAirport—the closest “official wind gauge”—on June 1, 2012 were capable of\nblowing over small trees and causing branches to fall. State Farm points to no\nevidence, much less evidence the jury could not reasonably disregard, that supports\nsome other specific wind event instead caused Hanson’s physical loss.11 The jury\nreasonably could have found that Hanson’s shingles suffered accidental direct\nphysical loss during the June 1, 2012 wind event.\n\n      We overrule this subissue.\n\n      3. State Farm failed to conclusively establish any policy exclusion.\n\n      Having determined Hanson met her initial burden to establish coverage\n\n\n      11\n         The only other specific storm discussed was Hurricane Ike, which occurred in\nSeptember 2008, several years before State Farm issued its underwriting report on Hanson’s\nhouse.\n\n                                           14\n\funder the terms of her policy, we next consider whether State Farm conclusively\nestablished that Hanson’s loss falls within an exclusion to avoid liability. See\nGilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 124\n(Tex. 2010); Francis, 46 S.W.3d at 241.        State Farm contends the evidence\nconclusively established that the unsealed shingles were caused by “wear and tear,\ndeterioration, latent defect, or inadequate, faulty, or unsound workmanship or\nmaterials used in construction.” State Farm’s position again focuses on shingles\nwhose only sustained damage was their unsealed nature or pulled-through tearing\nand fails to account for evidence of other types of (undisputed) wind damage to\nHanson’s shingles for which State Farm authorizes repair or replacement.\n\n      In any event, State Farm did not conclusively establish that any exclusion\napplies to avoid liability. State Farm’s underwriting report did not indicate any\nconcerns that would preclude or lessen coverage of Hanson’s roof. Moreover,\nState Farm’s claim file noted that Hanson’s shingles were in good general\ncondition and there was no “excessive wear and tear to the ridge shingles or to the\nsouth slope of s[h]ingles”; Traise found no “excessive wear and tear on the\nshingles”; West stated that Hanson’s shingles were in “real good condition”; and\nGreen testified Hanson’s shingles were “excellent” and “aging extremely well.”\nState Farm points to Green’s testimony that thermal debonding caused Hanson’s\nshingles to unseal, at least at the corners. But inspection photos reflected that the\n“lifted” shingles were unsealed throughout, not just at their corners. Further,\nFreeman testified that sealant actually becomes “better bonded” over time.\nTherefore, State Farm did not conclusively prove that wear and tear or\ndeterioration caused the unsealed or pulled-through shingles, much less the other\ntypes of shingle damage.\n\n      Nor did State Farm conclusively prove that stapling defects caused the\n\n                                         15\n\funsealed or pulled-through shingles, or any other types of shingle damage.\nAccording to Teufel and Green, the overdriven staples were a latent and a\nconstruction defect. But Freeman testified that Hanson’s roof only had a “handful”\nof overdriven staples common to “any roof.” Freeman explained that a pulled-\nthrough shingle was not “overdriven” based on the space underneath the staple and\nwhere the staple did not “go down into the decking.”                    Green acknowledged\n“[c]ertainly some of these staples were installed properly.” And although Green\nopined that Hanson’s entire roof needed to be replaced due to defective stapling,\nWest did not believe that all her shingles needed to be replaced.\n\n      We overrule this second subissue.\n\n      4. Hanson did not have to prove any actual repair or replacement.\n      State Farm argues even if Hanson provided evidence that her roof sustained\na covered loss, she failed to prove that she satisfied the policy’s condition\nprecedent to trigger any obligation for State Farm to make replacement cost\npayments. State Farm points to language within the loss settlement endorsement of\nHanson’s policy stating that State Farm would only pay the actual cash value at the\ntime of the loss of the damaged part of the property, up to policy limits and not to\nexceed the cost to repair or replace the damaged part, “until actual repair or\nreplacement is completed.”12\n\n\n      12\n           Under an endorsement for loss settlement, the policy provides:\n      A1 – Replacement Cost Loss Settlement – Similar Construction is replaced with\n      the following:\n                a. We will pay the cost to repair or replace with similar construction and\n                for the same use on the premises shown in the Declarations, the damaged\n                part of the property covered under SECTION I – COVERAGES,\n                COVERAGE A – DWELLING, except for wood fences, subject to the\n                following:\n                       (1) until actual repair or replacement is completed, we will pay\n                                                16\n\f      A condition precedent may be either a condition to the formation of a\ncontract or a condition to an obligation to perform an existing agreement.

In other words, conditions precedent may relate to either the formation of\ncontracts or to the liability under them. Id. at 143–44. We recognize particular\nburdens of pleading and proof with regard to conditions precedent:\n\n      When a plaintiff avers generally that all conditions precedent have\n      been performed, he is required to prove the performance of only those\n      conditions precedent specifically denied by the defendant. The effect\n      of this rule is to shift the burden of pleading to the defendant, but not\n      the burden of proof, when the plaintiff has made a general allegation\n      that all conditions precedent have been performed.\n\nLidawi v. Progressive Cty. Mut. Ins. Co., 112 S.W.3d 725, 729 n.1 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet) (citing Trevino v. Allstate Ins. Co., 651 S.W.2d\n8, 11 (Tex.

When such performances or\n       occurrences have been so plead, the party so pleading same shall be\n       required to prove only such of them as are specifically denied by the\n       opposite party.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 54.\n\n       In her petition, Hanson averred that “[a]ll conditions precedent to Plaintiff’s\nright to recover have been fully performed, or have been waived by Defendants.”\nBy operation of rule 54, Hanson was required to prove only the conditions\nprecedent that State Farm specifically denied. See id. In its answer, with regard to\nconditions precedent, State Farm alleged “[s]pecifically, Plaintiff has failed to\nprove that the alleged loss was a covered loss, and/or has failed to segregate the\nportion of the alleged loss which is covered from the portion of the alleged loss\nwhich is not covered.” State Farm also alleged that “Plaintiff has not provided\ntimely or adequate notice of their [sic] intent to sue.” State Farm, however, did not\nspecifically deny that Hanson was not entitled to repair or replacement costs\nbecause she had not completed actual repair or replacement.13                        Therefore,\nassuming without deciding actual repair or replacement was a condition precedent\nto Hanson’s recovery of repair or replacement benefits pursuant to her policy,14\nbecause State Farm did not specifically deny this condition precedent, Hanson was\nnot required to prove at trial that she had completed any actual repair or\n       13\n            Traise’s allegations were identical to State Farm’s.\n       14\n            State Farm relies on Fitzhugh 25 Partners, L.P. v. KILN Syndicate KLN 501, 261\nS.W.3d 861, 864 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied), where the Dallas court of appeals\ndetermined that the insurance policy provision at issue—“Replacement cost valuation does not\napply until the damaged or destroyed property is repaired or replaced.”—constituted a condition\nprecedent to the insured’s recovery under the policy. Hanson maintains Fitzhugh 25 Partners is\ndistinguishable because there the insurer did not wholesale deny coverage, but rather disputed its\nliability for any additional replacement costs after acknowledging coverage for the insured’s\nclaim and tendering actual cash value of the damaged property.\n\n                                                  18\n\freplacement.

(“Inasmuch\nas the Bencon Parties only pleaded failure to comply with certain alleged\nconditions in the Prime Contract in the event that the entire Prime Contract applies\nto Boyer, and because the entire Prime Contract does not apply to Boyer, the\nBencon Parties have not specifically denied the alleged conditions precedent in\nquestion, and Boyer did not have to prove compliance therewith.”).15\n\n       We overrule this third subissue. Having overruled all three of its subparts,\nwe overrule State Farm’s first issue.\n\nB. State Farm’s attorney’s fee issues\n\n       Because we have concluded that the evidence is legally sufficient to support\nthe jury’s liability finding,16 we necessarily reject State Farm’s argument that the\njury’s attorney’s fee award should be reversed because Hanson did not prevail on\nher contract claim.       Next, we turn to State Farm’s specific challenges to the\nattorney’s fee award.\n\n       1. Standard of review\n\n       The prevailing party in a breach of contract suit is entitled to attorney’s fees.\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (West 2013); Haden v. David J.\nSacks, P.C., 332 S.W.3d 503, 510 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet.\ndenied). An award of attorney’s fees must be supported by evidence that the fees\n\n       15\n            See also Sharifi, 370 S.W.3d at 147 (where defendant did not specifically deny\nconditions precedent, plaintiff did not have burden to prove they were satisfied on summary\njudgment); cf. U.S. Tire-Tech, Inc. v. Boeran, B.V., 110 S.W.3d 194, 200 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) (where defendant specifically denied condition precedent of notice,\nplaintiff required to prove notice at trial).\n       16\n         Aside from its argument relating to condition precedent, which we have overruled,\nState Farm does not challenge the jury’s award of damages for the cost to repair or replace\nHanson’s roof.\n\n                                               19\n\fare reasonable and necessary. See Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d\n1, 10 (Tex. 1991). The reasonableness of attorney’s fees is generally a fact issue.\nSee Garcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d 638, 642 (Tex. 2010). We review attorney’s fee\nawards for an abuse of discretion. Ridge Oil Co. v. Guinn Invs., Inc., 148 S.W.3d\n143, 163 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      2. Legal sufficiency\n\n      Here, Hanson’s trial counsel applied to recover their attorney’s fees under\nthe lodestar method. The lodestar method is a way to calculate total attorney’s fees\nwhere the number of hours worked is multiplied by the prevailing hourly rate. See\nLong v. Griffin, 442 S.W.3d 253, 255 (Tex. 2014) (per curiam).\n\n      In El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, the Supreme Court of Texas explained that\ngeneralities about tasks performed and hours spent provide insufficient information\nfor the fact finder to meaningfully review whether the tasks and hours were\nreasonable and necessary under the lodestar method. 370 S.W.3d 757, 763 (Tex.\n2012). Sufficient evidence includes, at a minimum, evidence “of the services\nperformed, who performed them and at what hourly rate, when they were\nperformed, and how much time the work required.” Id. at 764. Because the\ntestimony in El Apple only included the total number of hours worked and\ngeneralities about discovery and the length of trial, the Court remanded for a\nredetermination of attorney’s fees. Id. at 765. In so holding, the Court stated:\n\n      In this case, neither attorney indicated how the 890 hours they spent in\n      the aggregate were devoted to any particular task or category of tasks.\n      Neither attorney presented time records or other documentary\n      evidence. Nor did they testify based on their recollection of such\n      records. The attorneys instead based their time estimates on\n      generalities such as the amount of discovery in the case, the number\n      of pleadings filed, the number of witnesses questioned, and the length\n      of the trial. While all this is relevant, it provides none of the\n\n                                         20\n\f      specificity needed for the trial court to make a meaningful lodestar\n      determination. The court could not discern from the evidence how\n      many hours each of the tasks required and whether that time was\n      reasonable. Without at least some indication of the time spent on\n      various parts of the case, a court has little basis upon which to conduct\n      a meaningful review of the fee award.\n\nId. at 763.\n\n      El Apple involved a claim under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\nAct, which mandates use of the lodestar method. 370 S.W.3d at 758–59. In Long\nv. Griffin, a case involving claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment,\nthe Court revisited the specificity requirements of evidence to support attorney’s\nfees under the lodestar method. The Court characterized the attorney affidavit at\nissue as “only offer[ing] generalities”:\n\n      It indicates that one attorney spent 300 hours on the case, another\n      expended 344.50 hours, and the attorneys’ respective hourly rates.\n      The affidavit posits that the case involved extensive discovery, several\n      pretrial hearings, multiple summary judgment motions, and a four and\n      one-half day trial, and that litigating the matter required understanding\n      a related suit that settled after ten years of litigation. But no evidence\n      accompanied the affidavit to inform the trial court the time spent on\n      specific tasks. See El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763. The affidavit does\n      claim that 30% of the aggregate time was expended on the assignment\n      claim (part of which the Griffins prevailed on) and that the assignment\n      issue was inextricably intertwined with matters that consumed 95% of\n      the two attorneys’ time on the matter. But without any evidence of\n      the time spent on specific tasks, the trial court had insufficient\n      information to meaningfully review the fee request.

Health & Safety\nCode Ann. §§ 431.001–.415 (West 2010 & Supp. 2015), our sister court\nconsidered whether evidence on attorney’s fees was too general under El Apple\nand Long to support the judgment’s award of attorney’s fees.

There, the State presented expert testimony regarding its\nattorney’s fees—the reasonableness and necessity of the work done on the case, the\nhours spent, the experience and qualifications of the timekeepers for the State, and\ntheir prevailing hourly rates. Med. Disc. Pharmacy, 2015 WL 4100483, at *17.\nThe State also submitted a computer-generated summary of the time records of the\nState’s timekeepers. Id. The summary identified the case, each timekeeper, a\ndescription of activities, and the hours devoted. Id. The activities were divided\ninto categories such as “attend/appear at hearing,” “drafting/revising pleadings,”\nand “reviewing/researching law.” Id. However, the appellants argued that “the\ndepartment offered only information about general categories of work[,]” and\n“identified no specific tasks and apportioned the time its lawyers purportedly spent\nonly among general categories.”          Id. at *16.    They also complained that the\nsummary did not say which hearings were attended, which pleadings were revised,\nand what law was researched. Id. at *17.\n\n       Our sister court rejected such arguments, concluding the State’s evidence of\n\n“Gonzalez offered nothing to document his time in the case other than the ‘thousands and\nthousands and thousands of pages’ generated during his representation of the Montanos and his\nbelief that he had reasonably spent 1,356 hours preparing and trying the case.”)\n\n                                             22\n\fattorney’s fees was “much more detailed than that provided in El Apple [or] Long”\nand was sufficient for the trial court to conduct a meaningful review of the number\nof hours the State spent on the case and to properly apply the lodestar method.\nMed. Disc. Pharmacy, 2015 WL 4100483, at *17. In doing so, the First Court of\nAppeals particularly noted how “nothing in El Apple [or] Long . . . requires such\ndetail” and found that the State’s evidence was complied with El Apple “by\nindicating how long each person spent working on particular categories of tasks.”\nMed. Disc. Pharmacy, 2015 WL 4100483, at *17.\n\n      Here, State Farm raises a similar complaint based on El Apple and Long.\nHowever, having reviewed Hanson’s evidence, we conclude that her evidence is\nsufficiently detailed. Hanson presented expert testimony from Daly regarding his\nattorney’s fees, the reasonableness and necessity of the work done on the case, his\nexperience and qualifications and those of his two associates and the additional\nlawyer, John Black, brought in to help try the case, and the prevailing rates of each.\nDaly described keeping time in a particular computer program:\n\n            [C]ontemporaneously whenever I do my work, I write down\n      what the time is, who—what you were doing in your law firm and\n      then you would write down what the task was. And then you’ve got a\n      computer program that puts an hourly rate to it, whatever hourly rate\n      you assigned and tells you who did that.\n             So, basically, you know, on a daily or bi-weekly or, you know,\n      every third day you will write down your time and, you know, the\n      computer program keeps track of it. And, you know, in this case, for\n      example, it started in October of 2012, and then the time I’ve written\n      actually goes through tomorrow because we’re assuming we’re still\n      going to be here tomorrow.\n\nHanson also submitted a ten-page computer-generated summary, which contained\ndetails regarding the nature of the work performed, who performed the services\nand his rate, approximately when the services were performed, and the number of\n\n                                         23\n\fhours worked. See El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763.\n\n       State Farm challenges a particular entry that provided the total daily time\nspent but where the description of the work included more than one specific task.18\nEssentially, State Farm argues that El Apple requires assigning a particular number\nof minutes to each individual task. We cannot agree that such level of detail is\nrequired to be able to meaningfully review a fee award. See John Moore Servs.,\n2016 WL 3162206, at *6–7 (concluding that “block-billing technique” was\n“distinguishable from El Apple, in which there was far less evidence of attorney's\nfees, and it was presented in a far more summary fashion” and “distinguishable\nfrom the aggregate and conclusory time estimates provided in Montano” because\nentries “describe the work that was done, specify the date the work was done,\nprovide the total amount of time spent accomplishing the tasks, and identify the\nperson who did the work.”).             Hanson’s attorneys’ time entries could be\nmeaningfully reviewed because they included details about the nature of the work,\nwho did it at what rate, what day the work was performed, and the time worked.\nSee El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 762. Moreover, the entries were detailed enough to\nprovide “some indication of the time spent on various parts of the case”; the daily\nentry challenged by State Farm described tasks and time spent relating to\nformation of the attorney-client relationship and pre-suit investigation of the\ndefendant. See id.\n\n       State Farm also takes issue with generalities in the summary, such as the\ndescription “Prepared for trial” provided for each attorney who billed hours on a\nparticular trial day because “[t]hat is merely a general category for work that can\n       18\n           This October 23, 2012 entry indicated that Daly worked 3.40 hours at a rate of\n$450.00/hour doing the following tasks: “Draft Fee Agreement. Correspond with client re same.\nInvestigate hail claims against this particular Insurance company. Multiple conferences with\nconsulting experts. Research regarding removal to federal court and Defendant’s propensity to\nattempt.”\n\n                                             24\n\fbe comp[o]sed of many specific tasks.” Although State Farm acknowledges that\n“Prepare for trial” describes a particular category of tasks, it insists El Apple\nrequires further details.        We disagree.        See Med. Disc. Pharmacy, 2015 WL\n4100483, at *17 (concluding that El Apple does not require more level of detail for\nparticular category of tasks than, e.g., “attend/appear at hearing”). Even if El\nApple required more, Daly expounded on what trial preparation entailed:\n\n             It’s the most grueling thing that you can do as a lawyer. Last\n      night for the first time I got in bed at 11:30. Okay. That was good.\n      The prior six nights, 2:30 in the morning is when I went to bed. The\n      problem is you’ve got to go to trial, then you’ve got to go prepare for\n      an entire new day. You want to be—make sure you’re prepared so\n      they don’t waste your time because I don’t want to come in here and\n      bumble around and stumble around. You’ve got to get your exhibits\n      ready. You’ve got to get—you know, your associates to make sure\n      that everything is all set up.\n\nMoreover, State Farm has not pointed us to, and we have not located, any daily\ntime entries that failed to describe particular tasks or, at the least, categories of\ntasks, such as “prepare for trial.”\n\n      We overrule State Farm’s legal sufficiency challenge to the award of\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      3. Rule 167 settlement offer\n\n      There is no dispute that State Farm made a rule 167 settlement offer and that\nHanson did not accept the offer by the stated December 4, 2013 deadline, which\nconstituted a rejection. See Tex. Rs. Civ. P. 167.2(b),19 167.3(c). State Farm\n\n      19\n           Rule 167.2(b) provides:\n      (b) Requirements of an offer. A settlement offer must:\n                (1) be in writing;\n                (2) state that it is made under Rule 167 and Chapter 42 of the Texas Civil\n                Practice and Remedies Code;\n\n                                                25\n\fcontends that pursuant to rule 167.4 it is entitled to litigation costs accruing after\nHanson rejected its settlement offer.\n\n       Rule 167.4(a) provides that if a settlement offer made under the rule “is\nrejected, and the judgment to be awarded on the monetary claims covered by the\noffer is significantly less favorable to the offeree than was the offer, the court must\naward the offeror litigation costs against the offeree from the time the offer was\nrejected to the time of judgment.” Id. 167.4(a). Rule 167.4(b) states that “[a]\njudgment award on monetary claims is significantly less favorable than an offer to\nsettle those claims if: (1) the offeree is a claimant and the judgment would be less\nthan 80 percent of the offer; or (2) the offeree is a defendant and the judgment\nwould be more than 120 percent of the offer.” Id. 167.4(b). Litigation costs\nawarded to a defendant under rule 167 “must be made a setoff to the claimant’s\njudgment against the defendant.” Id. 167.4(g).\n\n       Here, the judgment would need to be at least $24,000 to meet the 80 percent\nthreshold set by the rule and entitle State Farm to an award of litigation costs.\nState Farm argues that the judgment was only 43 percent because it offered Hanson\n$30,000 and the jury only awarded her $12,878 for the cost to repair or replace her\nphysical loss under the policy. However, State Farm’s position fails to account for\nthe attorney’s fee award. Although State Farm argues that “monetary claims” do\n\n               (3) identify the party or parties making the offer and the party or parties to\n               whom the offer is made;\n               (4) state the terms by which all monetary claims—including any attorney\n               fees, interest, and costs that would be recoverable up to the time of the\n               offer—between the offeror or offerors on the one hand and the offeree or\n               offerees on the other may be settled;\n               (5) state a deadline—no sooner than 14 days after the offer is served—by\n               which the offer must be accepted;\n               (6) be served on all parties to whom the offer is made.\nTex. R. Civ. P. 167.2(b).\n\n                                                26\n\fnot include attorney’s fees for breach of contract, its settlement offer covered all\nHanson’s “claims for monetary damages, [her] attorney’s fees, exemplary\ndamages, interest and costs.” See Tex. P. Civ. P. 167.2(b)(4) (settlement offer\nmust state “terms by which all monetary claims—including any attorney fees,\ninterest and costs that would be recoverable up to the time of the offer . . . may be\nsettled”). Texas courts have not determined whether total attorney’s fees or fees as\nof date of settlement rejection should be used in a rule 167.4 calculation. See\nCompass Bank v. Nacim, 459 S.W.3d 95, 110–11 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2015, no\npet.). We need not reach that question because, in this case, even using the lesser\namount of only accrued fees, State Farm’s argument fails.20                       Here, the jury\nexpressly found that a reasonable fee for the necessary services of Hanson’s\nattorneys for representation before December 5, 2013, the date of the settlement\nrejection, was $15,000. Adding damages of $12,878 to fees of $15,000 equals\n$27,878.         $27,878 divided by the settlement offer amount of $30,000 equals\napproximately 93 percent. Therefore, the trial court was not required to award\nState Farm litigation costs and was not required to apply any setoff.\n\n         Because we conclude that State Farm was not entitled to litigation costs\nagainst Hanson, we do not reach State Farm’s argument under rule 167.4(f) that\nHanson is precluded from any award of attorney’s fees accruing after December 4,\n2013. We overrule State Farm’s challenge to Hanson’s award of attorney’s fees\nbased on its rule 167 offer.\n\n         4. Segregation\n\n         Because attorney’s fees are only recoverable pursuant to a contract or\nstatute, “fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims\n\n         20\n              Including the total amount of attorney’s fees, the judgment far exceeds the settlement\noffer.\n\n                                                  27\n\ffor which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Tony Gullo\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006).               Texas courts\nrecognize a narrow exception “when discrete legal services advance both a\nrecoverable and unrecoverable claim” and thus “are so intertwined that they need\nnot be segregated.” Id. at 313–14; see In re Lesikar, 285 S.W.3d 577, 585 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (“If a legal service necessary to the\nlitigation of a claim for which attorneys’ fees are available also advanced a claim\nfor which attorneys’ fees are not recoverable, then the exception to the general fee-\nsegregation rule applies, and the amount of time or money that was reasonable to\nexpend in performing the service need not be segregated among the claims it\nadvanced.”). However, if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which\nattorney’s fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\nunrecoverable fees. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313. But, even when fee segregation is\nrequired, attorneys are not required to keep separate records documenting the exact\namount of time prosecuting one claim versus another. See id. at 314. Rather,\nsegregation is sufficiently established if an attorney testifies that a given\npercentage of the time worked would have been necessary even if the claim for\nwhich attorney’s fees are unrecoverable had not been asserted. See id.; Alief Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Perry, 440 S.W.3d 228, 246 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013,\npet. denied) (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314, and Citizens Nat’l Bank of Tex. v.\nNXS Constr., Inc., 387 S.W.3d 74, 87 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no\npet.)).\n\n          Here, Daly stated:\n\n                Chapa is a case that basically says when you have different\n          causes of action—like here we’ve got a breach of contract cause of\n          action and we’ve got a bad faith cause of action. And it says you need\n          to apportion your time to each in case you’re not successful on one of\n          them.\n                                           28\n\f       But what basically happens is in this case we’re trying to get a\nnew roof. So 95 percent of the time that we spend on this case is\ntowards that. And that—so in other words, the breach of—the work\nyou do for breach of c[ontract] and bad faith is inextricably\nintertwined. That’s the terminology they use.\n       I would estimate that 5 percent of the time that we’ve spent was\nspent solely on bad faith issues.\nIn addition, Daly testified:\n\nQ. (By Mr. Black) So I take the number that you’ve got at the bottom\nthere and it’s $157,078.01. Now, the answer that you gave me about\ninextricably intertwining and causes of action that are so intertwined,\nsounded like a lawyer answer. And so I just—I want you to help me\nunderstand a little bit better what it means when you talk about\nseparating out time and why you’re doing that.\nA. Sure. Let’s say for example we want to go take the deposition of\ntheir expert. Now, we’re going to have to drive to the deposition, ask\nthe questions, prepare for the deposition, read the deposition,\nregardless of whether or not it’s a breach of contract claim or a bad\nfaith claim.\nQ. And stop right there. And why does it matter that you’re talking a\nbreach of contract claim versus a bad faith claim, what's the\ndifference?\nA. I’m not sure I understand what you mean.\nQ. I mean, do you get attorney’s fees for both?\nA. Oh, yeah, you do, you get attorney’s fees for both anyway.\nQ. All right. Keep going. I’m sorry I interrupted you.\nA. But, if for example, you don’t prevail on one of the claims or you\ndecide, you know, we’re not going to ask for any money for one of the\nclaims, then it would be improper for a jury to say, well, you know,\neither you didn’t ask for bad faith or you didn’t prevail on the bad\nfaith despite the fact you prevailed on the breach of contract, so we\nneed to knock 5 percent off because you spent 5 percent of your time\nsolely on bad faith.\nQ. So if you knocked 5 percent off this bill, and I’m just going to—\n\n\n                                  29\n\f      MR. BLACK: The Court can take judicial notice of this or people can\n      trust that I did the math correctly if you get cross-examined on it.\n      Q. (By Mr. Black) But 5 percent of that amount is $78[]53.90, which\n      yields $149,224.11.\n            Is this figure under the subtotal line the figure that would\n      represent 5 percent discounted off of your bill?\n      A. It is.\n      Q. All right. And do you think that that figure is a fair and reasonable\n      sum to request of a jury or anyone in a case like this?\n      A. I think it’s fair, reasonable and necessary. Yes.\n\n      There is no dispute that Hanson cannot recover attorney’s fees for any claim\naside from her contract claim against State Farm. As a result, Hanson generally\nwas required to segregate fees.      Hanson, however, provided evidence that 95\npercent of the attorney’s fees was for work related directly to prosecuting her\ncontract claim or for work that was so intertwined with that claim and that five\npercent of the attorney’s fees was for work attributable solely to bad faith claims.\n\n      State Farm asserts that Hanson’s attempt to segregate using a percentage\nestimate was unsupported and therefore insufficient, relying primarily on Farmers\nGroup Insurance, Inc. v. Poteet, 434 S.W.3d 316 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2014,\npet. denied). In Poteet, the court of appeals remanded for a redetermination of fees\nin part because the insured “failed to segregate her attorney’s fees related to the\nalleged breach of the appraisal provision from those fees incurred in pursuit of the\nclaims upon which she did not prevail in the prior appeal from the summary\njudgment and the claims upon which we have held that damages are not\nrecoverable on this appeal.”      Id. at 333.    The circumstances in Poteet are\ndistinguishable. Procedurally, there was a previous appeal where the appellate\ncourt affirmed a summary judgment on a multitude of claims in favor of the insurer\nand remanded for proceedings on the sole remaining claim of breach of the\n\n                                          30\n\fpolicy’s appraisal provision. Id. at 318. Moreover, in the second appeal, the\nPoteet court held that the trial court erred in failing to disregard the jury’s findings\nregarding two of the three awards of damages resulting from the insurer’s failure to\ncomply with the appraisal provision. Id. at 331–32. The insured’s attorney’s\npercentage estimate based on “the entire litigation” failed to account for these\ncircumstances. See id. at 332.       As a result, the Poteet court concluded that the\ninsured’s provided estimate was insufficient under Chapa:\n\n       Poteet’s attorney made his “rough estimate” by lumping together\n       hundreds of hours spent working to recover damages that Farmers had\n       no duty to pay. Most significantly, there is no estimate of the\n       reasonable and necessary fees incurred in pursuing the sole claim that\n       survived the first appeal of this lawsuit.\nPoteet, 434 S.W.3d at 333.\n\n       In contrast, Hanson’s case involved one continuous proceeding in the trial\ncourt, not proceedings both pre- and post-dating a remand after appeal.                  In\naddition, we already concluded that legally sufficient evidence supports the jury’s\nbreach finding (and State Farm otherwise does not challenge the jury’s actual\ndamages award). Further, Hanson presented evidence in the form of an estimate of\nthe reasonable and necessary fees incurred in, or at the least intertwined with, the\npursuit of her contract claim.\n\n       Nevertheless, State Farm argues the only way to properly segregate is to\nexamine each billing entry and deduct amounts that are not recoverable. See\nCitizens Nat’l Bank, 387 S.W.3d at 87–88 (attributing 66 percent of fees to\nUniform Fraudulent Transfer Act case).21 While we have held such a process\nsufficient, we do not necessarily require it under “the relaxed standard enunciated\n\n       21\n          The attorney in Citizens National Bank explained that he performed this review “in\n[his] mind” and “in [his] head.” 387 S.W.3d at 88.\n\n                                            31\n\fin Chapa”22:\n\n      Attorneys are not required to keep separate records documenting the\n      exact amount of time working on one recoverable claim versus an\n      unrecoverable claim. . . . Rather, segregation is sufficiently\n      established if, for example, an attorney testifies that a given\n      percentage of the drafting time would have been necessary even if the\n      claim for which attorney’s fees are unrecoverable had not been\n      asserted.\n\nPerry, 440 S.W.3d at 246 (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314, and Citizens Nat’l\nBank, 387 S.W.3d at 87). In Alief Independent School District v. Perry, we\nconsidered whether the plaintiff’s evidence from his attorney attributing\napproximately “80% of his attorney’s fees to each claim to each [defendant] for\nwhich fees were recoverable” was sufficient under the Chapa standard. Id. at 247.\nThis evidence consisted of redacted invoices, as well as affidavit testimony from\nhis attorney. Id. at 246. The attorney testified that all the discovery “would have\nbeen equally applicable” to the nonsuited claims. Id. He opined that less than ten\npercent of the time spent related solely to nonsuited claims.      Id. He further\nestimated an additional five percent reduction for each claim for which a defendant\nwas not liable or which was an alternative claim to account for legal research and\nanalysis attributable only to these claims. Id. at 247. We held such evidence\nsupported a conclusion that the plaintiff properly segregated his claims. Perry, 440\nS.W.3d at 247; see also Sentinel Integrity Sols., Inc. v. Mistras Group, Inc., 414\nS.W.3d 911, 929–30 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, pet. denied)\n(concluding evidence that attorney’s fees sought were for work directly related to\ndefense of claim or for work intertwined with such defense and that at least 90\npercent of work presented in admitted bills was necessary to defend claim was\nsufficiently segregated per Chapa).\n\n      22\n           Citizens Nat’l Bank, 387 S.W.3d at 88.\n\n                                               32\n\f       Here, Daly provided his opinion that the work on Hanson’s case involved\ninextricably intertwined claims. As reflected by Daly’s expert deposition example,\ndiscovery for her contract claim equally applied to her bad faith claims.\nApproximately 95 percent of the time, Hanson’s attorneys’ work went toward or\nwas intertwined with getting Hanson a new roof pursuant to the contract. Daly\nestimated that five percent of the attorneys’ time shown in the summary was spent\nsolely on bad faith issues. Further, the summary is consistent with Daly’s estimate.\nWhile not required by Chapa, see Perry, 440 S.W.3d at 246, the summary included\ndaily entries describing discrete legal tasks expressly relating to Hanson’s bad\nfaith, extra-contractual, or Insurance Code claims.23 Excising the entire amount of\nthose daily entries reduces the total balance by just over five percent. Moreover,\nDaly explained that the amount included in the summary did not include every fee\nincurred in the course of trial, particularly for the trial days themselves:\n\n              I mean, it is—we’ve put countless hours just in the past, you\n       know, weeks preparing for this case. And so you’re looking at 15, 16\n       hours a day. You’ll see that on the bills here we put ten. It’s not even\n       close. I mean, we’ve got—we’re here [from] 8:30 until 5:00 and then\n       I go back straight back to the office.\n\nSee Sentinel Integrity Sols., 414 S.W.3d at 929–30 (considering as part of\nsegregation analysis testimony that bills did not include every fee incurred).\n\n       We therefore conclude that Hanson’s evidence supporting her attorney’s fees\nwas sufficiently segregated under Chapa.\n\n       5. Excessiveness\n\n       Finally, State Farm contends that because the attorney’s fee award of\n\n       23\n          For the most part, we agree with State Farm’s statement that “[t]he fee statement\ncontains entries for non-recoverable fees for claims on which Hanson did not prevail.” However,\nwe do not agree that tasks involving research of State Farm’s policies with regard to denial of\nclaims or “wind lift” would necessarily only advance Hanson’s non-contract claims.\n\n                                              33\n\f$70,000 is unreasonably disproportionate to her damages award of $12,878 the\ntrial court abused its discretion when it denied State Farm’s motion for remittitur.\n\n      This court may only remit the jury’s award when we determine, after\nevaluation of the evidence, that the award is so against the great weight and\npreponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. Pope v. Moore, 711\nS.W.2d 622, 624 (Tex. 1986) (per curiam) (factual sufficiency is proper remittitur\nstandard). Here, the parties presented competing expert evidence regarding the\nreasonableness of the attorney’s fees award. Daly opined that Hanson’s case was\ndifficult and complicated with regard to defenses, discovery, and legal challenges.\nDaly testified that just under $150,000 in attorney’s fees was reasonable and\nnecessary. Levy opined that Hanson’s case was straightforward and reasonably\ncould have been tried by a second-year associate for $30,000 to $40,000.\nHowever, even such an amount would be approximately three times more than\nwhat the jury ultimately awarded Hanson as actual damages. See Bencon Mgmt.,\n178 S.W.3d at 209–10 (fee award of over $282,000 compared to actual damages of\n$81,336.83 was not factually insufficient); see also Metroplex Mailing Services,\nLLC v. RR Donnelley & Sons Co., 410 S.W.3d 889, 900 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013,\nno pet.) (“[T]here is no rule that fees cannot be more than the actual damages\nawarded.”). The jury charge included an instruction providing eight factors to\nconsider in determining a reasonable fee, tracking Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry\nEquipment Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997), which included “the amount\ninvolved and the results obtained.”       Ultimately, the jury determined that a\nreasonable fee for the necessary services of Hanson’s attorneys for trial\nrepresentation was less than half of what she sought.\n\n      Based on our review of all the evidence, we cannot conclude that the jury’s\naward is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence to require\n\n                                          34\n\fremittitur. See Pope, 711 S.W.2d at 624. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion.\n\n       We overrule all of State Farm’s challenges to Hanson’s attorney’s fee award.\n\n                            III.      CONCLUSION\n\n       Having overruled all of State Farm’s issues, we affirm the trial court’s\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                                      /s/    Marc W.

The jury found that State Farm breached its policy\nwhen it refused to cover physical loss to Hanson’s roof caused by a wind event in\nJune 2012. In addition to awarding Hanson damages for the cost to repair or\nreplace her physical loss, the jury awarded attorney’s fees.      State Farm: (1)\nchallenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s finding that\n\fState Farm failed to comply with the policy, (2) contends that the evidence\nconclusively established an exclusion to coverage, and (3) argues that Hanson\nfailed to produce evidence showing she was entitled to replacement cost benefits.\nWith regard to attorney’s fees, State Farm argues that: (a) the evidence is legally\ninsufficient to support the award; (b) under rule 167, State Farm is entitled to an\noffset for litigation costs accruing after Hanson rejected its settlement offer and\nHanson is precluded from receiving post-rejection attorney’s fees; (c) Hanson\nfailed to properly segregate; and (d) the award is excessive. We affirm.\n\n                I.       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Ginger Hanson closed on the house at issue in July 2011. At the time, the\nroof was approximately 15 years old with 30-year shingles fastened to the decking\nwith staples. The house underwent a purchase inspection, which did not reveal any\nconcerns with the roof. The seller’s disclosure did not indicate any roof damage.\n\n       Hanson sought coverage for the house from her longtime State Farm agent.\nHer agent prepared an underwriting report for Hanson’s policy. There was no\nindication that the roof had “possible hail damage,” “curled shingles,”\n“loose/missing shingles,” “wear in valleys,” “missing/replaced ridge row,”\n“patched area[s],” or “stain/rotting under eaves.” There were no “interior leaks.”\nThe report did not identify any possible concerns. According to Shannon Kimmel,\none of Hanson’s experts with experience working as a claims adjuster for State\nFarm and currently working as a public adjuster,1 the underwriting report indicated\nthere were “no issues with that roof less than a year before this reported storm.”\nAnother of Hanson’s experts with experience working for State Farm as a claims\nadjuster, Kerry Freeman, stated that the report reflected a “clean bill of health” for\n\n       1\n         A public adjuster is an adjuster who is licensed to represent the public against an\ninsurance company when there is a problem with the claim.\n\n                                             2\n\fHanson’s roof.\n\n      Under “Section I – Coverages,” Hanson’s homeowner’s policy with State\nFarm provides:\n\n      COVERAGE A – DWELLING\n      1. Dwelling. We cover the dwelling used principally as a private\n      residence on the residence premises shown in the Declarations.\n            Dwelling includes:\n            a. structures attached to the dwelling;\n            b. materials and supplies located on or adjacent to the residence\n            premises for use in the construction, alteration or repair of the\n            dwelling or other structures on the residence premises;\n            c. foundation, floor slab and footings supporting the dwelling;\n            and\n            d. wall-to-wall carpeting attached to the dwelling.\nUnder “Section I – Losses Insured,” the policy provides:\n\n      COVERAGE A – DWELLING\n      We insure for accidental direct physical loss to the property described\n      in Coverage A, except as provided in SECTION I - LOSSES NOT\n      INSURED.\nUnder “Section I – Losses Not Insured,” the policy provides:\n\n      1. We do not insure for any loss to the property described in Coverage\n      A which consists of, or is directly and immediately caused by, one or\n      more of the perils listed in items a. through n. below, regardless of\n      whether the loss occurs suddenly or gradually, involves isolated or\n      widespread damage, arises from natural or external forces, or occurs\n      as a result of any combination of these: . . .\n            g. wear, tear, marring, scratching, deterioration, inherent vice,\n            latent defect or mechanical breakdown . . . .\n\n      3. We do not insure under any coverage for any loss consisting of one\n      or more of the items below. Further, we do not insure for loss\n      described in paragraphs 1. and 2. immediately above regardless of\n                                         3\n\f         whether one or more of the following: (a) directly or indirectly cause,\n         contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the same\n         time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss: . . .\n                  b. defect, weakness, inadequacy, fault or unsoundness in: . . .\n                          (2) design, specifications, workmanship, construction,\n                          grading, compaction . . . .\n\n         Hanson was not at home during the June 1, 2012 storm. On the day after the\nstorm, Roy Campbell, who sells roofs for Telge Roofing, tarped roofs and made\nadjuster appointments for houses in Hanson’s neighborhood. Kimmel discussed\nthe June 1, 2012 storm with Hanson’s neighbors and the greenskeeper for the golf\ncourse around the corner from Hanson’s house. After the storm, the golf course\nhad to shut down due to “a tremendous amount” of fallen trees blocking golf cart\npaths. Several of Hanson’s neighbors received new roofs after the June 1, 2012\nstorm.\n\n         In early October 2012, Campbell inspected Hanson’s roof. Campbell found\n“pulled through fasteners” and “lots of wind lift”: “Basically, [Hanson] has staples\non her roof and where the wind had lifted it up, it made a clean pull through of the\nshingle. The shingle was actually still in place but it’s basically flapping in the\nwind.” Campbell found areas of Hanson’s roof where the edges of the top layer of\nshingles were not sealed to the underlying layers and could be lifted by hand.\nCampbell suggested that Hanson file an insurance claim.\n\n         Hanson and Campbell called in a claim to State Farm for wind damage to\nHanson’s roof.2 State Farm assigned claims representative Jon Flores. Campbell\naccompanied Flores onto the roof for the inspection. Campbell showed Flores\nareas of pulled-through shingles and creased shingles. Flores only walked the\n\n\n         2\n             Hanson’s claim initially also included hail damage.\n\n                                                   4\n\fridge3 of the roof and did not go down any of the slopes. According to Campbell,\nFlores indicated there was not “enough damage” and that despite any “lift” there\nwere “no missing shingles.”               Flores concluded that Hanson’s roof had not\nsustained an accidental direct physical loss.\n\n       Flores’s inspection did not satisfy Hanson. Campbell referred Hanson to\nKimmel. Hanson requested another inspection from State Farm. State Farm next\nassigned claims representative Andrew Traise. Campbell accompanied Traise onto\nthe roof for the inspection. Kimmel also was present. Campbell described Traise’s\ninspection as uncharacteristically quick. Traise “traversed” about ten percent of\nthe roof and made no effort to ask any of Hanson’s neighbors about, or to observe,\ntheir properties. Campbell showed Traise areas of lifted shingles “pretty much all\nover the roof”—pulled-through fasteners and unsealed shingles. According to\nCampbell, Traise wanted to find “some more missing shingles, you know,\ndamaged shingles.” Traise informed Hanson that he found no accidental direct\nphysical loss. State Farm denied Hanson’s claim for wind damage.\n\n       In November 2012, Hanson filed suit against State Farm and Traise.\nAgainst State Farm, Hanson alleged breach of contract and violation of the Prompt\nPayment of Claims Statute, see Tex. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 542.051–.061 (West 2009).\nAgainst both State Farm and Traise, Hanson alleged “bad faith/DTPA” in the form\nof violations of chapter 541 of the Insurance Code, see id. §§ 541.051, 541.060,\n541.061 (West 2009).4 State Farm and Traise served Hanson with a settlement\noffer in November 2013. State Farm and Traise offered Hanson $30,000, with an\n\n       3\n           The ridge is the top of the roof, where the slopes intersect.\n       4\n          In May 2014, the trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of State Farm\non the “section 542 claims and common law duty of good faith and fair dealing.” The trial court\nalso granted partial summary judgment in favor of Traise on “any common law duty of good\nfaith causes of action.”\n\n                                                    5\n\fexpiration date of December 4, 2013. Hanson did not accept the offer.\n\n      At trial, Kimmel testified about his inspection of Hanson’s roof.            He\ndescribed accidental direct physical loss as “any damage to the shingle. It could be\ncreasing. It could be torn. In this instance, in her roof, it’s pulled through that\nfastener so it’s actually torn right there at the fastener. So it is damage, it’s got\nactual direct physical loss.”    Kimmel located pulled-through shingle damage,\nwhere a shingle is “pulled through that fastener so it’s actually torn right there at\nthe fastener,” exposing the plywood decking underneath. According to Kimmel,\npulled-through shingles indicate “wind damage” and comprise “accidental direct\nphysical loss” covered under Hanson’s policy.         Kimmel also located “wind-\ncreased” shingle damage, where the shingle “was actually bent over” because “the\nwind has been flapping that thing up and creased it.” Wind-creased shingles also\nare “accidental direct physical loss” covered by Hanson’s policy. Kimmel further\nfound shingle damage caused either by flying debris or “tree damage where the\ntree’s blown into the roof during the storm and messed up the edging.”             He\nindicated that such damage was covered by Hanson’s policy.             According to\nKimmel, Hanson’s roof “absolutely” sustained covered wind damage on “all\nsides.” He opined Hanson’s roof required replacement—there were “way too\nmany shingles that are damaged on the roof, and the cost of repairing that would\noutweigh the cost of replacing that.”\n\n      Freeman also inspected Hanson’s roof and agreed with Kimmel’s\nassessment of wind damage. Freeman described pulled-through shingle damage—\n“[w]hat that is, where that fastener originally was put into that top one, it has been\npulled up and torn from wind.” Freeman acknowledged that he saw a “handful” of\noverdriven staples, as there are on any given roof, but that he saw pulled-through\nshingle tears throughout Hanson’s roof. He stated that if the staples had been\n\n                                          6\n\foverdriven, then there would not be tearing; instead, “it would go straight through\nlike a bullet hole.” Freeman opined that the roof was unrepairable because the\nrepairs would risk causing more damage to the shingles. Freeman further testified\nregarding his Xactimate5 estimate totaling approximately $39,687 as the reasonable\nand necessary cost to replace Hanson’s roof.\n\n       State Farm’s expert Mark West, a general contractor, inspected Hanson’s\nroof with Eric Green, a civil engineer also serving as State Farm’s expert. West\ndid not walk the back slope of Hanson’s roof.                     West acknowledged that\n“potentially the ridge was displaced by wind.” There were approximately five to\nten “displaced shingle tabs” and shingle tabs with a tear, crease, or “stripe,” which\ncould have been damaged by a wind event or from impact with tree limbs. West\nagreed that a windstorm could cause shingles to unseal or pull through their\nfasteners. He opined that the damaged shingle tabs could be repaired for under\n$500. West, who has experience with Xactimate, went through Kimmel’s estimate\nand noted several areas of unnecessary and duplicative charges. West estimated\nthat the cost to replace Hanson’s roof was approximately $15,000 to $16,000.\n\n       According to Green, wind measurements from the closest airport to\nHanson’s house (approximately eight miles away) indicated gusts up to 49 mph on\nJune 1, 2012. This wind speed can blow over small trees and cause tree branches\nto fall. Green testified that wind can cause physical damage to roofs such as\nshingles ripping off, tearing, and creasing. He physically examined a “sampling”\nof about five to eight percent of the surface of Hanson’s roof.                          Green\nacknowledged finding some shingles on the ridge and on the eaves that had\nsustained wind damage or “wind-blown debris damage.” Also, “wind forces”\n\n       5\n         Xactimate is software widely used in the insurance industry to estimate a cost basis for\nproperty replacement, including roofs.\n\n                                               7\n\fpossibly contributed to some staple failures. Green agreed that Kimmel’s photos\nrevealed “conditions consistent with wind damage.” When asked whether there\nwas wind damage to Hanson’s roof, Green answered “yes.” Green indicated that\nthe damaged shingles could be replaced without replacing the entire roof and could\nbe repaired for less than the policy’s $4000 deductible. Green opined that the\nunsealed condition of Hanson’s roof was not caused by a wind event, but rather by\nthermal expansion and contraction. Although Green stated Hanson’s roof was in\n“excellent” condition and was “aging extremely well,” he also opined it was a “bad\nroof” that had been defectively installed because 80 to 85 percent of the staples had\nbeen overdriven. Green also stated it was “true” that Hanson’s roof needed to be\nreplaced.\n\n      One of Hanson’s trial counsel, Richard Daly, testified regarding attorney’s\nfees. He described the case as “difficult,” involving as many as fifteen raised\ndefenses, at least five depositions, discovery disputes, legal challenges, and\nmultiple experts on each side. Daly described his firm’s method of keeping time\nrecords in a certain computer program.        The trial court admitted a summary\ncontaining billing entries in Hanson’s case from October 22, 2012 through May 15,\n2014. The summary contains line items with information about the date, the\nbilling professional, description of tasks performed, the hours and rate, and the\namount. The summary totaled just over $157,000. Daly described the work spent\non Hanson’s contract and bad faith claims as inextricably intertwined and\nestimated that five percent of the time was spent solely on bad faith issues. Daly\ntestified that attorney’s fees of $149,224.11 were fair, reasonable, and necessary.\n\n      State Farm’s expert on attorney’s fees, Charles Levy, opined that Hanson’s\ncase was “a plain run-of-the-mill lawsuit” and could have been tried for fewer\nhours at lower rates for approximately $30,000 to $40,000.\n\n                                          8\n\f      Question 1 of the jury charge asked whether State Farm failed to comply\nwith the terms of the insurance policy issued to Hanson. The jury was instructed\nthat: the insurance policy covers physical loss to Hanson’s property caused by a\nJune 1, 2012 wind event; the policy does not cover wear and tear, marring,\nscratching, deterioration, inherent vice, latent defect, or mechanical breakdown;\nand the policy does not cover defect, weakness, inadequacy, fault or unsoundness\nin design, specifications, workmanship, construction, grading, compaction,\nmaterials used in construction or repair, or maintenance. The jury answered “yes”\nto question 1.\n\n      Question 2 asked the jury what sum of money would fairly and reasonably\ncompensate Hanson for her damages resulting from State Farm’s failure to comply\nwith the policy. The jury awarded $12,878 as “the cost to repair or replace any\nphysical loss to Ginger Hanson’s property as a result of a wind event on June 1,\n2012, less the deductible of $4,000.”\n\n      Question 3 asked the jury what is a reasonable fee for the necessary services\nof Hanson’s attorneys in the current lawsuit. For representation prior to and\nthrough trial, the jury awarded $70,000.        The jury awarded $45,000 for\nrepresentation in an appeal in the court of appeals, and a total of $35,000 for\nrepresentation in the Supreme Court of Texas.       For representation before the\nsettlement offer’s deadline, the jury awarded $15,000.\n\n      The trial court rendered final judgment in favor of Hanson and against State\nFarm consistent with the jury’s verdict, and rendered that Hanson recover nothing\nfrom Traise. State Farm timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                                II.      ANALYSIS\n\nA. State Farm’s first issue\n\n      In what we construe as its first issue, State Farm presents three distinct\nsubparts. First, State Farm contends there is no proof that Hanson’s roof sustained\na covered physical loss on June 1, 2012. Second, State Farm asserts any physical\nloss was not covered because it conclusively established that an exclusion applied.\nThird, State Farm argues that Hanson cannot recover replacement costs as damages\nbecause she did not prove she was entitled to them.\n\n      1. Standard of review\n\n      The test for legal sufficiency is whether the evidence at trial “would enable\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.” City of\nKeller v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (Tex. 2005). In making this determination,\nwe must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, crediting any\nfavorable evidence if a reasonable factfinder could and disregarding any contrary\nevidence unless a reasonable factfinder could not. Id. at 827. We assume jurors\nmade all inferences in favor of their verdict if reasonable minds could, and\ndisregarded all other inferences. Id. at 821. We cannot substitute our judgment for\nthat of the jury, so long as the evidence falls within the zone of reasonable\ndisagreement. Id. at 822. The factfinder is the only judge of witness credibility\nand the weight to give to testimony. Id. at 819.\n\n      We will sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only when: (1) the record\ndiscloses the complete absence of a vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules of law\nor evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact,\n(3) the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla,\nor (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact. Id. at 810.\n\n\n                                          10\n\fMore than a scintilla of evidence exists if the evidence “rises to a level that would\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.” Service\nCorp.

Guerra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895329\"><a href=\"/opinion/895329/service-corp-intern-v-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228 (Tex. 2011). Evidence is conclusive\nonly if reasonable people could not differ in their conclusions. City of Keller, 168\nS.W.3d at 816. To successfully challenge the legal sufficiency of an adverse\nfinding on an issue on which it has the burden of proof, a party must conclusively\nestablish all vital facts in support of that issue. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560611\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560611/dow-chemical-co-v-francis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241 (Tex. 2001) (per curiam).\n\n       2. Legally sufficient evidence supports the jury’s answer to question 1.\n\n       State Farm first argues Hanson did not prove that her shingles were in a\n“satisfactory state,” or sealed, before the June 1, 2012 storm.6 State Farm points to\nHanson’s testimony that she did not ask her inspector to check for unsealed\nshingles when she purchased the house, and did not know whether they were\nsealed in 2011 or whether any other weather event had affected the sealing.\n\n       The evidence presented, however, reasonably supports the jury’s finding that\nHanson’s shingles were sealed prior to June 1, 2012. The inspection of Hanson’s\nhouse prior to closing found only cosmetic issues, no substantive damage, “nothing\nreally wrong with the roof that required repair.” The seller’s disclosure did not\nindicate any roof damage. State Farm generated an underwriting report in June\n2011 to determine whether to issue a policy on Hanson’s house. The report\nindicated that there were no concerns regarding the roof—no hail damage, no\n\n       6\n          State Farm cites Lennar Corp. v. Great American Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382198\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382198/lennar-corp-v-great-american-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678–\n79 (Tex.

Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273986\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273986/gilbert-texas-const-lp-v-underwriters/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2010). However,\nunlike here, the circumstances in Lennar revealed that the exterior insulation and finish system at\nissue had not been physically injured or changed to constitute property damage, but rather was\n“already in an unsatisfactory state when applied to the homes because it is inherently defective.”\nId. at 679.\n\n                                                11\n\fcurled shingles, no loose or missing shingles, no valley wear, no missing or\nreplaced ridge row, no patched areas, no stain or rotting under the eaves, and no\ninterior leaks. Kimmel’s and Freeman’s testimony supports that State Farm found\nno issues in 2011 precluding roof coverage. State Farm’s corporate representative,\nRandy Teufel, the team manager who supervised both Flores and Traise, testified\nthe report showed that Hanson’s roof was in “good condition.”            Traise also\ntestified that the report indicated “no problems noted with the roof.”\n\n      State Farm also argues there is no evidence that a wind event caused the\nunsealed condition of Hanson’s roof. State Farm contends that Campbell and\nKimmel did not testify regarding what caused the sealant to fail, only that the wind\nlifted the shingles so that they pulled and tore through the staples. However, State\nFarm’s expert Green, when asked “what are the scientifically recognized causes of\nunsealed shingles,” testified that shingles “can become loose because of wind” and\nagreed “wind can cause sealant failure.” West agreed that a windstorm could\ncause shingles to “flap in the wind.” In any event, the evidence was not limited to\nunsealed shingles, or even pulled-through shingles.         Even assuming without\ndeciding solely for purposes of our analysis that purely unsealed shingles are not\nevidence of accidental direct physical loss due to wind, there is no dispute that\n“torn, ripped, folded, creased,” “missing,” or “displaced” shingles can constitute\nevidence of accidental direct physical loss due to wind. Campbell indicated that\nTraise wanted to find “more missing shingles”; in other words, Traise located some\nmissing shingles. Kimmel located “wind-creased” shingle damage and areas of\n“messed-up” edging caused by flying debris or by a tree “blown into the roof\nduring the storm.” Freeman saw the same damage as Kimmel. West observed\n“displaced” shingle tabs. He agreed that photos taken by Kimmel showed shingle\ntabs with tears and creases. Green located a missing ridge shingle and “wind-\n\n\n                                         12\n\fblown debris damage” on eave shingles. Green also agreed that Kimmel’s photos\nshowed creased shingles. This evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s\nfinding of physical loss.\n\n       Next, State Farm asserts Hanson produced no evidence that a wind event\ncaused pulled-through damage to the shingles. State Farm argues that Campbell’s\nand Kimmel’s expert testimony was not probative because it is conclusory or\nspeculative.7      State Farm essentially contends that Campbell’s and Kimmel’s\nopinions amount to no evidence because they did not adequately explain or link\ntheir opinions to the facts.8 State Farm also complains that Campbell and Kimmel\ndid not rule out alternate causes of the purported pulled-through shingle damage.9\nState Farm contends that the pulled-through shingle damage was instead caused by\na construction defect: overdriven staples. Again, setting aside the pulled-through\nshingles,10 State Farm’s position completely fails to recognize that the jury was\npresented with evidence of other types of shingle damage—such as creases,\n“stripes,” edging tears, and displacement—which Teufel acknowledged “would be\nconsidered a covered loss, that would be accidental direct physical loss and we\nwould have considered repairing or replacing the roof.”\n\n       Finally, State Farm argues that there was no evidence Hanson’s roof\n\n\n       7\n          Hanson correctly notes that she did not designate Campbell as an expert and that the\ntrial court sustained State Farm’s objection to any expert opinion testimony by Campbell.\n       8\n          See City of San Antonio v.

There was also evidence that the wind event on June 1, 2012 was strong enough\nto topple trees and cause tree branches to fall. Moreover, there was evidence from Freeman\nexplaining that overdriven staples “go straight through [the shingle] almost like a bullet hole”\ncompared to when wind pulls the shingle through the staple resulting in tearing.\n\n                                                13\n\fsustained physical loss on June 1, 2012.           We disagree.      We already have\ndetermined there was evidence to support that the shingles were in a satisfactory\nstate prior to the June 1, 2012 storm. We already have determined that there was\nevidence to support that Hanson’s shingles were damaged by wind. Moreover,\nthere was evidence that a wind event occurred on June 1, 2012. Campbell testified\nregarding his response to the June 1, 2012 wind event; he was tarping houses and\nwas making claims and adjuster appointments in Hanson’s neighborhood the next\nday. Kimmel confirmed the date of the storm with Hanson’s neighbors, several of\nwhom sustained roof damage, and with the neighborhood golf course’s\ngreenskeeper. The wind was powerful enough to knock over a “tremendous”\nnumber of trees. According to Kimmel, State Farm uses precisely this type of\nevidence to determine the date of loss when adjusting claims.              State Farm’s\noperation guidelines list observation of neighboring properties as a factor in\ndetermining a loss. Further, wind speeds of almost 50 mph recorded at Hooks\nAirport—the closest “official wind gauge”—on June 1, 2012 were capable of\nblowing over small trees and causing branches to fall. State Farm points to no\nevidence, much less evidence the jury could not reasonably disregard, that supports\nsome other specific wind event instead caused Hanson’s physical loss.11 The jury\nreasonably could have found that Hanson’s shingles suffered accidental direct\nphysical loss during the June 1, 2012 wind event.\n\n      We overrule this subissue.\n\n      3. State Farm failed to conclusively establish any policy exclusion.\n\n      Having determined Hanson met her initial burden to establish coverage\n\n\n      11\n         The only other specific storm discussed was Hurricane Ike, which occurred in\nSeptember 2008, several years before State Farm issued its underwriting report on Hanson’s\nhouse.\n\n                                           14\n\funder the terms of her policy, we next consider whether State Farm conclusively\nestablished that Hanson’s loss falls within an exclusion to avoid liability. See\nGilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273986\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273986/gilbert-texas-const-lp-v-underwriters/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124\n(Tex. 2010); Francis, 46 S.W.3d at 241.        State Farm contends the evidence\nconclusively established that the unsealed shingles were caused by “wear and tear,\ndeterioration, latent defect, or inadequate, faulty, or unsound workmanship or\nmaterials used in construction.” State Farm’s position again focuses on shingles\nwhose only sustained damage was their unsealed nature or pulled-through tearing\nand fails to account for evidence of other types of (undisputed) wind damage to\nHanson’s shingles for which State Farm authorizes repair or replacement.\n\n      In any event, State Farm did not conclusively establish that any exclusion\napplies to avoid liability. State Farm’s underwriting report did not indicate any\nconcerns that would preclude or lessen coverage of Hanson’s roof. Moreover,\nState Farm’s claim file noted that Hanson’s shingles were in good general\ncondition and there was no “excessive wear and tear to the ridge shingles or to the\nsouth slope of s[h]ingles”; Traise found no “excessive wear and tear on the\nshingles”; West stated that Hanson’s shingles were in “real good condition”; and\nGreen testified Hanson’s shingles were “excellent” and “aging extremely well.”\nState Farm points to Green’s testimony that thermal debonding caused Hanson’s\nshingles to unseal, at least at the corners. But inspection photos reflected that the\n“lifted” shingles were unsealed throughout, not just at their corners. Further,\nFreeman testified that sealant actually becomes “better bonded” over time.\nTherefore, State Farm did not conclusively prove that wear and tear or\ndeterioration caused the unsealed or pulled-through shingles, much less the other\ntypes of shingle damage.\n\n      Nor did State Farm conclusively prove that stapling defects caused the\n\n                                         15\n\funsealed or pulled-through shingles, or any other types of shingle damage.\nAccording to Teufel and Green, the overdriven staples were a latent and a\nconstruction defect. But Freeman testified that Hanson’s roof only had a “handful”\nof overdriven staples common to “any roof.” Freeman explained that a pulled-\nthrough shingle was not “overdriven” based on the space underneath the staple and\nwhere the staple did not “go down into the decking.”                    Green acknowledged\n“[c]ertainly some of these staples were installed properly.” And although Green\nopined that Hanson’s entire roof needed to be replaced due to defective stapling,\nWest did not believe that all her shingles needed to be replaced.\n\n      We overrule this second subissue.\n\n      4. Hanson did not have to prove any actual repair or replacement.\n      State Farm argues even if Hanson provided evidence that her roof sustained\na covered loss, she failed to prove that she satisfied the policy’s condition\nprecedent to trigger any obligation for State Farm to make replacement cost\npayments. State Farm points to language within the loss settlement endorsement of\nHanson’s policy stating that State Farm would only pay the actual cash value at the\ntime of the loss of the damaged part of the property, up to policy limits and not to\nexceed the cost to repair or replace the damaged part, “until actual repair or\nreplacement is completed.”12\n\n\n      12\n           Under an endorsement for loss settlement, the policy provides:\n      A1 – Replacement Cost Loss Settlement – Similar Construction is replaced with\n      the following:\n                a. We will pay the cost to repair or replace with similar construction and\n                for the same use on the premises shown in the Declarations, the damaged\n                part of the property covered under SECTION I – COVERAGES,\n                COVERAGE A – DWELLING, except for wood fences, subject to the\n                following:\n                       (1) until actual repair or replacement is completed, we will pay\n                                                16\n\f      A condition precedent may be either a condition to the formation of a\ncontract or a condition to an obligation to perform an existing agreement.

Legal sufficiency\n\n      Here, Hanson’s trial counsel applied to recover their attorney’s fees under\nthe lodestar method.

Olivas, the Supreme Court of Texas explained that\ngeneralities about tasks performed and hours spent provide insufficient information\nfor the fact finder to meaningfully review whether the tasks and hours were\nreasonable and necessary under the lodestar method. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763 (Tex.\n2012). Sufficient evidence includes, at a minimum, evidence “of the services\nperformed, who performed them and at what hourly rate, when they were\nperformed, and how much time the work required.” Id. at 764. Because the\ntestimony in El Apple only included the total number of hours worked and\ngeneralities about discovery and the length of trial, the Court remanded for a\nredetermination of attorney’s fees. Id. at 765. In so holding, the Court stated:\n\n      In this case, neither attorney indicated how the 890 hours they spent in\n      the aggregate were devoted to any particular task or category of tasks.\n      Neither attorney presented time records or other documentary\n      evidence. Nor did they testify based on their recollection of such\n      records. The attorneys instead based their time estimates on\n      generalities such as the amount of discovery in the case, the number\n      of pleadings filed, the number of witnesses questioned, and the length\n      of the trial. While all this is relevant, it provides none of the\n\n                                         20\n\f      specificity needed for the trial court to make a meaningful lodestar\n      determination. The court could not discern from the evidence how\n      many hours each of the tasks required and whether that time was\n      reasonable. Without at least some indication of the time spent on\n      various parts of the case, a court has little basis upon which to conduct\n      a meaningful review of the fee award.\n\nId. at 763.\n\n      El Apple involved a claim under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\nAct, which mandates use of the lodestar method. 370 S.W.3d at 758–59. In Long\nv. Griffin, a case involving claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment,\nthe Court revisited the specificity requirements of evidence to support attorney’s\nfees under the lodestar method. The Court characterized the attorney affidavit at\nissue as “only offer[ing] generalities”:\n\n      It indicates that one attorney spent 300 hours on the case, another\n      expended 344.50 hours, and the attorneys’ respective hourly rates.\n      The affidavit posits that the case involved extensive discovery, several\n      pretrial hearings, multiple summary judgment motions, and a four and\n      one-half day trial, and that litigating the matter required understanding\n      a related suit that settled after ten years of litigation. But no evidence\n      accompanied the affidavit to inform the trial court the time spent on\n      specific tasks. See El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763. The affidavit does\n      claim that 30% of the aggregate time was expended on the assignment\n      claim (part of which the Griffins prevailed on) and that the assignment\n      issue was inextricably intertwined with matters that consumed 95% of\n      the two attorneys’ time on the matter. But without any evidence of\n      the time spent on specific tasks, the trial court had insufficient\n      information to meaningfully review the fee request.

Id. The summary identified the case, each timekeeper, a\ndescription of activities, and the hours devoted. Id. The activities were divided\ninto categories such as “attend/appear at hearing,” “drafting/revising pleadings,”\nand “reviewing/researching law.” Id. However, the appellants argued that “the\ndepartment offered only information about general categories of work[,]” and\n“identified no specific tasks and apportioned the time its lawyers purportedly spent\nonly among general categories.”          Id. at *16.    They also complained that the\nsummary did not say which hearings were attended, which pleadings were revised,\nand what law was researched. Id. at *17.\n\n       Our sister court rejected such arguments, concluding the State’s evidence of\n\n“Gonzalez offered nothing to document his time in the case other than the ‘thousands and\nthousands and thousands of pages’ generated during his representation of the Montanos and his\nbelief that he had reasonably spent 1,356 hours preparing and trying the case.”)\n\n                                             22\n\fattorney’s fees was “much more detailed than that provided in El Apple [or] Long”\nand was sufficient for the trial court to conduct a meaningful review of the number\nof hours the State spent on the case and to properly apply the lodestar method.\nMed.

In doing so, the First Court of\nAppeals particularly noted how “nothing in El Apple [or] Long . . . requires such\ndetail” and found that the State’s evidence was complied with El Apple “by\nindicating how long each person spent working on particular categories of tasks.”\nMed.

Hanson presented expert testimony from Daly regarding his\nattorney’s fees, the reasonableness and necessity of the work done on the case, his\nexperience and qualifications and those of his two associates and the additional\nlawyer, John Black, brought in to help try the case, and the prevailing rates of each.\nDaly described keeping time in a particular computer program:\n\n            [C]ontemporaneously whenever I do my work, I write down\n      what the time is, who—what you were doing in your law firm and\n      then you would write down what the task was. And then you’ve got a\n      computer program that puts an hourly rate to it, whatever hourly rate\n      you assigned and tells you who did that.\n             So, basically, you know, on a daily or bi-weekly or, you know,\n      every third day you will write down your time and, you know, the\n      computer program keeps track of it. And, you know, in this case, for\n      example, it started in October of 2012, and then the time I’ve written\n      actually goes through tomorrow because we’re assuming we’re still\n      going to be here tomorrow.\n\nHanson also submitted a ten-page computer-generated summary, which contained\ndetails regarding the nature of the work performed, who performed the services\nand his rate, approximately when the services were performed, and the number of\n\n                                         23\n\fhours worked. See El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763.\n\n       State Farm challenges a particular entry that provided the total daily time\nspent but where the description of the work included more than one specific task.18\nEssentially, State Farm argues that El Apple requires assigning a particular number\nof minutes to each individual task. We cannot agree that such level of detail is\nrequired to be able to meaningfully review a fee award. See John Moore Servs.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3162206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6–7 (concluding that “block-billing technique” was\n“distinguishable from El Apple, in which there was far less evidence of attorney's\nfees, and it was presented in a far more summary fashion” and “distinguishable\nfrom the aggregate and conclusory time estimates provided in Montano” because\nentries “describe the work that was done, specify the date the work was done,\nprovide the total amount of time spent accomplishing the tasks, and identify the\nperson who did the work.”).             Hanson’s attorneys’ time entries could be\nmeaningfully reviewed because they included details about the nature of the work,\nwho did it at what rate, what day the work was performed, and the time worked.\nSee El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 762. Moreover, the entries were detailed enough to\nprovide “some indication of the time spent on various parts of the case”; the daily\nentry challenged by State Farm described tasks and time spent relating to\nformation of the attorney-client relationship and pre-suit investigation of the\ndefendant. See id.\n\n       State Farm also takes issue with generalities in the summary, such as the\ndescription “Prepared for trial” provided for each attorney who billed hours on a\nparticular trial day because “[t]hat is merely a general category for work that can\n       18\n           This October 23, 2012 entry indicated that Daly worked 3.40 hours at a rate of\n$450.00/hour doing the following tasks: “Draft Fee Agreement. Correspond with client re same.\nInvestigate hail claims against this particular Insurance company. Multiple conferences with\nconsulting experts. Research regarding removal to federal court and Defendant’s propensity to\nattempt.”\n\n                                             24\n\fbe comp[o]sed of many specific tasks.” Although State Farm acknowledges that\n“Prepare for trial” describes a particular category of tasks, it insists El Apple\nrequires further details.        We disagree.        See Med. Disc. Pharmacy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">4100483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17 (concluding that El Apple does not require more level of detail for\nparticular category of tasks than, e.g., “attend/appear at hearing”). Even if El\nApple required more, Daly expounded on what trial preparation entailed:\n\n             It’s the most grueling thing that you can do as a lawyer. Last\n      night for the first time I got in bed at 11:30. Okay. That was good.\n      The prior six nights, 2:30 in the morning is when I went to bed. The\n      problem is you’ve got to go to trial, then you’ve got to go prepare for\n      an entire new day. You want to be—make sure you’re prepared so\n      they don’t waste your time because I don’t want to come in here and\n      bumble around and stumble around. You’ve got to get your exhibits\n      ready. You’ve got to get—you know, your associates to make sure\n      that everything is all set up.\n\nMoreover, State Farm has not pointed us to, and we have not located, any daily\ntime entries that failed to describe particular tasks or, at the least, categories of\ntasks, such as “prepare for trial.”\n\n      We overrule State Farm’s legal sufficiency challenge to the award of\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      3. Rule 167 settlement offer\n\n      There is no dispute that State Farm made a rule 167 settlement offer and that\nHanson did not accept the offer by the stated December 4, 2013 deadline, which\nconstituted a rejection. See Tex. Rs. Civ. P. 167.2(b),19 167.3(c). State Farm\n\n      19\n           Rule 167.2(b) provides:\n      (b) Requirements of an offer. A settlement offer must:\n                (1) be in writing;\n                (2) state that it is made under Rule 167 and Chapter 42 of the Texas Civil\n                Practice and Remedies Code;\n\n                                                25\n\fcontends that pursuant to rule 167.4 it is entitled to litigation costs accruing after\nHanson rejected its settlement offer.\n\n       Rule 167.4(a) provides that if a settlement offer made under the rule “is\nrejected, and the judgment to be awarded on the monetary claims covered by the\noffer is significantly less favorable to the offeree than was the offer, the court must\naward the offeror litigation costs against the offeree from the time the offer was\nrejected to the time of judgment.” Id. 167.4(a). Rule 167.4(b) states that “[a]\njudgment award on monetary claims is significantly less favorable than an offer to\nsettle those claims if: (1) the offeree is a claimant and the judgment would be less\nthan 80 percent of the offer; or (2) the offeree is a defendant and the judgment\nwould be more than 120 percent of the offer.” Id. 167.4(b). Litigation costs\nawarded to a defendant under rule 167 “must be made a setoff to the claimant’s\njudgment against the defendant.” Id. 167.4(g).\n\n       Here, the judgment would need to be at least $24,000 to meet the 80 percent\nthreshold set by the rule and entitle State Farm to an award of litigation costs.\nState Farm argues that the judgment was only 43 percent because it offered Hanson\n$30,000 and the jury only awarded her $12,878 for the cost to repair or replace her\nphysical loss under the policy. However, State Farm’s position fails to account for\nthe attorney’s fee award. Although State Farm argues that “monetary claims” do\n\n               (3) identify the party or parties making the offer and the party or parties to\n               whom the offer is made;\n               (4) state the terms by which all monetary claims—including any attorney\n               fees, interest, and costs that would be recoverable up to the time of the\n               offer—between the offeror or offerors on the one hand and the offeree or\n               offerees on the other may be settled;\n               (5) state a deadline—no sooner than 14 days after the offer is served—by\n               which the offer must be accepted;\n               (6) be served on all parties to whom the offer is made.\nTex. R. Civ. P. 167.2(b).\n\n                                                26\n\fnot include attorney’s fees for breach of contract, its settlement offer covered all\nHanson’s “claims for monetary damages, [her] attorney’s fees, exemplary\ndamages, interest and costs.” See Tex. P. Civ. P. 167.2(b)(4) (settlement offer\nmust state “terms by which all monetary claims—including any attorney fees,\ninterest and costs that would be recoverable up to the time of the offer . . . may be\nsettled”). Texas courts have not determined whether total attorney’s fees or fees as\nof date of settlement rejection should be used in a rule 167.4 calculation. See\nCompass Bank v. Nacim, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110–11 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2015, no\npet.). We need not reach that question because, in this case, even using the lesser\namount of only accrued fees, State Farm’s argument fails.20                       Here, the jury\nexpressly found that a reasonable fee for the necessary services of Hanson’s\nattorneys for representation before December 5, 2013, the date of the settlement\nrejection, was $15,000. Adding damages of $12,878 to fees of $15,000 equals\n$27,878.         $27,878 divided by the settlement offer amount of $30,000 equals\napproximately 93 percent. Therefore, the trial court was not required to award\nState Farm litigation costs and was not required to apply any setoff.\n\n         Because we conclude that State Farm was not entitled to litigation costs\nagainst Hanson, we do not reach State Farm’s argument under rule 167.4(f) that\nHanson is precluded from any award of attorney’s fees accruing after December 4,\n2013. We overrule State Farm’s challenge to Hanson’s award of attorney’s fees\nbased on its rule 167 offer.\n\n         4. Segregation\n\n         Because attorney’s fees are only recoverable pursuant to a contract or\nstatute, “fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims\n\n         20\n              Including the total amount of attorney’s fees, the judgment far exceeds the settlement\noffer.\n\n                                                  27\n\ffor which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Tony Gullo\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (Tex. 2006).               Texas courts\nrecognize a narrow exception “when discrete legal services advance both a\nrecoverable and unrecoverable claim” and thus “are so intertwined that they need\nnot be segregated.” Id. at 313–14; see In re Lesikar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1869120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1869120/in-re-lesikar/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (“If a legal service necessary to the\nlitigation of a claim for which attorneys’ fees are available also advanced a claim\nfor which attorneys’ fees are not recoverable, then the exception to the general fee-\nsegregation rule applies, and the amount of time or money that was reasonable to\nexpend in performing the service need not be segregated among the claims it\nadvanced.”). However, if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which\nattorney’s fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\nunrecoverable fees. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313. But, even when fee segregation is\nrequired, attorneys are not required to keep separate records documenting the exact\namount of time prosecuting one claim versus another. See id. at 314. Rather,\nsegregation is sufficiently established if an attorney testifies that a given\npercentage of the time worked would have been necessary even if the claim for\nwhich attorney’s fees are unrecoverable had not been asserted.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no\npet.)).\n\n          Here, Daly stated:\n\n                Chapa is a case that basically says when you have different\n          causes of action—like here we’ve got a breach of contract cause of\n          action and we’ve got a bad faith cause of action. And it says you need\n          to apportion your time to each in case you’re not successful on one of\n          them.\n                                           28\n\f       But what basically happens is in this case we’re trying to get a\nnew roof. So 95 percent of the time that we spend on this case is\ntowards that. And that—so in other words, the breach of—the work\nyou do for breach of c[ontract] and bad faith is inextricably\nintertwined. That’s the terminology they use.\n       I would estimate that 5 percent of the time that we’ve spent was\nspent solely on bad faith issues.\nIn addition, Daly testified:\n\nQ. (By Mr. Black) So I take the number that you’ve got at the bottom\nthere and it’s $157,078.01. Now, the answer that you gave me about\ninextricably intertwining and causes of action that are so intertwined,\nsounded like a lawyer answer. And so I just—I want you to help me\nunderstand a little bit better what it means when you talk about\nseparating out time and why you’re doing that.\nA. Sure. Let’s say for example we want to go take the deposition of\ntheir expert. Now, we’re going to have to drive to the deposition, ask\nthe questions, prepare for the deposition, read the deposition,\nregardless of whether or not it’s a breach of contract claim or a bad\nfaith claim.\nQ. And stop right there. And why does it matter that you’re talking a\nbreach of contract claim versus a bad faith claim, what's the\ndifference?\nA. I’m not sure I understand what you mean.\nQ. I mean, do you get attorney’s fees for both?\nA. Oh, yeah, you do, you get attorney’s fees for both anyway.\nQ. All right. Keep going. I’m sorry I interrupted you.\nA. But, if for example, you don’t prevail on one of the claims or you\ndecide, you know, we’re not going to ask for any money for one of the\nclaims, then it would be improper for a jury to say, well, you know,\neither you didn’t ask for bad faith or you didn’t prevail on the bad\nfaith despite the fact you prevailed on the breach of contract, so we\nneed to knock 5 percent off because you spent 5 percent of your time\nsolely on bad faith.\nQ. So if you knocked 5 percent off this bill, and I’m just going to—\n\n\n                                  29\n\f      MR. BLACK: The Court can take judicial notice of this or people can\n      trust that I did the math correctly if you get cross-examined on it.\n      Q. (By Mr. Black) But 5 percent of that amount is $78[]53.90, which\n      yields $149,224.11.\n            Is this figure under the subtotal line the figure that would\n      represent 5 percent discounted off of your bill?\n      A. It is.\n      Q. All right. And do you think that that figure is a fair and reasonable\n      sum to request of a jury or anyone in a case like this?\n      A. I think it’s fair, reasonable and necessary. Yes.\n\n      There is no dispute that Hanson cannot recover attorney’s fees for any claim\naside from her contract claim against State Farm. As a result, Hanson generally\nwas required to segregate fees.      Hanson, however, provided evidence that 95\npercent of the attorney’s fees was for work related directly to prosecuting her\ncontract claim or for work that was so intertwined with that claim and that five\npercent of the attorney’s fees was for work attributable solely to bad faith claims.\n\n      State Farm asserts that Hanson’s attempt to segregate using a percentage\nestimate was unsupported and therefore insufficient, relying primarily on Farmers\nGroup Insurance, Inc. v. Poteet, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2014,\npet. denied). In Poteet, the court of appeals remanded for a redetermination of fees\nin part because the insured “failed to segregate her attorney’s fees related to the\nalleged breach of the appraisal provision from those fees incurred in pursuit of the\nclaims upon which she did not prevail in the prior appeal from the summary\njudgment and the claims upon which we have held that damages are not\nrecoverable on this appeal.”      Id. at 333.    The circumstances in Poteet are\ndistinguishable. Procedurally, there was a previous appeal where the appellate\ncourt affirmed a summary judgment on a multitude of claims in favor of the insurer\nand remanded for proceedings on the sole remaining claim of breach of the\n\n                                          30\n\fpolicy’s appraisal provision. Id. at 318. Moreover, in the second appeal, the\nPoteet court held that the trial court erred in failing to disregard the jury’s findings\nregarding two of the three awards of damages resulting from the insurer’s failure to\ncomply with the appraisal provision. Id. at 331–32. The insured’s attorney’s\npercentage estimate based on “the entire litigation” failed to account for these\ncircumstances. See id. at 332.       As a result, the Poteet court concluded that the\ninsured’s provided estimate was insufficient under Chapa:\n\n       Poteet’s attorney made his “rough estimate” by lumping together\n       hundreds of hours spent working to recover damages that Farmers had\n       no duty to pay. Most significantly, there is no estimate of the\n       reasonable and necessary fees incurred in pursuing the sole claim that\n       survived the first appeal of this lawsuit.\nPoteet, 434 S.W.3d at 333.\n\n       In contrast, Hanson’s case involved one continuous proceeding in the trial\ncourt, not proceedings both pre- and post-dating a remand after appeal.                  In\naddition, we already concluded that legally sufficient evidence supports the jury’s\nbreach finding (and State Farm otherwise does not challenge the jury’s actual\ndamages award). Further, Hanson presented evidence in the form of an estimate of\nthe reasonable and necessary fees incurred in, or at the least intertwined with, the\npursuit of her contract claim.\n\n       Nevertheless, State Farm argues the only way to properly segregate is to\nexamine each billing entry and deduct amounts that are not recoverable. See\nCitizens Nat’l Bank, 387 S.W.3d at 87–88 (attributing 66 percent of fees to\nUniform Fraudulent Transfer Act case).21 While we have held such a process\nsufficient, we do not necessarily require it under “the relaxed standard enunciated\n\n       21\n          The attorney in Citizens National Bank explained that he performed this review “in\n[his] mind” and “in [his] head.” 387 S.W.3d at 88.\n\n                                            31\n\fin Chapa”22:\n\n      Attorneys are not required to keep separate records documenting the\n      exact amount of time working on one recoverable claim versus an\n      unrecoverable claim. . . . Rather, segregation is sufficiently\n      established if, for example, an attorney testifies that a given\n      percentage of the drafting time would have been necessary even if the\n      claim for which attorney’s fees are unrecoverable had not been\n      asserted.\n\nPerry, 440 S.W.3d at 246 (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314, and Citizens Nat’l\nBank, 387 S.W.3d at 87). In Alief Independent School District v. Perry, we\nconsidered whether the plaintiff’s evidence from his attorney attributing\napproximately “80% of his attorney’s fees to each claim to each [defendant] for\nwhich fees were recoverable” was sufficient under the Chapa standard. Id. at 247.\nThis evidence consisted of redacted invoices, as well as affidavit testimony from\nhis attorney. Id. at 246. The attorney testified that all the discovery “would have\nbeen equally applicable” to the nonsuited claims. Id. He opined that less than ten\npercent of the time spent related solely to nonsuited claims.      Id. He further\nestimated an additional five percent reduction for each claim for which a defendant\nwas not liable or which was an alternative claim to account for legal research and\nanalysis attributable only to these claims. Id. at 247. We held such evidence\nsupported a conclusion that the plaintiff properly segregated his claims. Perry, 440\nS.W.3d at 247; see also Sentinel Integrity Sols., Inc. v.

As reflected by Daly’s expert deposition example,\ndiscovery for her contract claim equally applied to her bad faith claims.\nApproximately 95 percent of the time, Hanson’s attorneys’ work went toward or\nwas intertwined with getting Hanson a new roof pursuant to the contract. Daly\nestimated that five percent of the attorneys’ time shown in the summary was spent\nsolely on bad faith issues. Further, the summary is consistent with Daly’s estimate.\nWhile not required by Chapa, see Perry, 440 S.W.3d at 246, the summary included\ndaily entries describing discrete legal tasks expressly relating to Hanson’s bad\nfaith, extra-contractual, or Insurance Code claims.23 Excising the entire amount of\nthose daily entries reduces the total balance by just over five percent. Moreover,\nDaly explained that the amount included in the summary did not include every fee\nincurred in the course of trial, particularly for the trial days themselves:\n\n              I mean, it is—we’ve put countless hours just in the past, you\n       know, weeks preparing for this case. And so you’re looking at 15, 16\n       hours a day. You’ll see that on the bills here we put ten. It’s not even\n       close. I mean, we’ve got—we’re here [from] 8:30 until 5:00 and then\n       I go back straight back to the office.\n\nSee Sentinel Integrity Sols., 414 S.W.3d at 929–30 (considering as part of\nsegregation analysis testimony that bills did not include every fee incurred).\n\n       We therefore conclude that Hanson’s evidence supporting her attorney’s fees\nwas sufficiently segregated under Chapa.\n\n       5. Excessiveness\n\n       Finally, State Farm contends that because the attorney’s fee award of\n\n       23\n          For the most part, we agree with State Farm’s statement that “[t]he fee statement\ncontains entries for non-recoverable fees for claims on which Hanson did not prevail.” However,\nwe do not agree that tasks involving research of State Farm’s policies with regard to denial of\nclaims or “wind lift” would necessarily only advance Hanson’s non-contract claims.\n\n                                              33\n\f$70,000 is unreasonably disproportionate to her damages award of $12,878 the\ntrial court abused its discretion when it denied State Farm’s motion for remittitur.\n\n      This court may only remit the jury’s award when we determine, after\nevaluation of the evidence, that the award is so against the great weight and\npreponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust.

Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1500135\"><a href=\"/opinion/1500135/pope-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (Tex. 1986) (per curiam) (factual sufficiency is proper remittitur\nstandard). Here, the parties presented competing expert evidence regarding the\nreasonableness of the attorney’s fees award. Daly opined that Hanson’s case was\ndifficult and complicated with regard to defenses, discovery, and legal challenges.\nDaly testified that just under $150,000 in attorney’s fees was reasonable and\nnecessary. Levy opined that Hanson’s case was straightforward and reasonably\ncould have been tried by a second-year associate for $30,000 to $40,000.\nHowever, even such an amount would be approximately three times more than\nwhat the jury ultimately awarded Hanson as actual damages. See Bencon Mgmt.,\n178 S.W.3d at 209–10 (fee award of over $282,000 compared to actual damages of\n$81,336.83 was not factually insufficient); see also Metroplex Mailing Services,\nLLC v.

See Pope, 711 S.W.2d at 624. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion.\n\n       We overrule all of State Farm’s challenges to Hanson’s attorney’s fee award.\n\n                            III.
