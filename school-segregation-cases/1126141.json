ROBERT HOOD\n\n                  Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                         No. 01-05939-40    Joseph B. Dailey, Judge\n\n\n\n                 No. W2004-01678-CCA-R3-DD - Filed September 13, 2005\n\n\nCapital Defendant, Robert Hood, appeals as of right his conviction of first degree murder and\nsentence of death resulting from the 2001 murder of Toni Banks. A Shelby County grand jury\ncharged the defendant by indictment with one count of felony murder, one count of premeditated\nmurder, two counts of misdemeanor theft of property, and two counts of especially aggravated\nkidnapping. On May 6, 2004, a Shelby County jury found the defendant guilty of both counts of\nhomicide and guilty as to both counts of misdemeanor theft. The jury acquitted the defendant on\nboth counts of aggravated kidnapping. After a separate sentencing hearing, the jury unanimously\nfound the presence of one statutory aggravating circumstance, that the defendant had previously been\nconvicted of a violent felony offense. The jury further determined that this aggravating circumstance\noutweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and imposed a sentence of\ndeath. The trial court approved the sentencing verdict. The defendant appeals presenting for our\nreview the following issues: (1) whether the trial court erred by denying the defendant’s request to\nproceed pro se, (2) whether the trial court erred by refusing to permit defense counsel to withdraw,\n(3) whether the presence of uniformed detention response team members sitting on either side of the\ndefendant throughout trial was prejudicial error, (4) whether the evidence is sufficient to support a\nverdict of premeditated murder, (5) whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence involving\nprior bad acts of the defendant, (6) whether the trial court’s instruction that the defendant’s prior\noffenses were offenses whose statutory elements involved the use of violence violated the United\nStates Constitution, (7) whether the death penalty imposed in this case violated due process because\nthe indictment failed to allege the aggravators relied upon by the state, and (8) whether Tennessee’s\ndeath penalty scheme is unconstitutional. Finding no error requiring reversal, we affirm the\ndefendant’s conviction and sentence of death.\n\n    Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court is Affirmed.\n\nJAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which, JERRY L. SMITH and\nNORMA MCGEE OGLE , JJ., joined.\n\nRobert Wilson Jones, District Public Defender; Diane Thackery, Assistant Public Defender; Latonya\nBurrows, Assistant Public Defender (at trial); Tony N. Brayton, Assistant Public Defender; Garland\n\fErgüden, Assistant Public Defender; and Phyllis Aluko, Assistant Public Defender (on appeal), for\nthe appellant, Robert Hood.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General and Reporter; Angele M. Gregory, Assistant Attorney General;\nWilliam L. Gibbons, District Attorney General; and Amy Weirich and Gerald Harris, Assistant\nDistrict Attorneys General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                              OPINION\n\n                                        Guilt Phase Evidence\n\n               On December 27, 2000, Phimphone Panyanouvong, his wife, and his daughter were\nat their home located at 3128 Ashwood in Memphis. Mr. Panyanouvong’s wife, Thong, and his\ndaughter, Phymonie, left the home to go to the grocery store. At the time, Mr. Panyanouvong was\nreading a book.\n\n                At approximately the same time, Joseph Jackson went to “the shop” to show his car\nto the man who had recently painted it. While Jackson was at the shop, he received a call on his\ncellular phone from the defendant. The defendant had two children with Jackson’s sister, and the\ntwo men had business dealings together. The defendant asked Jackson to come pick him up and\nprovided directions to a house near Camelot. The defendant advised Jackson that he would be in the\ndoorway of the house. In the past, the defendant and Jackson had dealt with one another involving\nstolen property, and Jackson assumed that this call pertained to stolen property also. Jackson arrived\nat the location, parked his car, and went into the house. Jackson observed a “man laying [sic] on\nthe floor gagging from blood coming out of his mouth.” The defendant told Jackson that “he had\nto shoot him.” Neither man did anything to assist the man lying on the floor.\n\n                 While Jackson stood in shock, the defendant went through the residence gathering\nitems. The defendant then proceeded to load his “loot” into a car sitting in the garage. Jackson\nobserved “a bottle of whiskey, a [television] and a duffle bag.” Jackson then observed the defendant\ndrive off in the victim’s car. Jackson followed in his vehicle. The defendant proceeded to a location\noff of Tchulahoma. He parked behind a building and waited for Jackson. The men then “loaded the\nstuff out [of] the victim’s car into [Jackson’s] car.” The men then drove both vehicles to a side street\noff Winchester and parked the victim’s car in front of a club. The defendant then joined Jackson in\nhis vehicle, and Jackson drove the defendant to his apartment.\n\n                Thong and Phymonie Panuanouvong returned to their home a couple of hours later\nand noticed that the car was missing from the garage. At first, Thong thought her husband had gone\nto buy cigarettes. However, upon entering the house, she saw her husband “lay down in the front\ndoor.” Thong called several family members and then called “911.” Phymonie, Mr.\nPanyanouvong’s daughter, noticed that her father was bleeding. Upon this discovery, Thong called\nthe police. Before the police arrived, Thong walked through her house and observed that “[t]he\nhouse – the mess.” Thong’s and her husband’s jewelry and a television were missing. Thong also\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fnoticed that a clock, her fur coat, Mr. Panyanouvong’s wallet, and a camcorder were missing.\n\n             At his apartment on Dunnavant Street that he shared with his girlfriend, the defendant\nunloaded the items from Jackson’s car. Jackson noticed a duffle bag, a television, and a fur coat.\nJackson never got out of his car, and when the defendant was finished unloading the car, Jackson\nleft. The defendant paid Jackson not “even quite a hundred dollars” cash and gave him a camcorder.\nA few days later, the defendant also gave Jackson a credit card. Jackson purchased gas with the\ncredit card.\n\n                Jackson was arrested on unrelated charges on January 8, 2001. While in jail, Jackson\nhad his fiancé, Lisa Matthews, complete a three-way telephone call to the defendant on at least two\noccasions. During the telephone call, Jackson informed the defendant that he was not in jail because\nof the December 27 incident and that he would not inform the police about the December 27\nincident. During these conversations, the defendant made a comment that his girlfriend, Toni Banks,\nknew too much and that “she got to go.” The comment was prompted because Jackson heard yelling\nand screaming between the defendant and Banks. Jackson asked, “[W]hat’s going on?” In response,\nthe defendant kept saying “this girl,” and then he made the comment that “she got to go.”\n\n               The defendant lived with Toni Banks and her two children, James and Demarius, in\nan apartment on Dunnavant Street. The four had moved into the apartment around October or\nNovember of 2000. James was in the third grade, and Demarius was in the second grade. Percy\nFoster, Toni Banks’s brother, lived in the apartment upstairs with his wife and three daughters.\nJames Banks, another brother, also lived in the same apartment complex with his girlfriend and three\nchildren. It was well known that the defendant kept a gun tucked inside his waistband. Percy Foster\nhad observed the defendant shooting a gun into the wooded area behind the apartment complex and\nhad informed his mother that the defendant had a small caliber weapon in the apartment with Toni\nand her children.\n\n                On February 6, 2001, Toni Banks washed clothes at James’s apartment after she\nreturned from her job at Super Value. The defendant helped Toni bring over their dirty laundry to\nJames’s apartment. James noticed that the defendant had been drinking. That day, Toni had her\nrent money, $255 in cash, on her person. She also had additional cash, and she lent her brother Percy\n$20 at approximately 6:30 p.m. In addition, she gave her brother James money to buy liquor so\nJames could make her daiquiris in his blender. Toni washed about ten loads of laundry at James’s\napartment. James later went to Toni’s apartment to tell her that she had left some of her laundry at\nhis apartment. Toni and the defendant then had words about the laundry because the defendant\nrefused to go get the laundry. James commented that the defendant was living free on her paycheck\nand that he could not even assist her with the laundry. Toni told James not to worry about it and\ngave him money to go buy a beer. She added that she was going to get rid of the defendant and that\nhe was going to have to leave her house.\n\n             The defendant and Donald Armstrong went to the liquor store at about 8:45 p.m. and\nbought a half pint of E & J Brandy. Armstrong noticed that, although the defendant did not act\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fdrunk, he did look as if he had been drinking. During their trip to the liquor store, the defendant\nrelated that he and his girlfriend had been having problems. When they got back to the apartment\ncomplex, the defendant remarked that he was “going to holler at his girlfriend and talk to her . . .\n[t]ry to . . . straighten things up with her.” Forty-five minutes later, Armstrong saw the defendant\nagain, and the defendant asked Armstrong to drive him somewhere. The defendant gave Armstrong\nfive dollars for driving him to Crump Street. During the drive, the defendant told Armstrong that\nhe had done something and that he was “fixing to leave town.” Armstrong noticed that the\ndefendant appeared “a little shook up and nervous.” Armstrong dropped the defendant off on Crump\nStreet across from the Martel Projects. As he was leaving, Armstrong observed the defendant run\nacross the street to the projects.\n\n                Both Percy Foster and James Banks had seen the defendant standing in the driveway\ndrinking with their younger brother, Leslie. James went out and had a “couple of drinks with\nLeslie.” The defendant later came to Foster’s apartment, which surprised Foster because the two\nmen did not get along. The defendant was returning three knives that Toni had borrowed from her\nbrother. The defendant told Foster that “he didn’t want any confusion down at the house that night.\nAnd he was taking – for me not to bring anything sharp back down to the house. And if anything\ngo on downstairs – you know, he knew that I could hear through the heater – that if I heard anything\ngoing on for me to please come down there. He would open the door for me. . . . He promised\nme that.” Neither Percy Foster nor his wife could make any sense of the defendant’s comments.\nFoster saw the defendant again at 8:30 p.m. when a friend alerted him that the defendant and Foster’s\nbrother, Leslie, were urinating on the garbage cans.\n\n                That evening, Toni prepared dinner for her children. The children observed Toni\nfighting with the defendant. During the fight, the defendant and Toni threw items at each other, and\nthe kitchen table was knocked over. James later went upstairs to his uncle’s apartment and\ntelephoned his grandmother, telling her that he wanted to go to her house. He then returned to his\nown apartment. Eventually, Toni told her children to go their bedroom, and the couple continued\narguing.\n\n              On February 7, 2001, James woke up late for school. He woke his brother, and the two\nwent to find their mother. The two boys thought she was in her bedroom, but she did not respond\nto their calling her. Her bedroom door was locked, so James “got a knife and opened the door.”\nUpon opening the door, James saw a form on the bed covered with bedclothes. Frightened by their\nfinding, the boys attempted to leave the apartment. The defendant was not in the apartment.\n\n             The boys discovered that they were locked inside the apartment and only their mother\nand the defendant had keys to unlock the door. James then took a broom and knocked on the ceiling\nto signal their cousin, who lived upstairs, to come down. Shortly thereafter, a cousin, Lashelle\nFoster, came downstairs. However, she was unable to gain access to the locked apartment. Lashelle\ninstructed the children to take the covers off of the body in their mother’s bedroom. The boys did\nas instructed and discovered their mother beneath the covers. They were unsuccessful in their\nattempt to awaken her. The boys noticed that their mother was not breathing and that there was\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fblood on her head. Lashelle informed her father, who was upstairs in his apartment, that Toni had\nbeen shot. Percy Foster then called 911. The police and an ambulance arrived. The police, assisted\nby Percy Foster and his friends, broke the lock on the front door to gain access to the apartment.\n\n            Lashelle Foster took the children upstairs to Percy’s apartment while Percy Foster\nproceeded to the victim’s bedroom. Percy observed his sister “laying [sic] there with a bullet hole\nin her head, blood against the wall, partly covered body.” The house was ransacked, which was\nunusual because Toni “kept a very neat house.” No money was found in the apartment.\n\n             Memphis Police Officer Cham Payne responded to the call at the Dunnavant Street\napartment. He arrived after the uniformed officers had secured the scene. At this time, the only\nsuspect was the defendant. No weapon, keys, or money was found at the scene. The only place\nwhere blood was found was the east wall of the bedroom near the victim’s head. The victim was\ndressed only in a purple T-shirt. A pair of children’s scissors was found beneath some clothes on\nthe mattress. A bullet was later recovered from the victim’s body. Lieutenant Venus Owens, also\nat the crime scene, observed that the victim’s body was “crammed against the wall, appeared to have\nbeen pushed like into a corner, and her head was jammed against the wall.”\n\n                Memphis police officers attempted to locate the defendant. They were later advised\nby the defendant’s family members that he was no longer in Memphis and that they did not know\nwhere he was. Notwithstanding, during the May 2001 term, the Shelby County grand jury indicted\nthe defendant on one count of felony murder resulting in the death of Toni Banks, one count of\npremeditated first degree murder resulting in the death of the victim, two counts of especially\naggravated kidnapping, one count of theft of property by obtaining the victim’s property, and one\ncount of theft of property by exercising control over the victim’s property. In June 2001, Memphis\npolice officers learned that the defendant was in custody in Colorado. In February 2003, Captain\nRonald Goodwin, a member of the District Attorney’s Anti- Gang Team, accompanied by his partner\nRonny Wilkerson, drove to Colorado and took the defendant into custody.\n\n                Heath Barker, a special agent forensic scientist with the Tennessee Bureau of\nInvestigation, examined the bullet and lead fragments from both the Panyanouvong murder and Toni\nBanks’s murder. Special Agent Barker examined the specimens in an attempt to determine whether\nboth bullets were fired from the same weapon but could not reach a conclusion because the bullets\nand fragments were too mutilated for testing. However, Special Agent Barker was able to conclude\nthat both bullets were fired from a .22 caliber weapon. The sound emanating from the firing of a\n.22 caliber weapon is not as loud as that from a larger caliber weapon.\n\n               Doctor Cynthia Gardner, a Deputy Medical Examiner for Shelby County, 1 performed\nthe autopsies on the bodies of Toni Banks and Mr. Panyanouvong. Regarding the autopsy of Toni\nBanks, Dr. Gardner found that the toxicology testing indicated the presence of both caffeine and\nalcohol in the victim’s blood. The victim’s blood alcohol level was .23 grams per decimeter. A\nphysical examination of the victim’s body revealed the presence of a near contact gunshot wound\n\n   1\n       At the time of trial, D r. Gardner was em ployed as a deputy coro ner in H amilton Co unty, Ohio.\n\n                                                           -5-\n\fabove the right eye on the right forehead. In support of the conclusion that the gunshot was near\ncontact, Dr. Gardner found gunpowder stippling as well as unburned flakes of gunpowder and soot.\nThis fine residue is only visible when the gun is fired from six inches or less from the victim’s body,\nsupporting the conclusion that the weapon was fired within six inches from the head. Doctor\nGardner also found unburned flakes of gunpowder on the inside of the victim’s right arm. The\npresence of the flakes on the victim’s arm in relation to the gunshot wound are consistent with a\ndefensive type maneuver and are also consistent with the “way one’s arm might be laying if they\nwere . . . asleep.” Doctor Gardner removed a bullet from the victim’s brain.\n\n                Doctor Gardner also observed the blood patterns. From the pattern of the blood\nemanating from the wound, Dr. Gardner was able to determine that the pattern was consistent with\nthe victim lying down at the time the wound was inflicted. Doctor Gardner concluded that the\nvictim’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to her head. She further concluded that the gun was\nfired within six inches from her head.\n\n                Following the proof, the trial court instructed the jury as to the applicable law. The\njury began deliberations at 8:00 p.m. The trial court ended deliberations at 9:30 p.m. and resumed\ndeliberations the next day at 8:45 a.m. The jury returned their verdict at 10:20 a.m. The jury found\nthe defendant guilty of first degree felony murder, first degree premeditated murder, and theft of\nproperty. However, the jury acquitted the defendant of both counts of especially aggravated\nkidnapping.\n\n                                      Penalty Phase Evidence\n\n               At the penalty phase, the state introduced the testimony of Barbara Banks, the\nvictim’s mother. Ms. Banks testified that she had seven children. She stated that since her\ndaughter’s murder she has custody of Toni’s children, 12-year-old James, 10-year-old Demarius, and\n16-year-old Lisa. Ms. Banks explained that the children lived with her and her husband, along with\nBarbara Banks’s daughter, whose name is also Lisa, and her baby. She testified that neither she nor\nher husband works and that they survive on social security alone. She added that she is 64 years old\nand her husband is 76 years old. Her daughter Lisa works, and James, Demarius, and Lisa each\nreceive $124.00 a month in social security death benefits.\n\n                Barbara Banks testified that she takes medication for nerves, high blood pressure, and\nher heart. She explained that she began taking the medication soon after her daughter’s murder.\nShe stated that it is a burden to “start all over raising small kids.”\n\n                Ms. Banks further testified that, at the time of the murder, the victim was thirty-five\nyears old. Toni was working, going to church, and was generally doing well at the time of her death.\nSince her murder, the victim’s children had suffered emotionally. Demarius, the youngest, has\nproblems sleeping at night. James “acts out things . . . [h]e’s very easy to get upset.” The boys\nwere attending counseling sessions, but Ms. Banks stopped taking them because she felt they were\ngetting better. She realized that they were not better and was planning on resuming the counseling\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fsessions. Ms. Banks testified that Toni’s oldest child, Lisa, helps her with the boys.                        Lisa has\nbecome withdrawn and has changed substantially since her mother’s murder.\n\n                The state introduced through the testimony of Kimberly Tanzy, an employee in the\nShelby County Criminal Court Clerk’s Office, prior convictions of the defendant. The clerk’s files\nindicated that the defendant had been indicted in case number 94-03958 for attempt to commit first\ndegree murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of reckless endangerment. Ms. Tanzy read into\nevidence the affidavit of complaint for this charge. The affidavit provided that\n\n                  Mr. Hubert Ballentine. . . rented the business establishment . . . at\n                  1043 South Third for . . . a Christmas party . . . . Two subjects, [the\n                  defendant] and his brother, Billy Joe, entered the business and both\n                  men had been drinking. Both became loud and abusive towards the\n                  family and friends of Mr. Ballentine. . . . Mr. Ballentine told the\n                  two that they were not members of the family or of the business, and\n                  that . . . they would have to leave. He then physically escorted the\n                  two subjects out. The two subjects left . . . and returned . . . 10\n                  minutes later. . . . [The defendant] produced a pistol and his brother\n                  . . . began fighting with . . . [the defendant], over who would get to\n                  shoot the victim. Defendant Billy Joe Hood . . . wrestled the gun\n                  from [the defendant] and then shot the victim, Hubert Ballentine. Mr.\n                  Ballentine was shot in the left side. The bullet went under his heart.\n                  He is listed in critical but stable condition.\n\nAlso introduced were instruments from Elpaso County, Colorado, showing that the defendant was\nconvicted in case number 01-CR-2120 of one count of first degree kidnapping; five counts of\ncommitting a crime of violence using a deadly weapon; two counts of second degree kidnapping;\none count of aggravated robbery; one count of aggravated criminal extortion; and one count of\nmenacing. The defendant was also convicted in Colorado case number 01CR-2263 of two counts\nof murder in the first degree, four counts of committing a crime of violence with a deadly weapon,\nand two counts of aggravated robbery.2 The defense stipulated that all of the convictions from\nColorado and Tennessee belong to the defendant.\n\n                Officer Bernice Murckson, a deputy Shelby County jailer, testified for the defendant\nthat she was assigned to the fourth floor, “B” pod, and had been for five months. She explained that\n“B” pod housed all high risk inmates. Officer Murckson stated that the defendant was housed in “B”\npod. Officer Murckson testified that she had never had any problems with the defendant during her\nshift. She added that he interacted well with other inmates and that he followed the policy and\nprocedures. She concluded that he was respectful of her.\n\n\n\n    2\n     A motion filed by defense counsel averred that the defendant is currently serving a life sentence plus\nconsecutive sentenc es totaling more than 5 00 years resulting from his Colorad o conviction s.\n\n                                                         -7-\n\f                 On cross-examination, Officer Murckson acknowledged that the defendant had\nviolated jail rules on June 22, 2000, and June 23, 2000, while at “R” pod, for failing to comply with\norders of a jailer. She stated that she was not assigned to that pod. She denied knowledge of other\njail infractions committed by the defendant, including an occasion where he displayed his penis to\nan officer conducting an armband check, despite three prior verbal warnings to stop exposing\nhimself. On another occasion, the defendant refused to “lock down” when ordered to do so by a\njailer. As a result, the defendant was placed in administrative segregation. Officer Murckson\nexplained that administrative segregation is for inmates who are out of control. She explained that\nher testimony was limited to the defendant’s behavior only when he was under her supervision. She\ndid not know that the defendant, while in custody in Colorado, had cut another inmate with a razor\nblade, resulting in a twelve-inch wound to the inmate’s abdomen. She also was not aware of an\nincident in Colorado when the defendant created a jail disturbance and attempted to strike an officer.\n\n               Officer Donald Kelly, a deputy jailer, testified that he was assigned to fourth floor,\n“B” pod. He admitted that he was not aware of any of the infractions that Officer Murckson was\nquestioned about by the state. Like Officer Murckson, he had only been on “B” pod for five months.\nDuring this time, Officer Kelly had not had any problems with the defendant. Officer Kelly testified\nthat the defendant was “laid back” and stayed to himself.\n\n                Defendant’s sister, Connie, testified that there were nine children in their family, six\nboys and three girls. Connie Hood noted that many of the defendant’s family members were present\nin the courtroom, including his mother, his aunt, his sister-in-law, his children’s mother, his son,\nanother sister, and a brother.\n\n                 Connie Hood stated that she was not close to her brother, Robert. She stated that\nprior to this trial, she had not seen her brother for five years. She explained that his absence from\ntheir family was his choice and that the family cared about him regardless of what he had done.\nConnie Hood stated that she had never visited her brother after he was taken into custody. She stated\nthat she thought that “Cindy and my mom been down here.” She did not know if any other family\nmembers had visited the defendant at the jail. She further testified that the defendant’s actions\nduring his adult life had affected their mother, knowing that she did not raise him that way. She\nacknowledged that another brother was in jail at the present time. The remaining siblings all work\nand have families.\n\n               Connie Hood testified that the defendant had received a gunshot wound to the head\nsometime during the 1990s. She did not know the circumstances of the shooting, but she did visit\nher brother while he was in the hospital. Connie Hood testified that the defendant has three children,\nages 12, 17, and 19. She does not have contact with these children. She could not offer any\nexplanation for the course the defendant chose to take. Rather, she stated that she would always\nwonder.\n\n               Their mother suffered from high blood pressure and is diabetic. Connie Hood stated\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\fthat her brother’s receiving the death penalty would “really hurt [their mother] bad.” She added that\nthis would impact the entire family.\n\n               On cross-examination, Ms. Hood stated that she did not think that her brother’s gun-\nshot wound to his head had any effect on him. She admitted that he was getting in trouble before\nthe incident and continued to get into trouble after the incident.\n\n               Another sister, Cindy Hood, testified that the defendant was her younger brother.\nCindy and her children had visited her brother in the jail and accepted collect calls from him. Cindy\ndescribed her brother as “pretty decent as a human.” She acknowledged that he had made “some\nmistakes,” as “sure [as] we all have.” She further admitted that he had “done some pretty bad\nthings.”\n\n                Cindy explained that her brother’s behavior had greatly affected their mother. She\nstated that she had tried to convince her brother that there are other ways to do things but that he\n“made his own decisions.” In stating that she did not believe that her brother should be sentenced\nto death, she admitted that he had “made some mistakes.” She rationalized that “[w]e all have [made\nmistakes.] So should we all be sentenced to death?” She added that the imposition of a death\nsentence would be “devastating for me and my family as well as my kids.” On cross-examination,\nCindy Hood acknowledged that there is a difference between the mistakes made by the defendant\nand the mistakes made by herself. Cindy admitted that she had heard that her brother used the alias\nof Billy McGhee while he was in Colorado. She further acknowledged that she had heard about her\nbrother’s involvement in a conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery and his conviction for\naggravated motor vehicle theft in Colorado. She stated that she had no knowledge of her brother’s\nColorado convictions for first degree criminal trespass, theft, and reckless endangerment. She also\ndenied knowledge of any other alias names used by her brother. Notwithstanding this information,\nMs. Hood maintained that he was a decent person. She was then questioned regarding her brother’s\nShelby County, Tennessee convictions, including his 2000 conviction of vandalism over $500, his\n2000 conviction of attempted burglary of a building, his 2000 conviction of criminal trespass, his\n1994 conviction of theft of property over $1000, his 1994 conviction of reckless endangerment with\na deadly weapon, his 1994 conviction of theft over $500, his 1994 conviction of contempt of court,\nhis 1989 conviction of receiving/concealing stolen property, his 1987 conviction of escape, and his\n1986 conviction of attempt to commit grand larceny. She stated that she could not recall these\nconvictions and still maintained that the defendant was a decent person.\n\n              On re-direct examination Ms. Hood maintained that she would always love her\nbrother “no matter what.” She stated that he was her brother and nothing would change that fact.\n\n               At the close of the proof, the trial court instructed the jury on the following statutory\naggravating circumstances:\n\n               One, that the defendant was previously convicted of one or more\n               felonies other than the present charge, the statutory elements of which\n\n\n                                                  -9-\n\f               involve the use of violence to the person. The state is relying upon\n               the crimes of murder in the first degree, reckless endangerment, first\n               degree kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery,\n               crime of violence [sic] deadly weapon, and menacing which are\n               felonies involving the use of violence to the person. Proof of\n               additional convictions may be considered by you only as they relate\n               to the credibility of witnesses. Two, the murder was committed for\n               the purpose of avoiding, interfering with or preventing a lawful arrest\n               or prosecution of the defendant or another.\n\nThe court then instructed the jury as to the following mitigating circumstances:\n\n               Mitigating circumstances, Tennessee law provides that in arriving at\n               the punishment, the jury shall consider, as previously indicated, any\n               mitigating circumstances raised by the evidence which . . . may\n               include, but are not limited to the following: One, that the capacity of\n               the defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\n               conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\n               impaired as a result of intoxication which was insufficient to establish\n               a defense to the crime, but which substantially [a]ffected his\n               judgment. Two, that the defendant gets along well in a structured\n               environment such as in jail. Three, that the defendant has family\n               members who love him and want him to live. Four, that the\n               defendant received a gunshot wound to the head. Five, any other\n               mitigating factor which is raised by the evidence produced by either\n               the prosecution or the defense at either the guilt or sentencing\n               hearing. That is, you shall consider any aspect of the defendant’s\n               character or record or any aspect of the circumstances of the offense\n               favorable to the defendant which is supported by the evidence.\n\n               Following submission of the instructions, the jury retired to consider the verdict at\n4:00 p.m. At 5:35 p.m., the jury returned its verdict, finding that the state had proven the aggravating\ncircumstance (i)(2), the defendant was previously convicted of one or more violent felonies other\nthan the present charge, beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury further found that the aggravating\ncircumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. In accordance\nwith their verdicts, the jury sentenced the defendant to death for the first degree murder of Toni\nBanks.\n\n                            I. Failure of Trial Court to Merge Verdicts\n\n                Although not raised by the defendant, the record reflects that, consistent with the jury\nverdicts, the trial court entered one judgment for murder committed during the perpetration of a\nfelony and one count of premeditated first degree murder. In State v. Howard, 30 S.W.3d 271 (Tenn.\n\n\n                                                 -10-\n\f2000), our supreme court held that premeditated murder and felony murder are not separate offenses,\nbut different theories of guilt for the crime of first degree murder. Id. at 274 n.4. Therefore, separate\nconvictions for both felony murder and premeditated murder based upon the same occurrence must\nbe merged. In this case, when the trial court found the evidence sufficient to support both verdicts,\nthe trial court should have merged the guilty verdicts into one judgment for first degree murder. See\nState v. Cribbs, 967 S.W.2d 773, 788 (Tenn. 1998). Defendant’s conviction for felony murder must\nbe merged with his conviction for premeditated murder, and this case is remanded for entry of\njudgments consistent with this opinion.\n\n                 Similarly, the trial court also entered judgments for each of the alternative counts of\ntheft of property under $500. The defendant was sentenced to 11 months, 29 days for each theft-of-\nproperty conviction. The judgment forms reflect that the sentence had been served in the matter as\na result of pretrial jail credits. The forms also indicate that the two theft sentences were ordered to\nbe served concurrently with one another. It appears that two judgments were entered for the same\noffense. Dual convictions and sentences for theft of property based upon the same evidence violate\nprinciples of double jeopardy. See State v. Denton, 938 S.W.2d 373, 382 (Tenn. 1996). The proper\nremedy is to merge the convictions. Although it has no effect upon the effective sentence and no\nchallenge is made on appeal to the theft convictions, we remand for entry of an order merging the\ntheft convictions.\n\n                          II. Refusal to Permit Defendant to Proceed Pro Se\n\n                 During a motion hearing regarding defense counsel’s request to withdraw from further\nrepresentation of defendant, defense counsel stated to the court, “I also don’t know if [the defendant]\nwould rather represent himself. I don’t know that. But if the court would like to ask him about that.”\n The trial court addressed the issue although no motion to proceed pro se had formally been made\neither orally or in writing and there was no indication from the defendant that he wished to proceed\npro se other than his statement that he had a constitutional right to be “heard by himself.”3\n\n                 The trial court noted that the case had been pending for approximately 14 months and\nthat trial was scheduled to begin a week and a half later. The trial court characterized trial counsel\nas an outstanding and experienced attorney, with access to law books, investigators, and a support\nstaff. The court further stated that to permit the defendant to proceed pro se at this stage would\nrequire a resetting of the case for six to eight months. The trial court rejected any scheme employed\nto delay the trial, noting that if such requests were allowed, trials would be continued indefinitely.\nThe trial court stated that the defendant was going to have a lawyer, and that, in fact, he was\nrepresented by two attorneys. The court further remarked that if the defendant “acted up” or “spoke\nout” he was going to be removed from the courtroom. Later, defense co-counsel informed the court\n\n         3\n            This comment was mad e in the context of defense counsel’s motion to withdraw. During argument of the\nmotion to withdraw, defendant interrupted the trial court mid-sentence, stating “I want her off my case, Your Honor.”\nIn response, the trial court warned the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to act\nup or speak up. Defendant then remarked that he had a “Tennessee constitutional . . . one declaration where I’ve got\nthe right to be heard by myself.”\n\n                                                        -11-\n\fthat the defendant “is prepared to go to trial, representing himself, on the scheduled date of April the\n26.” To this announcement, the trial court responded that no valid reason existed to permit the\ndefendant to represent himself. The trial court rejected the defendant’s pronouncement that he would\nbe ready to represent himself in a capital murder trial in one week. The court added that “any\nreasonable person looking at this situation would have to conclude that he would not be ready and\nis not capable of representing himself on this short notice in a capital case.” The court rejected the\npropriety of the defendant’s giving the court a one week notice that he intended to represent himself\nin a capital murder trial.\n\n            The defendant complains on appeal that the refusal to permit him to proceed pro se in\nthis matter amounted to constitutional error requiring reversal. The defendant concedes that this\nissue was not preserved in the motion for new trial. Nonetheless, he asserts that this court should\nreview the issue on its merits because it is an error affecting the substantial rights of the accused.\nSee Tenn. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n                 In exercising our discretion whether to entertain plain error review under Tennessee\nRule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), the Tennessee Supreme Court has directed that we examine five\nfactors, all of which must be present in a case for review under Rule 52(b) to be appropriate. These\nfive factors are as follows: (1) the record must clearly establish what occurred in the trial court; (2)\na clear and unequivocal rule of law must have been breached; (3) a substantial right of the defendant\nmust have been adversely affected; (4) the accused did not waive the issue for tactical reasons; and\n(5) consideration of the error is necessary to do substantial justice. State v. Smith, 24 S.W.3d 274,\n282-83 (Tenn. 2000) (adopting State v. Adkisson, 899 S.W.2d 626, 641 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994)).\nThe defendant asserts that all five factors are present requiring plain error review by this court.\nSpecifically, he asserts that the trial court failed to query the defendant to determine whether he\nunderstood the perils of self-representation and whether his waiver of counsel was knowing and\nintelligent. He also claims that the record clearly establishes what occurred in the trial court, that\nthe trial court’s failure to apply this rule affected a substantial right of the defendant, that no tactical\nreason exists for not including the issue in the motion for new trial, and that consideration of the\nissue is necessary to do substantial justice. We agree and proceed with our review.\n\n                  A criminal defendant has a right to be represented by counsel or to represent himself\nand proceed pro se without the assistance of counsel. See U.S. Const., amend. IV; Tenn. Const. art.\nI, § 9; Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2533 (1975); State v. Northington,\n667 S.W.2d 57, 60 (Tenn. 1984). The right to represent oneself exists “despite the fact that its\nexercise will almost surely result in detriment to both the defendant and the administration of\njustice.” See State v. Fritz, 585 P.2d 173 (Wash. Ct. App. 1978). The right is not absolute, however.\nTo activate the right of self-representation, the defendant must: (1) timely assert the right to proceed\npro se; (2) clearly and unequivocally exercise the right; and (3) knowingly and intelligently waive\nhis or her right to assistance of counsel. State v. Herrod, 754 S.W.2d 627, 629-30 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1988). Additionally, Rule 44(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that indigent\ndefendants should execute a written waiver before being allowed to proceed pro se.\n\n\n\n                                                   -12-\n\f                We first observe that the record before us contains no explicit written waiver of the\nright to counsel or a motion to proceed pro se filed by either the defendant or his counsel. See Tenn.\nR. Crim. P. 44(a). The technical record, however, contains several pro se motions submitted by the\ndefendant. Consequently, we conclude that had the defendant been adamant in his desire for self-\nrepresentation, he clearly was capable of filing an appropriate waiver.\n\n                 Next, the general rule is that a motion to proceed pro se must be made prior to trial\nin order to be considered timely. Northington, 667 S.W.2d at 62. The right may not be exercised\nfor the purpose of delaying the trial or obstructing justice, and even an unequivocal request may be\nwaived by subsequent words or conduct. State v. Luvene, 903 P.2d 960, 966 (Wash. 1995) (en\nbanc); see, e.g., United States v. Mackovich, 209 F.3d 1227, 1237 (10th Cir. 2000) (requests made\nsix to ten days before trial “were merely a tactic for delay”); United States v. George, 56 F.3d 1078,\n1084 (9th Cir. 1995) (request made on eve of trial untimely); United States v. Frazier-El, 204 F.3d\n553, 560 (4th Cir. 2000) (the “right does not exist, however, to be used as a tactic for delay”). The\ndefendant’s oral “request” in this case was made a week and a half before the start of the trial. The\ncase had been pending for 14 months, and the defendant had been represented by the same counsel\nthroughout the proceedings. The defendant had not provided any indication of his desire for self-\nrepresentation or his dissatisfaction with appointed counsel prior to the hearing on April 19, 2004.\nThe trial began on May 3, 2004. The reference to self-representation, which consisted of a statement\nthat he would be ready to proceed pro se on the scheduled trial date, was made through co-counsel\nafter the trial court denied lead counsel’s motion to withdraw. We agree with the trial court and\nconclude that defendant made this remark about representing himself as an attempt to delay the trial.\n\n                 Our next inquiry is whether the defendant’s request to proceed pro se was clear and\nunequivocal. The only evidence of a request by the defendant to proceed pro se included lead\ncounsel’s statement that “I also don’t know if Mr. Hood would rather represent himself” and co-\ncounsel’s announcement that “he is prepared to go to trial, representing himself, on the scheduled\ndate of April the 26th.” The defendant’s statement in which he interrupted the court and asserted that\nhe had a right to be heard related to his exclamation in court that he wanted lead counsel removed\nfrom his case. This statement did not relate to his desire to proceed pro se. Moreover, the defendant\nnever made any indication, through counsel or otherwise, that he wished to have co-counsel\nremoved. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the defendant’s statements made through counsel\nconstituted an unequivocal assertion of the right. See, e.g., Reese v. Nix, 942 F.2d 1276, 1281 (8th\nCir. 1991) (“I don’t want no counsel then” was not a clear and unequivocal pro se demand requiring\nFaretta inquiry); Frazier-El, 204 F.3d at 558 (assertion of the right of self-representation “must be\n. . . clear and unequivocal”).\n\n                The constitutional right of self-representation is waived if not timely and\nunequivocally asserted. Jackson v. Ylst, 921 F.2d 882, 888 (9th Cir. 1990). We conclude that the\ndefendant neither timely nor unequivocally asserted his right to self-representation. Moreover, we\nrecognize that courts should indulge every reasonable presumption against finding that a defendant\nhas waived the right to counsel. State v. Vermillion, 51 P.3d 188, 193 (Wash. Ct. App. 2002). One\npurpose is “to protect trial courts from manipulative vacillations by defendants.” State v. DeWeese,\n816 P.2d 1, 4 (Wash. 1991). There is no indication in the record that the defendant intended to\n\n                                                -13-\n\fwaive his right to have representation through co-counsel. Rather, he wanted lead counsel removed\nas counsel of record. Consideration of the defendant’s delay in asserting his desire to proceed pro\nse, his dissatisfaction with the trial court’s ruling regarding lead counsel, an absence of reasons for\nhis dissatisfaction with lead counsel’s performance, and his implication that he did not want co-\ncounsel removed from his case convinces this court that the purpose of his request was a delay tactic\nor other tactic to disrupt the court proceedings. Absent an unequivocal and timely request, the trial\ncourt was under no duty to advise the defendant of the perils of self-representation or to determine\nwhether the waiver of counsel was knowingly and voluntarily entered.\n\n                Finally, we conclude that the defendant abandoned any intention to represent himself\nwhen he did not pursue the issue of self-representation after the court rejected any notion that the\ndefendant should proceed pro se. See McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 182, 104 S. Ct. 944 , 953\n(1984) (defendant can waive his right to self-representation by allowing counsel to participate in\ntrial); accord Wilson v. Walker, 204 F.3d 33, 38 (2d Cir. 2000) (failure to reassert a desire to proceed\npro se constituted a waiver). For the foregoing reasons, we reject the propositions that the request\nwas unequivocal and timely. Accordingly, although the better practice would have been for the court\nto warn the defendant of the risks of self-representation, the court was under no duty to do so because\nthe request was neither timely nor unequivocal.\n\n                      III. Refusal to Permit Defense Counsel to Withdraw\n\n                Lead counsel, an assistant public defender, both orally and by written motion,\nrequested permission to withdraw as counsel of record for the defendant. Counsel related that the\npublic defender’s office was appointed to represent the defendant in two separate capital murder\ncases on February 19, 2003. Shortly thereafter, counsel was assigned to both cases. She maintained\nthat throughout her representation of the defendant, “he has been openly hostile to counsel, making\ncommunications difficult, at best.” The situation escalated on April 16, 2004, when counsel was\ndiscussing motions with defendant in the “lock up” area of the court. She stated that the defendant\n“became threatening toward counsel, in the presence of Officers Burress and Brown, stating he\nwould do whatever it takes to have her removed from his cases, even if it meant he would pick up\nanother charge.” Officer Burress advised counsel to leave the room. Officer Burress related the\nincident to the court. The defendant later told co-counsel and two investigators that he intended to\nhit lead counsel. Because of this incident, law enforcement personnel were present when lead\ncounsel and the defendant conferred, rendering confidential communication difficult. She stated that\nshe had never been threatened by a client in her 14 years as an attorney. Counsel concluded that she\nwas unable to function effectively under this situation.\n\n              The trial court denied the oral motion and entered a written order entered on April\n21, 2004. In denying the motion, the trial court made the following findings:\n\n               [T]here has been concern regarding Mr. Hood’s conduct and actions\n               the entire time this case has been pending in this court – certain\n               precautions have been taken on previous hearings. Additional\n\n\n                                                 -14-\n\f               precautions were taken today. No attorney should . . . have his or her\n               safety jeopardized because of a client’s actions.\n\n               But I will say that Mr. Hood, obviously being in custody, will, for\n               today’s purposes and any future court dates, be restrained – handcuffs\n               and leg restraints – and members of the DRT team will assist in\n               ensuring that he is not able to cause harm to anyone. His conduct\n               may well pose a threat to everyone in the system with whom he\n               comes in contact, and while I certainly understand Ms. Thackery’s\n               concern, and I respect her statement, and I know that she wouldn’t\n               make a request like that for any dilatory reason or frivolously, I am\n               going to ask that she stay on this case given the fact that we are a\n               couple of weeks away from trial – a week and a half away from trial,\n               the age of the case, the fact that he has two murder cases pending.\n               We need to get the first one tried before we move onto the second\n               one.\n\n                       Ms. Thackery is an experienced trial attorney; will do an\n               outstanding job in representing Mr. Hood’s interests; and anytime\n               he’s brought – I will certainly not ask Ms. Thackery nor expect her to\n               go to the jail to visit Mr. Hood. She’s welcome to visit him here in\n               lockup anytime she needs to try to speak with him here in lockup . .\n               . a completely secure area where we can ensure that Mr. Hood is\n               sufficiently restrained to . . . make certain that there will be no\n               problem for Ms. Thackery.\n\n               The defendant now complains that the trial court erred in denying counsel’s motion\nto withdraw. The defendant has failed to cite to any legal authority supporting his argument.\nAccordingly, this issue is waived. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b).\nNotwithstanding, because of the seriousness of the penalty imposed in this capital case, we elect to\nreview the issue on its merits.\n\n               The decision whether to allow counsel to withdraw in a pending criminal matter is\nvested in the sound discretion of the trial court, and the decision will not be reversed on appeal\nunless an abuse of discretion is shown. State v. Russell, 10 S.W.3d 270, 274 (Tenn. Crim. App.),\nperm. app. denied (Tenn. 1999). The trial court refused counsel’s motion, noting that this matter had\nbeen pending for over one year, that counsel was well-qualified, and that the court was not going to\npermit intentional delays by the defendant.\n\n               A review of the record supports the conclusions and ruling of the trial court. The trial\ncourt accredited counsel’s assertions that the defendant made threats against her person. Although\nwe do not consider these threats insignificant and share a strong concern for counsel’s safety, there\n\n\n\n                                                 -15-\n\fis no indication of the nature of the threats or the reason why the defendant was dissatisfied with\ncounsel.\n\n                Although an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to representation by counsel, this\nright does not include the right to counsel of choice or to a special rapport, confidence, or even\nmeaningful relationship with appointed counsel. See State v. Carruthers, 35 S.W.3d 516, 546 (Tenn.\n2000), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 953, 121 S. Ct. 2600 (2001). The trial court found that counsel was\nmore than qualified to represent the defendant. The record fails to indicate that counsel was unable\nto effectively defend the defendant against the charge of capital murder. She had been counsel of\nrecord for 14 months, during which time the defendant had no complaints with her performance.\nIndeed, the motion was made a week and a half prior to the start of trial. Had the motion been\nallowed, further delay would have been necessary for the defendant to prepare his case pro se or\nretain other counsel. See Russell, 10 S.W.3d at 270. Finally, the trial court enacted security\nmeasures to protect both counsel and persons in the courtroom. There is no indication that counsel\nhad any further adverse incident with the defendant. In fact, in requesting the removal of restraints\nduring the trial, counsel related that she had visited the defendant at the jail without incident.\n\n               Based upon the record before this court, we conclude that the defendant has failed to\ndemonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in denying counsel’s motion to withdraw.\nAccordingly, this issue is without merit.\n\n               IV. Presence of Uniformed Detention Response Team Members\n\n                  On the first morning of trial, defense counsel, relying upon a motion previously filed,\nrequested that the defendant not be required to wear handcuffs and shackles while in the presence\nof the jury. In support of this request, counsel related that she and co-counsel had visited the\ndefendant at the jail and had encountered no problems. The trial court denied the request, noting that\nthe defendant was wearing civilian clothing. The court informed counsel that the defendant would\nbe permitted to have his shirt untucked to conceal the fact that he was handcuffed. The court also\nnoted that the fact that his feet were shackled would not be noticeable. Additionally, the court\nrecounted the defendant’s history in this matter, specifically noting the defendant’s threats to\ncounsel. In this regard, the trial court considered the defendant’s Colorado convictions and sentences\nand the fact that he was facing the death penalty in Tennessee. The court concluded that there was\nlittle to deter the defendant from assaulting his attorney(s) should the trial not go the way he wanted.\n\n               During a recess in the voir dire process, counsel raised concern about the presence\nof the Detention Response Team (DRT) officers. Specifically, counsel noted that the officers’\nuniforms clearly identified them with the words “Detention Response Team” printed on front and\nback. The trial court noted that the two officers had been seated throughout the proceeding and were\nnot parading before the jury. The court found that the design on the uniform shirt or jacket did not\nprejudice the defendant. Later during the voir dire process, the trial court did request that the same\ntwo officers be present all day every day for the rest of the trial, to understand the rulings, to be\naware of what was going on, and to minimize the officers’ visibility and presence. The trial judge\n\n\n                                                  -16-\n\fexplained that he did not want a change of officers during the middle of the proceedings. The trial\ncourt did grant counsel’s request to have the DRT members move one seat down to permit counsel\nto sit next to the defendant as necessary during the trial.4\n\n                Counsel again objected to the handcuffs and shackles after the defendant expressed\nto her that it was inherently prejudicial. At this juncture, counsel again challenged the presence of\ntwo uniformed Detention Response Team members who were seated on either side of the defendant.\n Counsel noted that Officer Green was six foot one and weighed 215 pounds and that Officer\nWormley was six feet and one inch tall and weighed 198 pounds. Counsel argued that the presence\nof the officers indicated to the jury that the defendant is “dangerous, scary, and that they will be\ninherently prejudiced by that.” The trial court reiterated its previous rulings, noting that “[t]he two\nDRT officers that are here during the trial . . . conduct themselves in an extremely professional\nmanner. Show no expression yea or nay with regards to things that are said during the course of the\ntrial. And so, they do not . . . prejudice the defendant’s rights in this case in any way.”\n\n                 The defendant complains that the presence of uniformed members of the Detention\nResponse Team denied him a fair trial. He notes that two witnesses emphasized the officers’\npresence. Specifically, the defendant refers to Donald Armstrong, who had initially pointed to a\nDRT officer in response to making an in-court identification of the defendant and the penalty phase\ntestimony of Officer Murckson, who in response to questioning as to the function of the DRT,\nreplied, “That’s Detention Response Team. There (sic) are the ones who patrol and help control\ninmates [who are] high risk or violent.” Officer Murckson also identified the defendant as “the\ninmate . . . sitting between the [sic] both D.R.T. members.”\n\n                We initially observe that the defendant has failed to cite to any legal authority\nsupporting his argument. Accordingly, this issue is waived. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7); Tenn.\nCt. Crim. App. R. 10(b). Notwithstanding waiver, we elect to review his complaint that the officers’\npresence in the courtroom during the trial prejudiced his right to a fair trial. The defendant, we note,\ndoes not challenge the propriety of the handcuffs and shackles on appeal.\n\n                In Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560, 106 S. Ct. 1340 (1986), the United States\nSupreme Court defined the standard by which security presence in the courtroom may be measured\nin relation to a defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial. In reviewing a petition from a\ndefendant convicted in a Rhode Island state court, the Supreme Court concluded that “the\nconspicuous, or at least noticeable, deployment of security personnel in a courtroom during trial” is\nnot an inherently prejudicial practice and does not violate the fundamental principles of the criminal\njustice system. Id. at 568, 106 S. Ct. at 1345. When a courtroom security arrangement is challenged\nas inherently prejudicial, the question is whether there is “an unacceptable risk . . . of impermissible\nfactors coming into play.” Id. at 570, 106 S. Ct. at 1346-47.\n\n\n         4\n           The defendant asserts in his brief that, in Shelby County, the defendants are seated in a row of chairs two\nto three feet behind counsel. The backs of these chairs rest against the “bar” which separates the audience seating\narea.\n\n                                                         -17-\n\f              Holbrook involved a challenge to four uniformed officers seated behind six\ndefendants. In finding the defendants were not entitled to relief, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n               We do not minimize the threat that a roomful of uniformed and armed\n               policemen might pose to a defendant’s chances of receiving a fair\n               trial. But we simply cannot find an unacceptable risk of prejudice in\n               the spectacle of four such officers quietly sitting in the first row of a\n               courtroom’s spectator section. Even had the jurors been aware that\n               the deployment of troopers was not common practice in Rhode Island,\n               we cannot believe that the use of the four troopers tended to brand\n               respondent in their eyes with an unmistakable mark of guilt. Four\n               troopers are unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other\n               than a normal official concern for the safety and order of the\n               proceedings.\n\nId. at 571, 106 S. Ct. at 1347 (citations and internal punctuation omitted).\n\n              As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[J]urors are quite aware that the defendant\n appearing before them did not arrive there by choice or happenstance.” Id. at 567, 106 S. Ct. at\n1347. Generally, the trial court, which has presided over the proceedings, is in\n\n                the best position to make determinations regarding how to achieve\n               [the] primary purpose [of ensuring a fair trial], and absent some abuse\n               of the trial court’s discretion in marshalling the trial, an appellate\n               court should not redetermine in retrospect and on a cold record how\n               the case should have been better tried.\n\n State v. Franklin, 714 S.W.2d 252, 258 (Tenn. 1986). It has also been recognized that the use of\nsecurity personnel can be justified as a necessary measure to prevent escape, to protect those present\nin the courtroom, and to maintain order during the trial. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S. Ct.\n1057 (1970); Woodards v. Cardwell, 430 F.2d 978 (6th Cir. 1970); State ex rel. Hall v. Meadows,\n215 Tenn. 668, 389 S.W.2d 256 (1965).\n\n               Recently the United States Supreme Court revisited the propriety of shackling a\ndefendant in a courtroom. See Deck v. Missouri, __ U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 2007 (2005). The nation’s\nhighest court held that\n\n               courts cannot routinely place defendants in shackles or other physical restraints\n               visible to the jury. . . . The constitutional requirement, however, is not absolute. It\n               permits a judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to take account of special\n               circumstances, including security concerns, that may call for shackling.\n\n                Id. at __ , 125 S. Ct. at 2014-15. In this regard, the Supreme Court recognized the\nneed to restrain dangerous defendants to prevent courtroom attacks or the need to give trial courts\n\n                                                 -18-\n\flatitude in making individualized security determinations. Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 2014. The Court\nalso acknowledged the potential for tragedy that can result if judges are not able to protect\nthemselves and their courtrooms. Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 2014-15. The Court advised, however,\nthat such determinations must be case specific; “that is to say, it should reflect particular concerns,\nsay special security needs or escape risks, related to the defendant on trial.” Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at\n2015. Thus, the Court concluded that, “given their prejudicial effect, due process does not permit\nthe use of visible restraints if the trial court has not taken account of the circumstances of the\nparticular case.” Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 2014.\n\n                 Although this standard has not yet been applied to security personnel in the\ncourtroom, we conclude that the holding in Deck v. Missouri is a reasonable rule that should be\napplied to any restraint imposed on a criminal defendant in the courtroom. In the present case, the\ntrial court acknowledged (1) defense counsel’s recitation of threats made to her by the defendant, (2)\nthe 500-year prison sentence awaiting the defendant in Colorado, (3) the need to protect everyone\nin the courtroom, (4) the possible imposition of the death penalty in two cases in Tennessee, and (5)\npast incidents of violence by criminal defendants in this particular courtroom. The trial court then\ndetermined that it was necessary to impose restraints including handcuffs, shackles, and the\nassistance of members of the DRT team. The record supports the trial court’s finding that the\ndefendant posed a substantial security risk for the courtroom and that the circumstances warranted\nthe use of restraints. See United States v. Amaro, 816 F.2d 284, 285 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 481 U.S.\n1031, 107 S. Ct. 1961 (1987). Moreover, the defendant did not establish that the deployment of the\nDRT officers in the courtroom prejudiced his trial. See State v. Taylor, 771 S.W.2d 387, 396 (Tenn.\n1989) (holding that defendant under guard in courtroom was not prejudiced). Accordingly, we\ncannot conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court abused its discretion in\nimposing additional security measures in the courtroom.\n\n                                    V. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n             The defendant alleges that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction of the\npremeditated murder of Toni Banks. In support of this argument, the defendant refers to evidence\nintroduced at trial relating that both he and Toni Banks were consuming alcohol the day and evening\npreceding the murder. He also cites to the fact that the two were quarreling throughout the\nafternoon and evening. The defendant contends that there is no evidence that he threatened Toni\nBanks or declared an intent to harm her. He alleges that there is no proof of plans to conceal the\nmurder prior to its commission. The defendant asserts that the only proof to support a finding of\npremeditation is the fact that Toni Banks was not armed. This proof, he contends, is insufficient\nto support a conviction for first degree premeditated murder.\n\n            When a challenge is made on appeal to the sufficiency of the convicting evidence, this\ncourt is guided by certain well-established principles. First, a jury conviction removes the\npresumption of innocence with which a defendant is cloaked and replaces it with one of guilt, so\nthat on appeal, a convicted defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the evidence is\ninsufficient. State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). In determining the sufficiency\nof the evidence, this court does not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence. State v. Cabbage, 571\n\n                                                 -19-\n\fS.W.2d 832, 835 (Tenn. 1978). Likewise, it is not the duty of this court to revisit questions of\nwitness credibility on appeal, that function being within the province of the trier of fact. See\ngenerally State v. Adkins, 786 S.W.2d 642, 646 (Tenn. 1990); State v. Burlison, 868 S.W.2d 713,\n718-19 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993). Instead, the defendant must establish that the evidence presented\nat trial was so deficient that no reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\nthe offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\n319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2789 (1979); State v. Cazes, 875 S.W.2d 253, 259 (Tenn. 1994), cert. denied,\n513 U.S. 1086, 115 S. Ct. 743 (1995). Moreover, the state is entitled to the strongest legitimate\nview of the evidence and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom. State v. Harris,\n839 S.W.2d 54, 75 (Tenn. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 954, 113 S. Ct. 1368 (1993). In State v.\nMatthews, 805 S.W.2d 776, 779 (Tenn. Crim. App.), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 1990), this court\nheld these rules applicable to findings of guilt predicated upon direct evidence, circumstantial\nevidence, or a combination of both direct and circumstantial evidence.\n\n            The defendant was convicted of premeditated first degree murder. First degree murder\nis “the premeditated and intentional killing of another.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-202(a)(1) (2003).\nTennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-202(d) defines premeditation as:\n\n               an act done after the exercise of reflection and judgment.\n               “Premeditation” means that the intent to kill must have been formed\n               prior to the act itself. It is not necessary that the purpose to kill\n               preexist in the mind of the accused for any definite period of time.\n               The mental state of the accused at the time the accused allegedly\n               decided to kill must be carefully considered in order to determine\n               whether the accused was sufficiently free from excitement and\n               passion as to be capable of premeditation.\n\n               The element of premeditation is a question of fact to be resolved by the jury and may\nbe established by proof of the circumstances surrounding the killing. State v. Suttles, 30 S.W.3d\n252, 260 (Tenn.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 967, 121 S. Ct. 401 (2000). Because the trier of fact cannot\nspeculate as to what was in the killer’s mind, the existence of facts of premeditation must be\ndetermined from the killer’s conduct in light of the surrounding circumstances. Although there is\nno strict standard governing what constitutes proof of premeditation, circumstances from which a\njury may infer premeditation include planning activity by a defendant prior to the killing, the\ndefendant’s prior relationship with the victim, and the manner of the killing. State v. Hall, 958\nS.W.2d 679, 704 (Tenn. 1997); see also State v. Jones, 15 S.W.3d 880, 889 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1999); State v. Schafer, 973 S.W.2d 269, 273 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997); State v. Bordis, 905 S.W.2d\n214, 222 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995); State v. Gentry, 881 S.W.2d 1, 4-5 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\nThus, for example, our supreme court has held that premeditation may be inferred from a\ndefendant’s use of a deadly weapon upon an unarmed victim, the cruelty of the killing, declarations\nby a defendant of an intent to kill, the defendant’s procurement of a weapon, a defendant’s\npreparations prior to a killing for concealment of the crime, and calmness immediately after the\nkilling. State v. Pike, 978 S.W.2d 904, 914 (Tenn. 1998); State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651, 660\n(Tenn. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1083, 118 S. Ct. 1536 (1998).\n\n                                               -20-\n\f                Applying these factors, there are numerous circumstances in this case from which the\njury could conclude that the murder was premeditated: (1) The victim was unarmed; (2) the victim\nand the defendant had been involved in a romantic relationship and were quarreling; (3) the proof\nstrongly indicated that the victim was asleep in her bed as she was dressed only in a tee-shirt and was\nlying prone on a mattress; (4) the gun was fired within six inches from the victim’s forehead,\nassuring her death; and (5) the defendant stated his intentions to get rid of Toni Banks. Viewing the\nevidence and inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the state, this court finds sufficient\nevidence to support the jury’s finding of premeditation.\n\n                      VI. Admission of Prior Bad Acts of the Defendant\n\n               Prior to trial and pursuant to a motion filed by the state, a hearing was held to\ndetermine the admissibility of proof of another murder and theft of property allegedly committed by\nthe defendant. The state’s purpose in seeking admission of this evidence was to present proof as to\nthe defendant’s motive for killing Toni Banks. The state posited that Toni Banks knew too much\nabout these prior crimes and that her murder was necessary to prevent the defendant’s arrest. This\nposition was based upon Joseph Jackson’s testimony that the defendant had told him during a\ntelephone conversation that Toni Banks knew to much and that she had to go.\n\n               During this hearing, the trial court heard proof from Joseph Jackson, the accomplice\nto the alleged murder and theft. The trial court also heard statements by the prosecution that\ncorroborating proof by Panyanouvong’s widow and members of the Banks family would be\npresented linking the property taken from the Panyanouvong home to the defendant. Defense\ncounsel objected to the admission of any and all of this proof. In this regard, defense counsel cited\nto Jackson’s lack of credibility, the highly prejudicial nature of the evidence, and its irrelevance to\nthe Banks murder. Defense counsel also commented that Jackson’s accusation was self-serving in\nnature.\n\n                In making its decision, the trial court noted that the murder of Phimphone\nPanyanouvong would not have been solved but for the information provided by Jackson. The trial\ncourt further acknowledged that decisions regarding credibility of witnesses are left to the jury. With\nthese acknowledgments, the trial court found that there was sufficient credibility to Jackson’s\ntestimony to satisfy the clear and convincing provision of Tennessee Rule of Evidence 404(b). The\ncourt further found that:\n\n               the probative value certainly outweighs any prejudicial effect. The\n               testimony regarding the phone conversation is extremely probative,\n               and short of witnessing the murder himself, I can’t imagine proof that\n               would be much more probative than overhearing or being told\n               statements such as Mr. Jackson says he was told over the phone by\n               this defendant. And so I think clearly the probative value outweighs\n               the prejudicial effect.\n\n\n\n                                                 -21-\n\f               I think that proof of this sort would be highly relevant to establish\n               motive, to establish intent, lack of mistake, identity. And there are\n               several factors that are very relevant, and I think if the jury elects to\n               believe the testimony of Mr. Jackson after they hear that testimony\n               along with all the other proof in the case – several factors that would\n               be put before the jury through Mr. Jackson’s testimony – those four\n               that I mentioned being the four that come to mind.\n\n              The trial court rejected defense counsel’s request to limit the evidence to the burglary\nand theft, concluding that the murder lent credibility to Joe Jackson’s statement.\n\n                During the defendant’s trial, the state presented the testimony of numerous witnesses\nwho referenced the December 27, 2000 murder of Phimphone Panyanouvong and the theft of his\nproperty. Thong Panyanouvong described the events of December 27, 2000, including finding her\nmurdered husband’s body near the front door of their home. Jackson related his “fencing”\nrelationship with the defendant and the events of December 27, 2000, which included the defendant\nadmitting that he had shot a man and that the defendant had taken the man’s car and numerous\npersonal belongings from his house. Bruce Griffey, Jackson’s attorney, testified that Jackson had\ncontacted him from jail, explaining that he had information about some unsolved crimes. Lisa\nMatthews, Jackson’s girlfriend, related that she placed three-way telephone calls for Jackson to the\ndefendant while Jackson was in jail. During these conversations, Matthews overheard Jackson\ntelling the defendant that he was not in jail for what they had done. She also overheard the defendant\ntelling Jackson that “she had to go, and basically that she knew too much.” Various members of\nToni Banks’s family, James Banks, Percy Foster, James Banks, Jr., and Carol Webb, testified that\nthey were in possession of various items that matched the description of those items taken from the\nPanyanouvong home. Various law enforcement officers were called to testify regarding the\nidentification of property taken during the Panyanouvong murder.\n\n               After the testimony of the eighth witness called by the state, the trial court issued a\ncautionary instruction to the jury regarding the other crimes evidence:\n\n               Ladies and gentlemen, the testimony you have heard today regarding\n               the defendant’s alleged commission of crimes other than that for\n               which he is on trial, i.e. relating to the death of Mr. Panyanouvong,\n               may not be considered to prove the defendant’s disposition to commit\n               the type of crime for which he is on trial. This evidence may only be\n               considered by you for the limited purpose of determining whether it\n               proves the defendant’s identity, that is, such evidence may[]be\n               considered by you if it tends to establish the defendant’s identity in\n               the case on trial. Motive, that is, to show – that is, such evidence\n               may[]be considered by you if it tends to show a motive of the\n               defendant for the commission of the offense presently charged, or the\n               defendant’s intent. That is, such evidence may[]be considered by you\n               if it tends to establish that the defendant actually intended to commit\n\n                                                 -22-\n\f               the crime with which he is presently charged. Such evidence of other\n               crimes may not be considered for any purpose other than those\n               specifically stated herein.\n\nThe trial court repeated the instruction at the end of the guilt phase.\n\n               On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting any and all\nevidence involving his alleged murder of Phimphone Panyanouvong and the theft of his property.\nThe defendant complains that the trial court’s ruling created “devastatingly unfair prejudice,” and\nin support thereof, he references the order of the state’s witnesses. Moreover, he asserts that any\nproof regarding the Panyanouvong crimes was irrelevant to the issue whether he had murdered Toni\nBanks. The defendant further complains that prejudicial impact of the other crimes evidence was\ncompounded by the state’s use of the other crimes evidence in its closing argument and that had the\nother crimes evidence been excluded, “a reasonable jury could have returned a verdict of either\nvoluntary manslaughter or second degree murder.”\n\n                 Evidence of a defendant’s prior crimes, wrongs, or acts is not generally admissible\nto prove that he committed the crime in question. Tenn. R. Evid. 404. The rationale underlying the\ngeneral rule is that admission of such evidence carries with it the inherent risk of the jury convicting\nthe defendant of a crime based upon his bad character or propensity to commit a crime, rather than\nthe conviction resting upon the strength of the evidence. State v. Thacker, 164 S.W.3d 208, 239\n(Tenn. 2005). The risk is greater when the defendant’s prior bad acts are similar to the crime for\nwhich the defendant is on trial. Id. at 239; see also State v. McCary, 922 S.W.2d 511, 514 (Tenn.\n1996).\n\n                Notwithstanding the general rule, evidence of a defendant’s prior crimes, wrongs or\nacts may be admissible where it is probative of material issues other than conduct conforming with\na character trait. Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b). Thus, evidence of a defendant’s character may become\nadmissible when it logically tends to prove material issues which fall into one of three categories:\n(1) the use of “motive and common scheme or plan” to establish identity, (2) to establish the\ndefendant’s intent in committing the offense on trial, and (3) to “rebut a claim of mistake or accident\nif asserted as a defense.” Thacker, 164 S.W.3d at 239 (citing McCary, 922 S.W.2d at 514). To\nadmit such evidence, the rule specifies three prerequisites:\n\n               (1) The court upon request must hold a hearing outside the jury’s\n               presence;\n\n               (2) The court must determine that a material issue exists other than\n               conduct conforming with a character trait and must upon request state\n               on the record the material issue, the ruling, and the reasons for\n               admitting the evidence; and\n\n               (3) The court must exclude the evidence if its probative value is\n               outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n                                                 -23-\n\fTenn. R. Evid. 404(b). A fourth prerequisite to admission is that the court must find by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the defendant committed the other crime. Id., Advisory Commission\nCmts.; State v. DuBose, 953 S.W.2d 649, 654 (Tenn. 1997); State v. Parton, 694 S.W.2d 299, 303\n(Tenn. 1985).\n\n              In reviewing a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence, an appellate court\nmay disturb the lower court’s ruling only if there has been an abuse of discretion. Thacker, 164\nS.W.3d at 240. Its determination is entitled to deference when it has substantially complied with the\nprocedural requisites of Rule 404(b). See DuBose, 953 S.W.2d at 652.\n\n                 In the present case, the trial court conducted a jury-out hearing on the other crimes\nevidence; the court determined that a material issue existed other than conforming conduct; the court\nstated its reasons on the record; the trial court determined that the evidence was more probative than\nprejudicial; and the trial court found that the defendant committed the other crimes by clear and\nconvincing evidence. Accordingly, because the trial court substantially complied with the\nrequirements of Rule 404(b), this court will review the trial court’s determination for an abuse of\ndiscretion. Under this standard of review, this court will only reverse the trial court’s ruling if the\nlower court “applied an incorrect legal standard, or reached a decision which is against logic or\nreasoning that caused an injustice to the party complaining.” State v. Robinson, 146 S.W.3d 469,\n490 (Tenn. 2004).\n\n                Evidence of the Panyanouvong murder and burglary was introduced by the state to\nshow motive and premeditation. The trial court properly instructed the jury that the evidence could\nbe considered for the limited purpose of determining whether it tends to show motive. Evidence\nproving motive necessarily serves the purpose of completing the story of the crime. See State v.\nLeach, 148 S.W.3d 42, 58 (Tenn. 2004). Motive is a relevant circumstantial fact that refers to why\na defendant did what he did. The motive and intent of the defendant in the commission of a murder\nare almost always critical issues. State v. Gentry, 881 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\nEvidence of motive is often pertinent as the basis to infer that the act was committed, to prove\nrequisite mental state, or to prove the identity of the actor. See 22 C. Wright & K. Graham, Jr.,\nFederal Practice and Procedure Evidence § 479 (1978). Indeed, the defendant’s possession of a\nmotive strengthens the inference that the death of the victim was caused by an intentional act rather\nthan by accident. Finally, in making a risk versus benefit analysis in this case, we cannot conclude\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence\noutweighed its prejudicial impact. Accordingly, the admission of the evidence was not error.\n\n\n                             VII. Instruction as to (i)(2) Aggravator\n\n\n               Prior to the commencement of the penalty phase, the state asserted that it would use\nthe defendant’s prior convictions of murder in the first degree, reckless endangerment, first degree\nkidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery, crime of violence with a deadly weapon,\nand menacing to establish the existence of the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance. The trial court then\n\n                                                 -24-\n\fconducted a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the defendant’s prior\nconvictions involved the use of violence to the person. See State v. Sims, 45 S.W.3d 1, 11-12 (Tenn.\n2001). Finding that the offenses involved the use of violence, the trial court allowed the state to\nintroduce evidence of the prior convictions. See State v. Powers, 101 S.W.3d 383, 400-01 (Tenn.\n2003). At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n\n               One, that the defendant was previously convicted of one or more\n               felonies other than the present charge, the statutory elements of which\n               involve the use of violence to the person. The state is relying upon\n               the crimes of murder in the first degree, reckless endangerment, first\n               degree kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery,\n               crime of violence deadly weapon, and menacing which are felonies\n               involving the use of violence to the person. Proof of additional\n               convictions may[]be considered by you only as they relate to the\n               credibility of witnesses. Two, the murder was committed for the\n               purpose of avoiding, interfering with or preventing a lawful arrest or\n               prosecution of the defendant or another.\n\n\n               The defendant now contends that the question whether prior offenses involved the\nuse of violence was a question for the jury to resolve beyond a reasonable doubt. Essentially, the\ndefendant complains that the procedure set forth in Sims in which the trial court considers the\nunderlying facts of the prior offenses to determine whether the elements of the offenses involved the\nuse of violence to the person violates the dictates of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.\nCt. 2348 (2000), and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002).\n\n\n                Our supreme court recently rejected this same argument in State v. Cole, 155 S.W.3d\n885, 900 (Tenn. 2005). In doing so, our high court acknowledged that “Apprendi and its progeny\npreclude judges from finding ‘additional facts,’ that increase a defendant’s sentence beyond the\n‘statutory maximum,’ which is defined as the maximum sentence a judge may impose ‘solely on the\nbasis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.’” Cole, 155 S.W.3d at\n903 (quoting Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, __, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 2537 (2004)). The court\ndifferentiated the principles of Apprendi from the Sims procedure and concluded that “[t]he Sims\nprocedure involves a legal determination, and as such this procedure does not transgress the dictates\nof Apprendi and its progeny.” Id. at 904.\n\n\n               The supreme court explained,\n\n               The (i)(2) aggravating circumstance requires only that the statutory\n               elements of the prior felony involve the use of violence to the person.\n               The Sims procedure authorizes trial judges merely to examine the\n\n\n                                                -25-\n\f               facts, record, and evidence underlying the prior conviction to\n               ascertain which “statutory elements” served as the basis of the prior\n               felony conviction. This is a legal determination that neither requires\n               nor allows trial judges to make factual findings as to whether the prior\n               conviction involved violence. This legal determination is analogous\n               to the preliminary questions trial judges often are called upon to\n               decide when determining the admissibility of evidence.\n\n\nId. The supreme court further noted that “by making this legal determination, the trial court neither\ninflicts punishment nor usurps or infringes upon the jury’s role as fact-finder.” Id. The court\nobserved that\n\n\n               [o]nce the trial court determines as a matter of law that the statutory\n               elements of the prior convictions involve the use of violence, the jury\n               must then determine as matters of fact whether the prosecution has\n               proven the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt\n               and whether aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating\n               circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nId. Accordingly, the trial court’s procedure in the present case passes constitutional muster.\n\n\n                      VIII. Indictment Failed to Charge Capital Offense\n\n\n                The defendant asserts that “[a]ny fact that increases the maximum penalty for a crime\nmust be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order\nto satisfy the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment’s notice and jury\ntrial guarantees.” In this regard, the defendant contends that the indictment against him failed to\n“include the facts that would qualify the [defendant] for the death penalty.” The defendant’s\nargument is based upon the premise that first degree murder is not a capital offense unless\naccompanied by aggravating factors. Essentially, the defendant complains that the indictment\nreturned by the grand jury charges non-capital, first degree murder because the grand jury did not\nfind any capital aggravating circumstances. Thus, the defendant alleges that to satisfy the\nrequirements of Apprendi v. New Jersey, the indictment must include language of the statutory\naggravating circumstance(s) to elevate the offense to capital murder.\n\n\n               The defendant’s argument has been rejected on numerous occasions by our supreme\ncourt. See State v. Reid, 164 S.W.3d 286, 311-12 (Tenn. 2005); State v. Robinson, 146 S.W.3d 469,\n499 (Tenn. 2004); State v. Berry, 141 S.W.3d 549, 558 (Tenn. 2004); Holton, 126 S.W.3d at 845;\nsee also State v. Stephen Lynn Hugueley, No. W2004-00057-CCA-R3-CD, slip op. at 15 (Tenn.\n\n\n                                                -26-\n\fCrim. App., Jackson, Mar. 17, 2005), perm. app. granted (Tenn. Aug. 22, 2005). In Holton, our high\ncourt explained that “Apprendi applies only to enhancement factors used to impose a sentence above\nthe statutory maximum” and that “the death penalty is within the statutory range of punishment\nprescribed for first degree murder by the Tennessee General Assembly.” Holton, 126 S.W.3d at 863\n(citing State v. Dellinger, 79 S.W.3d 458, 466-67 (Tenn. 2002)); see also State v. Odom, 137\nS.W.3d 572 (Tenn. 2004). The court further emphasized that “Tennessee’s capital sentencing\nprocedures require that a jury, not a judge, make the findings regarding the presence of aggravating\ncircumstances and that the findings must be made beyond a reasonable doubt.” Odom, 137 S.W.3d\nat 590-91 (citing Holton, 126 S.W.3d at 864); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-204(f)(1) (2003).\nTennessee’s capital sentencing scheme does not require that aggravating circumstances be included\nin an indictment. See State v. Reid, 164 S.W.3d at 312. The defendant is not entitled to relief on\nthis issue.\n\n                  IX. Constitutionality of Tennessee Death Penalty Scheme\n\n\n                The defendant raises numerous challenges to the constitutionality of Tennessee’s\ndeath penalty provisions. Included within his challenge that the Tennessee death penalty statutes\nviolate the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and\nArticle I, Sections 8, 9, 16, and 17, and Article II, Section 2 of the Tennessee Constitution are the\nfollowing:\n\n\n               1. The defendant first asserts that Tennessee’s death penalty statutes\n               fail to meaningfully narrow the class of death eligible defendants,\n               thereby rendering Tennessee death penalty statutory scheme\n               unconstitutional.      Specifically, he argues that the statutory\n               aggravating circumstances set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated\n               section 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), (6), and (7) have been so broadly\n               interpreted, whether viewed singly or collectively, that they fail to\n               provide such a “meaningful basis” for narrowing the population of\n               those convicted of first degree murder to those eligible for the\n               sentence of death. We note that factors, (i)(5), (i)(6) and (i)(7), do not\n               pertain to this case as none of these factors were relied upon by the\n               state nor found by the jury. Thus, any individual claim with respect\n               to these factors is without merit. See, e.g., State v. Hall, 958 S.W.2d\n               679, 715 (Tenn. 1997), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 941, 118 S. Ct. 2358\n               (1998); State v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 87 (Tenn.), cert. denied,\n               513 U.S. 1020, 115 S. Ct. 585 (1994). Moreover, the defendant’s\n               argument has been rejected by our supreme court on numerous\n               occasions. See State v. Vann, 976 S.W.2d 93, 117-18 (Tenn. 1998)\n               (Appendix); State v. Keen, 926 S.W.2d 727, 742 (Tenn. 1994), cert.\n               denied, 532 U.S. 907, 121 S. Ct. 1233 (2001).\n\n\n                                                 -27-\n\f2. The defendant next argues that imposition of the death penalty in\nthis state is unconstitutional because the death sentence is imposed\ncapriciously and arbitrarily in that:\n\n\n(a) Unlimited discretion is vested in the prosecutor as to whether or\nnot to seek the death penalty. This argument has been rejected. See\nState v. Hines, 919 S.W.2d 573, 582 (Tenn. 1995), cert. denied, 519\nU.S. 847, 117 S. Ct. 133 (1996).\n\n\n(b) The death penalty is imposed in a discriminatory manner based\nupon race, geography, and gender. This argument has been rejected.\nSee Hines, 919 S.W.2d at 582; Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d at 87; Cazes,\n875 S.W.2d at 268; State v. Smith, 857 S.W.2d 1, 23 (Tenn.), cert.\ndenied, 510 U.S. 996, 114 S. Ct. 561 (1993).\n\n\n(c) Requiring the jury to agree unanimously to a life verdict violates\nMills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S. Ct. 1860 (1988), and McKoy\nv. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227 (1990). This\nargument has been rejected. See Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d at 87; State\nv. Thompson, 768 S.W.2d 239, 250 (Tenn. 1989); State v. King, 718\nS.W.2d 241, 249 (Tenn. 1986), superseded by statute as recognized\nby State v. Hutchinson, 898 S.W.2d 161 (Tenn. 1994).\n\n\n(d) There is a reasonable likelihood that jurors believe they must\nunanimously agree as to the existence of mitigating circumstances\nbecause of the failure to instruct the jury on the meaning and function\nof mitigating circumstances. This argument has been rejected. See\nThompson, 768 S.W.2d at 251-52.\n\n\n3. Finally, the defendant asserts that the appellate review process in\ndeath penalty cases is constitutionally inadequate. Our supreme court\nhas rejected this argument, as well. See Cazes, 875 S.W.2d at\n270-71; Harris, 839 S.W.2d at 77. Moreover, the supreme court has\nheld that, “while important as an additional safeguard against\narbitrary or capricious sentencing, comparative proportionality review\nis not constitutionally required.” See State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651,\n663 (Tenn. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1083, 118 S. Ct. 1536\n(1998).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f                    X. Review Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-206(c)\n\n                This court is required by Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-206(c)(1)(D) and\nunder the mandates of Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 661-74, to consider whether the defendant’s sentence\nof death is disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. See State v. Godsey, 60 S.W.3d\n759, 781-82 (Tenn. 2001). The comparative proportionality review is designed to identify aberrant,\narbitrary, or capricious sentencing by determining whether the death penalty in a given case is\n“disproportionate to the punishment imposed on others convicted of the same crime.” State v. Stout,\n46 S.W.3d 689, 706 (Tenn. 2001) (citing Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 662 (quoting Pulley v. Harris, 465\nU.S. 37, 42-43, 104 S. Ct. 871, 875 (1984)). If a case is “plainly lacking in circumstances consistent\nwith those in cases where the death penalty has been imposed,” then the sentence is disproportionate.\n Stout, 46 S.W.3d at 706 (citations omitted).\n\n                In conducting our proportionality review, this court must compare the present case\nwith cases involving similar defendants and similar crimes. See id., 46 S.W.3d at 706 (citation\nomitted); see also Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 163 (citations omitted). We select only from those cases in\nwhich a capital sentencing hearing was actually conducted to determine whether the sentence should\nbe life imprisonment, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or death. See State v.\nCarruthers, 35 S.W.3d 516, 570 (Tenn. 2000), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 953, 121 S. Ct. 2600 (2001)\n(citations omitted); see also Godsey, 60 S.W.3d at 783.\n\n\n                 We begin with the presumption that the sentence of death is proportionate with the\ncrime of first degree murder. See Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 163 (citing State v. Hall, 958 S.W.2d 679, 799\n(Tenn. 1997)). This presumption applies only if the sentencing procedures focus discretion on the\n“‘particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual\ndefendant.’” Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 163 (citing McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 308, 107 S. Ct.\n1756, 1775 (1987) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 206, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2940-41 (1976)).\n\n                 Applying this approach, in comparing this case to other cases in which the defendants\nwere convicted of the same or similar crimes, this court looks at the facts and circumstances of the\ncrime, the characteristics of the defendant, and the aggravating and mitigating factors involved. See\nTerry, 46 S.W.3d at 164. Regarding the circumstances of the crime itself, numerous factors are\nconsidered including: (1) the means of death, (2) the manner of death, (3) the motivation for the\nkilling, (4) the place of death, (5) the victim’s age, physical condition, and psychological condition,\n(6) the absence or presence of provocation, (7) the absence or presence of premeditation, (8) the\nabsence or presence of justification, and (9) the injury to and effect on non-decedent victims. Stout,\n46 S.W.3d at 706 (citing Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 667); see also Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164.\nContemplated within the review are numerous factors regarding the defendant, including: (1) prior\ncriminal record, (2) age, race, and gender, (3) mental, emotional, and physical condition, (4) role in\nthe murder, (5) cooperation with authorities, (6) level of remorse, (7) knowledge of the victim’s\n\n\n\n                                                 -29-\n\fhelplessness, and (8) potential for rehabilitation. Stout, 46 S.W.3d at 706; Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164.\n\n                In completing our review, we remain cognizant of the fact that “no two cases involve\nidentical circumstances.” See generally Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164. Thus, our function is not to limit\nour comparison to those cases where a death sentence “is perfectly symmetrical,” but rather, our\nobjective is only to “identify and to invalidate the aberrant death sentence.” Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164\n(citing Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 665).\n\n\n                The circumstances surrounding the murder in light of the relevant and comparative\nfactors reveal that the defendant and Toni Banks had been involved in a romantic relationship and\nshared an apartment together in a Shelby County apartment complex. Toni Banks apparently was the\nbreadwinner in the household, and the defendant was unemployed. During the day preceding her\nmurder, Toni Banks went to work, returned home, and began doing laundry at the nearby apartment\nof her brother. During this time, the defendant was observed drinking in the common area of the\napartment complex. Toni Banks also drank alcohol that evening. Sometime that evening, Toni\nBanks’s children overheard their mother and the defendant arguing. The children also heard objects\nbeing thrown. At some point, the defendant left the apartment and asked another resident to take him\nto the liquor store. During this trip, the defendant remarked that he and Toni Banks were having\nproblems. When they returned to the apartment complex, the defendant commented that he was\ngoing to “straighten things up” with Toni Banks. Thirty to 45 minutes later, the defendant emerged\nfrom the apartment and obtained a ride to Crump Street. The defendant remarked that he had done\nsomething and was going to leave town.\n\n\n                The following morning, the body of Toni Banks was discovered in her bedroom with\na single gunshot to her head. The autopsy revealed that the gun was fired less than six inches from\nthe victim’s head. The victim was only partially dressed. The medical examiner explained that the\npresence of unburned flakes of gunpowder on the inside of the victim’s right arm indicated that the\nvictim’s arm was above her head at the time the gun was fired, supporting the theory that the victim\nwas asleep at the time of the shooting or that the victim was trying to defend herself. The apartment\nhad been locked from the outside and only Toni Banks and the defendant had the keys. The\ndefendant made his way to the State of Colorado, where he proceeded to commit additional crimes.\nIt was only at the time of his arrest in Colorado that Shelby County authorities learned of his\nlocation.\n\n\n               The defendant was previously convicted of reckless endangerment in Shelby County.\nThis conviction arose from the shooting of a Memphis store owner. The defendant also has\nnumerous felony convictions in Colorado. In September 2002, the defendant entered guilty pleas\nto two counts of first degree murder, two counts of committing a violent crime with a deadly\nweapon, and three counts of aggravated robbery. In November 2002, the defendant entered guilty\npleas to one count of first degree kidnapping, two counts of second degree kidnapping, one count\n\n\n                                                -30-\n\fof aggravated robbery, and one count of menacing with a deadly weapon. Thus, the evidence\nsupporting the application of the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance is overwhelming.\n\n\n              The defendant was 33 years old at the time of the offense. The family of the\ndefendant described him as a decent person, despite his extensive history of criminal convictions.\nThe defendant has three children (ages 12, 17, and 19). The defendant’s sister testified that their\nmother would be greatly affected should the defendant receive the death penalty.\n\n\n              While no two capital cases and no two capital defendants are alike, we have reviewed\nthe circumstances of the present case with similar first degree murder cases and conclude that the\npenalty imposed in the present case is not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\n\n                The sentence of death has been upheld in numerous cases in which the victim was\nthe defendant’s wife or girlfriend. See, e.g., State v. Faulkner, 154 S.W.3d 48 (Tenn. 2005)\n(defendant struck wife in head with iron skillet; (i)(2) aggravating circumstance); State v. Suttles,\n30 S.W.3d 252 (Tenn. 2000) (defendant stabbed girlfriend in Taco Bell parking lot; (i)(2) and (i)(5)\naggravating circumstances); State v. Keough, 18 S.W.3d 175 (Tenn. 2000) (defendant stabbed wife\nafter argument in bar and left her to bleed to death in car; (i)(2) aggravator); State v. Hall, 8 S.W.3d\n593 (Tenn. 1999) (after arguing with wife, defendant beat, strangled, and drowned her; (i)(5)\naggravator); State v. Hall, 958 S.W.2d 679 (Tenn. 1997) (angry that girlfriend was going to leave\nhim, defendant set fire to her car while she was inside; (i)(5) and (i)(7) (felony murder) aggravators);\nState v. Smith, 868 S.W.2d 561 (Tenn. 1993) (defendant stabbed, shot, and disemboweled wife;\n(i)(5) and (i)(12) (mass murder) aggravators); State v. Johnson, 743 S.W.2d 154 (Tenn. 1987)\n(defendant suffocated wife with plastic bag; (i)(2) and (i)(5) aggravators); State v. Miller, 674\nS.W.2d 279 (Tenn. 1984), on remand, 771 S.W.2d 401 (Tenn. 1989) (defendant beat girlfriend to\ndeath with fists and fire poker and then stabbed her numerous times; death penalty upheld under\n(i)(5) aggravating circumstance).\n\n\n                The defendant has prior convictions for first degree murder, aggravated robbery,\nreckless endangerment, kidnapping, crimes committed with a deadly weapon, and other violent\ncrimes. The death sentence has been upheld based on the sole aggravating circumstance of a prior\nviolent felony conviction. See, e.g., McKinney, 74 S.W.3d at 291 (prior conviction for aggravated\nrobbery as adult and aggravated assault as juvenile); State v. Chalmers, 28 S.W.3d 913 (Tenn. 2000)\n(prior convictions for attempted especially aggravated robbery and attempted first degree murder);\nState v. Keough, 18 S.W.3d 175, 183 (Tenn. 2000) (prior convictions for assault to commit voluntary\nmanslaughter and manslaughter); State v. Smith, 993 S.W.2d 6 (Tenn. 1999) (prior convictions for\nrobbery and first degree murder); State v. Boyd, 959 S.W.2d 557 (Tenn. 1998); Adkins, 725 S.W.2d\nat 660 (prior conviction for aggravated assault). The prior violent felony factor is an aggravating\ncircumstance that the courts of this state have described as “more qualitatively persuasive and\nobjectively reliable than others.” McKinney, 74 S.W.3d at 313; State v. Howell, 868 S.W.2d 238,\n261 (Tenn. 1993).\n\n                                                 -31-\n\f                 Our review of these cases reveals that the sentence of death imposed upon the\ndefendant is proportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. In so concluding, we have\nconsidered the entire record and reach the decision that the sentence of death was not imposed\narbitrarily, that the evidence supports the finding of the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance, that the\nevidence supports the jury’s finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighs any mitigating\ncircumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the sentence is not excessive or disproportionate.\n\n\n                                          X. Conclusion\n\n\n                 Having fully reviewed the record and the applicable authorities, we affirm the\ndefendant’s conviction of first degree murder. Additionally, in accordance with the mandate of\nTennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-206(c)(1) and the principles adopted in prior decisions of\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court, we have considered the entire record in this cause and find that the\nsentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion and that the evidence supports, as\npreviously discussed, the jury’s finding of the statutory aggravating circumstances and the jury’s\nfinding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-206(c)(1)(A)-(C) (2003). A comparative proportionality review,\nconsidering both “the nature of the crime and the defendant,” convinces us that the sentence of death\nis neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Accordingly, we\naffirm the sentence of death imposed by the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                       ___________________________________\n                                                       JAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                -32-\n\f",

ROBERT HOOD\n\n                  Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                         No. 01-05939-40    Joseph B. Dailey, Judge\n\n\n\n                 No. W2004-01678-CCA-R3-DD - Filed September 13, 2005\n\n\nCapital Defendant, Robert Hood, appeals as of right his conviction of first degree murder and\nsentence of death resulting from the 2001 murder of Toni Banks. A Shelby County grand jury\ncharged the defendant by indictment with one count of felony murder, one count of premeditated\nmurder, two counts of misdemeanor theft of property, and two counts of especially aggravated\nkidnapping. On May 6, 2004, a Shelby County jury found the defendant guilty of both counts of\nhomicide and guilty as to both counts of misdemeanor theft. The jury acquitted the defendant on\nboth counts of aggravated kidnapping. After a separate sentencing hearing, the jury unanimously\nfound the presence of one statutory aggravating circumstance, that the defendant had previously been\nconvicted of a violent felony offense. The jury further determined that this aggravating circumstance\noutweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and imposed a sentence of\ndeath. The trial court approved the sentencing verdict. The defendant appeals presenting for our\nreview the following issues: (1) whether the trial court erred by denying the defendant’s request to\nproceed pro se, (2) whether the trial court erred by refusing to permit defense counsel to withdraw,\n(3) whether the presence of uniformed detention response team members sitting on either side of the\ndefendant throughout trial was prejudicial error, (4) whether the evidence is sufficient to support a\nverdict of premeditated murder, (5) whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence involving\nprior bad acts of the defendant, (6) whether the trial court’s instruction that the defendant’s prior\noffenses were offenses whose statutory elements involved the use of violence violated the United\nStates Constitution, (7) whether the death penalty imposed in this case violated due process because\nthe indictment failed to allege the aggravators relied upon by the state, and (8) whether Tennessee’s\ndeath penalty scheme is unconstitutional. Finding no error requiring reversal, we affirm the\ndefendant’s conviction and sentence of death.\n\n    Tenn. R.

Mr. Panyanouvong’s wife, Thong, and his\ndaughter, Phymonie, left the home to go to the grocery store. At the time, Mr. Panyanouvong was\nreading a book.\n\n                At approximately the same time, Joseph Jackson went to “the shop” to show his car\nto the man who had recently painted it. While Jackson was at the shop, he received a call on his\ncellular phone from the defendant. The defendant had two children with Jackson’s sister, and the\ntwo men had business dealings together. The defendant asked Jackson to come pick him up and\nprovided directions to a house near Camelot. The defendant advised Jackson that he would be in the\ndoorway of the house. In the past, the defendant and Jackson had dealt with one another involving\nstolen property, and Jackson assumed that this call pertained to stolen property also. Jackson arrived\nat the location, parked his car, and went into the house. Jackson observed a “man laying [sic] on\nthe floor gagging from blood coming out of his mouth.” The defendant told Jackson that “he had\nto shoot him.” Neither man did anything to assist the man lying on the floor.\n\n                 While Jackson stood in shock, the defendant went through the residence gathering\nitems. The defendant then proceeded to load his “loot” into a car sitting in the garage. Jackson\nobserved “a bottle of whiskey, a [television] and a duffle bag.” Jackson then observed the defendant\ndrive off in the victim’s car. Jackson followed in his vehicle. The defendant proceeded to a location\noff of Tchulahoma. He parked behind a building and waited for Jackson. The men then “loaded the\nstuff out [of] the victim’s car into [Jackson’s] car.” The men then drove both vehicles to a side street\noff Winchester and parked the victim’s car in front of a club. The defendant then joined Jackson in\nhis vehicle, and Jackson drove the defendant to his apartment.\n\n                Thong and Phymonie Panuanouvong returned to their home a couple of hours later\nand noticed that the car was missing from the garage. At first, Thong thought her husband had gone\nto buy cigarettes. However, upon entering the house, she saw her husband “lay down in the front\ndoor.” Thong called several family members and then called “911.” Phymonie, Mr.\nPanyanouvong’s daughter, noticed that her father was bleeding. Upon this discovery, Thong called\nthe police. Before the police arrived, Thong walked through her house and observed that “[t]he\nhouse – the mess.” Thong’s and her husband’s jewelry and a television were missing. Thong also\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fnoticed that a clock, her fur coat, Mr. Panyanouvong’s wallet, and a camcorder were missing.\n\n             At his apartment on Dunnavant Street that he shared with his girlfriend, the defendant\nunloaded the items from Jackson’s car. Jackson noticed a duffle bag, a television, and a fur coat.\nJackson never got out of his car, and when the defendant was finished unloading the car, Jackson\nleft. The defendant paid Jackson not “even quite a hundred dollars” cash and gave him a camcorder.\nA few days later, the defendant also gave Jackson a credit card. Jackson purchased gas with the\ncredit card.\n\n                Jackson was arrested on unrelated charges on January 8, 2001. While in jail, Jackson\nhad his fiancé, Lisa Matthews, complete a three-way telephone call to the defendant on at least two\noccasions. During the telephone call, Jackson informed the defendant that he was not in jail because\nof the December 27 incident and that he would not inform the police about the December 27\nincident. During these conversations, the defendant made a comment that his girlfriend, Toni Banks,\nknew too much and that “she got to go.” The comment was prompted because Jackson heard yelling\nand screaming between the defendant and Banks. Jackson asked, “[W]hat’s going on?” In response,\nthe defendant kept saying “this girl,” and then he made the comment that “she got to go.”\n\n               The defendant lived with Toni Banks and her two children, James and Demarius, in\nan apartment on Dunnavant Street. The four had moved into the apartment around October or\nNovember of 2000. James was in the third grade, and Demarius was in the second grade. Percy\nFoster, Toni Banks’s brother, lived in the apartment upstairs with his wife and three daughters.\nJames Banks, another brother, also lived in the same apartment complex with his girlfriend and three\nchildren. It was well known that the defendant kept a gun tucked inside his waistband. Percy Foster\nhad observed the defendant shooting a gun into the wooded area behind the apartment complex and\nhad informed his mother that the defendant had a small caliber weapon in the apartment with Toni\nand her children.\n\n                On February 6, 2001, Toni Banks washed clothes at James’s apartment after she\nreturned from her job at Super Value. The defendant helped Toni bring over their dirty laundry to\nJames’s apartment. James noticed that the defendant had been drinking. That day, Toni had her\nrent money, $255 in cash, on her person. She also had additional cash, and she lent her brother Percy\n$20 at approximately 6:30 p.m. In addition, she gave her brother James money to buy liquor so\nJames could make her daiquiris in his blender. Toni washed about ten loads of laundry at James’s\napartment. James later went to Toni’s apartment to tell her that she had left some of her laundry at\nhis apartment. Toni and the defendant then had words about the laundry because the defendant\nrefused to go get the laundry. James commented that the defendant was living free on her paycheck\nand that he could not even assist her with the laundry. Toni told James not to worry about it and\ngave him money to go buy a beer. She added that she was going to get rid of the defendant and that\nhe was going to have to leave her house.\n\n             The defendant and Donald Armstrong went to the liquor store at about 8:45 p.m. and\nbought a half pint of E & J Brandy. Armstrong noticed that, although the defendant did not act\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fdrunk, he did look as if he had been drinking. During their trip to the liquor store, the defendant\nrelated that he and his girlfriend had been having problems. When they got back to the apartment\ncomplex, the defendant remarked that he was “going to holler at his girlfriend and talk to her . . .\n[t]ry to . . . straighten things up with her.” Forty-five minutes later, Armstrong saw the defendant\nagain, and the defendant asked Armstrong to drive him somewhere. The defendant gave Armstrong\nfive dollars for driving him to Crump Street. During the drive, the defendant told Armstrong that\nhe had done something and that he was “fixing to leave town.” Armstrong noticed that the\ndefendant appeared “a little shook up and nervous.” Armstrong dropped the defendant off on Crump\nStreet across from the Martel Projects. As he was leaving, Armstrong observed the defendant run\nacross the street to the projects.\n\n                Both Percy Foster and James Banks had seen the defendant standing in the driveway\ndrinking with their younger brother, Leslie. James went out and had a “couple of drinks with\nLeslie.” The defendant later came to Foster’s apartment, which surprised Foster because the two\nmen did not get along. The defendant was returning three knives that Toni had borrowed from her\nbrother. The defendant told Foster that “he didn’t want any confusion down at the house that night.\nAnd he was taking – for me not to bring anything sharp back down to the house. And if anything\ngo on downstairs – you know, he knew that I could hear through the heater – that if I heard anything\ngoing on for me to please come down there. He would open the door for me. . . . He promised\nme that.” Neither Percy Foster nor his wife could make any sense of the defendant’s comments.\nFoster saw the defendant again at 8:30 p.m. when a friend alerted him that the defendant and Foster’s\nbrother, Leslie, were urinating on the garbage cans.\n\n                That evening, Toni prepared dinner for her children. The children observed Toni\nfighting with the defendant. During the fight, the defendant and Toni threw items at each other, and\nthe kitchen table was knocked over. James later went upstairs to his uncle’s apartment and\ntelephoned his grandmother, telling her that he wanted to go to her house. He then returned to his\nown apartment. Eventually, Toni told her children to go their bedroom, and the couple continued\narguing.\n\n              On February 7, 2001, James woke up late for school. He woke his brother, and the two\nwent to find their mother. The two boys thought she was in her bedroom, but she did not respond\nto their calling her. Her bedroom door was locked, so James “got a knife and opened the door.”\nUpon opening the door, James saw a form on the bed covered with bedclothes. Frightened by their\nfinding, the boys attempted to leave the apartment. The defendant was not in the apartment.\n\n             The boys discovered that they were locked inside the apartment and only their mother\nand the defendant had keys to unlock the door. James then took a broom and knocked on the ceiling\nto signal their cousin, who lived upstairs, to come down. Shortly thereafter, a cousin, Lashelle\nFoster, came downstairs. However, she was unable to gain access to the locked apartment. Lashelle\ninstructed the children to take the covers off of the body in their mother’s bedroom. The boys did\nas instructed and discovered their mother beneath the covers. They were unsuccessful in their\nattempt to awaken her. The boys noticed that their mother was not breathing and that there was\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fblood on her head. Lashelle informed her father, who was upstairs in his apartment, that Toni had\nbeen shot. Percy Foster then called 911. The police and an ambulance arrived. The police, assisted\nby Percy Foster and his friends, broke the lock on the front door to gain access to the apartment.\n\n            Lashelle Foster took the children upstairs to Percy’s apartment while Percy Foster\nproceeded to the victim’s bedroom. Percy observed his sister “laying [sic] there with a bullet hole\nin her head, blood against the wall, partly covered body.” The house was ransacked, which was\nunusual because Toni “kept a very neat house.” No money was found in the apartment.\n\n             Memphis Police Officer Cham Payne responded to the call at the Dunnavant Street\napartment. He arrived after the uniformed officers had secured the scene. At this time, the only\nsuspect was the defendant. No weapon, keys, or money was found at the scene. The only place\nwhere blood was found was the east wall of the bedroom near the victim’s head. The victim was\ndressed only in a purple T-shirt. A pair of children’s scissors was found beneath some clothes on\nthe mattress. A bullet was later recovered from the victim’s body. Lieutenant Venus Owens, also\nat the crime scene, observed that the victim’s body was “crammed against the wall, appeared to have\nbeen pushed like into a corner, and her head was jammed against the wall.”\n\n                Memphis police officers attempted to locate the defendant. They were later advised\nby the defendant’s family members that he was no longer in Memphis and that they did not know\nwhere he was. Notwithstanding, during the May 2001 term, the Shelby County grand jury indicted\nthe defendant on one count of felony murder resulting in the death of Toni Banks, one count of\npremeditated first degree murder resulting in the death of the victim, two counts of especially\naggravated kidnapping, one count of theft of property by obtaining the victim’s property, and one\ncount of theft of property by exercising control over the victim’s property. In June 2001, Memphis\npolice officers learned that the defendant was in custody in Colorado. In February 2003, Captain\nRonald Goodwin, a member of the District Attorney’s Anti- Gang Team, accompanied by his partner\nRonny Wilkerson, drove to Colorado and took the defendant into custody.\n\n                Heath Barker, a special agent forensic scientist with the Tennessee Bureau of\nInvestigation, examined the bullet and lead fragments from both the Panyanouvong murder and Toni\nBanks’s murder. Special Agent Barker examined the specimens in an attempt to determine whether\nboth bullets were fired from the same weapon but could not reach a conclusion because the bullets\nand fragments were too mutilated for testing. However, Special Agent Barker was able to conclude\nthat both bullets were fired from a .22 caliber weapon. The sound emanating from the firing of a\n.22 caliber weapon is not as loud as that from a larger caliber weapon.\n\n               Doctor Cynthia Gardner, a Deputy Medical Examiner for Shelby County, 1 performed\nthe autopsies on the bodies of Toni Banks and Mr. Panyanouvong. Regarding the autopsy of Toni\nBanks, Dr. Gardner found that the toxicology testing indicated the presence of both caffeine and\nalcohol in the victim’s blood. The victim’s blood alcohol level was .23 grams per decimeter. A\nphysical examination of the victim’s body revealed the presence of a near contact gunshot wound\n\n   1\n       At the time of trial, D r. Gardner was em ployed as a deputy coro ner in H amilton Co unty, Ohio.\n\n                                                           -5-\n\fabove the right eye on the right forehead. In support of the conclusion that the gunshot was near\ncontact, Dr. Gardner found gunpowder stippling as well as unburned flakes of gunpowder and soot.\nThis fine residue is only visible when the gun is fired from six inches or less from the victim’s body,\nsupporting the conclusion that the weapon was fired within six inches from the head. Doctor\nGardner also found unburned flakes of gunpowder on the inside of the victim’s right arm. The\npresence of the flakes on the victim’s arm in relation to the gunshot wound are consistent with a\ndefensive type maneuver and are also consistent with the “way one’s arm might be laying if they\nwere . . . asleep.” Doctor Gardner removed a bullet from the victim’s brain.\n\n                Doctor Gardner also observed the blood patterns. From the pattern of the blood\nemanating from the wound, Dr. Gardner was able to determine that the pattern was consistent with\nthe victim lying down at the time the wound was inflicted. Doctor Gardner concluded that the\nvictim’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to her head. She further concluded that the gun was\nfired within six inches from her head.\n\n                Following the proof, the trial court instructed the jury as to the applicable law. The\njury began deliberations at 8:00 p.m. The trial court ended deliberations at 9:30 p.m. and resumed\ndeliberations the next day at 8:45 a.m. The jury returned their verdict at 10:20 a.m. The jury found\nthe defendant guilty of first degree felony murder, first degree premeditated murder, and theft of\nproperty. However, the jury acquitted the defendant of both counts of especially aggravated\nkidnapping.\n\n                                      Penalty Phase Evidence\n\n               At the penalty phase, the state introduced the testimony of Barbara Banks, the\nvictim’s mother. Ms. Banks testified that she had seven children. She stated that since her\ndaughter’s murder she has custody of Toni’s children, 12-year-old James, 10-year-old Demarius, and\n16-year-old Lisa. Ms. Banks explained that the children lived with her and her husband, along with\nBarbara Banks’s daughter, whose name is also Lisa, and her baby. She testified that neither she nor\nher husband works and that they survive on social security alone. She added that she is 64 years old\nand her husband is 76 years old. Her daughter Lisa works, and James, Demarius, and Lisa each\nreceive $124.00 a month in social security death benefits.\n\n                Barbara Banks testified that she takes medication for nerves, high blood pressure, and\nher heart. She explained that she began taking the medication soon after her daughter’s murder.\nShe stated that it is a burden to “start all over raising small kids.”\n\n                Ms. Banks further testified that, at the time of the murder, the victim was thirty-five\nyears old. Toni was working, going to church, and was generally doing well at the time of her death.\nSince her murder, the victim’s children had suffered emotionally. Demarius, the youngest, has\nproblems sleeping at night. James “acts out things . . . [h]e’s very easy to get upset.” The boys\nwere attending counseling sessions, but Ms. Banks stopped taking them because she felt they were\ngetting better. She realized that they were not better and was planning on resuming the counseling\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fsessions. Ms. Banks testified that Toni’s oldest child, Lisa, helps her with the boys.                        Lisa has\nbecome withdrawn and has changed substantially since her mother’s murder.\n\n                The state introduced through the testimony of Kimberly Tanzy, an employee in the\nShelby County Criminal Court Clerk’s Office, prior convictions of the defendant. The clerk’s files\nindicated that the defendant had been indicted in case number 94-03958 for attempt to commit first\ndegree murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of reckless endangerment. Ms. Tanzy read into\nevidence the affidavit of complaint for this charge. The affidavit provided that\n\n                  Mr. Hubert Ballentine. . . rented the business establishment . . . at\n                  1043 South Third for . . . a Christmas party . . . . Two subjects, [the\n                  defendant] and his brother, Billy Joe, entered the business and both\n                  men had been drinking. Both became loud and abusive towards the\n                  family and friends of Mr. Ballentine. . . . Mr. Ballentine told the\n                  two that they were not members of the family or of the business, and\n                  that . . . they would have to leave. He then physically escorted the\n                  two subjects out. The two subjects left . . . and returned . . . 10\n                  minutes later. . . . [The defendant] produced a pistol and his brother\n                  . . . began fighting with . . . [the defendant], over who would get to\n                  shoot the victim. Defendant Billy Joe Hood . . . wrestled the gun\n                  from [the defendant] and then shot the victim, Hubert Ballentine. Mr.\n                  Ballentine was shot in the left side. The bullet went under his heart.\n                  He is listed in critical but stable condition.\n\nAlso introduced were instruments from Elpaso County, Colorado, showing that the defendant was\nconvicted in case number 01-CR-2120 of one count of first degree kidnapping; five counts of\ncommitting a crime of violence using a deadly weapon; two counts of second degree kidnapping;\none count of aggravated robbery; one count of aggravated criminal extortion; and one count of\nmenacing. The defendant was also convicted in Colorado case number 01CR-2263 of two counts\nof murder in the first degree, four counts of committing a crime of violence with a deadly weapon,\nand two counts of aggravated robbery.2 The defense stipulated that all of the convictions from\nColorado and Tennessee belong to the defendant.\n\n                Officer Bernice Murckson, a deputy Shelby County jailer, testified for the defendant\nthat she was assigned to the fourth floor, “B” pod, and had been for five months. She explained that\n“B” pod housed all high risk inmates. Officer Murckson stated that the defendant was housed in “B”\npod. Officer Murckson testified that she had never had any problems with the defendant during her\nshift. She added that he interacted well with other inmates and that he followed the policy and\nprocedures. She concluded that he was respectful of her.\n\n\n\n    2\n     A motion filed by defense counsel averred that the defendant is currently serving a life sentence plus\nconsecutive sentenc es totaling more than 5 00 years resulting from his Colorad o conviction s.\n\n                                                         -7-\n\f                 On cross-examination, Officer Murckson acknowledged that the defendant had\nviolated jail rules on June 22, 2000, and June 23, 2000, while at “R” pod, for failing to comply with\norders of a jailer. She stated that she was not assigned to that pod. She denied knowledge of other\njail infractions committed by the defendant, including an occasion where he displayed his penis to\nan officer conducting an armband check, despite three prior verbal warnings to stop exposing\nhimself. On another occasion, the defendant refused to “lock down” when ordered to do so by a\njailer. As a result, the defendant was placed in administrative segregation. Officer Murckson\nexplained that administrative segregation is for inmates who are out of control. She explained that\nher testimony was limited to the defendant’s behavior only when he was under her supervision. She\ndid not know that the defendant, while in custody in Colorado, had cut another inmate with a razor\nblade, resulting in a twelve-inch wound to the inmate’s abdomen. She also was not aware of an\nincident in Colorado when the defendant created a jail disturbance and attempted to strike an officer.\n\n               Officer Donald Kelly, a deputy jailer, testified that he was assigned to fourth floor,\n“B” pod. He admitted that he was not aware of any of the infractions that Officer Murckson was\nquestioned about by the state. Like Officer Murckson, he had only been on “B” pod for five months.\nDuring this time, Officer Kelly had not had any problems with the defendant. Officer Kelly testified\nthat the defendant was “laid back” and stayed to himself.\n\n                Defendant’s sister, Connie, testified that there were nine children in their family, six\nboys and three girls. Connie Hood noted that many of the defendant’s family members were present\nin the courtroom, including his mother, his aunt, his sister-in-law, his children’s mother, his son,\nanother sister, and a brother.\n\n                 Connie Hood stated that she was not close to her brother, Robert. She stated that\nprior to this trial, she had not seen her brother for five years. She explained that his absence from\ntheir family was his choice and that the family cared about him regardless of what he had done.\nConnie Hood stated that she had never visited her brother after he was taken into custody. She stated\nthat she thought that “Cindy and my mom been down here.” She did not know if any other family\nmembers had visited the defendant at the jail. She further testified that the defendant’s actions\nduring his adult life had affected their mother, knowing that she did not raise him that way. She\nacknowledged that another brother was in jail at the present time. The remaining siblings all work\nand have families.\n\n               Connie Hood testified that the defendant had received a gunshot wound to the head\nsometime during the 1990s. She did not know the circumstances of the shooting, but she did visit\nher brother while he was in the hospital. Connie Hood testified that the defendant has three children,\nages 12, 17, and 19. She does not have contact with these children. She could not offer any\nexplanation for the course the defendant chose to take. Rather, she stated that she would always\nwonder.\n\n               Their mother suffered from high blood pressure and is diabetic. Connie Hood stated\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\fthat her brother’s receiving the death penalty would “really hurt [their mother] bad.” She added that\nthis would impact the entire family.\n\n               On cross-examination, Ms. Hood stated that she did not think that her brother’s gun-\nshot wound to his head had any effect on him. She admitted that he was getting in trouble before\nthe incident and continued to get into trouble after the incident.\n\n               Another sister, Cindy Hood, testified that the defendant was her younger brother.\nCindy and her children had visited her brother in the jail and accepted collect calls from him. Cindy\ndescribed her brother as “pretty decent as a human.” She acknowledged that he had made “some\nmistakes,” as “sure [as] we all have.” She further admitted that he had “done some pretty bad\nthings.”\n\n                Cindy explained that her brother’s behavior had greatly affected their mother. She\nstated that she had tried to convince her brother that there are other ways to do things but that he\n“made his own decisions.” In stating that she did not believe that her brother should be sentenced\nto death, she admitted that he had “made some mistakes.” She rationalized that “[w]e all have [made\nmistakes.] So should we all be sentenced to death?” She added that the imposition of a death\nsentence would be “devastating for me and my family as well as my kids.” On cross-examination,\nCindy Hood acknowledged that there is a difference between the mistakes made by the defendant\nand the mistakes made by herself. Cindy admitted that she had heard that her brother used the alias\nof Billy McGhee while he was in Colorado. She further acknowledged that she had heard about her\nbrother’s involvement in a conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery and his conviction for\naggravated motor vehicle theft in Colorado. She stated that she had no knowledge of her brother’s\nColorado convictions for first degree criminal trespass, theft, and reckless endangerment. She also\ndenied knowledge of any other alias names used by her brother. Notwithstanding this information,\nMs. Hood maintained that he was a decent person. She was then questioned regarding her brother’s\nShelby County, Tennessee convictions, including his 2000 conviction of vandalism over $500, his\n2000 conviction of attempted burglary of a building, his 2000 conviction of criminal trespass, his\n1994 conviction of theft of property over $1000, his 1994 conviction of reckless endangerment with\na deadly weapon, his 1994 conviction of theft over $500, his 1994 conviction of contempt of court,\nhis 1989 conviction of receiving/concealing stolen property, his 1987 conviction of escape, and his\n1986 conviction of attempt to commit grand larceny. She stated that she could not recall these\nconvictions and still maintained that the defendant was a decent person.\n\n              On re-direct examination Ms. Hood maintained that she would always love her\nbrother “no matter what.” She stated that he was her brother and nothing would change that fact.\n\n               At the close of the proof, the trial court instructed the jury on the following statutory\naggravating circumstances:\n\n               One, that the defendant was previously convicted of one or more\n               felonies other than the present charge, the statutory elements of which\n\n\n                                                  -9-\n\f               involve the use of violence to the person. The state is relying upon\n               the crimes of murder in the first degree, reckless endangerment, first\n               degree kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery,\n               crime of violence [sic] deadly weapon, and menacing which are\n               felonies involving the use of violence to the person. Proof of\n               additional convictions may be considered by you only as they relate\n               to the credibility of witnesses. Two, the murder was committed for\n               the purpose of avoiding, interfering with or preventing a lawful arrest\n               or prosecution of the defendant or another.\n\nThe court then instructed the jury as to the following mitigating circumstances:\n\n               Mitigating circumstances, Tennessee law provides that in arriving at\n               the punishment, the jury shall consider, as previously indicated, any\n               mitigating circumstances raised by the evidence which . . . may\n               include, but are not limited to the following: One, that the capacity of\n               the defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\n               conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\n               impaired as a result of intoxication which was insufficient to establish\n               a defense to the crime, but which substantially [a]ffected his\n               judgment. Two, that the defendant gets along well in a structured\n               environment such as in jail. Three, that the defendant has family\n               members who love him and want him to live. Four, that the\n               defendant received a gunshot wound to the head. Five, any other\n               mitigating factor which is raised by the evidence produced by either\n               the prosecution or the defense at either the guilt or sentencing\n               hearing. That is, you shall consider any aspect of the defendant’s\n               character or record or any aspect of the circumstances of the offense\n               favorable to the defendant which is supported by the evidence.\n\n               Following submission of the instructions, the jury retired to consider the verdict at\n4:00 p.m. At 5:35 p.m., the jury returned its verdict, finding that the state had proven the aggravating\ncircumstance (i)(2), the defendant was previously convicted of one or more violent felonies other\nthan the present charge, beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury further found that the aggravating\ncircumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. In accordance\nwith their verdicts, the jury sentenced the defendant to death for the first degree murder of Toni\nBanks.\n\n                            I. Failure of Trial Court to Merge Verdicts\n\n                Although not raised by the defendant, the record reflects that, consistent with the jury\nverdicts, the trial court entered one judgment for murder committed during the perpetration of a\nfelony and one count of premeditated first degree murder. In State v. Howard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060572\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060572/state-v-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn.\n\n\n                                                 -10-\n\f2000), our supreme court held that premeditated murder and felony murder are not separate offenses,\nbut different theories of guilt for the crime of first degree murder. Id. at 274 n.4. Therefore, separate\nconvictions for both felony murder and premeditated murder based upon the same occurrence must\nbe merged. In this case, when the trial court found the evidence sufficient to support both verdicts,\nthe trial court should have merged the guilty verdicts into one judgment for first degree murder. See\nState v. Cribbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060886\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060886/state-v-cribbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788 (Tenn. 1998). Defendant’s conviction for felony murder must\nbe merged with his conviction for premeditated murder, and this case is remanded for entry of\njudgments consistent with this opinion.\n\n                 Similarly, the trial court also entered judgments for each of the alternative counts of\ntheft of property under $500. The defendant was sentenced to 11 months, 29 days for each theft-of-\nproperty conviction. The judgment forms reflect that the sentence had been served in the matter as\na result of pretrial jail credits. The forms also indicate that the two theft sentences were ordered to\nbe served concurrently with one another. It appears that two judgments were entered for the same\noffense. Dual convictions and sentences for theft of property based upon the same evidence violate\nprinciples of double jeopardy. See State v. Denton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1061017\"><a href=\"/opinion/1061017/state-v-denton/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382 (Tenn. 1996). The proper\nremedy is to merge the convictions. Although it has no effect upon the effective sentence and no\nchallenge is made on appeal to the theft convictions, we remand for entry of an order merging the\ntheft convictions.\n\n                          II. Refusal to Permit Defendant to Proceed Pro Se\n\n                 During a motion hearing regarding defense counsel’s request to withdraw from further\nrepresentation of defendant, defense counsel stated to the court, “I also don’t know if [the defendant]\nwould rather represent himself. I don’t know that. But if the court would like to ask him about that.”\n The trial court addressed the issue although no motion to proceed pro se had formally been made\neither orally or in writing and there was no indication from the defendant that he wished to proceed\npro se other than his statement that he had a constitutional right to be “heard by himself.”3\n\n                 The trial court noted that the case had been pending for approximately 14 months and\nthat trial was scheduled to begin a week and a half later. The trial court characterized trial counsel\nas an outstanding and experienced attorney, with access to law books, investigators, and a support\nstaff. The court further stated that to permit the defendant to proceed pro se at this stage would\nrequire a resetting of the case for six to eight months. The trial court rejected any scheme employed\nto delay the trial, noting that if such requests were allowed, trials would be continued indefinitely.\nThe trial court stated that the defendant was going to have a lawyer, and that, in fact, he was\nrepresented by two attorneys. The court further remarked that if the defendant “acted up” or “spoke\nout” he was going to be removed from the courtroom. Later, defense co-counsel informed the court\n\n         3\n            This comment was mad e in the context of defense counsel’s motion to withdraw. During argument of the\nmotion to withdraw, defendant interrupted the trial court mid-sentence, stating “I want her off my case, Your Honor.”\nIn response, the trial court warned the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to act\nup or speak up. Defendant then remarked that he had a “Tennessee constitutional . . . one declaration where I’ve got\nthe right to be heard by myself.”\n\n                                                        -11-\n\fthat the defendant “is prepared to go to trial, representing himself, on the scheduled date of April the\n26.” To this announcement, the trial court responded that no valid reason existed to permit the\ndefendant to represent himself. The trial court rejected the defendant’s pronouncement that he would\nbe ready to represent himself in a capital murder trial in one week. The court added that “any\nreasonable person looking at this situation would have to conclude that he would not be ready and\nis not capable of representing himself on this short notice in a capital case.” The court rejected the\npropriety of the defendant’s giving the court a one week notice that he intended to represent himself\nin a capital murder trial.\n\n            The defendant complains on appeal that the refusal to permit him to proceed pro se in\nthis matter amounted to constitutional error requiring reversal. The defendant concedes that this\nissue was not preserved in the motion for new trial. Nonetheless, he asserts that this court should\nreview the issue on its merits because it is an error affecting the substantial rights of the accused.\nSee Tenn. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n                 In exercising our discretion whether to entertain plain error review under Tennessee\nRule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), the Tennessee Supreme Court has directed that we examine five\nfactors, all of which must be present in a case for review under Rule 52(b) to be appropriate. These\nfive factors are as follows: (1) the record must clearly establish what occurred in the trial court; (2)\na clear and unequivocal rule of law must have been breached; (3) a substantial right of the defendant\nmust have been adversely affected; (4) the accused did not waive the issue for tactical reasons; and\n(5) consideration of the error is necessary to do substantial justice. State v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060573\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060573/state-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n282-83 (Tenn. 2000) (adopting State v.

Crim. App. 1994)).\nThe defendant asserts that all five factors are present requiring plain error review by this court.\nSpecifically, he asserts that the trial court failed to query the defendant to determine whether he\nunderstood the perils of self-representation and whether his waiver of counsel was knowing and\nintelligent. He also claims that the record clearly establishes what occurred in the trial court, that\nthe trial court’s failure to apply this rule affected a substantial right of the defendant, that no tactical\nreason exists for not including the issue in the motion for new trial, and that consideration of the\nissue is necessary to do substantial justice. We agree and proceed with our review.\n\n                  A criminal defendant has a right to be represented by counsel or to represent himself\nand proceed pro se without the assistance of counsel. See U.S. Const., amend. IV; Tenn. Const. art.\nI, § 9; Faretta v.

The right to represent oneself exists “despite the fact that its\nexercise will almost surely result in detriment to both the defendant and the administration of\njustice.” See State v. Fritz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615929/state-v-fritz/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Wash. Ct. App. 1978). The right is not absolute, however.\nTo activate the right of self-representation, the defendant must: (1) timely assert the right to proceed\npro se; (2) clearly and unequivocally exercise the right; and (3) knowingly and intelligently waive\nhis or her right to assistance of counsel. State v. Herrod, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1780564\"><a href=\"/opinion/1780564/state-v-herrod/\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 629-30 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1988). Additionally, Rule 44(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that indigent\ndefendants should execute a written waiver before being allowed to proceed pro se.\n\n\n\n                                                   -12-\n\f                We first observe that the record before us contains no explicit written waiver of the\nright to counsel or a motion to proceed pro se filed by either the defendant or his counsel. See Tenn.\nR. Crim. P. 44(a). The technical record, however, contains several pro se motions submitted by the\ndefendant. Consequently, we conclude that had the defendant been adamant in his desire for self-\nrepresentation, he clearly was capable of filing an appropriate waiver.\n\n                 Next, the general rule is that a motion to proceed pro se must be made prior to trial\nin order to be considered timely. Northington, 667 S.W.2d at 62.

The\ndefendant’s oral “request” in this case was made a week and a half before the start of the trial. The\ncase had been pending for 14 months, and the defendant had been represented by the same counsel\nthroughout the proceedings. The defendant had not provided any indication of his desire for self-\nrepresentation or his dissatisfaction with appointed counsel prior to the hearing on April 19, 2004.\nThe trial began on May 3, 2004. The reference to self-representation, which consisted of a statement\nthat he would be ready to proceed pro se on the scheduled trial date, was made through co-counsel\nafter the trial court denied lead counsel’s motion to withdraw. We agree with the trial court and\nconclude that defendant made this remark about representing himself as an attempt to delay the trial.\n\n                 Our next inquiry is whether the defendant’s request to proceed pro se was clear and\nunequivocal. The only evidence of a request by the defendant to proceed pro se included lead\ncounsel’s statement that “I also don’t know if Mr. Hood would rather represent himself” and co-\ncounsel’s announcement that “he is prepared to go to trial, representing himself, on the scheduled\ndate of April the 26th.” The defendant’s statement in which he interrupted the court and asserted that\nhe had a right to be heard related to his exclamation in court that he wanted lead counsel removed\nfrom his case. This statement did not relate to his desire to proceed pro se. Moreover, the defendant\nnever made any indication, through counsel or otherwise, that he wished to have co-counsel\nremoved. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the defendant’s statements made through counsel\nconstituted an unequivocal assertion of the right. See, e.g., Reese v. Nix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567248\"><a href=\"/opinion/567248/charles-o-reese-v-crispus-c-nix/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1281 (8th\nCir. 1991) (“I don’t want no counsel then” was not a clear and unequivocal pro se demand requiring\nFaretta inquiry); Frazier-El, 204 F.3d at 558 (assertion of the right of self-representation “must be\n. . . clear and unequivocal”).\n\n                The constitutional right of self-representation is waived if not timely and\nunequivocally asserted.

Ylst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553261\"><a href=\"/opinion/553261/vernon-jackson-v-eddie-ylst/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888 (9th Cir. 1990). We conclude that the\ndefendant neither timely nor unequivocally asserted his right to self-representation. Moreover, we\nrecognize that courts should indulge every reasonable presumption against finding that a defendant\nhas waived the right to counsel. State v. Vermillion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2638457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2638457/state-v-vermillion/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (Wash.

DeWeese,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1115407\"><a href=\"/opinion/1115407/state-v-deweese/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (Wash. 1991). There is no indication in the record that the defendant intended to\n\n                                                -13-\n\fwaive his right to have representation through co-counsel. Rather, he wanted lead counsel removed\nas counsel of record. Consideration of the defendant’s delay in asserting his desire to proceed pro\nse, his dissatisfaction with the trial court’s ruling regarding lead counsel, an absence of reasons for\nhis dissatisfaction with lead counsel’s performance, and his implication that he did not want co-\ncounsel removed from his case convinces this court that the purpose of his request was a delay tactic\nor other tactic to disrupt the court proceedings. Absent an unequivocal and timely request, the trial\ncourt was under no duty to advise the defendant of the perils of self-representation or to determine\nwhether the waiver of counsel was knowingly and voluntarily entered.\n\n                Finally, we conclude that the defendant abandoned any intention to represent himself\nwhen he did not pursue the issue of self-representation after the court rejected any notion that the\ndefendant should proceed pro se. See McKaskle v. Wiggins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For the foregoing reasons, we reject the propositions that the request\nwas unequivocal and timely. Accordingly, although the better practice would have been for the court\nto warn the defendant of the risks of self-representation, the court was under no duty to do so because\nthe request was neither timely nor unequivocal.\n\n                      III. Refusal to Permit Defense Counsel to Withdraw\n\n                Lead counsel, an assistant public defender, both orally and by written motion,\nrequested permission to withdraw as counsel of record for the defendant. Counsel related that the\npublic defender’s office was appointed to represent the defendant in two separate capital murder\ncases on February 19, 2003. Shortly thereafter, counsel was assigned to both cases. She maintained\nthat throughout her representation of the defendant, “he has been openly hostile to counsel, making\ncommunications difficult, at best.” The situation escalated on April 16, 2004, when counsel was\ndiscussing motions with defendant in the “lock up” area of the court. She stated that the defendant\n“became threatening toward counsel, in the presence of Officers Burress and Brown, stating he\nwould do whatever it takes to have her removed from his cases, even if it meant he would pick up\nanother charge.” Officer Burress advised counsel to leave the room. Officer Burress related the\nincident to the court. The defendant later told co-counsel and two investigators that he intended to\nhit lead counsel. Because of this incident, law enforcement personnel were present when lead\ncounsel and the defendant conferred, rendering confidential communication difficult. She stated that\nshe had never been threatened by a client in her 14 years as an attorney. Counsel concluded that she\nwas unable to function effectively under this situation.\n\n              The trial court denied the oral motion and entered a written order entered on April\n21, 2004. In denying the motion, the trial court made the following findings:\n\n               [T]here has been concern regarding Mr. Hood’s conduct and actions\n               the entire time this case has been pending in this court – certain\n               precautions have been taken on previous hearings. Additional\n\n\n                                                 -14-\n\f               precautions were taken today. No attorney should . . . have his or her\n               safety jeopardized because of a client’s actions.\n\n               But I will say that Mr. Hood, obviously being in custody, will, for\n               today’s purposes and any future court dates, be restrained – handcuffs\n               and leg restraints – and members of the DRT team will assist in\n               ensuring that he is not able to cause harm to anyone. His conduct\n               may well pose a threat to everyone in the system with whom he\n               comes in contact, and while I certainly understand Ms. Thackery’s\n               concern, and I respect her statement, and I know that she wouldn’t\n               make a request like that for any dilatory reason or frivolously, I am\n               going to ask that she stay on this case given the fact that we are a\n               couple of weeks away from trial – a week and a half away from trial,\n               the age of the case, the fact that he has two murder cases pending.\n               We need to get the first one tried before we move onto the second\n               one.\n\n                       Ms. Thackery is an experienced trial attorney; will do an\n               outstanding job in representing Mr. Hood’s interests; and anytime\n               he’s brought – I will certainly not ask Ms. Thackery nor expect her to\n               go to the jail to visit Mr. Hood. She’s welcome to visit him here in\n               lockup anytime she needs to try to speak with him here in lockup . .\n               . a completely secure area where we can ensure that Mr. Hood is\n               sufficiently restrained to . . . make certain that there will be no\n               problem for Ms. Thackery.\n\n               The defendant now complains that the trial court erred in denying counsel’s motion\nto withdraw. The defendant has failed to cite to any legal authority supporting his argument.\nAccordingly, this issue is waived. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b).\nNotwithstanding, because of the seriousness of the penalty imposed in this capital case, we elect to\nreview the issue on its merits.\n\n               The decision whether to allow counsel to withdraw in a pending criminal matter is\nvested in the sound discretion of the trial court, and the decision will not be reversed on appeal\nunless an abuse of discretion is shown. State v. Russell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451606/state-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (Tenn. Crim. App.),\nperm. app. denied (Tenn. 1999). The trial court refused counsel’s motion, noting that this matter had\nbeen pending for over one year, that counsel was well-qualified, and that the court was not going to\npermit intentional delays by the defendant.\n\n               A review of the record supports the conclusions and ruling of the trial court. The trial\ncourt accredited counsel’s assertions that the defendant made threats against her person. Although\nwe do not consider these threats insignificant and share a strong concern for counsel’s safety, there\n\n\n\n                                                 -15-\n\fis no indication of the nature of the threats or the reason why the defendant was dissatisfied with\ncounsel.\n\n                Although an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to representation by counsel, this\nright does not include the right to counsel of choice or to a special rapport, confidence, or even\nmeaningful relationship with appointed counsel. See State v. Carruthers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060523\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060523/state-v-carruthers/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (Tenn.\n2000), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). The trial court found that counsel was\nmore than qualified to represent the defendant. The record fails to indicate that counsel was unable\nto effectively defend the defendant against the charge of capital murder. She had been counsel of\nrecord for 14 months, during which time the defendant had no complaints with her performance.\nIndeed, the motion was made a week and a half prior to the start of trial. Had the motion been\nallowed, further delay would have been necessary for the defendant to prepare his case pro se or\nretain other counsel. See Russell, 10 S.W.3d at 270. Finally, the trial court enacted security\nmeasures to protect both counsel and persons in the courtroom. There is no indication that counsel\nhad any further adverse incident with the defendant. In fact, in requesting the removal of restraints\nduring the trial, counsel related that she had visited the defendant at the jail without incident.\n\n               Based upon the record before this court, we conclude that the defendant has failed to\ndemonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in denying counsel’s motion to withdraw.\nAccordingly, this issue is without merit.\n\n               IV. Presence of Uniformed Detention Response Team Members\n\n                  On the first morning of trial, defense counsel, relying upon a motion previously filed,\nrequested that the defendant not be required to wear handcuffs and shackles while in the presence\nof the jury. In support of this request, counsel related that she and co-counsel had visited the\ndefendant at the jail and had encountered no problems. The trial court denied the request, noting that\nthe defendant was wearing civilian clothing. The court informed counsel that the defendant would\nbe permitted to have his shirt untucked to conceal the fact that he was handcuffed. The court also\nnoted that the fact that his feet were shackled would not be noticeable. Additionally, the court\nrecounted the defendant’s history in this matter, specifically noting the defendant’s threats to\ncounsel. In this regard, the trial court considered the defendant’s Colorado convictions and sentences\nand the fact that he was facing the death penalty in Tennessee. The court concluded that there was\nlittle to deter the defendant from assaulting his attorney(s) should the trial not go the way he wanted.\n\n               During a recess in the voir dire process, counsel raised concern about the presence\nof the Detention Response Team (DRT) officers. Specifically, counsel noted that the officers’\nuniforms clearly identified them with the words “Detention Response Team” printed on front and\nback. The trial court noted that the two officers had been seated throughout the proceeding and were\nnot parading before the jury. The court found that the design on the uniform shirt or jacket did not\nprejudice the defendant. Later during the voir dire process, the trial court did request that the same\ntwo officers be present all day every day for the rest of the trial, to understand the rulings, to be\naware of what was going on, and to minimize the officers’ visibility and presence. The trial judge\n\n\n                                                  -16-\n\fexplained that he did not want a change of officers during the middle of the proceedings. The trial\ncourt did grant counsel’s request to have the DRT members move one seat down to permit counsel\nto sit next to the defendant as necessary during the trial.4\n\n                Counsel again objected to the handcuffs and shackles after the defendant expressed\nto her that it was inherently prejudicial. At this juncture, counsel again challenged the presence of\ntwo uniformed Detention Response Team members who were seated on either side of the defendant.\n Counsel noted that Officer Green was six foot one and weighed 215 pounds and that Officer\nWormley was six feet and one inch tall and weighed 198 pounds. Counsel argued that the presence\nof the officers indicated to the jury that the defendant is “dangerous, scary, and that they will be\ninherently prejudiced by that.” The trial court reiterated its previous rulings, noting that “[t]he two\nDRT officers that are here during the trial . . . conduct themselves in an extremely professional\nmanner. Show no expression yea or nay with regards to things that are said during the course of the\ntrial. And so, they do not . . . prejudice the defendant’s rights in this case in any way.”\n\n                 The defendant complains that the presence of uniformed members of the Detention\nResponse Team denied him a fair trial. He notes that two witnesses emphasized the officers’\npresence. Specifically, the defendant refers to Donald Armstrong, who had initially pointed to a\nDRT officer in response to making an in-court identification of the defendant and the penalty phase\ntestimony of Officer Murckson, who in response to questioning as to the function of the DRT,\nreplied, “That’s Detention Response Team. There (sic) are the ones who patrol and help control\ninmates [who are] high risk or violent.” Officer Murckson also identified the defendant as “the\ninmate . . . sitting between the [sic] both D.R.T. members.”\n\n                We initially observe that the defendant has failed to cite to any legal authority\nsupporting his argument. Accordingly, this issue is waived. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7); Tenn.\nCt. Crim. App. R. 10(b). Notwithstanding waiver, we elect to review his complaint that the officers’\npresence in the courtroom during the trial prejudiced his right to a fair trial. The defendant, we note,\ndoes not challenge the propriety of the handcuffs and shackles on appeal.\n\n                In Holbrook v. Flynn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111619\"><a href=\"/opinion/111619/holbrook-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111619\"><a href=\"/opinion/111619/holbrook-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), the United States\nSupreme Court defined the standard by which security presence in the courtroom may be measured\nin relation to a defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial. In reviewing a petition from a\ndefendant convicted in a Rhode Island state court, the Supreme Court concluded that “the\nconspicuous, or at least noticeable, deployment of security personnel in a courtroom during trial” is\nnot an inherently prejudicial practice and does not violate the fundamental principles of the criminal\njustice system. Id. at 568, 106 S. Ct. at 1345. When a courtroom security arrangement is challenged\nas inherently prejudicial, the question is whether there is “an unacceptable risk . . . of impermissible\nfactors coming into play.” Id. at 570, 106 S. Ct. at 1346-47.\n\n\n         4\n           The defendant asserts in his brief that, in Shelby County, the defendants are seated in a row of chairs two\nto three feet behind counsel. The backs of these chairs rest against the “bar” which separates the audience seating\narea.\n\n                                                         -17-\n\f              Holbrook involved a challenge to four uniformed officers seated behind six\ndefendants. In finding the defendants were not entitled to relief, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n               We do not minimize the threat that a roomful of uniformed and armed\n               policemen might pose to a defendant’s chances of receiving a fair\n               trial. But we simply cannot find an unacceptable risk of prejudice in\n               the spectacle of four such officers quietly sitting in the first row of a\n               courtroom’s spectator section. Even had the jurors been aware that\n               the deployment of troopers was not common practice in Rhode Island,\n               we cannot believe that the use of the four troopers tended to brand\n               respondent in their eyes with an unmistakable mark of guilt. Four\n               troopers are unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other\n               than a normal official concern for the safety and order of the\n               proceedings.\n\nId. at 571, 106 S. Ct. at 1347 (citations and internal punctuation omitted).\n\n              As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[J]urors are quite aware that the defendant\n appearing before them did not arrive there by choice or happenstance.” Id. at 567, 106 S. Ct. at\n1347. Generally, the trial court, which has presided over the proceedings, is in\n\n                the best position to make determinations regarding how to achieve\n               [the] primary purpose [of ensuring a fair trial], and absent some abuse\n               of the trial court’s discretion in marshalling the trial, an appellate\n               court should not redetermine in retrospect and on a cold record how\n               the case should have been better tried.\n\n State v.

See Deck v. Missouri, __ U.S. __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142897\"><a href=\"/opinion/142897/deck-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2007</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). The nation’s\nhighest court held that\n\n               courts cannot routinely place defendants in shackles or other physical restraints\n               visible to the jury. . . . The constitutional requirement, however, is not absolute. It\n               permits a judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to take account of special\n               circumstances, including security concerns, that may call for shackling.\n\n                Id. at __ , 125 S. Ct. at 2014-15. In this regard, the Supreme Court recognized the\nneed to restrain dangerous defendants to prevent courtroom attacks or the need to give trial courts\n\n                                                 -18-\n\flatitude in making individualized security determinations. Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 2014. The Court\nalso acknowledged the potential for tragedy that can result if judges are not able to protect\nthemselves and their courtrooms. Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 2014-15. The Court advised, however,\nthat such determinations must be case specific; “that is to say, it should reflect particular concerns,\nsay special security needs or escape risks, related to the defendant on trial.” Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at\n2015. Thus, the Court concluded that, “given their prejudicial effect, due process does not permit\nthe use of visible restraints if the trial court has not taken account of the circumstances of the\nparticular case.” Id. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 2014.\n\n                 Although this standard has not yet been applied to security personnel in the\ncourtroom, we conclude that the holding in Deck v. Missouri is a reasonable rule that should be\napplied to any restraint imposed on a criminal defendant in the courtroom. In the present case, the\ntrial court acknowledged (1) defense counsel’s recitation of threats made to her by the defendant, (2)\nthe 500-year prison sentence awaiting the defendant in Colorado, (3) the need to protect everyone\nin the courtroom, (4) the possible imposition of the death penalty in two cases in Tennessee, and (5)\npast incidents of violence by criminal defendants in this particular courtroom. The trial court then\ndetermined that it was necessary to impose restraints including handcuffs, shackles, and the\nassistance of members of the DRT team. The record supports the trial court’s finding that the\ndefendant posed a substantial security risk for the courtroom and that the circumstances warranted\nthe use of restraints. See United States v. Amaro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486579\"><a href=\"/opinion/486579/united-states-v-filemon-amaro/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1031</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, we\ncannot conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court abused its discretion in\nimposing additional security measures in the courtroom.\n\n                                    V. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n             The defendant alleges that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction of the\npremeditated murder of Toni Banks. In support of this argument, the defendant refers to evidence\nintroduced at trial relating that both he and Toni Banks were consuming alcohol the day and evening\npreceding the murder. He also cites to the fact that the two were quarreling throughout the\nafternoon and evening. The defendant contends that there is no evidence that he threatened Toni\nBanks or declared an intent to harm her. He alleges that there is no proof of plans to conceal the\nmurder prior to its commission. The defendant asserts that the only proof to support a finding of\npremeditation is the fact that Toni Banks was not armed. This proof, he contends, is insufficient\nto support a conviction for first degree premeditated murder.\n\n            When a challenge is made on appeal to the sufficiency of the convicting evidence, this\ncourt is guided by certain well-established principles. First, a jury conviction removes the\npresumption of innocence with which a defendant is cloaked and replaces it with one of guilt, so\nthat on appeal, a convicted defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the evidence is\ninsufficient.

Crim. App.), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 1990), this court\nheld these rules applicable to findings of guilt predicated upon direct evidence, circumstantial\nevidence, or a combination of both direct and circumstantial evidence.\n\n            The defendant was convicted of premeditated first degree murder. First degree murder\nis “the premeditated and intentional killing of another.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-202(a)(1) (2003).\nTennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-202(d) defines premeditation as:\n\n               an act done after the exercise of reflection and judgment.\n               “Premeditation” means that the intent to kill must have been formed\n               prior to the act itself. It is not necessary that the purpose to kill\n               preexist in the mind of the accused for any definite period of time.\n               The mental state of the accused at the time the accused allegedly\n               decided to kill must be carefully considered in order to determine\n               whether the accused was sufficiently free from excitement and\n               passion as to be capable of premeditation.\n\n               The element of premeditation is a question of fact to be resolved by the jury and may\nbe established by proof of the circumstances surrounding the killing. State v. Suttles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060577/state-v-suttles/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260 (Tenn.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the trier of fact cannot\nspeculate as to what was in the killer’s mind, the existence of facts of premeditation must be\ndetermined from the killer’s conduct in light of the surrounding circumstances. Although there is\nno strict standard governing what constitutes proof of premeditation, circumstances from which a\njury may infer premeditation include planning activity by a defendant prior to the killing, the\ndefendant’s prior relationship with the victim, and the manner of the killing.

Viewing the\nevidence and inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the state, this court finds sufficient\nevidence to support the jury’s finding of premeditation.\n\n                      VI. Admission of Prior Bad Acts of the Defendant\n\n               Prior to trial and pursuant to a motion filed by the state, a hearing was held to\ndetermine the admissibility of proof of another murder and theft of property allegedly committed by\nthe defendant. The state’s purpose in seeking admission of this evidence was to present proof as to\nthe defendant’s motive for killing Toni Banks. The state posited that Toni Banks knew too much\nabout these prior crimes and that her murder was necessary to prevent the defendant’s arrest. This\nposition was based upon Joseph Jackson’s testimony that the defendant had told him during a\ntelephone conversation that Toni Banks knew to much and that she had to go.\n\n               During this hearing, the trial court heard proof from Joseph Jackson, the accomplice\nto the alleged murder and theft. The trial court also heard statements by the prosecution that\ncorroborating proof by Panyanouvong’s widow and members of the Banks family would be\npresented linking the property taken from the Panyanouvong home to the defendant. Defense\ncounsel objected to the admission of any and all of this proof. In this regard, defense counsel cited\nto Jackson’s lack of credibility, the highly prejudicial nature of the evidence, and its irrelevance to\nthe Banks murder. Defense counsel also commented that Jackson’s accusation was self-serving in\nnature.\n\n                In making its decision, the trial court noted that the murder of Phimphone\nPanyanouvong would not have been solved but for the information provided by Jackson. The trial\ncourt further acknowledged that decisions regarding credibility of witnesses are left to the jury. With\nthese acknowledgments, the trial court found that there was sufficient credibility to Jackson’s\ntestimony to satisfy the clear and convincing provision of Tennessee Rule of Evidence 404(b). The\ncourt further found that:\n\n               the probative value certainly outweighs any prejudicial effect. The\n               testimony regarding the phone conversation is extremely probative,\n               and short of witnessing the murder himself, I can’t imagine proof that\n               would be much more probative than overhearing or being told\n               statements such as Mr. Jackson says he was told over the phone by\n               this defendant. And so I think clearly the probative value outweighs\n               the prejudicial effect.\n\n\n\n                                                 -21-\n\f               I think that proof of this sort would be highly relevant to establish\n               motive, to establish intent, lack of mistake, identity. And there are\n               several factors that are very relevant, and I think if the jury elects to\n               believe the testimony of Mr. Jackson after they hear that testimony\n               along with all the other proof in the case – several factors that would\n               be put before the jury through Mr. Jackson’s testimony – those four\n               that I mentioned being the four that come to mind.\n\n              The trial court rejected defense counsel’s request to limit the evidence to the burglary\nand theft, concluding that the murder lent credibility to Joe Jackson’s statement.\n\n                During the defendant’s trial, the state presented the testimony of numerous witnesses\nwho referenced the December 27, 2000 murder of Phimphone Panyanouvong and the theft of his\nproperty. Thong Panyanouvong described the events of December 27, 2000, including finding her\nmurdered husband’s body near the front door of their home. Jackson related his “fencing”\nrelationship with the defendant and the events of December 27, 2000, which included the defendant\nadmitting that he had shot a man and that the defendant had taken the man’s car and numerous\npersonal belongings from his house. Bruce Griffey, Jackson’s attorney, testified that Jackson had\ncontacted him from jail, explaining that he had information about some unsolved crimes. Lisa\nMatthews, Jackson’s girlfriend, related that she placed three-way telephone calls for Jackson to the\ndefendant while Jackson was in jail. During these conversations, Matthews overheard Jackson\ntelling the defendant that he was not in jail for what they had done. She also overheard the defendant\ntelling Jackson that “she had to go, and basically that she knew too much.” Various members of\nToni Banks’s family, James Banks, Percy Foster, James Banks, Jr., and Carol Webb, testified that\nthey were in possession of various items that matched the description of those items taken from the\nPanyanouvong home. Various law enforcement officers were called to testify regarding the\nidentification of property taken during the Panyanouvong murder.\n\n               After the testimony of the eighth witness called by the state, the trial court issued a\ncautionary instruction to the jury regarding the other crimes evidence:\n\n               Ladies and gentlemen, the testimony you have heard today regarding\n               the defendant’s alleged commission of crimes other than that for\n               which he is on trial, i.e. relating to the death of Mr. Panyanouvong,\n               may not be considered to prove the defendant’s disposition to commit\n               the type of crime for which he is on trial. This evidence may only be\n               considered by you for the limited purpose of determining whether it\n               proves the defendant’s identity, that is, such evidence may[]be\n               considered by you if it tends to establish the defendant’s identity in\n               the case on trial. Motive, that is, to show – that is, such evidence\n               may[]be considered by you if it tends to show a motive of the\n               defendant for the commission of the offense presently charged, or the\n               defendant’s intent. That is, such evidence may[]be considered by you\n               if it tends to establish that the defendant actually intended to commit\n\n                                                 -22-\n\f               the crime with which he is presently charged. Such evidence of other\n               crimes may not be considered for any purpose other than those\n               specifically stated herein.\n\nThe trial court repeated the instruction at the end of the guilt phase.\n\n               On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting any and all\nevidence involving his alleged murder of Phimphone Panyanouvong and the theft of his property.\nThe defendant complains that the trial court’s ruling created “devastatingly unfair prejudice,” and\nin support thereof, he references the order of the state’s witnesses. Moreover, he asserts that any\nproof regarding the Panyanouvong crimes was irrelevant to the issue whether he had murdered Toni\nBanks. The defendant further complains that prejudicial impact of the other crimes evidence was\ncompounded by the state’s use of the other crimes evidence in its closing argument and that had the\nother crimes evidence been excluded, “a reasonable jury could have returned a verdict of either\nvoluntary manslaughter or second degree murder.”\n\n                 Evidence of a defendant’s prior crimes, wrongs, or acts is not generally admissible\nto prove that he committed the crime in question. Tenn. R. Evid. 404. The rationale underlying the\ngeneral rule is that admission of such evidence carries with it the inherent risk of the jury convicting\nthe defendant of a crime based upon his bad character or propensity to commit a crime, rather than\nthe conviction resting upon the strength of the evidence. State v. Thacker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058342\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058342/state-v-thacker/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239\n(Tenn. 2005). The risk is greater when the defendant’s prior bad acts are similar to the crime for\nwhich the defendant is on trial. Id. at 239; see also State v. McCary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462824\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462824/state-v-mccary/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (Tenn.\n1996).\n\n                Notwithstanding the general rule, evidence of a defendant’s prior crimes, wrongs or\nacts may be admissible where it is probative of material issues other than conduct conforming with\na character trait. Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b). Thus, evidence of a defendant’s character may become\nadmissible when it logically tends to prove material issues which fall into one of three categories:\n(1) the use of “motive and common scheme or plan” to establish identity, (2) to establish the\ndefendant’s intent in committing the offense on trial, and (3) to “rebut a claim of mistake or accident\nif asserted as a defense.” Thacker, 164 S.W.3d at 239 (citing McCary, 922 S.W.2d at 514). To\nadmit such evidence, the rule specifies three prerequisites:\n\n               (1) The court upon request must hold a hearing outside the jury’s\n               presence;\n\n               (2) The court must determine that a material issue exists other than\n               conduct conforming with a character trait and must upon request state\n               on the record the material issue, the ruling, and the reasons for\n               admitting the evidence; and\n\n               (3) The court must exclude the evidence if its probative value is\n               outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n                                                 -23-\n\fTenn. R. Evid. 404(b). A fourth prerequisite to admission is that the court must find by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the defendant committed the other crime. Id., Advisory Commission\nCmts.; State v. DuBose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518815\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518815/state-v-dubose/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 654 (Tenn. 1997); State v.

Thacker, 164\nS.W.3d at 240. Its determination is entitled to deference when it has substantially complied with the\nprocedural requisites of Rule 404(b). See DuBose, 953 S.W.2d at 652.\n\n                 In the present case, the trial court conducted a jury-out hearing on the other crimes\nevidence; the court determined that a material issue existed other than conforming conduct; the court\nstated its reasons on the record; the trial court determined that the evidence was more probative than\nprejudicial; and the trial court found that the defendant committed the other crimes by clear and\nconvincing evidence. Accordingly, because the trial court substantially complied with the\nrequirements of Rule 404(b), this court will review the trial court’s determination for an abuse of\ndiscretion. Under this standard of review, this court will only reverse the trial court’s ruling if the\nlower court “applied an incorrect legal standard, or reached a decision which is against logic or\nreasoning that caused an injustice to the party complaining.” State v.

The trial court properly instructed the jury that the evidence could\nbe considered for the limited purpose of determining whether it tends to show motive. Evidence\nproving motive necessarily serves the purpose of completing the story of the crime. See State v.\nLeach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058543\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058543/state-v-leach/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (Tenn. 2004). Motive is a relevant circumstantial fact that refers to why\na defendant did what he did. The motive and intent of the defendant in the commission of a murder\nare almost always critical issues. State v. Gentry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1660646\"><a href=\"/opinion/1660646/state-v-gentry/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\nEvidence of motive is often pertinent as the basis to infer that the act was committed, to prove\nrequisite mental state, or to prove the identity of the actor. See 22 C. Wright & K. Graham, Jr.,\nFederal Practice and Procedure Evidence § 479 (1978). Indeed, the defendant’s possession of a\nmotive strengthens the inference that the death of the victim was caused by an intentional act rather\nthan by accident. Finally, in making a risk versus benefit analysis in this case, we cannot conclude\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence\noutweighed its prejudicial impact. Accordingly, the admission of the evidence was not error.\n\n\n                             VII. Instruction as to (i)(2) Aggravator\n\n\n               Prior to the commencement of the penalty phase, the state asserted that it would use\nthe defendant’s prior convictions of murder in the first degree, reckless endangerment, first degree\nkidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery, crime of violence with a deadly weapon,\nand menacing to establish the existence of the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance. The trial court then\n\n                                                 -24-\n\fconducted a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the defendant’s prior\nconvictions involved the use of violence to the person. See State v. Sims, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1580541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1580541/state-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11-12 (Tenn.\n2001). Finding that the offenses involved the use of violence, the trial court allowed the state to\nintroduce evidence of the prior convictions. See State v. Powers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060345\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060345/state-v-powers/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 400-01 (Tenn.\n2003). At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n\n               One, that the defendant was previously convicted of one or more\n               felonies other than the present charge, the statutory elements of which\n               involve the use of violence to the person. The state is relying upon\n               the crimes of murder in the first degree, reckless endangerment, first\n               degree kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery,\n               crime of violence deadly weapon, and menacing which are felonies\n               involving the use of violence to the person. Proof of additional\n               convictions may[]be considered by you only as they relate to the\n               credibility of witnesses. Two, the murder was committed for the\n               purpose of avoiding, interfering with or preventing a lawful arrest or\n               prosecution of the defendant or another.\n\n\n               The defendant now contends that the question whether prior offenses involved the\nuse of violence was a question for the jury to resolve beyond a reasonable doubt. Essentially, the\ndefendant complains that the procedure set forth in Sims in which the trial court considers the\nunderlying facts of the prior offenses to determine whether the elements of the offenses involved the\nuse of violence to the person violates the dictates of Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120 S.\nCt. 2348 (2000), and Ring v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).\n\n\n                Our supreme court recently rejected this same argument in State v. Cole, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">885</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 900 (Tenn. 2005). In doing so, our high court acknowledged that “Apprendi and its progeny\npreclude judges from finding ‘additional facts,’ that increase a defendant’s sentence beyond the\n‘statutory maximum,’ which is defined as the maximum sentence a judge may impose ‘solely on the\nbasis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.’” Cole, 155 S.W.3d at\n903 (quoting Blakely v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2537 (2004)). The court\ndifferentiated the principles of Apprendi from the Sims procedure and concluded that “[t]he Sims\nprocedure involves a legal determination, and as such this procedure does not transgress the dictates\nof Apprendi and its progeny.” Id. at 904.\n\n\n               The supreme court explained,\n\n               The (i)(2) aggravating circumstance requires only that the statutory\n               elements of the prior felony involve the use of violence to the person.\n               The Sims procedure authorizes trial judges merely to examine the\n\n\n                                                -25-\n\f               facts, record, and evidence underlying the prior conviction to\n               ascertain which “statutory elements” served as the basis of the prior\n               felony conviction. This is a legal determination that neither requires\n               nor allows trial judges to make factual findings as to whether the prior\n               conviction involved violence. This legal determination is analogous\n               to the preliminary questions trial judges often are called upon to\n               decide when determining the admissibility of evidence.\n\n\nId. The supreme court further noted that “by making this legal determination, the trial court neither\ninflicts punishment nor usurps or infringes upon the jury’s role as fact-finder.” Id. The court\nobserved that\n\n\n               [o]nce the trial court determines as a matter of law that the statutory\n               elements of the prior convictions involve the use of violence, the jury\n               must then determine as matters of fact whether the prosecution has\n               proven the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt\n               and whether aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating\n               circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nId. Accordingly, the trial court’s procedure in the present case passes constitutional muster.\n\n\n                      VIII. Indictment Failed to Charge Capital Offense\n\n\n                The defendant asserts that “[a]ny fact that increases the maximum penalty for a crime\nmust be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order\nto satisfy the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment’s notice and jury\ntrial guarantees.” In this regard, the defendant contends that the indictment against him failed to\n“include the facts that would qualify the [defendant] for the death penalty.” The defendant’s\nargument is based upon the premise that first degree murder is not a capital offense unless\naccompanied by aggravating factors. Essentially, the defendant complains that the indictment\nreturned by the grand jury charges non-capital, first degree murder because the grand jury did not\nfind any capital aggravating circumstances. Thus, the defendant alleges that to satisfy the\nrequirements of Apprendi v. New Jersey, the indictment must include language of the statutory\naggravating circumstance(s) to elevate the offense to capital murder.\n\n\n               The defendant’s argument has been rejected on numerous occasions by our supreme\ncourt. See State v. Reid, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058311/state-v-reid/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311-12 (Tenn. 2005); State v.

Aug. 22, 2005). In Holton, our high\ncourt explained that “Apprendi applies only to enhancement factors used to impose a sentence above\nthe statutory maximum” and that “the death penalty is within the statutory range of punishment\nprescribed for first degree murder by the Tennessee General Assembly.” Holton, 126 S.W.3d at 863\n(citing State v. Dellinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060393/state-v-dellinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466-67 (Tenn. 2002)); see also State v.

The court further emphasized that “Tennessee’s capital sentencing\nprocedures require that a jury, not a judge, make the findings regarding the presence of aggravating\ncircumstances and that the findings must be made beyond a reasonable doubt.” Odom, 137 S.W.3d\nat 590-91 (citing Holton, 126 S.W.3d at 864); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-204(f)(1) (2003).\nTennessee’s capital sentencing scheme does not require that aggravating circumstances be included\nin an indictment. See State v. Reid, 164 S.W.3d at 312. The defendant is not entitled to relief on\nthis issue.\n\n                  IX. Constitutionality of Tennessee Death Penalty Scheme\n\n\n                The defendant raises numerous challenges to the constitutionality of Tennessee’s\ndeath penalty provisions. Included within his challenge that the Tennessee death penalty statutes\nviolate the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and\nArticle I, Sections 8, 9, 16, and 17, and Article II, Section 2 of the Tennessee Constitution are the\nfollowing:\n\n\n               1. The defendant first asserts that Tennessee’s death penalty statutes\n               fail to meaningfully narrow the class of death eligible defendants,\n               thereby rendering Tennessee death penalty statutory scheme\n               unconstitutional.      Specifically, he argues that the statutory\n               aggravating circumstances set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated\n               section 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), (6), and (7) have been so broadly\n               interpreted, whether viewed singly or collectively, that they fail to\n               provide such a “meaningful basis” for narrowing the population of\n               those convicted of first degree murder to those eligible for the\n               sentence of death. We note that factors, (i)(5), (i)(6) and (i)(7), do not\n               pertain to this case as none of these factors were relied upon by the\n               state nor found by the jury. Thus, any individual claim with respect\n               to these factors is without merit. See, e.g., State v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060934\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060934/state-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n               <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715 (Tenn. 1997), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See\nTerry, 46 S.W.3d at 164. Regarding the circumstances of the crime itself, numerous factors are\nconsidered including: (1) the means of death, (2) the manner of death, (3) the motivation for the\nkilling, (4) the place of death, (5) the victim’s age, physical condition, and psychological condition,\n(6) the absence or presence of provocation, (7) the absence or presence of premeditation, (8) the\nabsence or presence of justification, and (9) the injury to and effect on non-decedent victims. Stout,\n46 S.W.3d at 706 (citing Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 667); see also Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164.\nContemplated within the review are numerous factors regarding the defendant, including: (1) prior\ncriminal record, (2) age, race, and gender, (3) mental, emotional, and physical condition, (4) role in\nthe murder, (5) cooperation with authorities, (6) level of remorse, (7) knowledge of the victim’s\n\n\n\n                                                 -29-\n\fhelplessness, and (8) potential for rehabilitation. Stout, 46 S.W.3d at 706; Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164.\n\n                In completing our review, we remain cognizant of the fact that “no two cases involve\nidentical circumstances.” See generally Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164. Thus, our function is not to limit\nour comparison to those cases where a death sentence “is perfectly symmetrical,” but rather, our\nobjective is only to “identify and to invalidate the aberrant death sentence.” Terry, 46 S.W.3d at 164\n(citing Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 665).\n\n\n                The circumstances surrounding the murder in light of the relevant and comparative\nfactors reveal that the defendant and Toni Banks had been involved in a romantic relationship and\nshared an apartment together in a Shelby County apartment complex. Toni Banks apparently was the\nbreadwinner in the household, and the defendant was unemployed. During the day preceding her\nmurder, Toni Banks went to work, returned home, and began doing laundry at the nearby apartment\nof her brother. During this time, the defendant was observed drinking in the common area of the\napartment complex. Toni Banks also drank alcohol that evening. Sometime that evening, Toni\nBanks’s children overheard their mother and the defendant arguing. The children also heard objects\nbeing thrown. At some point, the defendant left the apartment and asked another resident to take him\nto the liquor store. During this trip, the defendant remarked that he and Toni Banks were having\nproblems. When they returned to the apartment complex, the defendant commented that he was\ngoing to “straighten things up” with Toni Banks. Thirty to 45 minutes later, the defendant emerged\nfrom the apartment and obtained a ride to Crump Street. The defendant remarked that he had done\nsomething and was going to leave town.\n\n\n                The following morning, the body of Toni Banks was discovered in her bedroom with\na single gunshot to her head. The autopsy revealed that the gun was fired less than six inches from\nthe victim’s head. The victim was only partially dressed. The medical examiner explained that the\npresence of unburned flakes of gunpowder on the inside of the victim’s right arm indicated that the\nvictim’s arm was above her head at the time the gun was fired, supporting the theory that the victim\nwas asleep at the time of the shooting or that the victim was trying to defend herself. The apartment\nhad been locked from the outside and only Toni Banks and the defendant had the keys. The\ndefendant made his way to the State of Colorado, where he proceeded to commit additional crimes.\nIt was only at the time of his arrest in Colorado that Shelby County authorities learned of his\nlocation.\n\n\n               The defendant was previously convicted of reckless endangerment in Shelby County.\nThis conviction arose from the shooting of a Memphis store owner. The defendant also has\nnumerous felony convictions in Colorado. In September 2002, the defendant entered guilty pleas\nto two counts of first degree murder, two counts of committing a violent crime with a deadly\nweapon, and three counts of aggravated robbery. In November 2002, the defendant entered guilty\npleas to one count of first degree kidnapping, two counts of second degree kidnapping, one count\n\n\n                                                -30-\n\fof aggravated robbery, and one count of menacing with a deadly weapon. Thus, the evidence\nsupporting the application of the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance is overwhelming.\n\n\n              The defendant was 33 years old at the time of the offense. The family of the\ndefendant described him as a decent person, despite his extensive history of criminal convictions.\nThe defendant has three children (ages 12, 17, and 19). The defendant’s sister testified that their\nmother would be greatly affected should the defendant receive the death penalty.\n\n\n              While no two capital cases and no two capital defendants are alike, we have reviewed\nthe circumstances of the present case with similar first degree murder cases and conclude that the\npenalty imposed in the present case is not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\n\n                The sentence of death has been upheld in numerous cases in which the victim was\nthe defendant’s wife or girlfriend.

In so concluding, we have\nconsidered the entire record and reach the decision that the sentence of death was not imposed\narbitrarily, that the evidence supports the finding of the (i)(2) aggravating circumstance, that the\nevidence supports the jury’s finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighs any mitigating\ncircumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the sentence is not excessive or disproportionate.\n\n\n                                          X. Conclusion\n\n\n                 Having fully reviewed the record and the applicable authorities, we affirm the\ndefendant’s conviction of first degree murder. Additionally, in accordance with the mandate of\nTennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-206(c)(1) and the principles adopted in prior decisions of\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court, we have considered the entire record in this cause and find that the\nsentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion and that the evidence supports, as\npreviously discussed, the jury’s finding of the statutory aggravating circumstances and the jury’s\nfinding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-206(c)(1)(A)-(C) (2003). A comparative proportionality review,\nconsidering both “the nature of the crime and the defendant,” convinces us that the sentence of death\nis neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Accordingly, we\naffirm the sentence of death imposed by the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                       ___________________________________\n                                                       JAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                -32-\n\f</pre>",
