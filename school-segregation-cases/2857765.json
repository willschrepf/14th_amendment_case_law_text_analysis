On April 3, 1995, a fire swept\nthrough the premises of the auto repair business that John\nTalmage operated in New Richmond, Wisconsin. After he\nnotified his insurance carrier of the loss, Talmage made\nextensive repairs to the business. The present case arose\nafter the insurance company decided that it had paid\nenough, and the lawyer Talmage hired agreed to a settle-\nment of his claims against the insurer. The lawyer,\nCharles B. Harris, did not handle matters to Talmage’s\nsatisfaction, however, which led Talmage ultimately to\n\f2                                  Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nfile a legal malpractice action. The district court dis-\nmissed some claims and others went to trial before a jury,\nwhich ruled in Talmage’s favor in part and awarded him\nmodest damages. The district court reduced those damages\nfurther. On appeal, Talmage complains that the district\ncourt made a number of evidentiary errors and unduly\nrestricted his damages. Harris cross-appealed from the\ndistrict court’s refusal to order judgment as a matter of\nlaw in his favor. We conclude that the district court’s\nevidentiary rulings were within the scope of its discre-\ntion and that it did not err otherwise in its handling of\nthe case, and we therefore affirm.\n\n\n                             I\n   Talmage’s business, the Talmage Auto Center, offered\ncomplete auto services and collision repair. At the time of\nthe fire, it was insured by United Fire & Casualty Com-\npany (“United Fire”). The policy provided coverage for\nfire loss, with an aggregate limit of $489,000. The day\nafter the fire, Talmage properly notified United Fire of the\nevent. United Fire assigned an adjuster named John H.\nHolt to handle the file. Holt was new to the task: he had\nnever adjusted a claim as large as Talmage’s, nor had he\npreviously worked with a fire claim involving an auto\nrepair facility. Holt told Talmage to find a contractor to\nperform the necessary repair work, but neither Holt nor\nTalmage was able to find someone suitable. At that point,\nUnited Fire neither prepared its own estimate of the\namount of the claim nor asked a contractor to prepare\none. Talmage thought that the loss was approximately\n$527,700, including damage to the building, damage to\nbusiness personal property, loss of income, employee\ntools, and other miscellaneous items. Talmage and Holt\nagreed that Talmage and his employees would perform the\nrepair work themselves. Holt told Talmage to document\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                  3\n\nthe time that they devoted to the work and to save the\nreceipts for the materials they purchased; United Fire,\nHolt promised, would reimburse Talmage. Later, United\nFire hired an accountant, Jennifer Bestul, to review and\norganize the records that Talmage had submitted; Bestul\nrecommended that United Fire adjust the loss on a time-\nand-materials basis.\n  Although Talmage regularly submitted the time rec-\nords and receipts that were accumulating, United Fire did\nnot reimburse him in accordance with Holt’s promises.\nNevertheless, it did make significant partial payments:\nbetween April 17, 1995, and May 20, 1996, it paid him\n$309,309.66. Dissatisfied because he thought that more\nwas due, Talmage turned to Holt’s supervisor, Kelly Hart,\nbut Hart was no help. Later, United Fire removed Holt\nfrom the job and replaced him with Stan Stensrud; by this\ntime, Talmage had done enough repairs to enable him to\nreopen the business. Stensrud took a fresh look at the\nentire claim and decided, at a time when the repairs\nwere 80% complete, to change the method of calculating\nthe fire loss. Instead of a straight time-and-materials\nsystem, Stensrud decided to rely on an outside estimate.\n  In the meantime, on May 28, 1996, Talmage retained\nDoar, Drill & Skow, S.C., the law firm of attorney Charles\nHarris, to represent him in settling his claims against\nUnited Fire. On Talmage’s behalf, Harris prepared a proof\nof claim statement for United Fire that itemized the\nlosses, documented them, and presented a total claim of\n$527,701.95. With a large gap separating the parties’\nassessments of the amounts due, Talmage and United\nFire agreed to submit to an appraisal proceeding in\nDecember 1996, as required by the policy. There were\nthree appraisers—one selected by Talmage, one by United\nFire, and a third selected by the first two.\n  The appraisal proceeding dragged on for quite some\ntime, while the parties collected documents and deposed\n\f4                                 Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nwitnesses. In April 1997, Harris filed a lawsuit against\nUnited Fire on Talmage’s behalf in Wisconsin state court,\nasserting claims for breach of contract and bad faith. More\nthan a year later, on July 20, 1998, the parties attended\nan appraisal hearing. Rather than proceeding to the\nmerits, however, they decided to explore settlement.\nUltimately, United Fire offered to settle all of Talmage’s\noutstanding claims for an additional $114,000 over and\nabove the $309,309 it had previously advanced. Harris\nrecommended that Talmage accept this offer, even though\nit was lower than the $200,000 that Talmage believed he\nwas owed. According to Talmage, Harris assured him\nthat he could accept the $114,000 and still pursue his\nbad faith claim separately. Relying on that advice,\nTalmage took the $114,000, and the state court approved\nthe settlement.\n   Afterward, Talmage believed that Harris and his law\nfirm were pursuing the “reserved” bad faith claim. Be-\ntween September 1998 and November 2000, he called\nHarris’s office many times to inquire about the status of\nhis case, but apparently no one gave him any information.\nOnly on November 21, 2000, did Harris inform Talmage\nfor the first time that the firm was not willing to handle\nthis claim. In the meantime, the two-year statute of\nlimitations in Wisconsin for the intentional tort of bad\nfaith committed by an insurance company had expired.\nHarris did not mention this fact either in his letter to\nTalmage or otherwise. As a result of Harris’s inaction,\nTalmage was unable to pursue his bad faith claim against\nUnited Fire. He filed this malpractice action on November\n19, 2003, relying on the district court’s diversity juris-\ndiction. (By that time, Talmage was a citizen of Montana;\nHarris was a Wisconsin citizen; the firm is a “service\ncorporation” incorporated in Wisconsin with its principal\nplace of business there; and CNA Insurance (the law firm’s\ncarrier) is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal\nplace of business in Illinois.)\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                     5\n\n                             II\n  At various points before the trial, the district court\nnarrowed the scope of Talmage’s case. It ruled that\nTalmage had not pointed to enough evidence to proceed on\nhis claims for (1) additional fire loss, (2) the expenses\nallegedly due to him from interest charges that he had\npaid on his credit cards while awaiting reimbursement\nfrom United Fire, and (3) punitive damages. In the final\npre-trial order, the court rejected Talmage’s objection to\ncertain evidence relating to appraisals or valuation of the\nproperty, and it decided to grant the defendants’ request\nthat Talmage be precluded from claiming a net fire loss\nexpense of $141,036 (the difference between his alleged\nproof of loss and the amount he accepted in settlement\nfrom United Fire). Chief Judge Crabb explained that the\nonly way Talmage could prevail would be if he could have\npersuaded a jury to award him $513,000 (an amount\n$24,000 over the policy limit). She concluded that Talmage\nhad no evidence to support either that or any other\nnumber, and he had no expert testimony indicating that\nHarris’s advice to take the (net) $430,000 offered in the\nsettlement was negligent legal representation.\n  The claim that Harris committed malpractice by fail-\ning to pursue the bad faith action against United Fire went\nto trial before a jury. As the district court pointed out, in\norder to prevail Talmage had to prove first that he had a\nwinning claim against United Fire for bad faith denial of\ncoverage, and second that Harris acted improperly in\nfailing to pursue that claim. Talmage wanted to prove\nUnited Fire’s bad faith through the testimony of Russell\nBohach, a lawyer, who was prepared to testify about the\nstandard of reasonableness for handling an insurance\nclaim. The district court permitted that testimony, al-\nthough it later regretted the decision, finding in a post-\ntrial ruling that Bohach lacked sufficient knowledge of\nthe insurance industry to qualify as an expert on those\n\f6                                    Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nmatters. Nonetheless, the court also found that its error\nin permitting Bohach’s testimony was harmless, because\nthe jury was able to understand this case on its own. The\ncrux of the case, as the court saw it, was whether United\nFire reasonably believed that Talmage’s invoices were\nunreliable, and if its decision to delay additional payments\nuntil it could resolve its concerns was also justified. The\njury resolved the underlying dispute about United Fire\nas well as the malpractice claim in Talmage’s favor—\na decision that the district court refused to upset after the\ntrial.\n  Defendants were more successful in their challenge to\nthe amount of damages. The jury awarded $68,322.67 in\ndamages, which represented both the legal fees Talmage\npaid to Harris ($32,632.00) and losses Talmage suffered\nbecause of a forced sale of his business ($35,690.67). The\ndistrict court agreed with the defendants that the evidence\nwas insufficient to establish a causal link between United\nFire’s delay in payments and any decline in the value of\nTalmage’s business. (At the trial, the court had refused to\nallow Talmage to seek damages for interest he had paid\non his credit cards for the same reason.) The court accord-\ningly reduced the damages award to $32,632.00.\n\n\n                             III\n  Talmage raises a bevy of arguments on appeal, some of\nwhich relate to the pre-trial and trial rulings of the district\ncourt and others to its post-trial decisions. We address\nthem, insofar as possible, in chronological order.\n\n\n    A. Exclusion of Talmage’s claim for contract damages\n  Before the trial, the district court ruled in response to\na motion in limine filed by Harris that Talmage would not\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   7\n\nbe permitted to pursue a claim for additional losses from\nthe fire. Talmage was seeking an additional $141,036, over\nand above the interim payments and settlement payment\nhe had received from United Fire. This was essentially a\npartial summary judgment, although it was not labeled as\nsuch. We review the district court’s decision de novo. See\nRehling v. City of Chicago, 207 F.3d 1009, 1014 (7th Cir.\n2000).\n   The district court found that Talmage had not pointed\nto evidence in the record that would support a finding\nthat he would have collected any additional money at all,\nin light of the $114,000 settlement and the earlier pay-\nments. Before this court, he argues that his fire loss\nclaim had two components: damages that he sought from\nUnited Fire at the time of the appraisal proceeding, and\ndamages that were not included in the claim presented\nfor appraisal (because they dealt with United Fire’s al-\nleged bad faith). Harris argues that Talmage’s claim for\nadditional damages is precluded as a matter of law. The\nsettlement that was reached in conjunction with the\nappraisal proceeding had the effect of settling the state\ncourt action that Talmage had brought. He asserts that\nit is barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion, which\nunder Wisconsin law makes a final judgment conclusive\n“in all subsequent actions between the same parties as\nto all matters which were litigated or which might have\nbeen litigated in the former proceedings.” Lindas v. Cady,\n515 N.W.2d 458, 463 (Wis. 1994).\n  Claim preclusion, however, is not the proper doctrine for\nthis situation. To begin with, we have a different claim—\nlegal malpractice—between different parties. Although\nthe “case within a case” for Talmage’s legal malpractice\nclaim is his action against United Fire, there is no way\nthat he could have litigated his present claim against\nHarris and the law firm in that earlier case. Issue preclu-\nsion is another possibility, but under Wisconsin law that\n\f8                                  Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\ncannot apply unless “the issue or fact was actually liti-\ngated and determined in the prior proceeding by a valid\njudgment in a previous action and . . . the determination\nwas essential to the judgment.” In re Estate Rille ex rel.\nRille,728 N.W.2d 693, 702 (Wis. 2007); see also Restate-\nment (2d) of Judgments § 27 (1982). Normally, when a\ncase is resolved by settlement or stipulation, courts will\nfind that the “valid final judgment” requirement of issue\npreclusion has not been satisfied. E.g., Deminsky v.\nArlington Plastics Machinery, 657 N.W.2d 411, 428 (Wis.\n2003); see 18A Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller,\nFed. Prac. & Proc. 2d § 4443. Cf. Buckhannon Bd. and\nCare Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 600 (2001) (prevailing\nparty status for attorneys’ fees purposes not achieved by\nvoluntary change in defendant’s conduct; must have\njudgment on the merits or court-ordered consent decree).\n   Nonetheless, the fact remains that Talmage entered\ninto a contractual settlement with United Fire that\nstipulates the amount he was willing to accept for the\nfire losses. Had he not settled, he would have had to\nconvince the trier of fact in the state court action to award\nhim more than $200,000 in additional damages (thereby\ntaking his total recovery up to approximately $513,000).\nThe district court properly concluded that Talmage could\nnot satisfy this burden of proof without expert testimony.\nAs Chief Judge Crabb pointed out, a fire-damaged com-\nmercial building presents a complex valuation problem:\nwhich part of the rebuilding or replacement was necessi-\ntated by the fire; is the new structure a simple replace-\nment or is it an improvement over the old; if it is a bit of\nboth, how should the costs be allocated? Talmage’s lawyer\nconceded that he did not have this kind of evidence. He\nargued that it was unnecessary, because United Fire had\nagreed (through the inexperienced Holt) to pay him on\na time-and-materials basis. Talmage cannot mean this\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   9\n\nliterally, however: at a minimum he would have been\nlimited to reasonable expenditures and time. Had he\ndecided to replace a 2,000 square-foot business with a\n20,000 square-foot mini-mall, he would have had to bear\nmost of the additional expense. The record does not\nreveal how much of his work was required to restore the\nbusiness to its pre-fire condition and how much repre-\nsented improvements. Without that evidence, his claim\nthat the settlement was inadequate has no support and\nwas properly rejected by the district court.\n\n\n B. Exclusion of Talmage’s interest damages\n  The critical question for this part of the case is causa-\ntion. Talmage’s theory was that United Fire’s delays and\nunder-payments required him to carry large balances on\nhis credit cards, for which he paid a substantial amount of\ninterest. The only evidence Talmage offered on this point\nwas a report from his accounting expert, Kleinheiz. The\nreport displayed and quantified the interest charges that\nhe paid during the period after the shop was destroyed. It\ndoes not, however, segregate charges related to the\nreconstruction from other charges he may have incurred\nduring that period. This evidence fell so far short of\nanything revealing a causal link between the interest\npaid and United Fire’s alleged bad faith that the district\ncourt properly kept it from the jury. We see no need to\ndiscuss whether the primary failing was the lack of ex-\npert testimony or the lack of evidence, period.\n\n\n C. Admission of expert reports\n  In this instance, Talmage is complaining that the dis-\ntrict court erred by admitting certain reports, rather than\nby excluding information. Harris wanted to introduce\nseveral appraisal reports at the trial without calling\n\f10                                 Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\ntheir authors as witnesses. Talmage objected on hearsay\ngrounds. See FED. R. EVID. 801. The reports contained\nestimates by appraisers of the amount of the loss caused\nby the fire. The district court decided that the reports\ncould come in as evidence of United Fire’s state of mind.\nSee United States v. Hanson, 994 F.2d 403, 406 (7th Cir.\n1993) (“An out of court statement that is offered to\nshow its effect on the hearer’s state of mind is not hear-\nsay.”). Talmage argues that reports authored by others\ncould not show what United Fire was thinking.\n  Here again, Talmage is missing the point. The key issue\nis not the state of mind of the appraisers, which might\nhave required analysis under FED. R. EVID. 803(3), but\nthe effect of the report on United Fire’s state of mind. The\ntruth or falsity of the reports is irrelevant to the latter\nquestion, and thus they did not fall within the definition of\nhearsay in Rule 801. One contested issue was United\nFire’s “knowledge or reckless disregard of the lack of a\nreasonable basis for denying the claim.” Weiss v. United\nFire and Cas. Co., 541 N.W.2d 753, 757 (Wis. 1995). This\nis a subjective test. Id.; see also Anderson v. Continental\nIns. Co., 271 N.W.2d 368, 376 (Wis. 1978). Harris was\nentitled to introduce the expert appraisal reports to\nshow that United Fire did not have the requisite state of\nmind. If it did not, then at the secondary level Harris\nwould not have been negligent by failing to pursue the\nbad faith claim.\n\n\n  D. Bohach’s expert testimony\n  As we mentioned earlier, Talmage wanted to, and did,\npresent Attorney Russell Bohach as an expert on the ques-\ntion of bad faith in the insurance industry. Bohach, as\nthe district court recognized in its post-trial ruling, had\nextensive knowledge about the law of bad faith claims. The\nproblem was that the court concluded, after the trial was\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   11\n\nover, that it should not have qualified Bohach as an\nexpert on United Fire’s conduct because he lacked knowl-\nedge of the insurance industry and its customs and\npractices. It is more than a little odd that Talmage is\ncomplaining about this, because the jury did hear Bohach’s\ntestimony and it ruled in Talmage’s favor on the legal\nmalpractice claim (and hence on the underlying bad\nfaith claim). No relief we could order on this point would\nhelp Talmage, and we thus reject it on that basis.\n\n\n  E. Punitive damages\n  The district court decided that there was no evidence\nin the record that would have supported a punitive\ndamages award in the litigation against United Fire. We\nagree with that assessment. As the Wisconsin Supreme\nCourt observed, “[p]roof of a bad faith claim does not\nnecessarily make the award of punitive damages appro-\npriate. The intent necessary to maintain an action for\nbad faith is distinct from what must be shown to recover\npunitive damages.” Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church\nand School-Freistadt v. Tower Ins. Co., 661 N.W.2d 789,\n797 (Wis. 2003) (internal citation omitted). In order to\nrecover punitive damages, the plaintiff must show “(1) evil\nintent deserving of punishment or of something in the\nnature of special ill-will; or (2) wanton disregard of duty;\nor (3) gross or outrageous conduct.” Id.\n  There is no evidence in this record that comes close to\nany of those criteria. To the contrary, even though it may\nhave had some doubts about the case, United Fire repeat-\nedly sent checks to Talmage, up to the point where it had\npaid him almost $310,000 without a fuss. Talmage ac-\nknowledges this, of course, but he suggests that the\ncompany deliberately waited until he had expended his\nown funds repairing his shop and then it changed the\nreimbursement formula. Nothing supports this hypoth-\n\f12                                 Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nesis; United Fire’s actions are equally if not more consis-\ntent with the reason it offered, which was its growing\nconcern about over-payment. There is also no support\nfor a punitive damages award in the malpractice action.\nWhile the jury was entitled to conclude that Harris was\nnegligent in failing to warn Talmage about the expiring\nstatute of limitations on his bad faith claim, nothing in\nthe record points to the kind of evil intent, “wanton”\ndisregard, or outrageous conduct that would be necessary\nfor punitive damages.\n\n\n  F. Reduction of the jury award\n  The reason why the district court reduced Talmage’s\ndamages from $68,322.67 to $32,632 was not a general\nsense that the evidence did not support the larger amount.\nThus, this was not a remittitur, offered as an alternative\nto a grant of a new trial. It was instead a ruling as a\nmatter of law (implicitly under FED. R. CIV. P. 50(b)) that\nthe jury never should have been permitted to consider the\nelements of damage represented by the larger amount. Our\nreview is therefore de novo. See McNabola v. Chicago\nTransit Authority, 10 F.3d 501, 515 (7th Cir. 1993).\n  The $35,959.67 that the district court lopped off repre-\nsented the alleged decline in the value of Talmage’s\nbusiness caused by United Fire’s delays in reimbursing\nhim. In rejecting this after the trial, the district court\nanalogized it to the interest costs claim that it had refused\nto permit at the trial. As the court put it, “[t]he evidence\ndoes not show when the insurer’s delay in payments\namounted to bad faith, so that the jury could determine\nwhat relationship the bad faith delay had to the decline\nin value of plaintiff ’s business, as distinguished from a\ndecline attributable to delays that were reasonable.” The\nproblem, in other words, was not in the proof of how much\nvalue was lost; it was, once again, a failure to show\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   13\n\ncausation. We, too, can find nothing in the record that\nwould have permitted the jury to draw the necessary lines,\nand we therefore find no reversible error in the court’s\ndecision to limit Talmage’s damages to the fees he paid\nto Harris.\n\n\n                            IV\n   Last, we consider the issue Harris has presented in his\ncross-appeal: whether the district court erred when it\nrefused to grant his motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, which was based on Talmage’s failure to support his\nbad-faith case with expert testimony. Under Wisconsin\nlaw, in order to establish a claim for a bad-faith denial of\ncoverage or refusal to pay, an insured “must show the\nabsence of a reasonable basis for denying benefits of the\npolicy and the defendant’s knowledge or reckless dis-\nregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the\nclaim.” Weiss, 541 N.W.2d at 757 (quoting Anderson, 271\nN.W.2d at 691). Expert testimony may be relevant to the\nfirst point, but the district court concluded that it was\nnot essential.\n  Relying on Weiss, the court reasoned that “the acts and\nomissions in dispute in this case are not so esoteric that\na lay jury could not decide them.” The jury was able to\nassess whether, under all the circumstances, the insurer\nbehaved reasonably when it refused to pay Talmage the\nfull amount he was requesting for his expenses in rebuild-\ning his business premises. Harris points to no inflexible\nrule of Wisconsin law demanding expert testimony in\ncircumstances like these, and it is unclear whether such a\nlaw would bind a federal district court in any event.\nWhether the jury needs expert testimony for a particular\nclaim is a question within the district court’s discretion,\nand we see no abuse of that discretion here.\n\f14                                Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\n                        * * *\n  Finding no reversible error either in Talmage’s appeal\nor Harris’s cross-appeal, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                      ________________________________\n                      Clerk of the United States Court of\n                        Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—5-3-07\n\f",

On April 3, 1995, a fire swept\nthrough the premises of the auto repair business that John\nTalmage operated in New Richmond, Wisconsin. After he\nnotified his insurance carrier of the loss, Talmage made\nextensive repairs to the business. The present case arose\nafter the insurance company decided that it had paid\nenough, and the lawyer Talmage hired agreed to a settle-\nment of his claims against the insurer. The lawyer,\nCharles B. Harris, did not handle matters to Talmage’s\nsatisfaction, however, which led Talmage ultimately to\n\f2                                  Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nfile a legal malpractice action. The district court dis-\nmissed some claims and others went to trial before a jury,\nwhich ruled in Talmage’s favor in part and awarded him\nmodest damages. The district court reduced those damages\nfurther. On appeal, Talmage complains that the district\ncourt made a number of evidentiary errors and unduly\nrestricted his damages. Harris cross-appealed from the\ndistrict court’s refusal to order judgment as a matter of\nlaw in his favor. We conclude that the district court’s\nevidentiary rulings were within the scope of its discre-\ntion and that it did not err otherwise in its handling of\nthe case, and we therefore affirm.\n\n\n                             I\n   Talmage’s business, the Talmage Auto Center, offered\ncomplete auto services and collision repair. At the time of\nthe fire, it was insured by United Fire & Casualty Com-\npany (“United Fire”). The policy provided coverage for\nfire loss, with an aggregate limit of $489,000. The day\nafter the fire, Talmage properly notified United Fire of the\nevent. United Fire assigned an adjuster named John H.\nHolt to handle the file. Holt was new to the task: he had\nnever adjusted a claim as large as Talmage’s, nor had he\npreviously worked with a fire claim involving an auto\nrepair facility. Holt told Talmage to find a contractor to\nperform the necessary repair work, but neither Holt nor\nTalmage was able to find someone suitable. At that point,\nUnited Fire neither prepared its own estimate of the\namount of the claim nor asked a contractor to prepare\none. Talmage thought that the loss was approximately\n$527,700, including damage to the building, damage to\nbusiness personal property, loss of income, employee\ntools, and other miscellaneous items. Talmage and Holt\nagreed that Talmage and his employees would perform the\nrepair work themselves. Holt told Talmage to document\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                  3\n\nthe time that they devoted to the work and to save the\nreceipts for the materials they purchased; United Fire,\nHolt promised, would reimburse Talmage. Later, United\nFire hired an accountant, Jennifer Bestul, to review and\norganize the records that Talmage had submitted; Bestul\nrecommended that United Fire adjust the loss on a time-\nand-materials basis.\n  Although Talmage regularly submitted the time rec-\nords and receipts that were accumulating, United Fire did\nnot reimburse him in accordance with Holt’s promises.\nNevertheless, it did make significant partial payments:\nbetween April 17, 1995, and May 20, 1996, it paid him\n$309,309.66. Dissatisfied because he thought that more\nwas due, Talmage turned to Holt’s supervisor, Kelly Hart,\nbut Hart was no help. Later, United Fire removed Holt\nfrom the job and replaced him with Stan Stensrud; by this\ntime, Talmage had done enough repairs to enable him to\nreopen the business. Stensrud took a fresh look at the\nentire claim and decided, at a time when the repairs\nwere 80% complete, to change the method of calculating\nthe fire loss. Instead of a straight time-and-materials\nsystem, Stensrud decided to rely on an outside estimate.\n  In the meantime, on May 28, 1996, Talmage retained\nDoar, Drill & Skow, S.C., the law firm of attorney Charles\nHarris, to represent him in settling his claims against\nUnited Fire. On Talmage’s behalf, Harris prepared a proof\nof claim statement for United Fire that itemized the\nlosses, documented them, and presented a total claim of\n$527,701.95. With a large gap separating the parties’\nassessments of the amounts due, Talmage and United\nFire agreed to submit to an appraisal proceeding in\nDecember 1996, as required by the policy. There were\nthree appraisers—one selected by Talmage, one by United\nFire, and a third selected by the first two.\n  The appraisal proceeding dragged on for quite some\ntime, while the parties collected documents and deposed\n\f4                                 Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nwitnesses. In April 1997, Harris filed a lawsuit against\nUnited Fire on Talmage’s behalf in Wisconsin state court,\nasserting claims for breach of contract and bad faith. More\nthan a year later, on July 20, 1998, the parties attended\nan appraisal hearing. Rather than proceeding to the\nmerits, however, they decided to explore settlement.\nUltimately, United Fire offered to settle all of Talmage’s\noutstanding claims for an additional $114,000 over and\nabove the $309,309 it had previously advanced. Harris\nrecommended that Talmage accept this offer, even though\nit was lower than the $200,000 that Talmage believed he\nwas owed. According to Talmage, Harris assured him\nthat he could accept the $114,000 and still pursue his\nbad faith claim separately. Relying on that advice,\nTalmage took the $114,000, and the state court approved\nthe settlement.\n   Afterward, Talmage believed that Harris and his law\nfirm were pursuing the “reserved” bad faith claim. Be-\ntween September 1998 and November 2000, he called\nHarris’s office many times to inquire about the status of\nhis case, but apparently no one gave him any information.\nOnly on November 21, 2000, did Harris inform Talmage\nfor the first time that the firm was not willing to handle\nthis claim. In the meantime, the two-year statute of\nlimitations in Wisconsin for the intentional tort of bad\nfaith committed by an insurance company had expired.\nHarris did not mention this fact either in his letter to\nTalmage or otherwise. As a result of Harris’s inaction,\nTalmage was unable to pursue his bad faith claim against\nUnited Fire. He filed this malpractice action on November\n19, 2003, relying on the district court’s diversity juris-\ndiction. (By that time, Talmage was a citizen of Montana;\nHarris was a Wisconsin citizen; the firm is a “service\ncorporation” incorporated in Wisconsin with its principal\nplace of business there; and CNA Insurance (the law firm’s\ncarrier) is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal\nplace of business in Illinois.)\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                     5\n\n                             II\n  At various points before the trial, the district court\nnarrowed the scope of Talmage’s case. It ruled that\nTalmage had not pointed to enough evidence to proceed on\nhis claims for (1) additional fire loss, (2) the expenses\nallegedly due to him from interest charges that he had\npaid on his credit cards while awaiting reimbursement\nfrom United Fire, and (3) punitive damages. In the final\npre-trial order, the court rejected Talmage’s objection to\ncertain evidence relating to appraisals or valuation of the\nproperty, and it decided to grant the defendants’ request\nthat Talmage be precluded from claiming a net fire loss\nexpense of $141,036 (the difference between his alleged\nproof of loss and the amount he accepted in settlement\nfrom United Fire). Chief Judge Crabb explained that the\nonly way Talmage could prevail would be if he could have\npersuaded a jury to award him $513,000 (an amount\n$24,000 over the policy limit). She concluded that Talmage\nhad no evidence to support either that or any other\nnumber, and he had no expert testimony indicating that\nHarris’s advice to take the (net) $430,000 offered in the\nsettlement was negligent legal representation.\n  The claim that Harris committed malpractice by fail-\ning to pursue the bad faith action against United Fire went\nto trial before a jury. As the district court pointed out, in\norder to prevail Talmage had to prove first that he had a\nwinning claim against United Fire for bad faith denial of\ncoverage, and second that Harris acted improperly in\nfailing to pursue that claim. Talmage wanted to prove\nUnited Fire’s bad faith through the testimony of Russell\nBohach, a lawyer, who was prepared to testify about the\nstandard of reasonableness for handling an insurance\nclaim. The district court permitted that testimony, al-\nthough it later regretted the decision, finding in a post-\ntrial ruling that Bohach lacked sufficient knowledge of\nthe insurance industry to qualify as an expert on those\n\f6                                    Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nmatters. Nonetheless, the court also found that its error\nin permitting Bohach’s testimony was harmless, because\nthe jury was able to understand this case on its own. The\ncrux of the case, as the court saw it, was whether United\nFire reasonably believed that Talmage’s invoices were\nunreliable, and if its decision to delay additional payments\nuntil it could resolve its concerns was also justified. The\njury resolved the underlying dispute about United Fire\nas well as the malpractice claim in Talmage’s favor—\na decision that the district court refused to upset after the\ntrial.\n  Defendants were more successful in their challenge to\nthe amount of damages. The jury awarded $68,322.67 in\ndamages, which represented both the legal fees Talmage\npaid to Harris ($32,632.00) and losses Talmage suffered\nbecause of a forced sale of his business ($35,690.67). The\ndistrict court agreed with the defendants that the evidence\nwas insufficient to establish a causal link between United\nFire’s delay in payments and any decline in the value of\nTalmage’s business. (At the trial, the court had refused to\nallow Talmage to seek damages for interest he had paid\non his credit cards for the same reason.) The court accord-\ningly reduced the damages award to $32,632.00.\n\n\n                             III\n  Talmage raises a bevy of arguments on appeal, some of\nwhich relate to the pre-trial and trial rulings of the district\ncourt and others to its post-trial decisions. We address\nthem, insofar as possible, in chronological order.\n\n\n    A. Exclusion of Talmage’s claim for contract damages\n  Before the trial, the district court ruled in response to\na motion in limine filed by Harris that Talmage would not\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   7\n\nbe permitted to pursue a claim for additional losses from\nthe fire. Talmage was seeking an additional $141,036, over\nand above the interim payments and settlement payment\nhe had received from United Fire. This was essentially a\npartial summary judgment, although it was not labeled as\nsuch. We review the district court’s decision de novo. See\nRehling v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768159\"><a href=\"/opinion/768159/donald-rehling-v-the-city-of-chicago-a-municipal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1014 (7th Cir.\n2000).\n   The district court found that Talmage had not pointed\nto evidence in the record that would support a finding\nthat he would have collected any additional money at all,\nin light of the $114,000 settlement and the earlier pay-\nments. Before this court, he argues that his fire loss\nclaim had two components: damages that he sought from\nUnited Fire at the time of the appraisal proceeding, and\ndamages that were not included in the claim presented\nfor appraisal (because they dealt with United Fire’s al-\nleged bad faith). Harris argues that Talmage’s claim for\nadditional damages is precluded as a matter of law. The\nsettlement that was reached in conjunction with the\nappraisal proceeding had the effect of settling the state\ncourt action that Talmage had brought. He asserts that\nit is barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion, which\nunder Wisconsin law makes a final judgment conclusive\n“in all subsequent actions between the same parties as\nto all matters which were litigated or which might have\nbeen litigated in the former proceedings.” Lindas v. Cady,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2135676\"><a href=\"/opinion/2135676/lindas-v-cady/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463 (Wis. 1994).\n  Claim preclusion, however, is not the proper doctrine for\nthis situation. To begin with, we have a different claim—\nlegal malpractice—between different parties. Although\nthe “case within a case” for Talmage’s legal malpractice\nclaim is his action against United Fire, there is no way\nthat he could have litigated his present claim against\nHarris and the law firm in that earlier case. Issue preclu-\nsion is another possibility, but under Wisconsin law that\n\f8                                  Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\ncannot apply unless “the issue or fact was actually liti-\ngated and determined in the prior proceeding by a valid\njudgment in a previous action and . . . the determination\nwas essential to the judgment.” In re Estate Rille ex rel.\nRille,728 N.W.2d 693, 702 (Wis. 2007); see also Restate-\nment (2d) of Judgments § 27 (1982). Normally, when a\ncase is resolved by settlement or stipulation, courts will\nfind that the “valid final judgment” requirement of issue\npreclusion has not been satisfied. E.g., Deminsky v.\nArlington Plastics Machinery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1230399\"><a href=\"/opinion/1230399/deminsky-v-arlington-plastics-machinery/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428 (Wis.\n2003); see 18A Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller,\nFed. Prac. & Proc. 2d § 4443. Cf. Buckhannon Bd. and\nCare Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (2001) (prevailing\nparty status for attorneys’ fees purposes not achieved by\nvoluntary change in defendant’s conduct; must have\njudgment on the merits or court-ordered consent decree).\n   Nonetheless, the fact remains that Talmage entered\ninto a contractual settlement with United Fire that\nstipulates the amount he was willing to accept for the\nfire losses. Had he not settled, he would have had to\nconvince the trier of fact in the state court action to award\nhim more than $200,000 in additional damages (thereby\ntaking his total recovery up to approximately $513,000).\nThe district court properly concluded that Talmage could\nnot satisfy this burden of proof without expert testimony.\nAs Chief Judge Crabb pointed out, a fire-damaged com-\nmercial building presents a complex valuation problem:\nwhich part of the rebuilding or replacement was necessi-\ntated by the fire; is the new structure a simple replace-\nment or is it an improvement over the old; if it is a bit of\nboth, how should the costs be allocated? Talmage’s lawyer\nconceded that he did not have this kind of evidence. He\nargued that it was unnecessary, because United Fire had\nagreed (through the inexperienced Holt) to pay him on\na time-and-materials basis. Talmage cannot mean this\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   9\n\nliterally, however: at a minimum he would have been\nlimited to reasonable expenditures and time. Had he\ndecided to replace a 2,000 square-foot business with a\n20,000 square-foot mini-mall, he would have had to bear\nmost of the additional expense. The record does not\nreveal how much of his work was required to restore the\nbusiness to its pre-fire condition and how much repre-\nsented improvements. Without that evidence, his claim\nthat the settlement was inadequate has no support and\nwas properly rejected by the district court.\n\n\n B. Exclusion of Talmage’s interest damages\n  The critical question for this part of the case is causa-\ntion. Talmage’s theory was that United Fire’s delays and\nunder-payments required him to carry large balances on\nhis credit cards, for which he paid a substantial amount of\ninterest. The only evidence Talmage offered on this point\nwas a report from his accounting expert, Kleinheiz. The\nreport displayed and quantified the interest charges that\nhe paid during the period after the shop was destroyed. It\ndoes not, however, segregate charges related to the\nreconstruction from other charges he may have incurred\nduring that period. This evidence fell so far short of\nanything revealing a causal link between the interest\npaid and United Fire’s alleged bad faith that the district\ncourt properly kept it from the jury. We see no need to\ndiscuss whether the primary failing was the lack of ex-\npert testimony or the lack of evidence, period.\n\n\n C. Admission of expert reports\n  In this instance, Talmage is complaining that the dis-\ntrict court erred by admitting certain reports, rather than\nby excluding information. Harris wanted to introduce\nseveral appraisal reports at the trial without calling\n\f10                                 Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\ntheir authors as witnesses. Talmage objected on hearsay\ngrounds. See FED. R. EVID. 801. The reports contained\nestimates by appraisers of the amount of the loss caused\nby the fire. The district court decided that the reports\ncould come in as evidence of United Fire’s state of mind.\nSee United States v. Hanson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607911\"><a href=\"/opinion/607911/united-states-v-lila-d-hanson-also-known-as-diane-hanson-and-keyte/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (7th Cir.\n1993) (“An out of court statement that is offered to\nshow its effect on the hearer’s state of mind is not hear-\nsay.”). Talmage argues that reports authored by others\ncould not show what United Fire was thinking.\n  Here again, Talmage is missing the point. The key issue\nis not the state of mind of the appraisers, which might\nhave required analysis under FED. R. EVID. 803(3), but\nthe effect of the report on United Fire’s state of mind. The\ntruth or falsity of the reports is irrelevant to the latter\nquestion, and thus they did not fall within the definition of\nhearsay in Rule 801. One contested issue was United\nFire’s “knowledge or reckless disregard of the lack of a\nreasonable basis for denying the claim.” Weiss v. United\nFire and Cas. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1239835\"><a href=\"/opinion/1239835/weiss-v-united-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757 (Wis. 1995). This\nis a subjective test. Id.; see also Anderson v. Continental\nIns. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2063523\"><a href=\"/opinion/2063523/anderson-v-continental-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376 (Wis. 1978). Harris was\nentitled to introduce the expert appraisal reports to\nshow that United Fire did not have the requisite state of\nmind. If it did not, then at the secondary level Harris\nwould not have been negligent by failing to pursue the\nbad faith claim.\n\n\n  D. Bohach’s expert testimony\n  As we mentioned earlier, Talmage wanted to, and did,\npresent Attorney Russell Bohach as an expert on the ques-\ntion of bad faith in the insurance industry. Bohach, as\nthe district court recognized in its post-trial ruling, had\nextensive knowledge about the law of bad faith claims. The\nproblem was that the court concluded, after the trial was\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   11\n\nover, that it should not have qualified Bohach as an\nexpert on United Fire’s conduct because he lacked knowl-\nedge of the insurance industry and its customs and\npractices. It is more than a little odd that Talmage is\ncomplaining about this, because the jury did hear Bohach’s\ntestimony and it ruled in Talmage’s favor on the legal\nmalpractice claim (and hence on the underlying bad\nfaith claim). No relief we could order on this point would\nhelp Talmage, and we thus reject it on that basis.\n\n\n  E. Punitive damages\n  The district court decided that there was no evidence\nin the record that would have supported a punitive\ndamages award in the litigation against United Fire. We\nagree with that assessment. As the Wisconsin Supreme\nCourt observed, “[p]roof of a bad faith claim does not\nnecessarily make the award of punitive damages appro-\npriate. The intent necessary to maintain an action for\nbad faith is distinct from what must be shown to recover\npunitive damages.” Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church\nand School-Freistadt v. Tower Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1305483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1305483/trinity-evangelical-v-tower-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n797 (Wis. 2003) (internal citation omitted). In order to\nrecover punitive damages, the plaintiff must show “(1) evil\nintent deserving of punishment or of something in the\nnature of special ill-will; or (2) wanton disregard of duty;\nor (3) gross or outrageous conduct.” Id.\n  There is no evidence in this record that comes close to\nany of those criteria. To the contrary, even though it may\nhave had some doubts about the case, United Fire repeat-\nedly sent checks to Talmage, up to the point where it had\npaid him almost $310,000 without a fuss. Talmage ac-\nknowledges this, of course, but he suggests that the\ncompany deliberately waited until he had expended his\nown funds repairing his shop and then it changed the\nreimbursement formula. Nothing supports this hypoth-\n\f12                                 Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\nesis; United Fire’s actions are equally if not more consis-\ntent with the reason it offered, which was its growing\nconcern about over-payment. There is also no support\nfor a punitive damages award in the malpractice action.\nWhile the jury was entitled to conclude that Harris was\nnegligent in failing to warn Talmage about the expiring\nstatute of limitations on his bad faith claim, nothing in\nthe record points to the kind of evil intent, “wanton”\ndisregard, or outrageous conduct that would be necessary\nfor punitive damages.\n\n\n  F. Reduction of the jury award\n  The reason why the district court reduced Talmage’s\ndamages from $68,322.67 to $32,632 was not a general\nsense that the evidence did not support the larger amount.\nThus, this was not a remittitur, offered as an alternative\nto a grant of a new trial. It was instead a ruling as a\nmatter of law (implicitly under FED. R. CIV. P. 50(b)) that\nthe jury never should have been permitted to consider the\nelements of damage represented by the larger amount. Our\nreview is therefore de novo. See McNabola v. Chicago\nTransit Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658151\"><a href=\"/opinion/658151/william-mcnabola-v-chicago-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 (7th Cir. 1993).\n  The $35,959.67 that the district court lopped off repre-\nsented the alleged decline in the value of Talmage’s\nbusiness caused by United Fire’s delays in reimbursing\nhim. In rejecting this after the trial, the district court\nanalogized it to the interest costs claim that it had refused\nto permit at the trial. As the court put it, “[t]he evidence\ndoes not show when the insurer’s delay in payments\namounted to bad faith, so that the jury could determine\nwhat relationship the bad faith delay had to the decline\nin value of plaintiff ’s business, as distinguished from a\ndecline attributable to delays that were reasonable.” The\nproblem, in other words, was not in the proof of how much\nvalue was lost; it was, once again, a failure to show\n\fNos. 05-3127 & 05-3282                                   13\n\ncausation. We, too, can find nothing in the record that\nwould have permitted the jury to draw the necessary lines,\nand we therefore find no reversible error in the court’s\ndecision to limit Talmage’s damages to the fees he paid\nto Harris.\n\n\n                            IV\n   Last, we consider the issue Harris has presented in his\ncross-appeal: whether the district court erred when it\nrefused to grant his motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, which was based on Talmage’s failure to support his\nbad-faith case with expert testimony. Under Wisconsin\nlaw, in order to establish a claim for a bad-faith denial of\ncoverage or refusal to pay, an insured “must show the\nabsence of a reasonable basis for denying benefits of the\npolicy and the defendant’s knowledge or reckless dis-\nregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the\nclaim.” Weiss, 541 N.W.2d at 757 (quoting Anderson, 271\nN.W.2d at 691). Expert testimony may be relevant to the\nfirst point, but the district court concluded that it was\nnot essential.\n  Relying on Weiss, the court reasoned that “the acts and\nomissions in dispute in this case are not so esoteric that\na lay jury could not decide them.” The jury was able to\nassess whether, under all the circumstances, the insurer\nbehaved reasonably when it refused to pay Talmage the\nfull amount he was requesting for his expenses in rebuild-\ning his business premises. Harris points to no inflexible\nrule of Wisconsin law demanding expert testimony in\ncircumstances like these, and it is unclear whether such a\nlaw would bind a federal district court in any event.\nWhether the jury needs expert testimony for a particular\nclaim is a question within the district court’s discretion,\nand we see no abuse of that discretion here.\n\f14                                Nos. 05-3127 & 05-3282\n\n                        * * *\n  Finding no reversible error either in Talmage’s appeal\nor Harris’s cross-appeal, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                      ________________________________\n                      Clerk of the United States Court of\n                        Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—5-3-07\n\f</pre>",
