In our first opinion, we held that the District Court\nimproperly granted summary judgment to the Pennsylvania Milk\nMarketing Board (“Board”),1 and remanded to the District Court\nfor a trial. See Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Pa.\nMilk Mktg. Bd., 298 F.3d 201 (3d Cir. 2002) (hereafter\n“Cloverland I”). The District Court then conducted a six-day\n\n\n    1\n       Although the members of the Board have been sued\nindividually in their official capacities, we refer to them as the\n“Board”. We also note that the Pennsylvania Association of\nMilk Dealers intervened as a defendant in the District Court in\nsupport of the Board, and filed an appellee’s brief on this appeal.\nFor simplicity, we shall refer to all appellees as the “Board”.\n\n                                3\n\fbench trial and ruled in favor of the Board. We now affirm.\n\n                       I. Milk Economics\n\n       Before addressing the facts of this case, we believe it\nhelpful (if not necessary) to explain how milk pricing works.\nOn the surface, the path of milk from the cow to the consumer\nseems simple. A farmer (commonly called a “producer”) sells\nraw milk to a processor (or “handler”). The handler processes\nthe raw milk into fluid milk or other dairy products, packages it,\nand sells the product to a retailer. The retailer, in turn, sells to\nthe consumer.\n\n        Yet this apparent simplicity is deceptive. Federal and\nstate regulations regarding the sale of milk make “Byzantine” an\napt, and none too pejorative, description. See, e.g., Lansing\nDairy, Inc. v. Espy, 39 F.3d 1339, 1344 (6th Cir. 1994) (“[T]he\nsystem established by [federal law] to regulate the sale of milk\nis of labyrinthine complexity.”); Kenneth W. Bailey, Marketing\nand Pricing of Milk and Dairy Products in the United States 109\n(1997) (noting that the rules governing milk prices are “mind-\nboggling”);2 Jim Chen, Around the World in Eighty Centiliters,\n\n\n  2\n     We note that Professor Bailey testified as an expert witness\nfor the Board in the District Court. We do not, of course, cite\nhis textbook herein as a substitute for his testimony, but rather\nas a reference for the workings of the federal milk pricing\nsystem, which the parties do not dispute.\n\n                                 4\n\f15 Minn. J. Int’l L. 1, 6 (2006) (describing the federal milk\npricing structure as “outlandishly complex”).3 This complexity,\n\n   3\n      As Judge Jerome Frank of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit once observed (in terms more\ngilded than our era musters):\n\n             [T]he ‘milk problem’ is exquisitely\n             complicated. The city-dweller or\n             poet who regards the cow as a\n             symbol of bucolic serenity is\n             indeed naive. From the udders of\n             that placid animal flows a bland\n             liquid indispensable to human\n             health but often provoking as much\n             human strife and nastiness as strong\n             alcoholic beverages. . . . The[se]\n             difficulties have given rise to much\n             legislation and are reflected in\n             many judicial decisions. . . . The\n             milk problem is so vast that fully to\n             comprehend it would require an\n             almost universal knowledge\n             ranging from geology, biology,\n             chemistry and medicine to the\n             niceties of the legislative, judicial\n             and administrative processes of\n             government. It affects an industry\n             immense in scope, for dairying is\n             [one of] the largest . . . branch[es]\n             of agriculture in this country.\n\n                              5\n\fand the large sums of money at stake,4 have spawned an\nextraordinary amount of litigation. It has been estimated that\n“no other commodity in the United States has been involved in\nas many legal challenges in regard to how it is marketed” as\nmilk. Bailey, supra, at 3.\n\n       Two systems of milk price regulation concern us on this\nappeal: the federal system and Pennsylvania’s state system. We\ndescribe each in turn.\n\n       A.     Federal Milk Price Regulation\n\n              1.     Unique Nature of Milk\n\n       Milk is a unique agricultural commodity. The Supreme\nCourt has recognized “two distinctive and essential phenomena\nof the milk industry[:] a basic two-price structure that permits a\nhigher return for the same product, depending on its ultimate\nuse, and the cyclical characteristic of production.” Zuber v.\nAllen, 396 U.S. 168, 172 (1969); see also Lehigh Valley\nFarmers v. Block, 829 F.2d 409, 411 (3d Cir. 1987) (same). The\n\n\nQueensboro Farms Prods. v. Wickard, 137 F.2d 969, 974-75 (2d\nCir. 1943).\n   4\n      In 2003, for example, U.S. dairy farmers sold about 19.7\nbillion gallons of milk for more than $21 billion. Gen.\nAccounting Office, Dairy Industry: Information on Milk Prices,\nFactors Affecting Prices, and Dairy Policy Options 1 (2004).\n\n                                6\n\ffirst phenomenon derives from the fact that raw milk may be put\nto two general uses by handlers: fluid milk for drinking and\nmanufactured dairy products such as cheese, butter, and ice\ncream. See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 172. Fluid milk is more\nexpensive for handlers to produce and market because it is\nhighly perishable (a gallon of milk must ordinarily be marketed\nto the consumer within two days of milking), requires more\nsanitation and processing than other dairy products, and is\nheavier and thus more expensive to transport. See id. at 173 n.3;\nBailey, supra, at 34, 46, 109-10; Alden C. Manchester & Don P.\nBlayney, Econ. Research Serv., U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Milk\nPricing in the United States 2 (2001), available at\nhttp://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib761/aib761.pdf. Fluid\nmilk for drinking therefore costs the consumer more per pound\nthan milk that has been manufactured into other dairy products,\nand the partial inelasticity of demand for fluid milk (viewed as\na dietary staple by many Americans) means profit margins on\nfluid milk sales may also be higher. See Bailey, supra, at 34;\nsee also Smyser v. Block, 760 F.2d 514, 516 (3d Cir. 1985)\n(“Milk that is ultimately used for fluid purposes has traditionally\ncommanded a higher price than milk of the same grade and\nquality used for manufactured products. This difference is not\nentirely accounted for by differences in cost.”).\n\n      Farmers also produce two “grades” of marketable raw\nmilk. Grade A milk is fit for drinking, and therefore can be\nprocessed into fluid milk or manufactured products, while Grade\nB milk is not fit for drinking but may be used in other dairy\n\n\n                                7\n\fproducts. Manchester & Blayney, supra, at 2; David L. Baumer,\nFederal Regulation of Milk Production and Sale is Growing at\nthe Expense of State Authority, 12 J. Agric. Tax. & L. 36, 38-39\n(1990). Not surprisingly, in an entirely unregulated market,\nhandlers would have an incentive to produce manufactured dairy\nproducts using Grade B milk and reserve as much Grade A milk\nas possible for the more lucrative fluid milk market. At the\nsame time, farmers would want to be paid a higher price for\ntheir Grade A milk than for Grade B milk, but handlers would\nwant to pay less for Grade A milk they intended to put to use in\nmanufactured dairy products (i.e., surplus Grade A milk they\ncannot sell as fluid milk).\n\n       The complexity deepens when we consider the second\nphenomenon identified in Zuber: the cyclical nature of milk\nproduction. Demand for fluid milk, though somewhat inelastic\nwith respect to price, is temporally cyclic, with demand higher\nin the fall and winter months than in the spring and summer\nmonths. See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 172-73; Bailey, supra, at 34; see\nalso John R. Snyder, A Summary: Political and Economic\nAnalysis of Milk Marketing, 1980-81 Agric. L.J. 297, 310-11.\nUnfortunately, cows do not work this way, and produce more\nmilk in the spring and summer (known as the “flush” season)\nthan in the fall and winter (the “short-supply” season).\nManchester & Blayney, supra, at 2; Snyder, supra, at 310-11.\nThus, “it [is] necessary to coordinate a supply that is rising when\nfluid milk demand is falling.” Manchester & Blayney, supra, at\n2. Otherwise, handlers would attempt to “take advantage of this\n\n\n                                8\n\fsurplus to obtain bargains [from producers] during glut periods,”\nwhich would lead farmers to increase production to maintain a\nsteady income, “and the disequilibrium snowballs.” Zuber, 396\nU.S. at 173; Smyser, 760 F.2d at 516 (“In an unregulated market\n‘cutthroat’ competition for more profitable fluid milk sales can\nlead to an overall decline in prices.”); see also Bailey, supra, at\n110 (explaining that the unique characteristics of the milk\nindustry, if unregulated, lead to “chaotic marketing conditions”).\n\n              2.      The Federal System\n\n       Federal regulation of the nation’s dairy industry began in\nearnest in the 1930s, when falling prices caused by the Great\nDepression led to “utter chaos” in the milk market. Zuber, 396\nU.S. at 174. The first attempt at regulation was the Agricultural\nAdjustment Act (“AAA”) of 1933, 48 Stat. 31, which\nempowered the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate\nemergency licensing requirements in the dairy industry to\nregulate output and price. See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 174-75. The\nSupreme Court’s decision in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.\nUnited States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), however, struck down a\nsimilarly broad delegation of rulemaking authority under the\nNational Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 195, and\nCongress acted to protect regulation of the dairy market by first\namending the AAA and then enacting the Agricultural\nMarketing Agreement Act (“AMAA”) of 1937, 50 Stat. 246,\nwhich replaced the emergency measures with a permanent\nsystem of milk regulation. See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 175-76;\n\n\n                                9\n\fDefiance Milk Prods. Co. v. Lyng, 857 F.2d 1065, 1066-67 (6th\nCir. 1988).\n\n       Under the AMAA, the Secretary of Agriculture is\nempowered to regulate the nation’s milk markets by issuing\n“orders” that regulate prices in defined geographic areas. See 7\nU.S.C. § 608c(1); Defiance, 857 F.2d at 1067; Lehigh Valley,\n829 F.2d at 411. These orders are meant to ensure “a sufficient\nquantity of pure and wholesome milk to meet current needs and\nfurther to assure a level of farm income adequate to maintain\nproductive capacity sufficient to meet anticipated future needs.”\n7 U.S.C. § 608c(18). Although their number has varied over the\nyears, there are currently ten federal milk marketing order\nareas.5 See 7 C.F.R. pts. 1001-1135; U.S. Dep’t of Agric.,\n\n\n  5\n     These are the Northeast, Appalachian, Southeast, Florida,\nMideast, Upper Midwest, Central, Southwest, Arizona, and\nPacific Northwest orders.        See U.S. Dep’t of Agric.,\nConsolidated Milk Marketing Order Areas, available at\nhttp://www.ams.usda.gov/dairy/dymap.htm. There are also\nseveral parts of the country that are not regulated by a federal\norder, including parts of Idaho, New York, Pennsylvania, and\nNorth and South Dakota, and most or all of California, Maine,\nMontana, Nevada, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. Id.\n        Confusingly, the orders are often referred to by a number\nthat corresponds to the implementing regulation that defines the\norder. So, for example, the Northeast order (encompassing all\nor part of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode\nIsland, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\n\n                               10\n\fConsolidated Milk Marketing Order Areas, available at\nhttp://www.ams.usda.gov/dairy/dymap.htm.          Within these\norders, the Secretary sets prices at which raw milk may be sold.\nThere are two main features of this pricing structure that merit\nexplanation.\n\n          Handlers pay for their milk according to a classified\npricing arrangement. See 7 U.S.C. § 608c(5)(A). Grade A raw\nmilk is classified according to its end use. Class I milk is fluid\nmilk for drinking, while other classes (II, III, and IV) are\nassigned to raw milk used in various manufactured products. 7\nC.F.R. § 1000.40; see West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512\nU.S. 186, 189 n.1 (1994). It is not necessary for our purposes to\nexplain in detail the pricing mechanism for each class, see, e.g.,\n7 C.F.R. § 1000.50; we simply note that handlers pay more for\nGrade A raw milk they intend to put to use as Class I milk than\nthey do for Grade A raw milk they intend to put to use as Class\nII, III, or IV milk.6 See Lansing Dairy, 39 F.3d at 1344; Smyser,\n\n\nDelaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, as well as a\nfew counties in Northern Virginia) is defined in 7 C.F.R. part\n1001, and is known commonly as “Order 1”. The Mideast order\n(encompassing all or part of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,\nWest Virginia, and Pennsylvania) is defined in 7 C.F.R. part\n1033, and is known commonly as “Order 33”.\n    6\n      To be clear, however, the different classes are merely\nadministrative distinctions to take account of the fact that\nhandlers charge different wholesale prices for fluid milk and\n\n                               11\n\f760 F.2d at 516.\n\n        Producers do not, however, receive more or less money\nfor raw milk based on the handler’s use. Instead, producers\nreceive a uniform “blend” price that is essentially a weighted\naverage of the price of all classes of milk sold in the region. See\n7 U.S.C. 608c(5)(B); Zuber, 396 U.S. at 177; Lehigh Valley,\n829 F.2d at 411. This system “eliminate[s] the potential\nsituation where one producer, who sold milk to a fluid\nprocessor, would get a higher milk price than his neighbor who\nsold to a cheese plant.” Bailey, supra, at 113; see also Lehigh\nValley, 829 F.2d at 411-12 (“By mandating that producers\nwithin a market area receive a uniform price based on the use of\nmilk within the area, the [AMAA] eliminates the incentive for\ndairy farmers to attempt to compete with their neighbors through\nlowering their prices.”).\n\n        Of course, this would ordinarily lead to a situation in\nwhich handlers dealing mostly in lower classes of milk\nessentially subsidize those dealing mostly in Class I milk,\nbecause the blend price paid to the producer will be more than,\nsay, the classified price of Class IV milk, but lower than the\nclassified price of Class I milk. To compensate for this, the\nregulations establish a “Producer Settlement Fund,” into which\n\n\n\nmanufactured products. The raw milk is all Grade A, and is\nalike in all respects except the artificially created class\ndistinction that depends on the use to which the milk is put.\n\n                                12\n\fhandlers who have underpaid contribute an amount equal to the\ndifference between the blend price and classified price, which is\nthen distributed to handlers who have overpaid. See 7 C.F.R.\n§ 1000.70; Lansing Dairy, 39 F.3d at 1344; Smyser, 760 F.2d at\n516.\n\n       By charging handlers less for Grade A raw milk used in\nstorable dairy products like cheese and butter than for raw milk\nused as Class I drinking milk, while assuring that producers are\npaid the same no matter the use to which the raw milk is put,\nhandlers have an incentive to use surplus Grade A milk in\nmanufactured products during the glut months, and producers\nmaintain a more stable income year-round. This, in turn, guards\nagainst overproduction in the flush season. Moreover, the\nProducer Settlement Fund relieves pressures on handlers to deal\nexclusively in fluid milk to the detriment of other dairy\nproducts.\n\n       B.     Pennsylvania Milk Price Regulation\n\n       Although state control of milk markets has declined\nsignificantly in the wake of federal regulation, particularly\nthrough court challenges, it survives in a few states, including\nPennsylvania. See Bailey, supra, at 205, 210; see generally\nBaumer, supra. Parts of Pennsylvania are federally regulated —\nthe southeast and southcentral parts of the Commonwealth are\nunder the Northeast order, and the western part of the\nCommonwealth is under the Mideast order — while other parts\n\n\n                               13\n\fare not regulated by the federal system. Pennsylvania’s system\ncovers the entire Commonwealth, however.\n\n       Under Pennsylvania’s Milk Marketing Law, 31 Pa. Cons.\nStat. § 700j, the Board is granted “power to supervise,\ninvestigate and regulate the entire milk industry of th[e]\nCommonwealth, including the production, transportation,\ndisposal, manufacture, processing, storage, distribution,\ndelivery, handling, bailment, brokerage, consignment, purchase\nand sale of milk and milk products in th[e] Commonwealth.” 31\nPa. Cons. Stat. § 700j-301. The statute requires that all handlers\noperating in Pennsylvania be licensed by the Board, see id. §\n700j-401, and empowers the Board to set minimum prices paid\nto producers, handlers, and retailers to “benefi[t] . . . the public\ninterest [and] best protect the milk industry of the\nCommonwealth and insure a sufficient quantity of pure and\nwholesome milk to [its] inhabitants.” Id. § 700j-801.\n\n       In-state handlers who buy raw milk from in-state\nproducers for in-state use must pay “over-order” prices — which\ninclude a premium above the applicable Class I milk prices —\nto assure producers a “reasonable return” based on the\n“conditions affecting the milk industry in each marketing area.”7\n\n\n  7\n    According to the Board, “the state-mandated premium has\nresulted in over 335 million additional dollars being paid to\nPennsylvania farmers” since 1988. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., Fiscal\nYear Report, 2003-2004 10 (2004), available at http://\n\n                                14\n\fId.; see also id. § 700j-803 (“The [B]oard shall fix, by official\norder, the minimum prices or a formula for setting of minimum\nprices to be paid by milk dealears or handlers to producers for\nmilk or milk components sold or delivered or made available on\nconsignment or otherwise by producers to dealers or handlers.”).\nThe over-order premium only applies to sales of Class I milk.\nSee Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., Order No. A-913 (2001) (establishing\nthe method for calculating the over-order premium, and\nspecifying that the premium “shall be based on milk that is\nproduced, processed, and utilized as Class I milk in\nPennsylvania”).8\n\n       Pennsylvania also exports raw milk to other states. The\nover-order price, however, does not apply to sales to out-of-state\nhandlers.\n\n\n\nwww.mmb.state.pa.us/mmb/lib/mmb/2003-2004.pdf. From July\n2003 to June 2004, the over-order premium resulted in\nPennsylvania farmers receiving $30.8 million more than they\nwould otherwise have received. Id. at 13.\n    8\n        The Board has promulgated a complex mathematical\nformula for calculating the over-order premium. See Pa. Milk\nMktg. Bd., Order No. A-913 (2001). It is not necessary to\nexplain that process here. As of this writing, in all Pennsylvania\nmilk marketing areas handlers must add $1.60 per\nhundredweight (approximately 11.6 gallons) to the price of\nClass I milk. See Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., Order No. A-938 (2006).\n\n\n                               15\n\f        All handlers who sell milk to retailers in Pennsylvania\nmust do so at minimum wholesale prices that also guarantee a\n“reasonable return,” which state law defines as between 2.5%\nand 3.5% of net sales. 31 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 700j-801; see also id.\n§ 700j-802 (“The [B]oard shall fix, by official order . . ., the\nminimum wholesale and retail prices, and may fix, by official\norder, the maximum wholesale and retail prices, to be charged\nand received by milk dealers or handlers for milk sold,\ndelivered, handled or consigned within any milk marketing area\nof the Commonwealth.”).\n\n        The Board has divided Pennsylvania into six milk\nmarketing areas. Areas 1 and 4 (the Areas at issue in this\nappeal) consist of the counties in southeast and southcentral\nPennsylvania that are also covered by the federal Northeast\norder. Area 5 consists of the counties in western Pennsylvania\nthat are also covered by the federal Mideast order. The\nremaining Areas (2, 3, and 6) consist of the counties that are not\nregulated by the federal order system. See Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd.,\nFiscal Year Report, 2003-2004 10 (2004), available at\nhttp://www.mmb.state.pa.us/mmb/lib/mmb/2003-2004.pdf. The\nBoard sets minimum wholesale and retail prices, as well as over-\norder premiums, in each Area based on the circumstances of that\nregion, and enforces the minimum prices by regular audits of\nhandlers’ books. Id. Anyone who sells milk (raw or processed)\nat a price below the mandatory minimums set by the Board is\nsubject to criminal penalties, including fines or imprisonment.\n31 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 700j-1001 & 1002.\n\n\n                               16\n\f       The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”)\nhas identified several important differences between the\nPennsylvania system and the federal orders. First, Pennsylvania\ndivides milk into only two classes when calculating the price\nhandlers must pay, as opposed to the four classes applicable to\nprices under federal orders. See Milk in the New England and\nOther Marketing Areas, 64 Fed. Reg. 16,026, 16,056 (Apr. 2,\n1999). As in the federal system, Class I milk in Pennsylvania is\nprimarily fluid milk for drinking, but Class II milk encompasses\nall other dairy products. Second, the location where milk is\ndistributed for sale determines the applicable minimum price in\nPennsylvania, while under federal orders the price is determined\nbased on the handler’s plant location. Id. Third, blend prices\npaid to farmers under the Pennsylvania system are calculated\nbased on the individual handler’s usage, and not the use of the\nvarious milk classes in the wider market. Id.; see also 7 Pa.\nCode § 143.11 (“Dealers shall pay their producers on a weight\nand butterfat basis as determined by the utilization of the milk\nreceived at each plant or receiving station.”). This includes, of\ncourse, the over-order premium, which is added to the Class I\nprice and then (as part of the Class I price) blended with the\nClass II price to yield the handler’s “plant blend” price paid to\nits producers.\n\n              II. Facts and Procedural History\n\n       With this background in mind, we proceed to the facts of\nthis case. Appellant Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc.\n\n\n                               17\n\f(“Cloverland”) is a milk handler located in Maryland. It buys\napproximately 90% of its raw milk from Pennsylvania\nproducers, but does not sell processed fluid milk in\nPennsylvania. In March 1999, Cloverland brought suit against\nthe Board’s members in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, alleging that Pennsylvania’s milk pricing scheme\neliminates competition based on price and, as such, nullifies\nCloverland’s competitive advantages, thereby effectively\nbarring it from Pennsylvania’s market. This, it argues, violates\nthe Constitution’s dormant Commerce Clause (described in Part\nIII.A below). Three individual milk consumers in Pennsylvania\nintervened as plaintiffs in the suit, and the Pennsylvania\nAssociation of Milk Dealers intervened as a defendant in\nsupport of the minimum prices.\n\n       A.     Summary Judgment and Appeal\n\n         The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nBoard, see Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Pa. Milk\nMktg. Bd., 138 F. Supp. 2d 593 (M.D. Pa. 2001), and\nCloverland appealed. We affirmed the grant of summary\njudgment with respect to Pennsylvania’s minimum retail prices\n(i.e., prices charged to consumers, which are not at issue on this\nappeal), but reversed with respect to the minimum wholesale\nprices. Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 205. Viewing all facts in the\nlight most favorable to Cloverland — as required at that stage of\nthe proceedings, see id. — we held that a reasonable trier of fact\ncould find (on the facts presented) that Pennsylvania’s minimum\n\n\n                               18\n\fwholesale milk prices were unconstitutional, thus precluding\nsummary judgment for the Board. Specifically, we noted that\nCloverland indicated it had evidence that it could offer prices\nbelow Pennsylvania’s wholesale floor. Although, based on the\nlimited record available at that stage of the proceedings, it was\nnot entirely clear to us why Cloverland could offer lower prices,\nid. at 207, we observed that Cloverland (as an out-of-state\nhandler) is exempt from paying the over-order premium on\nClass I milk purchased from Pennsylvania producers, and thus\nits raw milk costs could be lower than similarly situated\nPennsylvania handlers. Id. at 213. As such, “a reasonable trier\nof fact could find that Pennsylvania’s minimum wholesale prices\neliminate a competitive advantage enjoyed by out-of-state\ndealers like Cloverland,” which would trigger heightened\nscrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause. Id. at 213.\nMoreover, there was no evidence (at that time) that there were\nPennsylvania firms more efficient than Cloverland, and thus the\nminimum price floors did not necessarily affect all in-state and\nout-of-state firms equally. Id.9\n\n\n  9\n      Indeed, on the facts Cloverland offered, it appeared to us\nthat “[b]y calibrating wholesale price floors for a particular milk\nmarketing area to the operating costs of average dealers in that\narea, the Commonwealth enables Pennsylvania dealers to\noperate less efficiently without fearing losses to lower-cost\ncompetitors like Cloverland. This aspect of Pennsylvania’s\nscheme appears to run afoul of the cardinal rule that states may\nnot shield in-state businesses from out-of-state competitors.”\nCloverland I, 298 F.3d at 214 n.17.\n\n                                19\n\f         Even if the District Court were to conclude that\nheightened scrutiny did not apply, we held that “the record . . .\namply supports a finding that the wholesale floors\n. . . incidentally burden interstate commerce by making it more\ndifficult for out-of-state dealers to attract new business in a\nmarket dominated by in-state dealers,” id. at 215, and thus the\nDistrict Court would have to employ the balancing test set forth\nin Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970), to determine\nwhether the burdens on interstate commerce substantially\noutweighed the putative local benefits. Cloverland I, 298 F.3d\nat 215. We held that the “the purpose asserted in the\n[Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Law’s] text deserve[d] little\ndeference” in identifying the law’s benefits because no\nPennsylvania milk processors objected to the minimum prices\n(indeed, the Pennsylvania Association of Milk Dealers\nintervened in support of the law), and the price scheme therefore\n“appear[ed] to [burden] only . . . out-of-state dealers.” Id. at\n216. Moreover, we found only “meager evidence” that the\nminimum prices were necessary to sustain Pennsylvania’s dairy\nindustry — since “the federal producer price floors [appear to]\nprovide ample protection against predatory pricing” in other\nstates, and the Pennsylvania dairy industry was quite successful\n(indeed, it exported most of its raw milk) — and thus it seemed\nto us unlikely that the minimum prices were necessary to secure\na supply sufficient to meet the needs of Pennsylvania’s\nresidents. Id. at 216-17. Moreover, the burdens on interstate\ncommerce appeared substantial: Cloverland’s stated evidence\nsuggested it was “virtually impossible to displace incumbent\n\n\n                               20\n\fdealers in Pennsylvania without offering prices below the\nBoard-mandated floors.” Id. at 217. Thus, construing all the\nfacts in the light most favorable to Cloverland, the\nCommonwealth’s minimum wholesale milk prices could fail the\nPike balancing test.\n\n       C.     Second District Court Proceeding\n\n       On remand, the District Court permitted full discovery\nand held a bench trial at which numerous witnesses testified.\nBased on this evidence, the Court made detailed findings of fact\nthat largely contradicted the facts (viewed in the light most\nfavorable to Cloverland) on which we relied in our earlier\ndecision. The District Court found that Cloverland — which,\nagain, buys about 90% of its raw milk from Pennsylvania\nsuppliers — purchases about 35% of this milk from dairy farm\ncooperatives, which negotiate prices with Cloverland equal to\nthe over-order price charged to Pennsylvania processors.\nCloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd.,\nNo. 1:CV-99-487, slip op. at 5 (M.D. Pa. 2005) (hereafter\n“Cloverland II”). The other 65% is purchased from independent\nPennsylvania farmers, who do not charge the over-order\npremium to Cloverland because, as an out-of-state handler, it is\nexempt. Id. at 6. The Board nonetheless offered expert\ntestimony that Cloverland actually had higher raw milk costs\nand was less efficient than three of four sample dairies, which\nthe Court accepted because Cloverland did not produce\n\n\n\n                              21\n\fsufficient countervailing evidence.10 Id. at 6, 15. Thus, the\nCourt found that “[a]lthough Cloverland can sell milk at a cost\nbelow the minimum wholesale price floor established by the\nBoard, Cloverland does not have an out-of-state price or\nefficiency comparative advantage.” Id. at 6.\n\n       Indeed, the Court concluded that, even if Cloverland’s\nexemption from the over-order premium conferred an advantage\nbecause it is an out-of-state firm, that advantage “arises from the\nvery Milk Law pricing structure [Cloverland] seeks to partially\ninvalidate,” and thus, if Cloverland’s suit were successful, its\nadvantage would be “ephemeral.” Id. at 16. In the Court’s\nview, the invalidation of the wholesale price would necessarily\nlead to the abandonment of the over-order premium, which\nwould make it economically unfeasible for small dairy farms to\nremain in business and thus would force them into cooperatives\n(which negotiate prices with out-of-state processors equal to the\nover-order price). Id. at 15-16.\n\n       The District Court also found that, although “[m]ost\nprocessors sell at or around the wholesale floor price, [thus]\nprecluding appreciable amounts of competition based upon\nprice,” id. at 6-7, Cloverland failed to show that competition on\nnon-price factors did not exist. Indeed, the Court found\n\n\n  10\n       The District Court expressly found the Board’s expert on\nmilk pricing to be more credible than Cloverland’s. Cloverland\nII, slip op. at 6 n.4.\n\n                                22\n\f“competition among processors in quality, service, and the\nability to bundle the delivery of non-milk based drinks,” and\n“[a]lthough price is a significant factor in competing for\nbusiness within the Pennsylvania dairy market, twice as many\nretailers choose name recognition as the number one factor\ninforming their choice of supplier.” Id. at 7. Thus, even if\nCloverland could compete on the basis of price, the Court found\nthat it failed to prove it could penetrate the Pennsylvania market.\nId.11 Indeed, the Court noted that Cloverland only attempted\n\n\n   11\n       At one point in its opinion, the District Court stated that\n“Cloverland has established that it can compete with\nPennsylvania dealers only by selling milk at prices below the\nwholesale milk floor,” Cloverland II, slip op. at 7 (emphasis\nadded), but we do not believe the Court meant what it literally\nsaid. In the same paragraph, the Court explained that robust\ncompetition exists in the Pennsylvania market on a variety of\nnon-price factors, and “even were Cloverland able to establish\nthat it could sell milk for the lowest price, [it] would not enjoy\na competitive advantage that would enable it to penetrate the\nPennsylvania dairy market.” Id. (emphasis added). The Court\nexpressly found “that the minimum price floor does not have the\npractical effect of preventing Cloverland from entering the\nPennsylvania milk market,” id. (emphasis added), and later\nobserved that Cloverland “offered no credible evidence that it\ncould in fact compete in the Pennsylvania marketplace, absent\nof the Milk law.” Id. at 20.\n        Under these circumstances, we are confident that the\nDistrict Court, by typographical error or otherwise, misstated the\nintended proposition when it said Cloverland did establish the\n\n                                23\n\f(and failed) to solicit business from three retailers in Area 4 and\nnone in Area 1, and provided no evidence that these retailers\nrejected it because of price. Id. at 6, 20.\n\n        Thus, the District Court concluded that Cloverland failed\nto prove that the Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Law nullified\nany competitive advantage it enjoyed by virtue of being an out-\nof-state firm, and thus heightened scrutiny did not apply.\n\n       The Court then considered whether the minimum pricing\nscheme’s incidental burdens on interstate commerce\nsubstantially outweighed the putative local benefits, as required\nby the Pike balancing test. It concluded that minimum\nwholesale prices confer substantial benefits on Pennsylvania’s\ndairy industry, because the federal minimums “ha[ve] not\nadequately guaranteed enough income to protect Pennsylvania\ndairy farms since 1988,” when federal deregulation lowered the\nminimums. Id. at 8, 26. Minimum wholesale prices allow\nhandlers a sufficient return to enable them to pay the over-order\npremium, which in turn allows Pennsylvania’s independent\ndairy farms to survive. Id. at 8, 24. Based largely on evidence\nproduced at trial regarding the abolition of minimum prices in\nCalifornia, the District Court concluded that if Pennsylvania’s\nmarket were dominated by a few large players, “[c]onsumer\nprices would fall in the short term, but rise heavily in the long\nterm.” Id. at 9, 25. And, if small farms went out of business,\n\n\nvery thing it repeatedly explained Cloverland did not establish.\n\n                                24\n\fthe Court concluded that the “agricultural infrastructure” that\nsupports the dairy industry — including “dealers, feed stores,\nveterinarians, and other business[es]” — might suffer.12 Id. at\n9, 26.\n\n        In contrast, the Court found only incidental burdens on\ninterstate commerce: the minimum prices simply placed\nCloverland on the same footing as every other handler doing\nbusiness in Pennsylvania, did not prevent interstate competition\non non-price factors, and the dominance of incumbent handlers\ncould be attributed to Pennsylvania retailers’ preference for\ndoing business with local handlers “independent of regulatory\npressures.” Id. at 22. Thus, the Court held that, under the Pike\ntest, Cloverland failed to prove a violation of the dormant\nCommerce Clause, and granted judgment in the Board’s favor.\nCloverland appeals.13\n\n\n  12\n     These conclusions were based largely on the testimony of\nthe Board’s experts, which the District Court expressly found\nmore credible than Cloverland’s expert. Cloverland II, slip op.\nat 27.\n  13\n     The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this\ncase pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332, and we have\njurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our\nreview of the District Court’s decision is subject to familiar\nstandards: we review findings of fact for clear error (meaning\nwe will reverse only if we are “left with a definite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed”), and exercise\n\n                               25\n\f                          III. Analysis\n\n         Cloverland raises two issues on appeal. It contends its\ncompetitive advantages require heightened scrutiny, regardless\nwhether those advantages derive from its status as an out-of-\nstate firm, and that the mandatory minimum wholesale prices are\nthe only reason it cannot compete in the Pennsylvania market.\nEven if heightened scrutiny does not apply, Cloverland argues\nthat under the Pike test the burdens on interstate commerce\nclearly outweigh any putative benefits.\n\n       A.     The Dormant Commerce Clause\n\n       Under the federal Constitution’s Commerce Clause,\nCongress has explicit power to “regulate Commerce . . . among\nthe several States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. This clause\nalso has an implied requirement (often called the “negative” or\n“dormant” aspect of the clause) that states not “mandate\ndifferential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic\ninterests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.”\nGranholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 472 (2005) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at\n192-93 (same). Under the dormant Commerce Clause, it is\n“[a]xiomatic . . . that a state cannot impede free market forces to\nshield in-state businesses from out-of-state competition.”\n\n\nplenary review over legal conclusions. Gordon v. Lewiston\nHosp., 423 F.3d 184, 201 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\n                                26\n\fCloverland I, 298 F.3d at 210. This includes “forcing [out-of-\nstate businesses] to ‘surrender whatever competitive advantages\nthey may possess’” as the price of doing business in the state.\nId. (quoting Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State Liquor\nAuth., 476 U.S. 573, 580 (1986)).\n\n       In considering whether a state law violates the dormant\nCommerce Clause, the inquiry is twofold: a court considers first\nwhether “heightened scrutiny” applies, and, if not, then\nconsiders whether the law is invalid under the Pike balancing\ntest. See, e.g., Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 210-11.\n\n       Heightened scrutiny applies when a law “discriminates\nagainst interstate commerce” in its purpose or effect. C & A\nCarbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 390 (1994);\nHarvey & Harvey, Inc. v. County of Chester, 68 F.3d 788, 797-\n98 (3d Cir. 1995).14 The party challenging the statute has the\nburden of proving the existence of such discrimination, Harvey\n& Harvey, 68 F.3d at 802, and the burden then shifts to the state\nto prove that “the statute serves a legitimate local purpose, and\nthat this purpose could not be served as well by available\nnondiscriminatory means.” Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138\n(1986); Harvey & Harvey, 68 F.3d at 797 (same). This standard\n\n\n   14\n       Notably, “in order to find a dormant Commerce Clause\nviolation there is no requirement that discrimination must be the\n‘primary’ purpose or effect” of the challenged state law. Harvey\n& Harvey, 68 F.3d at 803.\n\n                               27\n\frenders all but the most unusual statute invalid. Carbone, 511\nU.S. at 393; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 579 (“When a state\nstatute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate\ncommerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic\ninterests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck\ndown the statute without further inquiry.”); Cloverland I, 298\nF.3d at 210-11; see also Harvey & Harvey, 68 F.3d at 797\n(referring to this standard as “strict scrutiny”).\n\n        There are two general types of discrimination that a\nplaintiff may show to trigger heightened scrutiny (although they\nare not entirely distinct, and overlap in many ways). First, it\nmay show that the challenged state statute has extraterritorial\neffects that adversely affect economic production (and hence\ninterstate commerce) in other states, thereby forcing “producers\nor consumers in other States [to] surrender whatever competitive\nadvantages they may possess” to “give local consumers an\nadvantage over consumers in other states.” Brown-Forman, 476\nU.S. at 580; see Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511,\n521, 527 (1935) (“New York has no power to project its\nlegislation into Vermont by regulating the price to be paid in\nthat state for milk acquired there,” because such regulation\n“set[s] up what is equivalent to a rampart of customs duties\ndesigned to neutralize advantages belonging to the place of\norigin.”).\n\n      Second, it may show that the “object [of the law] is local\neconomic protectionism,” in that it disadvantages out-of-state\n\n\n                              28\n\fbusinesses to benefit in-state ones. Carbone, 511 U.S. at 390;\nsee West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 194-96 (holding that a\nMassachusetts state law requiring milk processors, including\nout-of-state firms, to pay a premium to a state fund that was then\ndisbursed only to in-state producers was “effectively a tax which\nmakes milk produced out-of-state more expensive,” thus\ndiscriminating against out-of-state milk); Hunt v. Wash. State\nApple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 351-53 (1977)\n(overturning a North Carolina statute that forbade importing\napples bearing a quality mark other than one issued by the\nUSDA, because Washington’s apples bore a state quality mark\nand thus “the statute’s consequence [is] raising the costs of\ndoing business in the North Carolina market for Washington\napple growers and dealers, while leaving those of their North\nCarolina counterparts unaffected”); Polar Ice Cream &\nCreamery Co. v. Andrews, 375 U.S. 361, 375-77 (1964)\n(holding that a Florida statute requiring in-state milk processors\nto purchase raw milk from in-state producers unlawfully\ndiscriminated against interstate commerce).15\n\n\n   15\n      The Board argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v.\nWalsh, 538 U.S. 644 (2003), stands for the proposition that two\n“separate and distinct” types of heightened scrutiny analysis\nexist (extraterritorial effect and discrimination), and that\n“extraterritorial effect” cases like Baldwin and Brown-Forman\nare not relevant to “discrimination” cases like Carbone and\nHarvey, and vice versa. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd. Br. at 49-51.\n       The Board substantially overreads Pharmaceutical\n\n                               29\n\f        In deciding whether a state law discriminates against out-\nof-state businesses, it is immaterial whether the statute or\nordinance also burdens some in-state businesses. See Carbone,\n511 U.S. at 391 (“The ordinance is no less discriminatory\nbecause in-state or in-town processors are also covered by the\nprohibition.”); Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 214 (noting that\nCarbone “‘explicitly rejected the argument that a disputed\nstatute would have to favor all in-state businesses as a group —\n\n\nResearch. The Supreme Court discussed the “extraterritorial\neffect” cases apart from other discrimination cases only because\nthe petitioner framed its argument that way. See Pharm.\nResearch, 538 U.S. 669-70. Nowhere did the Supreme Court\nsuggest that the two lines of cases are mutually exclusive;\nindeed, so-called “discrimination” cases like Carbone, West\nLynn Creamery, and Washington State Apple rely heavily on\nso-called “extraterritorial effect” cases like Baldwin, and vice\nversa. As we noted in Cloverland I, both types of cases may\nshare the common element of “state laws that are facially neutral\nbut have the effect of eliminating a competitive advantage\npossessed by out-of-state firms, [thus] trigger[ing] heightened\nscrutiny.” 298 F.3d at 211 (citing Wash. State Apple, 432 U.S.\n333, and Baldwin, 294 U.S. 511); see also id. at 212 n.14\n(“[T]he problem with the law invalidated in Baldwin was not\nmerely its extraterritorial reach, but that it had the practical\neffect of discriminating against out-of-state milk producers by\neliminating their competitive advantage.”). Thus, while it may\nsometimes be useful to consider the two types of cases\nseparately for ease of analysis, they are actually just two forms\nof discrimination, with significant overlap.\n\n                               30\n\fa statute may be invalid if it favors only a single or finite set of\nbusinesses’” (quoting Harvey & Harvey, 68 F.3d at 798)).\n\n        If the plaintiff does not succeed in showing that the\npurpose or effect of the state law discriminates against interstate\ncommerce — but, rather, the statute “regulates even-handedly\nto effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on\ninterstate commerce are only incidental” — the court must\ndetermine whether “the burden imposed on such commerce is\nclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.” Pike,\n397 U.S. at 142; Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 211 (same). This\nbalancing test is significantly less restrictive of state laws than\nheightened scrutiny.\n\n       Often, “there is no clear line separating the category of\nstate regulation that is virtually per se invalid under the\nCommerce Clause, and the category subject to the Pike v. Bruce\nChurch balancing approach.” Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 579;\nsee Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 211 (“[S]ometimes the distinction\nbetween state laws subject only to Pike balancing and those that\nare nearly per se invalid is ‘hazy.’”). In determining whether\nheightened scrutiny should be applied instead of the Pike test,\n“the critical consideration is the overall effect of the statute on\nboth local and interstate activity,” Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at\n579, with special attention paid to whether a “facially neutral”\nstate law “ha[s] the effect of eliminating a competitive\nadvantage possessed by out-of-state firms” (which “trigger[s]\nheightened scrutiny”). Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 211.\n\n\n                                31\n\f        B.     Heightened Scrutiny\n\n         Cloverland’s argument against the District Court’s\nheightened scrutiny analysis may be distilled as follows. The\nDistrict Court concluded that Cloverland has some advantages\nover some Pennsylvania firms — it is more efficient than some,\nit sells milk in Maryland for less than the minimum wholesale\nprices that exist in Pennsylvania, and its exemption from the\nover-order premium for raw milk purchased from independent\nPennsylvania dairy farmers means its raw milk costs might\ntheoretically be lower than its Pennsylvania competitors’ costs.\nAlthough these advantages may not derive necessarily from\nCloverland’s status as an out-of-state handler,16 the argument\nproceeds, there is no question that Pennsylvania’s minimum\nprices level the playing field with Pennsylvania firms that have\nhigher costs and are less efficient, thus nullifying Cloverland’s\nalleged competitive advantages. Since it is an out-of-state firm,\nCloverland contends the pricing scheme necessarily restrains\ninterstate commerce. Moreover, it asserts that Pennsylvania’s\nin-state processors are so entrenched (we noted previously that\n“in-state dealers dominate the wholesale milk market in\nPennsylvania,” Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 217), other means of\ncompetition are so lacking, and the wholesale minimums are set\nso high (such that they effectively set the actual price for all\n\n\n   16\n      Cloverland’s exemption from the over-order premium is\ndue to its status as an out-of-state firm, but it argues this fact is\nnot relevant to the heightened scrutiny analysis.\n\n                                 32\n\fhandlers), that no out-of-state firm can compete in the\nPennsylvania market without offering a lower price. As we\nsummarized the argument, “[p]reventing dealers from attracting\ncustomers by offering lower prices . . . helps in-state dealers\nmaintain their traditional hegemony.” Id.\n\n              1.     Must a Competitive Advantage Arise from\n                     Cloverland’s Status as an Out-of-State\n                     Firm?\n\n\n\n\n        Although Cloverland’s arguments were persuasive on the\nlimited facts (construed in Cloverland’s favor) available in\nCloverland I, they are less compelling in light of the factual\nrecord developed at trial. As a starting point, we note that\nCloverland is incorrect that, at least on the facts of this case,\nstate regulations that nullify a competitive advantage unrelated\nto the firm’s out-of-state status may nonetheless, on their own,\ntrigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n        As the District Court framed the issue, “courts have\nstruggled with . . . the difficulty in examining laws which do not\nfacially discriminate against out-of-state interests under\n[d]ormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. When does a\nsimple economic advantage rise to the level of [a] competitive\nadvantage, within the heightened scrutiny context?” Cloverland\nII, slip op. at 16-17. The Supreme Court has never expressly\n\n\n                               33\n\faddressed this issue, but it has often stated that a state law that\n“cause[s] local goods to constitute a larger share, and goods with\nan out-of-state source to constitute a smaller share, of the total\nsales in the market” is unconstitutional “because it, like a tariff,\n‘neutraliz[es] advantages belonging to the place of origin.’”\nWest Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 196 (quoting Baldwin, 294\nU.S. at 527) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis\nadded); Polar Ice Cream, 375 U.S. at 377 (same with respect to\na Florida law barring in-state handlers from buying raw milk\nfrom out-of-state producers); see also Wash. State Apple, 432\nU.S. at 351 (noting that a North Carolina statute forbidding\nimporting apples with a non-USDA quality mark “has the effect\nof stripping away from the Washington apple industry the\ncompetitive and economic advantages it has earned for itself\nthough its expensive inspection and grading system”).\n\n       We have observed that “[t]he Supreme Court’s opinions\nin Baldwin and Washington State Apple show that if a state\nregulation has the effect of protecting in-state businesses by\neliminating a competitive advantage possessed by their out-of-\nstate counterparts, heightened scrutiny applies. . . . [Here,] a\nreasonable trier of fact could find that Pennsylvania’s minimum\nwholesale prices eliminate a competitive advantage enjoyed by\nout-of-state dealers like Cloverland.” Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at\n212-13. By referencing a “competitive advantage enjoyed by\nout-of-state dealers” not shared by in-state dealers, we presumed\nthe advantage would have something to do with the out-of-state\nstatus of the advantaged firms.\n\n\n                                34\n\f         Cloverland argues, however, that it need not prove a cost\nadvantage linked to its place of origin. It contends that the mere\nfact it has some efficiency advantage (for whatever reason) over\nat least one in-state firm means it can sell milk for less, and\nbecause Pennsylvania’s minimum wholesale prices nullify its\nability to do so, they render meaningless its efficiency advantage\nand thus trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n        The ramifications of this argument are expansive.\nCloverland’s proposed rule would eviscerate longstanding\nSupreme Court precedent that “price regulation [is not] an\nimpermissible burden upon commerce” where “the burden on\ncommerce is indirect and only incidental to the regulation of an\nessentially local activity,” Polar Ice Cream, 375 U.S. at 378\n(citing Milk Control Bd. of Pa. v. Eisenberg Farm Prods., 306\nU.S. 346 (1939), and Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, 300 U.S.\n608 (1937)) — subject, of course, to the Pike balancing test.\nSee Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 215-16. As the District Court\nnoted, in any state with minimum price regulations, there will\nalways be some out-of-state competitors (like Cloverland) that\nhave some advantages over at least one in-state firm, even\nthough those advantages may reflect differences in capacity,\nefficiency, workers, etc., that have nothing to do with the firm’s\nlocation (and indeed are shared with many in-state firms). See\nCloverland II, slip op. at 16-17, 19. Thus, under Cloverland’s\nproposed rule, state milk price regulations will always be subject\nto heightened scrutiny (and thus nearly per se invalid), despite\nthe fact we and the Supreme Court have clearly recognized this\n\n\n                               35\n\fis not always the case. If the neutralization of any advantage\npossessed by any out-of-state firm were enough to trigger\nheightened scrutiny, it is difficult to think of a state pricing\nregulation that could survive.\n\n       The elimination of a particular competitive advantage\nbelonging to the place of origin is not, of course, a determinative\ninquiry in every case. For example, where a state statute\nimposes an outright ban on competition by reserving all business\nfor an in-state firm or firms and explicitly barring interstate\ncommerce, see Carbone, 511 U.S. at 391-93; Polar Ice Cream,\n375 U.S. at 376-77, or targets out-of-state firms for special\nburdens from which in-state firms are exempt, see West Lynn\nCreamery, 512 U.S. at 194-95; Wash. State Apple, 432 U.S. at\n350-51, the problem is more blatant: the out-of-state firms are\nsubjected to overt discrimination or an outright ban on\ncompetition. But Cloverland does not allege those barriers here.\nRather, it alleges more subtle discrimination, stemming from a\nlaw and regulatory scheme that are not facially discriminatory.\nHence, a nexus between the advantage that has been neutralized\nand the firm’s out-of-state status is necessary.\n\n      We therefore hold that, if Cloverland is to succeed in\ndemonstrating that heightened scrutiny applies because its\ncompetitive advantages have been neutralized by the\nPennsylvania Milk Marketing Law, it must establish that those\nadvantages arise by virtue of its out-of-state status.\n\n\n\n                                36\n\f             2.     Does Cloverland Have an Out-of-State\n                    Competitive Advantage?\n\n      The question becomes, then, whether the Pennsylvania\nMilk Marketing Law operates to neutralize competitive\nadvantages belonging to Cloverland’s place of origin. The\nrecord reveals only one such potential advantage vis-a-vis\nCloverland’s Pennsylvania competitors — its potential raw milk\ncost advantage due to its exemption from the over-order\npremium.\n\n                    a.     Legal Errors in the District Court’s\n                           Analysis\n\n      We note at the outset two legal errors in the District\nCourt’s opinion that cannot form the basis for a determination\nof whether Cloverland’s exemption from the over-order\npremium should trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n                           (1)     Nexus Between the\n                                   Challenged State Law and\n                                   Cloverland’s Advantage\n\n       We are unpersuaded by the District Court’s reasoning\nthat because Cloverland’s exemption arises from Pennsylvania\nlaw, any cost advantage it has is “ephemeral” — the argument\nbeing that if the minimum wholesale prices were invalidated (as\nCloverland desires), its purported raw milk cost advantage\n\n\n                              37\n\fwould disappear because the over-order premium would no\nlonger be viable. We assume, without deciding, that if the\nminimum wholesale prices themselves conferred an advantage\non Cloverland due to its out-of-state status, it could not rely on\nthat advantage to challenge those prices because invalidating the\nprices would necessarily nullify the advantage (though, of\ncourse, Cloverland would have no incentive to challenge the\nprices in that event). Here, however, Cloverland’s purported\ncost advantage arises from the operation of a different aspect of\nthe regulatory scheme — the over-order premium — that is not\nchallenged in this suit.\n\n        The District Court concluded, based on the Board’s\nevidence, that if the minimum wholesale prices were\ninvalidated, the over-order premium would fall. But this is not\na question susceptible to definitive proof by the Board’s experts.\nIt may well be that invalidating the minimum wholesale prices\nwould place pressure on the Commonwealth’s legislature to\nrepeal the over-order premium or extend it to out-of-state\npurchasers (both of which would nullify Cloverland’s supposed\nadvantage). The cost disadvantage to Pennsylvania handlers of\npaying the over-order premium and then competing against out-\nof-state handlers without the protection of minimum wholesale\nprices might make the over-order premium less feasible or\nencourage them to purchase out-of-state milk to avoid the\npremium. But we note that, under the current system,\nPennsylvania handlers already have an incentive to purchase\nout-of-state milk to maximize their profit margins, yet the over-\n\n\n                               38\n\forder premium remains strong. Moreover, even assuming\nPennsylvania could constitutionally impose over-order\npremiums on sales of milk to out-of-state purchasers (an issue\nwe do not decide here), doing so would presumably damage the\nCommonwealth’s ability to export milk by essentially adding a\nsurcharge on exports. And the Board has gone to great lengths\n(as explained below) to demonstrate several legal options\nhandlers use to sell milk at below minimum wholesale prices in\nPennsylvania, which suggests that invalidating the minimum\nwholesale prices would not necessarily harm the handlers’\nability to pay the over-order premium to producers.\n\n       If the minimum wholesale prices were invalidated, the\nPennsylvania legislature would be faced with these thorny\npolicy questions and would have to weigh the competing\nconsiderations to determine whether the over-order premium\nprovisions of 31 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 700j remain viable. There is\nsimply no way to determine, at this stage, whether the over-\norder premium would necessarily be repealed or extended to\nout-of-state purchasers of Pennsylvania milk. At best, the\nBoard’s evidence and the District Court’s opinion establish that\nsuch an event would be likely. We hold, though, that the\npossible removal of Cloverland’s purported out-of-state\nadvantage if it is successful on this appeal is insufficient to\nrender that advantage irrelevant to our heightened scrutiny\nanalysis.\n\n                            (2)    Availability of Non-Price\n\n\n                              39\n\f                                     Competition\n\n       We also are unpersuaded by the District Court’s reliance\non the availability of non-price competition in the Pennsylvania\nmarket. As we explain below, if Cloverland proves that its\nexemption from the over-order premium confers a cost\nadvantage over Pennsylvania handlers that is neutralized by the\nCommonwealth’s minimum wholesale prices, heightened\nscrutiny applies. The fact that Cloverland might be able to\ncompete for some retailer accounts on non-price bases is\nirrelevant, because even if there are other potential paths into the\nPennsylvania market that may allow an out-of-state handler\nsuccessfully to obtain some business, neutralizing an out-of-\nstate price advantage alone offends the dormant Commerce\nClause (especially since the record amply demonstrates that\nprice is — or, at least, would be if competition on price were\nallowed — an important factor retailers consider in choosing a\nsupplier). See Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 455\n(1992) (holding that a state may not insulate part of its market\nfrom out-of-state competition while leaving other parts open,\nbecause this “measures only the extent of the discrimination; it\nis of no relevance to the determination whether a State has\ndiscriminated against interstate commerce”).17\n\n\n   17\n      Indeed, the Board’s argument (which the District Court\naccepted) is similar conceptually to the one advanced\nunsuccessfully by the State of Oklahoma in Wyoming. There,\nOklahoma argued that it “set[] aside only a ‘small portion’ of the\n\n                                40\n\f       If Cloverland proves its Maryland residency confers a\ncost advantage it wishes to exploit in the Pennsylvania market,\nbut Pennsylvania law neutralizes that advantage (and thus\nunlawfully shields in-state handlers from price competition),\nheightened scrutiny will apply regardless of the existence of\nother competitive means that Pennsylvania has not neutralized.\nIn demonstrating that heightened scrutiny should apply to a state\nlaw, a plaintiff like Cloverland need only prove that its out-of-\nstate residency confers competitive advantages that are\nneutralized by the state law under review, thus preventing\ncompetition in the area in which the plaintiff enjoys an\nadvantage. The plaintiff need not prove it is prevented from\nentering the market through competition on all possible bases.\n\n\n\nOklahoma coal market” for in-state coal producers, “without\nplacing an ‘overall burden’ on out-of-state coal producers doing\nbusiness in Oklahoma.” Wyoming, 502 U.S. at 455. Here, the\nBoard essentially contends there is no “overall burden” on\nhandlers (including out-of-state handlers) because they may\ncompete for business on non-price factors, even though at least\npart of the market would surely be more receptive to Cloverland\nif it were allowed to exploit its alleged out-of-state cost\nadvantage to offer a lower price on wholesale milk. The fact\nthat Cloverland may compete on bases in which it does not\nenjoy an advantage (and on which it would, therefore, have\nconsiderable difficulty displacing an incumbent handler from an\nestablished account with a retailer, especially a retailer that is\nprimarily concerned with price) resolve the constitutional\nproblem.\n\n                               41\n\f                     b.     Factual Support for District Court’s\n                            Decision\n\n        Notwithstanding these errors in the District Court’s\nanalysis, we conclude it was not clearly erroneous for the Court\nto find that Cloverland did not sustain its burden of proving an\nactual raw milk cost advantage belonging to its place of origin.\nCloverland’s proof of its alleged cost advantage consisted\nprimarily of testimony from Lawrence Webster, Cloverland’s\ngeneral manager, and Robert Havemeyer, a management\nconsultant who testified as an expert in the costs of processing\nand delivering milk. Webster testified that, by not adding the\nover-order premium to the 65% of raw milk it purchases from\nindependent Pennsylvania farmers, Cloverland saves about five\ncents per gallon, which would allow Cloverland to lower its\nwholesale prices enough to gain a significant price advantage\nover Pennsylvania competitors. Havemeyer testified that, based\non a survey of Cloverland’s costs during a 13-week period in the\nfall of 1998 (when demand was at its peak), and updated in\n2002, Cloverland’s variable costs (i.e., costs that vary with the\nvolume of production) allowed it to sell its milk in Pennsylvania\nbelow wholesale minimum prices.\n\n       Notably absent from Cloverland’s offer of proof,\nhowever, was any comparison to actual Pennsylvania\ncompetitors’ costs, despite the fact this was crucial to\ndemonstrating a cost advantage vis a vis those competitors. At\nmost, Cloverland proved it was capable of selling milk for less\n\n\n                               42\n\fthan the wholesale minimum, but (as explained above) this is\nnot in itself sufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n        Carl Herbein, who testified for the Board as an expert in\nmilk cost accounting, conducted the comparison with\nPennsylvania handlers that Cloverland’s expert did not, and\nconcluded that Cloverland’s total costs rendered it less efficient\nthan three of the four sample handlers. Herbein explained, and\nthe District Court agreed, that Havemeyer’s calculations were\nunreliable because they used an unreasonably small time frame,\nrelied only on Cloverland’s variable costs (rather than looking\nat total costs),18 and considered a time when demand was at its\n\n\n    18\n          We observed in Cloverland I that, based solely on\nCloverland’s evidence, it appeared that “fixing prices based on\naverage total costs” — which includes variable costs and fixed\ncosts “such as equipment, office space, and other ‘overhead’\nexpenses” — “significantly increases dealers’ profits because it\nwill be in their economic interest to sell additional units of milk\nat any price above their average variable costs, even if below\ntheir total costs. Outside Pennsylvania, in contrast, milk dealers\ngenerally offer prices based on their average variable costs.”\n298 F.3d at 208. Herbein and Havemeyer presented conflicting\nevidence on this point at trial, and the District Court agreed with\nHerbein that an analysis of total costs is necessary to take into\naccount fully the costs of production. Since this conclusion is\nsupported by Herbein’s testimony, and Cloverland has not\nshown that the testimony is demonstrably untrue, the District\nCourt’s conclusion is not clearly erroneous.\n\n                                43\n\fpeak rather than a period representative of the full year.\nHerbein, and other witnesses offered by the Board, also\nexplained that the cost advantage resulting from Cloverland’s\nexemption from the over-order premium vis a vis a particular\nPennsylvania competitor may be mitigated by the fact that\nCloverland pays a slightly higher federal price for raw milk\nbecause it is located in Maryland,19 and many Pennsylvania\nhandlers avoid paying minimum wholesale prices by entering\ntolling agreements20 and taking advantage of allowable\n\n\n   19\n      Although Pennsylvania Areas 1 and 4 and the State of\nMaryland are all under the Northeast federal order, there are\nnumerous price differentials that set various minimum prices\nthroughout the order. See, e.g., U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Northeast\nStates Class I Differentials, available at\nhttp://www.fmmone.com/New_Zone_Diffs/\nNEZoneDiffMap.pdf.\n   20\n       A tolling agreement is a state-approved service contract\nwhereby a handler contracts with a large retailer that is\nvertically integrated (i.e., processes its own milk) to process,\npackage, and deliver milk to the retailer. Essentially, the\nhandler acts as a proxy for the retailer’s milk processing\noperation, and thereby avoids charging minimum wholesale\nprices.\n        We have previously held that “out-of-state dealers’\nability to enter into tolling agreements [does not] meaningfully\nmitigate[] the burden on interstate commerce,” because only\nabout one-third of wholesale milk sales in Pennsylvania are\nmade pursuant to tolling, and “[t]he dormant Commerce Clause\n\n                              44\n\fdiscounts for high volume sales, partial service (i.e., delivering\nthe milk to a retailer but not stocking it in the cooler or ordering\nfuture inventory), and multi-store customers. None of this was\nreflected in Cloverland’s offer of proof at trial, which relied on\na straightforward comparison between the price of raw milk\nwith the over-order premium and the price of milk without it.\n\n       Cloverland argues strenuously that the Board’s data is\nflawed. It contends, first, that the Board purposely selected\nsample handlers with lower operating costs than Cloverland, and\nargues specifically against the inclusion of “Dealer 4”,21 which\n\n\ndoes not allow Pennsylvania to hamper out-of-state dealers in\ntwo-thirds of its wholesale market on the ground that they may\ncompete freely in the remaining third.” Cloverland I, 298 F.3d\nat 218 (citing Wyoming, 502 U.S. at 455). We adhere fully to\nthis holding. Thus, the Board’s evidence at trial, and argument\non appeal, that tolling is available to Cloverland as a means to\navoid minimum wholesale prices do not defeat Cloverland’s\ndormant Commerce Clause challenge. But, as explained below,\nthe plaintiff in a case like this must prove an out-of-state\nadvantage over similarly situated in-state handlers, and in\nconducting this comparison the plaintiff must take account of\nthe circumstances of the in-state handlers over which it claims\nto have an advantage. Since Cloverland did not analyze\nPennsylvania handlers’ costs, the District Court did not clearly\nerr in relying on the Board’s comparison.\n   21\n      The relative costs of milk handlers are trade secrets, and\nthus the sample dairies are referenced by pseudonyms.\n\n                                45\n\fis not located within a federal order area and moves less than\n25% of its total Class I milk volume into that area, and thus is\nonly partially regulated by federal law. See 7 C.F.R. § 1001.7;\nsee also Sani-Dairy, Div. of Penn Traffic Co, Inc. v. Espy, 939\nF. Supp. 410, 412 (W.D. Pa. 1993) (same under earlier federal\norder regulations). Herbein testified, and Cloverland does not\ndispute, that a partially regulated handler like Dealer 4 need not\naccount to the Producer Settlement Fund, and is therefore able\nto pay producers more for raw milk (which gives it a price\nadvantage over fully regulated handlers, and a corresponding\ncost advantage when the market price of raw milk is higher than\nthe federal minimum). See 7 C.F.R. § 1000.76. Since\nCloverland is fully regulated federally, and must account to the\nProducer Settlement Fund, it argues a comparison with the\npartially regulated Dealer 4 is irrelevant.\n\n       Cloverland’s argument misses the mark. Dealer 4 would\nclearly be a competitor in the Pennsylvania market; although\nDealer 4 cannot sell more than 25% of its total milk volume into\na federal order area and remain partially regulated, it could still\ncompete with Cloverland for retail outlets in Areas 1 and 4 with\nthe milk it does move into the order area. Dealer 4 is not,\ntherefore, a wholly irrelevant comparison. Cloverland’s\nargument is really addressed to whether Dealer 4 is a proper\nrepresentative for comparison. Yet Cloverland had every\nopportunity to submit evidence of similarly situated\nPennsylvania handlers with comparatively higher costs, and it\nfailed to do so. As the Board was the only one to submit\n\n\n                                46\n\fevidence of comparative costs, the District Court did not clearly\nerr in relying on the Board’s sample.\n\n       Second, Cloverland argues Herbein erroneously relied on\nthe “plant blend” cost of raw milk (i.e., the weighted average of\nthe costs of different classes of milk used by the plant, which is\npaid to producers), rather than a segregated Class I price, in\nconducting his analysis of comparative costs. This, according\nto Cloverland, artificially lowered the costs of plants with less\nClass I usage than Cloverland. The Board counters that the\nplant blend method of calculating costs is the norm in the\nindustry and comports with generally accepted accounting\npractices.\n\n       Although Cloverland’s argument may have some merit,22\n\n\n  22\n     Herbein justified his reliance on the plant blend cost — as\ndoes the Board in its arguments on appeal — by noting that\nplant blend is an accepted method of pricing the cost of raw\nmilk, and reflects the way handlers actually operate (i.e., by\npurchasing Grade A raw milk and only later deciding how it will\nbe classified). While we have no doubt plant blend is\nrecognized and accepted in the industry, here Cloverland\ncontends that its exemption from the over-order premium (which\napplies only to purchases of Class I raw milk) gives it an\nadvantage over other purchasers of Class I raw milk. Reliance\non the plant blend cost in determining Cloverland’s advantage\nover other handlers makes sense only if Cloverland and the\nPennsylvania handlers to which it is compared have the same\n\n                               47\n\fwe note that it submitted no evidence that the sample handlers\n(which Herbein testified were “very similar” to Cloverland in\nterms of size, volume, and gross sales) had appreciably different\nClass I usage. Havemeyer provided evidence of Cloverland’s\nClass I costs, but did not compare these to any actual\nPennsylvania competitors, and the District Court expressly\nfound his study unreliable due to its limited time frame and\nexamination of only variable costs. Again, under these\ncircumstances, we cannot conclude that the District Court\n\n\nClass I usage. Otherwise, as Cloverland argues, the comparison\nwill be flawed: because it has a high Class I usage, its plant\nblend cost will be artificially higher than a plant with lower\nClass I usage, even though the cost of its Class I milk alone may\nbe lower than the Pennsylvania competitor.\n        Of course, it may be difficult to calculate a discrete\n“Class I” cost because if (as the Board persuasively argued, and\nthe District Court found) it is appropriate to consider the total\ncosts of production — including fixed costs like capital\ninvestment, facilities, equipment, and other overhead — in\ndeciding whether one handler has a cost or efficiency advantage\nover another, it would be an arduous task to separate out the\nportion of fixed costs attributable to the production of Class I\nmilk, as many fixed costs are directed at processing raw milk\nregardless of its end use. It may be, then, that plant blend is an\nunavoidable consequence of the way handlers actually work,\nthough we still think it most useful if the two handlers compared\nuse roughly the same amount of raw milk as Class I. But, as we\nexplain, in this case Cloverland’s failure of proof makes it\nunnecessary to resolve this question.\n\n                               48\n\fcommitted clear error by relying on the only comparative\nevidence before it.\n\n                      *    *    *    *   *\n\n        To be sure, we do not mean to suggest that a defendant\nin a case such as this may defeat heightened scrutiny merely by\nshowing that the plaintiff does not have a competitive advantage\nover some of its putative competitors. Such a rule would be at\nodds with the well-established principle that “‘a statute may be\ninvalid if it favors only a single or finite set of businesses.’”\nCloverland I, 298 F.3d at 214 (quoting Harvey & Harvey, 68\nF.3d at 798). But this does not relieve a plaintiff like Cloverland\nof its burden of proving, as part of its prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, that it has an actual competitive advantage over\nsome of its prospective competitors because it is an out-of-state\nfirm. Cloverland should have established that its exemption\nfrom the over-order premium gave it a relevant cost advantage\nover similarly situated Pennsylvania competitors that translated\ninto an ability to sell wholesale milk at a lower cost.23 Had it\n\n  23\n      Herbein’s testimony indicated that Cloverland had a cost\nadvantage over one of the four sample dairies offered by the\nBoard (which Herbein selected because they were similarly\nsituated to Cloverland), but Cloverland offered no proof that this\ncost advantage arose because of its out-of-state status. In any\nevent, given the totality of the Board’s evidence, the District\nCourt did not clearly err in deciding (implicitly) that evidence of\na cost advantage over one similarly situated Pennsylvania\n\n                                49\n\fdone so, the Board could (of course) have attempted to rebut this\nproof by showing that Cloverland did not have an actual cost\nadvantage over its competitors, or its cost advantage was not\nrelated to its out-of-state status. The District Court would then\nhave had to weigh the evidence. But Cloverland’s evidence did\nnot compare its costs to the costs of its competitors, and thus the\nCourt did not commit clear error when it held that Cloverland\nfailed to sustain its burden of proving an out-of-state\ncompetitive advantage vis a vis its Pennsylvania competitors\nthat is neutralized by the Commonwealth’s mandatory minimum\nwholesale prices. In this context, we do not have facts calling\nfor heightened scrutiny.\n\n       C.      Pike Balancing\n\n        Having concluded that Cloverland failed to prove the\napplicability of heightened scrutiny, we proceed to the Pike\nbalancing test. Pike, 397 U.S. at 142. As noted, when a law\n“effectuate[s] a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on\ninterstate commerce are only incidental,” the court must\ndetermine whether “the burden imposed on such commerce is\nclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.” Id.\nThe District Court concluded that Pennsylvania’s mandatory\nminimum wholesale milk prices survive this test.\n\n\nhandler, owing possibly to Cloverland’s exemption from the\nover-order premium, was not sufficient to trigger heightened\nscrutiny.\n\n                                 50\n\f        Cloverland argues that the “benefits” conferred by the\nminimum wholesale prices are merely economic protectionism,\n“the very evil the Commerce Clause seeks to prohibit.”\nAppellant’s Br. at 40. The District Court disagreed, crediting\nthe Board’s witnesses who testified that minimum wholesale\nprices make it easier for handlers to pay the over-order\npremium. The over-order premium, in turn, helps small,\nindependent dairy farms remain profitable without joining\ncooperatives, which fosters market diversity and prevents a\npossible future rise in retail prices. Indeed, the District Court\nwas persuaded by expert testimony offered by the Board that the\nabolition of minimum prices in California led to consolidation\nof farms and handlers into a few dominant market participants,\nresulting eventually in a sharp rise in consumer prices. The\nDistrict Court also credited testimony offered by the Board that\nif small farms went out of business, “the agricultural\ninfrastructure built around the industry will also be negatively\naffected, resulting in the loss of dealers, feed stores,\nveterinarians, and other business[es] that support the dairy\nindustry.” Cloverland II, slip op. at 9, 26.\n\n       Although Cloverland presented testimony tending to\nestablish the opposite — that the abolition of minimum\nwholesale prices would have no adverse effect on the dairy\nindustry, which would continue to thrive as it does in other\nstates — the District Court was entitled to base its ultimate\nfactual conclusion on the Board’s evidence. “As we have\nrecognized, the clearly erroneous standard of review does not\n\n\n                               51\n\fpermit an appellate court to substitute its findings for those of\nthe trial court. It allows only an assessment of whether there is\nenough evidence on the record to support those findings. That\na different set of inferences could be drawn from the record is\nnot determinative. . . . Where there are two permissible views of\nthe evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be\nclearly erroneous.” Scully v. US WATS, Inc., 238 F.3d 497,\n506 (3d Cir. 2001) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74\n(1985) (same).\n\n       The next question, then, is whether the putative benefits\nof the Milk Law are outweighed by a significant incidental\nburden on commerce. Cloverland offered testimony that the\nminimum prices prevented it from competing in the\nPennsylvania milk market, and thus the burdens on interstate\ncommerce were substantial. As noted, the Board offered\ntestimony that several other forms of competition exist in the\nPennsylvania market,24 and therefore the minimum wholesale\n\n\n 24\n     Although we held above that evidence of other competitive\noutlets is not relevant to the question of whether heightened\nscrutiny applies — because, as explained, the only relevant\ninquiry in making that determination is whether an out-of-state\ncompetitive advantage is neutralized by Pennsylvania law — the\npresence of other forms of competition is one of many factors\nthat may be taken into account under the Pike balancing test,\nwhere the inquiry concerns the magnitude of the incidental\nburden on commerce and the countervailing benefits of the law.\n\n                               52\n\fprices do not entirely prevent new competitors from challenging\nincumbent handlers and moving their milk interstate. As with\nthe benefits of the law, the District Court was forced to choose\nbetween conflicting evidence, and we cannot say its choice was\nclearly erroneous. Thus, we affirm the District Court’s holding\nthat Cloverland failed to sustain its burden of proving that the\nincidental burdens of Pennsylvania’s minimum wholesale milk\nprices outweigh the putative benefits.\n\n                        V. Conclusion\n\n       In Cloverland I, we expressed our unease with the fact\nthat Pennsylvania is the only state with mandatory price controls\nof the sort described in this case, while its milk industry\n(dominated by in-state firms) is flourishing. In our view, the\nBoard’s argument that the price controls are the only thing\npreventing a vulnerable milk industry from complete collapse\n(and a concomitant disruption in the supply of milk to\nPennsylvania’s residents) rings hollow in light of the undisputed\nevidence that Pennsylvania exports far more milk than its\nresidents consume,25 and other states appear to do quite well\n\n\n\n\n    25\n       In Cloverland I, we noted that “Pennsylvania’s dairy\nindustry is among our nation’s most productive. Milk\nproduction in the Commonwealth outpaces consumption by\nroughly 350%. Annual production per-capita [for Pennsylvania\nresidents] is around 900 pounds; consumption [by Pennsylvania\n\n                               53\n\fwithout mandatory minimum prices. It is quite likely, as we\nstated on the limited factual record in Cloverland I, that\npreventing competition based on price works to the advantage\nof Pennsylvania’s resident handlers by helping maintain their\ndominance in the market. Indeed, there is apparently no\npolitical incentive for in-state handlers to resist the price\ncontrols, as evidenced by the fact that the Pennsylvania\nAssociation of Milk Dealers has intervened in support of the\nchallenged law. Cf. West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 200-01\n(“[O]ne would ordinarily have expected at least three groups to\nlobby against the order premium, which, as a tax, raises the\nprice (and hence lowers demand) for milk: dairy farmers, milk\ndealers, and consumers. But because the tax was coupled with\na subsidy, one of the most powerful of these groups,\nMassachusetts dairy farmers, instead of exerting their influence\nagainst the tax, were in fact its primary supporters. . . . [Thus,]\n[the] State’s political processes can no longer be relied upon to\nprevent legislative abuse.”).\n\n       Cloverland failed to prove its case, however, and the\nDistrict Court cannot be faulted for relying on the evidence\npresented at trial. But our opinion today does not settle the\nquestion of the Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Law’s\nconstitutionality. Indeed, if another out-of-state plaintiff can\nprove it has competitive advantages over actual Pennsylvania\ncompetitors belonging to its place of origin (whether by virtue\n\n\nresidents] per-capita is merely 200 pounds.” 298 F.3d at 206.\n\n                                54\n\fof its exemption from the over-order premium or otherwise),26\nand these advantages translate into an actual ability to sell milk\nfor less than similarly situated Pennsylvania handlers that is\nneutralized by the minimum wholesale prices, heightened\nscrutiny would apply.27 Cloverland lost this case because its\nevidence was insufficient, but the constitutionality of\nPennsylvania’s minimum wholesale prices remains unresolved.\n\n         In this context, the District Court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n   26\n       The District Court noted, for example, that “if . . . [a]\ncompetitive price advantage arose from [out-of-state] firms’\nability to buy cheap local milk, the wholesale price floor would\nfall under a heightened scrutiny analysis.” Cloverland II, slip\nop. at 18 n.13.\n    27\n        We have already held that “[i]f they are subject to\nheightened scrutiny, the wholesale price floors cannot satisfy the\ndormant Commerce Clause” because Pennsylvania could\n“achieve its objective through alternative measures that do not\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce” — by acting as a\nmarket participant, for example. Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 215.\nThis holding would, of course, apply in any future challenge to\nthe minimum wholesale prices.\n\n                                 55\n\f",

Milk Economics\n\n       Before addressing the facts of this case, we believe it\nhelpful (if not necessary) to explain how milk pricing works.\nOn the surface, the path of milk from the cow to the consumer\nseems simple. A farmer (commonly called a “producer”) sells\nraw milk to a processor (or “handler”). The handler processes\nthe raw milk into fluid milk or other dairy products, packages it,\nand sells the product to a retailer. The retailer, in turn, sells to\nthe consumer.\n\n        Yet this apparent simplicity is deceptive. Federal and\nstate regulations regarding the sale of milk make “Byzantine” an\napt, and none too pejorative, description. See, e.g., Lansing\nDairy, Inc. v.

The city-dweller or\n             poet who regards the cow as a\n             symbol of bucolic serenity is\n             indeed naive. From the udders of\n             that placid animal flows a bland\n             liquid indispensable to human\n             health but often provoking as much\n             human strife and nastiness as strong\n             alcoholic beverages. . . .

The\n             milk problem is so vast that fully to\n             comprehend it would require an\n             almost universal knowledge\n             ranging from geology, biology,\n             chemistry and medicine to the\n             niceties of the legislative, judicial\n             and administrative processes of\n             government.

See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 172. Fluid milk is more\nexpensive for handlers to produce and market because it is\nhighly perishable (a gallon of milk must ordinarily be marketed\nto the consumer within two days of milking), requires more\nsanitation and processing than other dairy products, and is\nheavier and thus more expensive to transport.

Fluid\nmilk for drinking therefore costs the consumer more per pound\nthan milk that has been manufactured into other dairy products,\nand the partial inelasticity of demand for fluid milk (viewed as\na dietary staple by many Americans) means profit margins on\nfluid milk sales may also be higher.

Manchester & Blayney, supra, at 2; David L. Baumer,\nFederal Regulation of Milk Production and Sale is Growing at\nthe Expense of State Authority, 12 J. Agric. Tax. & L. 36, 38-39\n(1990). Not surprisingly, in an entirely unregulated market,\nhandlers would have an incentive to produce manufactured dairy\nproducts using Grade B milk and reserve as much Grade A milk\nas possible for the more lucrative fluid milk market. At the\nsame time, farmers would want to be paid a higher price for\ntheir Grade A milk than for Grade B milk, but handlers would\nwant to pay less for Grade A milk they intended to put to use in\nmanufactured dairy products (i.e., surplus Grade A milk they\ncannot sell as fluid milk).\n\n       The complexity deepens when we consider the second\nphenomenon identified in Zuber: the cyclical nature of milk\nproduction. Demand for fluid milk, though somewhat inelastic\nwith respect to price, is temporally cyclic, with demand higher\nin the fall and winter months than in the spring and summer\nmonths. See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 172-73; Bailey, supra, at 34; see\nalso John R. Snyder, A Summary: Political and Economic\nAnalysis of Milk Marketing, 1980-81 Agric. L.J. 297, 310-11.\nUnfortunately, cows do not work this way, and produce more\nmilk in the spring and summer (known as the “flush” season)\nthan in the fall and winter (the “short-supply” season).\nManchester & Blayney, supra, at 2; Snyder, supra, at 310-11.\nThus, “it [is] necessary to coordinate a supply that is rising when\nfluid milk demand is falling.” Manchester & Blayney, supra, at\n2. Otherwise, handlers would attempt to “take advantage of this\n\n\n                                8\n\fsurplus to obtain bargains [from producers] during glut periods,”\nwhich would lead farmers to increase production to maintain a\nsteady income, “and the disequilibrium snowballs.” Zuber, 396\nU.S. at 173; Smyser, 760 F.2d at 516 (“In an unregulated market\n‘cutthroat’ competition for more profitable fluid milk sales can\nlead to an overall decline in prices.”); see also Bailey, supra, at\n110 (explaining that the unique characteristics of the milk\nindustry, if unregulated, lead to “chaotic marketing conditions”).\n\n              2.      The Federal System\n\n       Federal regulation of the nation’s dairy industry began in\nearnest in the 1930s, when falling prices caused by the Great\nDepression led to “utter chaos” in the milk market. Zuber, 396\nU.S. at 174. The first attempt at regulation was the Agricultural\nAdjustment Act (“AAA”) of 1933, 48 Stat. 31, which\nempowered the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate\nemergency licensing requirements in the dairy industry to\nregulate output and price. See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 174-75. The\nSupreme Court’s decision in A.L.A.

See Zuber, 396 U.S. at 175-76;\n\n\n                                9\n\fDefiance Milk Prods. Co. v.

See 7\nU.S.C. § 608c(1); Defiance, 857 F.2d at 1067; Lehigh Valley,\n829 F.2d at 411. These orders are meant to ensure “a sufficient\nquantity of pure and wholesome milk to meet current needs and\nfurther to assure a level of farm income adequate to maintain\nproductive capacity sufficient to meet anticipated future needs.”\n7 U.S.C. § 608c(18). Although their number has varied over the\nyears, there are currently ten federal milk marketing order\nareas.5 See 7 C.F.R. pts. 1001-1135; U.S. Dep’t of Agric.,\n\n\n  5\n     These are the Northeast, Appalachian, Southeast, Florida,\nMideast, Upper Midwest, Central, Southwest, Arizona, and\nPacific Northwest orders.        See U.S. Dep’t of Agric.,\nConsolidated Milk Marketing Order Areas, available at\nhttp://www.ams.usda.gov/dairy/dymap.htm. There are also\nseveral parts of the country that are not regulated by a federal\norder, including parts of Idaho, New York, Pennsylvania, and\nNorth and South Dakota, and most or all of California, Maine,\nMontana, Nevada, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. Id.\n        Confusingly, the orders are often referred to by a number\nthat corresponds to the implementing regulation that defines the\norder. So, for example, the Northeast order (encompassing all\nor part of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode\nIsland, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\n\n                               10\n\fConsolidated Milk Marketing Order Areas, available at\nhttp://www.ams.usda.gov/dairy/dymap.htm.          Within these\norders, the Secretary sets prices at which raw milk may be sold.\nThere are two main features of this pricing structure that merit\nexplanation.\n\n          Handlers pay for their milk according to a classified\npricing arrangement. See 7 U.S.C. § 608c(5)(A). Grade A raw\nmilk is classified according to its end use. Class I milk is fluid\nmilk for drinking, while other classes (II, III, and IV) are\nassigned to raw milk used in various manufactured products. 7\nC.F.R. § 1000.40; see West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117855\"><a href=\"/opinion/117855/west-lynn-creamery-inc-v-healy/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189 n.1 (1994). It is not necessary for our purposes to\nexplain in detail the pricing mechanism for each class, see, e.g.,\n7 C.F.R. § 1000.50; we simply note that handlers pay more for\nGrade A raw milk they intend to put to use as Class I milk than\nthey do for Grade A raw milk they intend to put to use as Class\nII, III, or IV milk.6 See Lansing Dairy, 39 F.3d at 1344; Smyser,\n\n\nDelaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, as well as a\nfew counties in Northern Virginia) is defined in 7 C.F.R. part\n1001, and is known commonly as “Order 1”. The Mideast order\n(encompassing all or part of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,\nWest Virginia, and Pennsylvania) is defined in 7 C.F.R. part\n1033, and is known commonly as “Order 33”.\n    6\n      To be clear, however, the different classes are merely\nadministrative distinctions to take account of the fact that\nhandlers charge different wholesale prices for fluid milk and\n\n                               11\n\f760 F.2d at 516.\n\n        Producers do not, however, receive more or less money\nfor raw milk based on the handler’s use. Instead, producers\nreceive a uniform “blend” price that is essentially a weighted\naverage of the price of all classes of milk sold in the region. See\n7 U.S.C. 608c(5)(B); Zuber, 396 U.S. at 177; Lehigh Valley,\n829 F.2d at 411. This system “eliminate[s] the potential\nsituation where one producer, who sold milk to a fluid\nprocessor, would get a higher milk price than his neighbor who\nsold to a cheese plant.” Bailey, supra, at 113; see also Lehigh\nValley, 829 F.2d at 411-12 (“By mandating that producers\nwithin a market area receive a uniform price based on the use of\nmilk within the area, the [AMAA] eliminates the incentive for\ndairy farmers to attempt to compete with their neighbors through\nlowering their prices.”).\n\n        Of course, this would ordinarily lead to a situation in\nwhich handlers dealing mostly in lower classes of milk\nessentially subsidize those dealing mostly in Class I milk,\nbecause the blend price paid to the producer will be more than,\nsay, the classified price of Class IV milk, but lower than the\nclassified price of Class I milk. To compensate for this, the\nregulations establish a “Producer Settlement Fund,” into which\n\n\n\nmanufactured products. The raw milk is all Grade A, and is\nalike in all respects except the artificially created class\ndistinction that depends on the use to which the milk is put.\n\n                                12\n\fhandlers who have underpaid contribute an amount equal to the\ndifference between the blend price and classified price, which is\nthen distributed to handlers who have overpaid. See 7 C.F.R.\n§ 1000.70; Lansing Dairy, 39 F.3d at 1344; Smyser, 760 F.2d at\n516.\n\n       By charging handlers less for Grade A raw milk used in\nstorable dairy products like cheese and butter than for raw milk\nused as Class I drinking milk, while assuring that producers are\npaid the same no matter the use to which the raw milk is put,\nhandlers have an incentive to use surplus Grade A milk in\nmanufactured products during the glut months, and producers\nmaintain a more stable income year-round. This, in turn, guards\nagainst overproduction in the flush season. Moreover, the\nProducer Settlement Fund relieves pressures on handlers to deal\nexclusively in fluid milk to the detriment of other dairy\nproducts.\n\n       B.     Pennsylvania Milk Price Regulation\n\n       Although state control of milk markets has declined\nsignificantly in the wake of federal regulation, particularly\nthrough court challenges, it survives in a few states, including\nPennsylvania. See Bailey, supra, at 205, 210; see generally\nBaumer, supra. Parts of Pennsylvania are federally regulated —\nthe southeast and southcentral parts of the Commonwealth are\nunder the Northeast order, and the western part of the\nCommonwealth is under the Mideast order — while other parts\n\n\n                               13\n\fare not regulated by the federal system. Pennsylvania’s system\ncovers the entire Commonwealth, however.\n\n       Under Pennsylvania’s Milk Marketing Law, 31 Pa. Cons.\nStat. § 700j, the Board is granted “power to supervise,\ninvestigate and regulate the entire milk industry of th[e]\nCommonwealth, including the production, transportation,\ndisposal, manufacture, processing, storage, distribution,\ndelivery, handling, bailment, brokerage, consignment, purchase\nand sale of milk and milk products in th[e] Commonwealth.” 31\nPa. Cons. Stat. § 700j-301. The statute requires that all handlers\noperating in Pennsylvania be licensed by the Board, see id. §\n700j-401, and empowers the Board to set minimum prices paid\nto producers, handlers, and retailers to “benefi[t] . . . the public\ninterest [and] best protect the milk industry of the\nCommonwealth and insure a sufficient quantity of pure and\nwholesome milk to [its] inhabitants.” Id. § 700j-801.\n\n       In-state handlers who buy raw milk from in-state\nproducers for in-state use must pay “over-order” prices — which\ninclude a premium above the applicable Class I milk prices —\nto assure producers a “reasonable return” based on the\n“conditions affecting the milk industry in each marketing area.”7\n\n\n  7\n    According to the Board, “the state-mandated premium has\nresulted in over 335 million additional dollars being paid to\nPennsylvania farmers” since 1988. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., Fiscal\nYear Report, 2003-2004 10 (2004), available at http://\n\n                                14\n\fId.; see also id. § 700j-803 (“The [B]oard shall fix, by official\norder, the minimum prices or a formula for setting of minimum\nprices to be paid by milk dealears or handlers to producers for\nmilk or milk components sold or delivered or made available on\nconsignment or otherwise by producers to dealers or handlers.”).\nThe over-order premium only applies to sales of Class I milk.\nSee Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., Order No. A-913 (2001) (establishing\nthe method for calculating the over-order premium, and\nspecifying that the premium “shall be based on milk that is\nproduced, processed, and utilized as Class I milk in\nPennsylvania”).8\n\n       Pennsylvania also exports raw milk to other states. The\nover-order price, however, does not apply to sales to out-of-state\nhandlers.\n\n\n\nwww.mmb.state.pa.us/mmb/lib/mmb/2003-2004.pdf. From July\n2003 to June 2004, the over-order premium resulted in\nPennsylvania farmers receiving $30.8 million more than they\nwould otherwise have received. Id. at 13.\n    8\n        The Board has promulgated a complex mathematical\nformula for calculating the over-order premium. See Pa. Milk\nMktg. Bd., Order No. A-913 (2001). It is not necessary to\nexplain that process here. As of this writing, in all Pennsylvania\nmilk marketing areas handlers must add $1.60 per\nhundredweight (approximately 11.6 gallons) to the price of\nClass I milk. See Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., Order No. A-938 (2006).\n\n\n                               15\n\f        All handlers who sell milk to retailers in Pennsylvania\nmust do so at minimum wholesale prices that also guarantee a\n“reasonable return,” which state law defines as between 2.5%\nand 3.5% of net sales. 31 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 700j-801; see also id.\n§ 700j-802 (“The [B]oard shall fix, by official order . . ., the\nminimum wholesale and retail prices, and may fix, by official\norder, the maximum wholesale and retail prices, to be charged\nand received by milk dealers or handlers for milk sold,\ndelivered, handled or consigned within any milk marketing area\nof the Commonwealth.”).\n\n        The Board has divided Pennsylvania into six milk\nmarketing areas. Areas 1 and 4 (the Areas at issue in this\nappeal) consist of the counties in southeast and southcentral\nPennsylvania that are also covered by the federal Northeast\norder. Area 5 consists of the counties in western Pennsylvania\nthat are also covered by the federal Mideast order. The\nremaining Areas (2, 3, and 6) consist of the counties that are not\nregulated by the federal order system. See Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd.,\nFiscal Year Report, 2003-2004 10 (2004), available at\nhttp://www.mmb.state.pa.us/mmb/lib/mmb/2003-2004.pdf. The\nBoard sets minimum wholesale and retail prices, as well as over-\norder premiums, in each Area based on the circumstances of that\nregion, and enforces the minimum prices by regular audits of\nhandlers’ books. Id. Anyone who sells milk (raw or processed)\nat a price below the mandatory minimums set by the Board is\nsubject to criminal penalties, including fines or imprisonment.\n31 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 700j-1001 & 1002.\n\n\n                               16\n\f       The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”)\nhas identified several important differences between the\nPennsylvania system and the federal orders. First, Pennsylvania\ndivides milk into only two classes when calculating the price\nhandlers must pay, as opposed to the four classes applicable to\nprices under federal orders. See Milk in the New England and\nOther Marketing Areas, 64 Fed. Reg. 16,026, 16,056 (Apr. 2,\n1999). As in the federal system, Class I milk in Pennsylvania is\nprimarily fluid milk for drinking, but Class II milk encompasses\nall other dairy products. Second, the location where milk is\ndistributed for sale determines the applicable minimum price in\nPennsylvania, while under federal orders the price is determined\nbased on the handler’s plant location. Id. Third, blend prices\npaid to farmers under the Pennsylvania system are calculated\nbased on the individual handler’s usage, and not the use of the\nvarious milk classes in the wider market. Id.; see also 7 Pa.\nCode § 143.11 (“Dealers shall pay their producers on a weight\nand butterfat basis as determined by the utilization of the milk\nreceived at each plant or receiving station.”). This includes, of\ncourse, the over-order premium, which is added to the Class I\nprice and then (as part of the Class I price) blended with the\nClass II price to yield the handler’s “plant blend” price paid to\nits producers.\n\n              II. Facts and Procedural History\n\n       With this background in mind, we proceed to the facts of\nthis case. Appellant Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc.\n\n\n                               17\n\f(“Cloverland”) is a milk handler located in Maryland. It buys\napproximately 90% of its raw milk from Pennsylvania\nproducers, but does not sell processed fluid milk in\nPennsylvania. In March 1999, Cloverland brought suit against\nthe Board’s members in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, alleging that Pennsylvania’s milk pricing scheme\neliminates competition based on price and, as such, nullifies\nCloverland’s competitive advantages, thereby effectively\nbarring it from Pennsylvania’s market. This, it argues, violates\nthe Constitution’s dormant Commerce Clause (described in Part\nIII.A below). Three individual milk consumers in Pennsylvania\nintervened as plaintiffs in the suit, and the Pennsylvania\nAssociation of Milk Dealers intervened as a defendant in\nsupport of the minimum prices.\n\n       A.     Summary Judgment and Appeal\n\n         The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nBoard, see Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Pa. Milk\nMktg. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462192\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462192/cloverland-green-spring-dairies-v-penn-milk-marketing-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (M.D. Pa. 2001), and\nCloverland appealed. We affirmed the grant of summary\njudgment with respect to Pennsylvania’s minimum retail prices\n(i.e., prices charged to consumers, which are not at issue on this\nappeal), but reversed with respect to the minimum wholesale\nprices. Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 205. Viewing all facts in the\nlight most favorable to Cloverland — as required at that stage of\nthe proceedings, see id. — we held that a reasonable trier of fact\ncould find (on the facts presented) that Pennsylvania’s minimum\n\n\n                               18\n\fwholesale milk prices were unconstitutional, thus precluding\nsummary judgment for the Board. Specifically, we noted that\nCloverland indicated it had evidence that it could offer prices\nbelow Pennsylvania’s wholesale floor. Although, based on the\nlimited record available at that stage of the proceedings, it was\nnot entirely clear to us why Cloverland could offer lower prices,\nid. at 207, we observed that Cloverland (as an out-of-state\nhandler) is exempt from paying the over-order premium on\nClass I milk purchased from Pennsylvania producers, and thus\nits raw milk costs could be lower than similarly situated\nPennsylvania handlers. Id. at 213. As such, “a reasonable trier\nof fact could find that Pennsylvania’s minimum wholesale prices\neliminate a competitive advantage enjoyed by out-of-state\ndealers like Cloverland,” which would trigger heightened\nscrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause. Id. at 213.\nMoreover, there was no evidence (at that time) that there were\nPennsylvania firms more efficient than Cloverland, and thus the\nminimum price floors did not necessarily affect all in-state and\nout-of-state firms equally. Id.9\n\n\n  9\n      Indeed, on the facts Cloverland offered, it appeared to us\nthat “[b]y calibrating wholesale price floors for a particular milk\nmarketing area to the operating costs of average dealers in that\narea, the Commonwealth enables Pennsylvania dealers to\noperate less efficiently without fearing losses to lower-cost\ncompetitors like Cloverland. This aspect of Pennsylvania’s\nscheme appears to run afoul of the cardinal rule that states may\nnot shield in-state businesses from out-of-state competitors.”\nCloverland I, 298 F.3d at 214 n.17.\n\n                                19\n\f         Even if the District Court were to conclude that\nheightened scrutiny did not apply, we held that “the record . . .\namply supports a finding that the wholesale floors\n. . . incidentally burden interstate commerce by making it more\ndifficult for out-of-state dealers to attract new business in a\nmarket dominated by in-state dealers,” id. at 215, and thus the\nDistrict Court would have to employ the balancing test set forth\nin Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970), to determine\nwhether the burdens on interstate commerce substantially\noutweighed the putative local benefits. Cloverland I, 298 F.3d\nat 215. We held that the “the purpose asserted in the\n[Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Law’s] text deserve[d] little\ndeference” in identifying the law’s benefits because no\nPennsylvania milk processors objected to the minimum prices\n(indeed, the Pennsylvania Association of Milk Dealers\nintervened in support of the law), and the price scheme therefore\n“appear[ed] to [burden] only . . . out-of-state dealers.” Id. at\n216. Moreover, we found only “meager evidence” that the\nminimum prices were necessary to sustain Pennsylvania’s dairy\nindustry — since “the federal producer price floors [appear to]\nprovide ample protection against predatory pricing” in other\nstates, and the Pennsylvania dairy industry was quite successful\n(indeed, it exported most of its raw milk) — and thus it seemed\nto us unlikely that the minimum prices were necessary to secure\na supply sufficient to meet the needs of Pennsylvania’s\nresidents. Id. at 216-17. Moreover, the burdens on interstate\ncommerce appeared substantial: Cloverland’s stated evidence\nsuggested it was “virtually impossible to displace incumbent\n\n\n                               20\n\fdealers in Pennsylvania without offering prices below the\nBoard-mandated floors.” Id. at 217. Thus, construing all the\nfacts in the light most favorable to Cloverland, the\nCommonwealth’s minimum wholesale milk prices could fail the\nPike balancing test.\n\n       C.     Second District Court Proceeding\n\n       On remand, the District Court permitted full discovery\nand held a bench trial at which numerous witnesses testified.\nBased on this evidence, the Court made detailed findings of fact\nthat largely contradicted the facts (viewed in the light most\nfavorable to Cloverland) on which we relied in our earlier\ndecision. The District Court found that Cloverland — which,\nagain, buys about 90% of its raw milk from Pennsylvania\nsuppliers — purchases about 35% of this milk from dairy farm\ncooperatives, which negotiate prices with Cloverland equal to\nthe over-order price charged to Pennsylvania processors.\nCloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd.,\nNo. 1:CV-99-487, slip op. at 5 (M.D. Pa. 2005) (hereafter\n“Cloverland II”). The other 65% is purchased from independent\nPennsylvania farmers, who do not charge the over-order\npremium to Cloverland because, as an out-of-state handler, it is\nexempt. Id. at 6. The Board nonetheless offered expert\ntestimony that Cloverland actually had higher raw milk costs\nand was less efficient than three of four sample dairies, which\nthe Court accepted because Cloverland did not produce\n\n\n\n                              21\n\fsufficient countervailing evidence.10 Id. at 6, 15. Thus, the\nCourt found that “[a]lthough Cloverland can sell milk at a cost\nbelow the minimum wholesale price floor established by the\nBoard, Cloverland does not have an out-of-state price or\nefficiency comparative advantage.” Id. at 6.\n\n       Indeed, the Court concluded that, even if Cloverland’s\nexemption from the over-order premium conferred an advantage\nbecause it is an out-of-state firm, that advantage “arises from the\nvery Milk Law pricing structure [Cloverland] seeks to partially\ninvalidate,” and thus, if Cloverland’s suit were successful, its\nadvantage would be “ephemeral.” Id. at 16. In the Court’s\nview, the invalidation of the wholesale price would necessarily\nlead to the abandonment of the over-order premium, which\nwould make it economically unfeasible for small dairy farms to\nremain in business and thus would force them into cooperatives\n(which negotiate prices with out-of-state processors equal to the\nover-order price). Id. at 15-16.\n\n       The District Court also found that, although “[m]ost\nprocessors sell at or around the wholesale floor price, [thus]\nprecluding appreciable amounts of competition based upon\nprice,” id. at 6-7, Cloverland failed to show that competition on\nnon-price factors did not exist. Indeed, the Court found\n\n\n  10\n       The District Court expressly found the Board’s expert on\nmilk pricing to be more credible than Cloverland’s.

Thus, even if\nCloverland could compete on the basis of price, the Court found\nthat it failed to prove it could penetrate the Pennsylvania market.\nId.11 Indeed, the Court noted that Cloverland only attempted\n\n\n   11\n       At one point in its opinion, the District Court stated that\n“Cloverland has established that it can compete with\nPennsylvania dealers only by selling milk at prices below the\nwholesale milk floor,” Cloverland II, slip op. at 7 (emphasis\nadded), but we do not believe the Court meant what it literally\nsaid. In the same paragraph, the Court explained that robust\ncompetition exists in the Pennsylvania market on a variety of\nnon-price factors, and “even were Cloverland able to establish\nthat it could sell milk for the lowest price, [it] would not enjoy\na competitive advantage that would enable it to penetrate the\nPennsylvania dairy market.” Id. (emphasis added). The Court\nexpressly found “that the minimum price floor does not have the\npractical effect of preventing Cloverland from entering the\nPennsylvania milk market,” id. (emphasis added), and later\nobserved that Cloverland “offered no credible evidence that it\ncould in fact compete in the Pennsylvania marketplace, absent\nof the Milk law.” Id. at 20.\n        Under these circumstances, we are confident that the\nDistrict Court, by typographical error or otherwise, misstated the\nintended proposition when it said Cloverland did establish the\n\n                                23\n\f(and failed) to solicit business from three retailers in Area 4 and\nnone in Area 1, and provided no evidence that these retailers\nrejected it because of price. Id. at 6, 20.\n\n        Thus, the District Court concluded that Cloverland failed\nto prove that the Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Law nullified\nany competitive advantage it enjoyed by virtue of being an out-\nof-state firm, and thus heightened scrutiny did not apply.\n\n       The Court then considered whether the minimum pricing\nscheme’s incidental burdens on interstate commerce\nsubstantially outweighed the putative local benefits, as required\nby the Pike balancing test. It concluded that minimum\nwholesale prices confer substantial benefits on Pennsylvania’s\ndairy industry, because the federal minimums “ha[ve] not\nadequately guaranteed enough income to protect Pennsylvania\ndairy farms since 1988,” when federal deregulation lowered the\nminimums. Id. at 8, 26. Minimum wholesale prices allow\nhandlers a sufficient return to enable them to pay the over-order\npremium, which in turn allows Pennsylvania’s independent\ndairy farms to survive. Id. at 8, 24. Based largely on evidence\nproduced at trial regarding the abolition of minimum prices in\nCalifornia, the District Court concluded that if Pennsylvania’s\nmarket were dominated by a few large players, “[c]onsumer\nprices would fall in the short term, but rise heavily in the long\nterm.” Id. at 9, 25. And, if small farms went out of business,\n\n\nvery thing it repeatedly explained Cloverland did not establish.\n\n                                24\n\fthe Court concluded that the “agricultural infrastructure” that\nsupports the dairy industry — including “dealers, feed stores,\nveterinarians, and other business[es]” — might suffer.12 Id. at\n9, 26.\n\n        In contrast, the Court found only incidental burdens on\ninterstate commerce: the minimum prices simply placed\nCloverland on the same footing as every other handler doing\nbusiness in Pennsylvania, did not prevent interstate competition\non non-price factors, and the dominance of incumbent handlers\ncould be attributed to Pennsylvania retailers’ preference for\ndoing business with local handlers “independent of regulatory\npressures.” Id. at 22. Thus, the Court held that, under the Pike\ntest, Cloverland failed to prove a violation of the dormant\nCommerce Clause, and granted judgment in the Board’s favor.\nCloverland appeals.13\n\n\n  12\n     These conclusions were based largely on the testimony of\nthe Board’s experts, which the District Court expressly found\nmore credible than Cloverland’s expert. Cloverland II, slip op.\nat 27.\n  13\n     The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this\ncase pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332, and we have\njurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our\nreview of the District Court’s decision is subject to familiar\nstandards: we review findings of fact for clear error (meaning\nwe will reverse only if we are “left with a definite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed”), and exercise\n\n                               25\n\f                          III. Analysis\n\n         Cloverland raises two issues on appeal. It contends its\ncompetitive advantages require heightened scrutiny, regardless\nwhether those advantages derive from its status as an out-of-\nstate firm, and that the mandatory minimum wholesale prices are\nthe only reason it cannot compete in the Pennsylvania market.\nEven if heightened scrutiny does not apply, Cloverland argues\nthat under the Pike test the burdens on interstate commerce\nclearly outweigh any putative benefits.\n\n       A.     The Dormant Commerce Clause\n\n       Under the federal Constitution’s Commerce Clause,\nCongress has explicit power to “regulate Commerce . . . among\nthe several States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. This clause\nalso has an implied requirement (often called the “negative” or\n“dormant” aspect of the clause) that states not “mandate\ndifferential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic\ninterests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.”\nGranholm v.

This\nbalancing test is significantly less restrictive of state laws than\nheightened scrutiny.\n\n       Often, “there is no clear line separating the category of\nstate regulation that is virtually per se invalid under the\nCommerce Clause, and the category subject to the Pike v. Bruce\nChurch balancing approach.” Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 579;\nsee Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 211 (“[S]ometimes the distinction\nbetween state laws subject only to Pike balancing and those that\nare nearly per se invalid is ‘hazy.’”). In determining whether\nheightened scrutiny should be applied instead of the Pike test,\n“the critical consideration is the overall effect of the statute on\nboth local and interstate activity,” Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at\n579, with special attention paid to whether a “facially neutral”\nstate law “ha[s] the effect of eliminating a competitive\nadvantage possessed by out-of-state firms” (which “trigger[s]\nheightened scrutiny”). Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 211.\n\n\n                                31\n\f        B.     Heightened Scrutiny\n\n         Cloverland’s argument against the District Court’s\nheightened scrutiny analysis may be distilled as follows. The\nDistrict Court concluded that Cloverland has some advantages\nover some Pennsylvania firms — it is more efficient than some,\nit sells milk in Maryland for less than the minimum wholesale\nprices that exist in Pennsylvania, and its exemption from the\nover-order premium for raw milk purchased from independent\nPennsylvania dairy farmers means its raw milk costs might\ntheoretically be lower than its Pennsylvania competitors’ costs.\nAlthough these advantages may not derive necessarily from\nCloverland’s status as an out-of-state handler,16 the argument\nproceeds, there is no question that Pennsylvania’s minimum\nprices level the playing field with Pennsylvania firms that have\nhigher costs and are less efficient, thus nullifying Cloverland’s\nalleged competitive advantages. Since it is an out-of-state firm,\nCloverland contends the pricing scheme necessarily restrains\ninterstate commerce. Moreover, it asserts that Pennsylvania’s\nin-state processors are so entrenched (we noted previously that\n“in-state dealers dominate the wholesale milk market in\nPennsylvania,” Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 217), other means of\ncompetition are so lacking, and the wholesale minimums are set\nso high (such that they effectively set the actual price for all\n\n\n   16\n      Cloverland’s exemption from the over-order premium is\ndue to its status as an out-of-state firm, but it argues this fact is\nnot relevant to the heightened scrutiny analysis.\n\n                                 32\n\fhandlers), that no out-of-state firm can compete in the\nPennsylvania market without offering a lower price. As we\nsummarized the argument, “[p]reventing dealers from attracting\ncustomers by offering lower prices . . . helps in-state dealers\nmaintain their traditional hegemony.” Id.\n\n              1.     Must a Competitive Advantage Arise from\n                     Cloverland’s Status as an Out-of-State\n                     Firm?\n\n\n\n\n        Although Cloverland’s arguments were persuasive on the\nlimited facts (construed in Cloverland’s favor) available in\nCloverland I, they are less compelling in light of the factual\nrecord developed at trial. As a starting point, we note that\nCloverland is incorrect that, at least on the facts of this case,\nstate regulations that nullify a competitive advantage unrelated\nto the firm’s out-of-state status may nonetheless, on their own,\ntrigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n        As the District Court framed the issue, “courts have\nstruggled with . . . the difficulty in examining laws which do not\nfacially discriminate against out-of-state interests under\n[d]ormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. When does a\nsimple economic advantage rise to the level of [a] competitive\nadvantage, within the heightened scrutiny context?” Cloverland\nII, slip op. at 16-17. The Supreme Court has never expressly\n\n\n                               33\n\faddressed this issue, but it has often stated that a state law that\n“cause[s] local goods to constitute a larger share, and goods with\nan out-of-state source to constitute a smaller share, of the total\nsales in the market” is unconstitutional “because it, like a tariff,\n‘neutraliz[es] advantages belonging to the place of origin.’”\nWest Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 196 (quoting Baldwin, 294\nU.S. at 527) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis\nadded); Polar Ice Cream, 375 U.S. at 377 (same with respect to\na Florida law barring in-state handlers from buying raw milk\nfrom out-of-state producers); see also Wash. State Apple, 432\nU.S. at 351 (noting that a North Carolina statute forbidding\nimporting apples with a non-USDA quality mark “has the effect\nof stripping away from the Washington apple industry the\ncompetitive and economic advantages it has earned for itself\nthough its expensive inspection and grading system”).\n\n       We have observed that “[t]he Supreme Court’s opinions\nin Baldwin and Washington State Apple show that if a state\nregulation has the effect of protecting in-state businesses by\neliminating a competitive advantage possessed by their out-of-\nstate counterparts, heightened scrutiny applies. . . . [Here,] a\nreasonable trier of fact could find that Pennsylvania’s minimum\nwholesale prices eliminate a competitive advantage enjoyed by\nout-of-state dealers like Cloverland.” Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at\n212-13. By referencing a “competitive advantage enjoyed by\nout-of-state dealers” not shared by in-state dealers, we presumed\nthe advantage would have something to do with the out-of-state\nstatus of the advantaged firms.\n\n\n                                34\n\f         Cloverland argues, however, that it need not prove a cost\nadvantage linked to its place of origin. It contends that the mere\nfact it has some efficiency advantage (for whatever reason) over\nat least one in-state firm means it can sell milk for less, and\nbecause Pennsylvania’s minimum wholesale prices nullify its\nability to do so, they render meaningless its efficiency advantage\nand thus trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n        The ramifications of this argument are expansive.\nCloverland’s proposed rule would eviscerate longstanding\nSupreme Court precedent that “price regulation [is not] an\nimpermissible burden upon commerce” where “the burden on\ncommerce is indirect and only incidental to the regulation of an\nessentially local activity,” Polar Ice Cream, 375 U.S. at 378\n(citing Milk Control Bd. of Pa. v.

As the District Court\nnoted, in any state with minimum price regulations, there will\nalways be some out-of-state competitors (like Cloverland) that\nhave some advantages over at least one in-state firm, even\nthough those advantages may reflect differences in capacity,\nefficiency, workers, etc., that have nothing to do with the firm’s\nlocation (and indeed are shared with many in-state firms). See\nCloverland II, slip op. at 16-17, 19. Thus, under Cloverland’s\nproposed rule, state milk price regulations will always be subject\nto heightened scrutiny (and thus nearly per se invalid), despite\nthe fact we and the Supreme Court have clearly recognized this\n\n\n                               35\n\fis not always the case. If the neutralization of any advantage\npossessed by any out-of-state firm were enough to trigger\nheightened scrutiny, it is difficult to think of a state pricing\nregulation that could survive.\n\n       The elimination of a particular competitive advantage\nbelonging to the place of origin is not, of course, a determinative\ninquiry in every case. For example, where a state statute\nimposes an outright ban on competition by reserving all business\nfor an in-state firm or firms and explicitly barring interstate\ncommerce, see Carbone, 511 U.S. at 391-93; Polar Ice Cream,\n375 U.S. at 376-77, or targets out-of-state firms for special\nburdens from which in-state firms are exempt, see West Lynn\nCreamery, 512 U.S. at 194-95; Wash. State Apple, 432 U.S. at\n350-51, the problem is more blatant: the out-of-state firms are\nsubjected to overt discrimination or an outright ban on\ncompetition. But Cloverland does not allege those barriers here.\nRather, it alleges more subtle discrimination, stemming from a\nlaw and regulatory scheme that are not facially discriminatory.\nHence, a nexus between the advantage that has been neutralized\nand the firm’s out-of-state status is necessary.\n\n      We therefore hold that, if Cloverland is to succeed in\ndemonstrating that heightened scrutiny applies because its\ncompetitive advantages have been neutralized by the\nPennsylvania Milk Marketing Law, it must establish that those\nadvantages arise by virtue of its out-of-state status.\n\n\n\n                                36\n\f             2.     Does Cloverland Have an Out-of-State\n                    Competitive Advantage?\n\n      The question becomes, then, whether the Pennsylvania\nMilk Marketing Law operates to neutralize competitive\nadvantages belonging to Cloverland’s place of origin. The\nrecord reveals only one such potential advantage vis-a-vis\nCloverland’s Pennsylvania competitors — its potential raw milk\ncost advantage due to its exemption from the over-order\npremium.\n\n                    a.     Legal Errors in the District Court’s\n                           Analysis\n\n      We note at the outset two legal errors in the District\nCourt’s opinion that cannot form the basis for a determination\nof whether Cloverland’s exemption from the over-order\npremium should trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n                           (1)     Nexus Between the\n                                   Challenged State Law and\n                                   Cloverland’s Advantage\n\n       We are unpersuaded by the District Court’s reasoning\nthat because Cloverland’s exemption arises from Pennsylvania\nlaw, any cost advantage it has is “ephemeral” — the argument\nbeing that if the minimum wholesale prices were invalidated (as\nCloverland desires), its purported raw milk cost advantage\n\n\n                              37\n\fwould disappear because the over-order premium would no\nlonger be viable. We assume, without deciding, that if the\nminimum wholesale prices themselves conferred an advantage\non Cloverland due to its out-of-state status, it could not rely on\nthat advantage to challenge those prices because invalidating the\nprices would necessarily nullify the advantage (though, of\ncourse, Cloverland would have no incentive to challenge the\nprices in that event). Here, however, Cloverland’s purported\ncost advantage arises from the operation of a different aspect of\nthe regulatory scheme — the over-order premium — that is not\nchallenged in this suit.\n\n        The District Court concluded, based on the Board’s\nevidence, that if the minimum wholesale prices were\ninvalidated, the over-order premium would fall. But this is not\na question susceptible to definitive proof by the Board’s experts.\nIt may well be that invalidating the minimum wholesale prices\nwould place pressure on the Commonwealth’s legislature to\nrepeal the over-order premium or extend it to out-of-state\npurchasers (both of which would nullify Cloverland’s supposed\nadvantage). The cost disadvantage to Pennsylvania handlers of\npaying the over-order premium and then competing against out-\nof-state handlers without the protection of minimum wholesale\nprices might make the over-order premium less feasible or\nencourage them to purchase out-of-state milk to avoid the\npremium. But we note that, under the current system,\nPennsylvania handlers already have an incentive to purchase\nout-of-state milk to maximize their profit margins, yet the over-\n\n\n                               38\n\forder premium remains strong. Moreover, even assuming\nPennsylvania could constitutionally impose over-order\npremiums on sales of milk to out-of-state purchasers (an issue\nwe do not decide here), doing so would presumably damage the\nCommonwealth’s ability to export milk by essentially adding a\nsurcharge on exports. And the Board has gone to great lengths\n(as explained below) to demonstrate several legal options\nhandlers use to sell milk at below minimum wholesale prices in\nPennsylvania, which suggests that invalidating the minimum\nwholesale prices would not necessarily harm the handlers’\nability to pay the over-order premium to producers.\n\n       If the minimum wholesale prices were invalidated, the\nPennsylvania legislature would be faced with these thorny\npolicy questions and would have to weigh the competing\nconsiderations to determine whether the over-order premium\nprovisions of 31 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 700j remain viable. There is\nsimply no way to determine, at this stage, whether the over-\norder premium would necessarily be repealed or extended to\nout-of-state purchasers of Pennsylvania milk. At best, the\nBoard’s evidence and the District Court’s opinion establish that\nsuch an event would be likely. We hold, though, that the\npossible removal of Cloverland’s purported out-of-state\nadvantage if it is successful on this appeal is insufficient to\nrender that advantage irrelevant to our heightened scrutiny\nanalysis.\n\n                            (2)    Availability of Non-Price\n\n\n                              39\n\f                                     Competition\n\n       We also are unpersuaded by the District Court’s reliance\non the availability of non-price competition in the Pennsylvania\nmarket. As we explain below, if Cloverland proves that its\nexemption from the over-order premium confers a cost\nadvantage over Pennsylvania handlers that is neutralized by the\nCommonwealth’s minimum wholesale prices, heightened\nscrutiny applies. The fact that Cloverland might be able to\ncompete for some retailer accounts on non-price bases is\nirrelevant, because even if there are other potential paths into the\nPennsylvania market that may allow an out-of-state handler\nsuccessfully to obtain some business, neutralizing an out-of-\nstate price advantage alone offends the dormant Commerce\nClause (especially since the record amply demonstrates that\nprice is — or, at least, would be if competition on price were\nallowed — an important factor retailers consider in choosing a\nsupplier).

The fact\nthat Cloverland may compete on bases in which it does not\nenjoy an advantage (and on which it would, therefore, have\nconsiderable difficulty displacing an incumbent handler from an\nestablished account with a retailer, especially a retailer that is\nprimarily concerned with price) resolve the constitutional\nproblem.\n\n                               41\n\f                     b.     Factual Support for District Court’s\n                            Decision\n\n        Notwithstanding these errors in the District Court’s\nanalysis, we conclude it was not clearly erroneous for the Court\nto find that Cloverland did not sustain its burden of proving an\nactual raw milk cost advantage belonging to its place of origin.\nCloverland’s proof of its alleged cost advantage consisted\nprimarily of testimony from Lawrence Webster, Cloverland’s\ngeneral manager, and Robert Havemeyer, a management\nconsultant who testified as an expert in the costs of processing\nand delivering milk. Webster testified that, by not adding the\nover-order premium to the 65% of raw milk it purchases from\nindependent Pennsylvania farmers, Cloverland saves about five\ncents per gallon, which would allow Cloverland to lower its\nwholesale prices enough to gain a significant price advantage\nover Pennsylvania competitors. Havemeyer testified that, based\non a survey of Cloverland’s costs during a 13-week period in the\nfall of 1998 (when demand was at its peak), and updated in\n2002, Cloverland’s variable costs (i.e., costs that vary with the\nvolume of production) allowed it to sell its milk in Pennsylvania\nbelow wholesale minimum prices.\n\n       Notably absent from Cloverland’s offer of proof,\nhowever, was any comparison to actual Pennsylvania\ncompetitors’ costs, despite the fact this was crucial to\ndemonstrating a cost advantage vis a vis those competitors. At\nmost, Cloverland proved it was capable of selling milk for less\n\n\n                               42\n\fthan the wholesale minimum, but (as explained above) this is\nnot in itself sufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny.\n\n        Carl Herbein, who testified for the Board as an expert in\nmilk cost accounting, conducted the comparison with\nPennsylvania handlers that Cloverland’s expert did not, and\nconcluded that Cloverland’s total costs rendered it less efficient\nthan three of the four sample handlers. Herbein explained, and\nthe District Court agreed, that Havemeyer’s calculations were\nunreliable because they used an unreasonably small time frame,\nrelied only on Cloverland’s variable costs (rather than looking\nat total costs),18 and considered a time when demand was at its\n\n\n    18\n          We observed in Cloverland I that, based solely on\nCloverland’s evidence, it appeared that “fixing prices based on\naverage total costs” — which includes variable costs and fixed\ncosts “such as equipment, office space, and other ‘overhead’\nexpenses” — “significantly increases dealers’ profits because it\nwill be in their economic interest to sell additional units of milk\nat any price above their average variable costs, even if below\ntheir total costs. Outside Pennsylvania, in contrast, milk dealers\ngenerally offer prices based on their average variable costs.”\n298 F.3d at 208. Herbein and Havemeyer presented conflicting\nevidence on this point at trial, and the District Court agreed with\nHerbein that an analysis of total costs is necessary to take into\naccount fully the costs of production. Since this conclusion is\nsupported by Herbein’s testimony, and Cloverland has not\nshown that the testimony is demonstrably untrue, the District\nCourt’s conclusion is not clearly erroneous.\n\n                                43\n\fpeak rather than a period representative of the full year.\nHerbein, and other witnesses offered by the Board, also\nexplained that the cost advantage resulting from Cloverland’s\nexemption from the over-order premium vis a vis a particular\nPennsylvania competitor may be mitigated by the fact that\nCloverland pays a slightly higher federal price for raw milk\nbecause it is located in Maryland,19 and many Pennsylvania\nhandlers avoid paying minimum wholesale prices by entering\ntolling agreements20 and taking advantage of allowable\n\n\n   19\n      Although Pennsylvania Areas 1 and 4 and the State of\nMaryland are all under the Northeast federal order, there are\nnumerous price differentials that set various minimum prices\nthroughout the order. See, e.g., U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Northeast\nStates Class I Differentials, available at\nhttp://www.fmmone.com/New_Zone_Diffs/\nNEZoneDiffMap.pdf.\n   20\n       A tolling agreement is a state-approved service contract\nwhereby a handler contracts with a large retailer that is\nvertically integrated (i.e., processes its own milk) to process,\npackage, and deliver milk to the retailer. Essentially, the\nhandler acts as a proxy for the retailer’s milk processing\noperation, and thereby avoids charging minimum wholesale\nprices.\n        We have previously held that “out-of-state dealers’\nability to enter into tolling agreements [does not] meaningfully\nmitigate[] the burden on interstate commerce,” because only\nabout one-third of wholesale milk sales in Pennsylvania are\nmade pursuant to tolling, and “[t]he dormant Commerce Clause\n\n                              44\n\fdiscounts for high volume sales, partial service (i.e., delivering\nthe milk to a retailer but not stocking it in the cooler or ordering\nfuture inventory), and multi-store customers. None of this was\nreflected in Cloverland’s offer of proof at trial, which relied on\na straightforward comparison between the price of raw milk\nwith the over-order premium and the price of milk without it.\n\n       Cloverland argues strenuously that the Board’s data is\nflawed. It contends, first, that the Board purposely selected\nsample handlers with lower operating costs than Cloverland, and\nargues specifically against the inclusion of “Dealer 4”,21 which\n\n\ndoes not allow Pennsylvania to hamper out-of-state dealers in\ntwo-thirds of its wholesale market on the ground that they may\ncompete freely in the remaining third.” Cloverland I, 298 F.3d\nat 218 (citing Wyoming, 502 U.S. at 455). We adhere fully to\nthis holding. Thus, the Board’s evidence at trial, and argument\non appeal, that tolling is available to Cloverland as a means to\navoid minimum wholesale prices do not defeat Cloverland’s\ndormant Commerce Clause challenge. But, as explained below,\nthe plaintiff in a case like this must prove an out-of-state\nadvantage over similarly situated in-state handlers, and in\nconducting this comparison the plaintiff must take account of\nthe circumstances of the in-state handlers over which it claims\nto have an advantage. Since Cloverland did not analyze\nPennsylvania handlers’ costs, the District Court did not clearly\nerr in relying on the Board’s comparison.\n   21\n      The relative costs of milk handlers are trade secrets, and\nthus the sample dairies are referenced by pseudonyms.\n\n                                45\n\fis not located within a federal order area and moves less than\n25% of its total Class I milk volume into that area, and thus is\nonly partially regulated by federal law.

Espy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1511352/sani-dairy-a-div-of-penn-traffic-co-v-espy/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412 (W.D. Pa. 1993) (same under earlier federal\norder regulations). Herbein testified, and Cloverland does not\ndispute, that a partially regulated handler like Dealer 4 need not\naccount to the Producer Settlement Fund, and is therefore able\nto pay producers more for raw milk (which gives it a price\nadvantage over fully regulated handlers, and a corresponding\ncost advantage when the market price of raw milk is higher than\nthe federal minimum). See 7 C.F.R. § 1000.76. Since\nCloverland is fully regulated federally, and must account to the\nProducer Settlement Fund, it argues a comparison with the\npartially regulated Dealer 4 is irrelevant.\n\n       Cloverland’s argument misses the mark. Dealer 4 would\nclearly be a competitor in the Pennsylvania market; although\nDealer 4 cannot sell more than 25% of its total milk volume into\na federal order area and remain partially regulated, it could still\ncompete with Cloverland for retail outlets in Areas 1 and 4 with\nthe milk it does move into the order area. Dealer 4 is not,\ntherefore, a wholly irrelevant comparison. Cloverland’s\nargument is really addressed to whether Dealer 4 is a proper\nrepresentative for comparison. Yet Cloverland had every\nopportunity to submit evidence of similarly situated\nPennsylvania handlers with comparatively higher costs, and it\nfailed to do so. As the Board was the only one to submit\n\n\n                                46\n\fevidence of comparative costs, the District Court did not clearly\nerr in relying on the Board’s sample.\n\n       Second, Cloverland argues Herbein erroneously relied on\nthe “plant blend” cost of raw milk (i.e., the weighted average of\nthe costs of different classes of milk used by the plant, which is\npaid to producers), rather than a segregated Class I price, in\nconducting his analysis of comparative costs. This, according\nto Cloverland, artificially lowered the costs of plants with less\nClass I usage than Cloverland. The Board counters that the\nplant blend method of calculating costs is the norm in the\nindustry and comports with generally accepted accounting\npractices.\n\n       Although Cloverland’s argument may have some merit,22\n\n\n  22\n     Herbein justified his reliance on the plant blend cost — as\ndoes the Board in its arguments on appeal — by noting that\nplant blend is an accepted method of pricing the cost of raw\nmilk, and reflects the way handlers actually operate (i.e., by\npurchasing Grade A raw milk and only later deciding how it will\nbe classified). While we have no doubt plant blend is\nrecognized and accepted in the industry, here Cloverland\ncontends that its exemption from the over-order premium (which\napplies only to purchases of Class I raw milk) gives it an\nadvantage over other purchasers of Class I raw milk. Reliance\non the plant blend cost in determining Cloverland’s advantage\nover other handlers makes sense only if Cloverland and the\nPennsylvania handlers to which it is compared have the same\n\n                               47\n\fwe note that it submitted no evidence that the sample handlers\n(which Herbein testified were “very similar” to Cloverland in\nterms of size, volume, and gross sales) had appreciably different\nClass I usage. Havemeyer provided evidence of Cloverland’s\nClass I costs, but did not compare these to any actual\nPennsylvania competitors, and the District Court expressly\nfound his study unreliable due to its limited time frame and\nexamination of only variable costs. Again, under these\ncircumstances, we cannot conclude that the District Court\n\n\nClass I usage. Otherwise, as Cloverland argues, the comparison\nwill be flawed: because it has a high Class I usage, its plant\nblend cost will be artificially higher than a plant with lower\nClass I usage, even though the cost of its Class I milk alone may\nbe lower than the Pennsylvania competitor.\n        Of course, it may be difficult to calculate a discrete\n“Class I” cost because if (as the Board persuasively argued, and\nthe District Court found) it is appropriate to consider the total\ncosts of production — including fixed costs like capital\ninvestment, facilities, equipment, and other overhead — in\ndeciding whether one handler has a cost or efficiency advantage\nover another, it would be an arduous task to separate out the\nportion of fixed costs attributable to the production of Class I\nmilk, as many fixed costs are directed at processing raw milk\nregardless of its end use. It may be, then, that plant blend is an\nunavoidable consequence of the way handlers actually work,\nthough we still think it most useful if the two handlers compared\nuse roughly the same amount of raw milk as Class I. But, as we\nexplain, in this case Cloverland’s failure of proof makes it\nunnecessary to resolve this question.\n\n                               48\n\fcommitted clear error by relying on the only comparative\nevidence before it.\n\n                      *    *    *    *   *\n\n        To be sure, we do not mean to suggest that a defendant\nin a case such as this may defeat heightened scrutiny merely by\nshowing that the plaintiff does not have a competitive advantage\nover some of its putative competitors. Such a rule would be at\nodds with the well-established principle that “‘a statute may be\ninvalid if it favors only a single or finite set of businesses.’”\nCloverland I, 298 F.3d at 214 (quoting Harvey & Harvey, 68\nF.3d at 798). But this does not relieve a plaintiff like Cloverland\nof its burden of proving, as part of its prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, that it has an actual competitive advantage over\nsome of its prospective competitors because it is an out-of-state\nfirm. Cloverland should have established that its exemption\nfrom the over-order premium gave it a relevant cost advantage\nover similarly situated Pennsylvania competitors that translated\ninto an ability to sell wholesale milk at a lower cost.23 Had it\n\n  23\n      Herbein’s testimony indicated that Cloverland had a cost\nadvantage over one of the four sample dairies offered by the\nBoard (which Herbein selected because they were similarly\nsituated to Cloverland), but Cloverland offered no proof that this\ncost advantage arose because of its out-of-state status. In any\nevent, given the totality of the Board’s evidence, the District\nCourt did not clearly err in deciding (implicitly) that evidence of\na cost advantage over one similarly situated Pennsylvania\n\n                                49\n\fdone so, the Board could (of course) have attempted to rebut this\nproof by showing that Cloverland did not have an actual cost\nadvantage over its competitors, or its cost advantage was not\nrelated to its out-of-state status. The District Court would then\nhave had to weigh the evidence. But Cloverland’s evidence did\nnot compare its costs to the costs of its competitors, and thus the\nCourt did not commit clear error when it held that Cloverland\nfailed to sustain its burden of proving an out-of-state\ncompetitive advantage vis a vis its Pennsylvania competitors\nthat is neutralized by the Commonwealth’s mandatory minimum\nwholesale prices. In this context, we do not have facts calling\nfor heightened scrutiny.\n\n       C.      Pike Balancing\n\n        Having concluded that Cloverland failed to prove the\napplicability of heightened scrutiny, we proceed to the Pike\nbalancing test. Pike, 397 U.S. at 142. As noted, when a law\n“effectuate[s] a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on\ninterstate commerce are only incidental,” the court must\ndetermine whether “the burden imposed on such commerce is\nclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.” Id.\nThe District Court concluded that Pennsylvania’s mandatory\nminimum wholesale milk prices survive this test.\n\n\nhandler, owing possibly to Cloverland’s exemption from the\nover-order premium, was not sufficient to trigger heightened\nscrutiny.\n\n                                 50\n\f        Cloverland argues that the “benefits” conferred by the\nminimum wholesale prices are merely economic protectionism,\n“the very evil the Commerce Clause seeks to prohibit.”\nAppellant’s Br. at 40. The District Court disagreed, crediting\nthe Board’s witnesses who testified that minimum wholesale\nprices make it easier for handlers to pay the over-order\npremium. The over-order premium, in turn, helps small,\nindependent dairy farms remain profitable without joining\ncooperatives, which fosters market diversity and prevents a\npossible future rise in retail prices. Indeed, the District Court\nwas persuaded by expert testimony offered by the Board that the\nabolition of minimum prices in California led to consolidation\nof farms and handlers into a few dominant market participants,\nresulting eventually in a sharp rise in consumer prices. The\nDistrict Court also credited testimony offered by the Board that\nif small farms went out of business, “the agricultural\ninfrastructure built around the industry will also be negatively\naffected, resulting in the loss of dealers, feed stores,\nveterinarians, and other business[es] that support the dairy\nindustry.” Cloverland II, slip op. at 9, 26.\n\n       Although Cloverland presented testimony tending to\nestablish the opposite — that the abolition of minimum\nwholesale prices would have no adverse effect on the dairy\nindustry, which would continue to thrive as it does in other\nstates — the District Court was entitled to base its ultimate\nfactual conclusion on the Board’s evidence. “As we have\nrecognized, the clearly erroneous standard of review does not\n\n\n                               51\n\fpermit an appellate court to substitute its findings for those of\nthe trial court.

Cloverland offered testimony that the\nminimum prices prevented it from competing in the\nPennsylvania milk market, and thus the burdens on interstate\ncommerce were substantial. As noted, the Board offered\ntestimony that several other forms of competition exist in the\nPennsylvania market,24 and therefore the minimum wholesale\n\n\n 24\n     Although we held above that evidence of other competitive\noutlets is not relevant to the question of whether heightened\nscrutiny applies — because, as explained, the only relevant\ninquiry in making that determination is whether an out-of-state\ncompetitive advantage is neutralized by Pennsylvania law — the\npresence of other forms of competition is one of many factors\nthat may be taken into account under the Pike balancing test,\nwhere the inquiry concerns the magnitude of the incidental\nburden on commerce and the countervailing benefits of the law.\n\n                               52\n\fprices do not entirely prevent new competitors from challenging\nincumbent handlers and moving their milk interstate. As with\nthe benefits of the law, the District Court was forced to choose\nbetween conflicting evidence, and we cannot say its choice was\nclearly erroneous. Thus, we affirm the District Court’s holding\nthat Cloverland failed to sustain its burden of proving that the\nincidental burdens of Pennsylvania’s minimum wholesale milk\nprices outweigh the putative benefits.\n\n                        V. Conclusion\n\n       In Cloverland I, we expressed our unease with the fact\nthat Pennsylvania is the only state with mandatory price controls\nof the sort described in this case, while its milk industry\n(dominated by in-state firms) is flourishing. In our view, the\nBoard’s argument that the price controls are the only thing\npreventing a vulnerable milk industry from complete collapse\n(and a concomitant disruption in the supply of milk to\nPennsylvania’s residents) rings hollow in light of the undisputed\nevidence that Pennsylvania exports far more milk than its\nresidents consume,25 and other states appear to do quite well\n\n\n\n\n    25\n       In Cloverland I, we noted that “Pennsylvania’s dairy\nindustry is among our nation’s most productive. Milk\nproduction in the Commonwealth outpaces consumption by\nroughly 350%. Annual production per-capita [for Pennsylvania\nresidents] is around 900 pounds; consumption [by Pennsylvania\n\n                               53\n\fwithout mandatory minimum prices. It is quite likely, as we\nstated on the limited factual record in Cloverland I, that\npreventing competition based on price works to the advantage\nof Pennsylvania’s resident handlers by helping maintain their\ndominance in the market. Indeed, there is apparently no\npolitical incentive for in-state handlers to resist the price\ncontrols, as evidenced by the fact that the Pennsylvania\nAssociation of Milk Dealers has intervened in support of the\nchallenged law. Cf. West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 200-01\n(“[O]ne would ordinarily have expected at least three groups to\nlobby against the order premium, which, as a tax, raises the\nprice (and hence lowers demand) for milk: dairy farmers, milk\ndealers, and consumers. But because the tax was coupled with\na subsidy, one of the most powerful of these groups,\nMassachusetts dairy farmers, instead of exerting their influence\nagainst the tax, were in fact its primary supporters. . . . [Thus,]\n[the] State’s political processes can no longer be relied upon to\nprevent legislative abuse.”).\n\n       Cloverland failed to prove its case, however, and the\nDistrict Court cannot be faulted for relying on the evidence\npresented at trial. But our opinion today does not settle the\nquestion of the Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Law’s\nconstitutionality. Indeed, if another out-of-state plaintiff can\nprove it has competitive advantages over actual Pennsylvania\ncompetitors belonging to its place of origin (whether by virtue\n\n\nresidents] per-capita is merely 200 pounds.” 298 F.3d at 206.\n\n                                54\n\fof its exemption from the over-order premium or otherwise),26\nand these advantages translate into an actual ability to sell milk\nfor less than similarly situated Pennsylvania handlers that is\nneutralized by the minimum wholesale prices, heightened\nscrutiny would apply.27 Cloverland lost this case because its\nevidence was insufficient, but the constitutionality of\nPennsylvania’s minimum wholesale prices remains unresolved.\n\n         In this context, the District Court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n   26\n       The District Court noted, for example, that “if . . . [a]\ncompetitive price advantage arose from [out-of-state] firms’\nability to buy cheap local milk, the wholesale price floor would\nfall under a heightened scrutiny analysis.” Cloverland II, slip\nop. at 18 n.13.\n    27\n        We have already held that “[i]f they are subject to\nheightened scrutiny, the wholesale price floors cannot satisfy the\ndormant Commerce Clause” because Pennsylvania could\n“achieve its objective through alternative measures that do not\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce” — by acting as a\nmarket participant, for example. Cloverland I, 298 F.3d at 215.\nThis holding would, of course, apply in any future challenge to\nthe minimum wholesale prices.\n\n                                 55\n\f</pre>",
