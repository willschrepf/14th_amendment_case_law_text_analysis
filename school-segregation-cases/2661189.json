Martone, Assistant Attorney\n                                                       General, for George Jepsen, Attorney\n                                                       General of Connecticut, Hartford, CT.\n\n       Appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut\n(Covello, J.).\n\n       UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\n\nDECREED that the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n       Plaintiff-Appellant Michael Edwards brought a civil rights action against\n\nDefendants-Appellees, supervisory officials in the Connecticut Department of Corrections,\n\nalleging that they enacted a policy under which Edwards and other inmates with disciplinary\n\nproblems were subject to full restraints—with hands cuffed behind their backs and ankles\n\nshackled—during their out-of-cell recreation periods. On appeal, Edwards challenges the district\n\ncourt’s judgment (Covello, J.), which granted summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds\n\nas to Edwards’s Eighth Amendment claim. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the underlying\n\nfacts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\n       We review de novo a grant of summary judgment, “view[ing] the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.”\n\nCox v. Warwick Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 654 F.3d 267, 271 (2d Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate where “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n       Qualified immunity shields public officials “from liability for civil damages insofar as\n\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982) (internal\n\n                                                  2\n\fquotation marks omitted). The defendants bear the burden of establishing their entitlement to\n\nqualified immunity. See Vincent v. Yelich, 718 F.3d 157, 166 (2d Cir. 2013). “The issues on\n\nqualified immunity are: (1) whether plaintiff has shown facts making out violation of a\n\nconstitutional right; (2) if so, whether that right was clearly established; and (3) even if the right\n\nwas clearly established, whether it was objectively reasonable for the [officials] to believe the\n\nconduct at issue was lawful.” Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 728 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir. 2013)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because courts need not address these prongs sequentially, see\n\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009), we focus here on the second and third prongs of\n\nthe Gonzalez inquiry.\n\n       “A right is ‘clearly established’ if ‘the contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a\n\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.’” LaBounty v.\n\nCoughlin, 137 F.3d 68, 73 (2d Cir. 1998) (alterations omitted) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton,\n\n483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). To determine whether a right is clearly established, we consider\n\n“whether the right in question was defined with reasonable specificity,” “whether the decisional\n\nlaw of the Supreme Court and the applicable circuit court support the existence of the right in\n\nquestion,” and “whether under preexisting law a reasonable defendant official would have\n\nunderstood that his or her acts were unlawful.” Dean v. Blumenthal, 577 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009)\n\n(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The district court in this case described the right at issue as one “to recreate free from\n\nrestraints” and held that, as a matter of law, such a right was not clearly established. Appellant’s\n\nApp. 8–9. We disagree, however, and conclude that the district court erred in finding that no\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fclearly established right was implicated because the court defined the scope of the relevant right\n\ntoo narrowly.\n\n       To prevail on a conditions-of-confinement claim, an inmate must show that he suffered a\n\nsufficiently serious deprivation and that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference. See\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). A prisoner suffers a sufficiently serious deprivation\n\nwhen prison officials fail to furnish him with “life’s necessities.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S.\n\n337, 347 (1981). Accordingly, we have recognized that “the Eighth Amendment requires that\n\nprison inmates be allowed some out-of-cell exercise.” Williams v. Greifinger, 97 F.3d 699, 704 n.5\n\n(2d Cir. 1996). That right is limited, however, where there is a valid safety exception or certain\n\nunusual circumstances. See id. at 704. Additionally, when a restriction on exercise is imposed,\n\nprison officials must perform “a detailed review” of feasible alternatives. Id. at 705 (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). Taken together, our earlier decisions have clearly\n\nestablished a right for inmates to have some meaningful opportunity for exercise, unless the prison\n\nhas a legitimate safety justification and has adequately considered feasible alternatives. As such,\n\nthe district court erred by defining the scope of the right at issue too narrowly and by concluding\n\nthat no right implicated in this case is clearly established.\n\n       Next, even though inmates have a clearly established right to some meaningful opportunity\n\nto exercise subject to a safety exception and adequate consideration of alternatives, the question\n\nremains whether “‘reasonable persons in [the defendants’] position would not have understood\n\nthat their conduct was within the scope of the established prohibition.’” LaBounty, 137 F.3d at 73\n\n(quoting In re State Police Litig., 88 F.3d 111, 123 (2d Cir. 1996)). To be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on this basis, a defendant must demonstrate that “no rational jury could fail to conclude”\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fthat it was reasonable for him to believe that his conduct did not violate the prisoner’s\n\nconstitutional right. Id. at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       We have recognized that a restriction on the meaningful opportunity to exercise must be\n\nbased on a valid security exception. See Williams, 97 F.3d at 704. Here, it is undisputed that while\n\nin Phase I of the Administrative Segregation Program, Edwards was permitted to attend outdoor\n\nrecreation only in full restraints, with his hands cuffed behind his back and his ankles shackled.\n\nSuch a restriction may be found to infringe an inmate’s right to some meaningful opportunity for\n\nexercise, and, if so, must be justified by legitimate safety considerations. Accordingly, if it finds\n\nunpersuasive a proffered safety justification, a reasonable jury could readily conclude that a\n\ncorrections official acted unreasonably by permitting an inmate to exercise only in full restraints.\n\nAfter all, a prison policy that required every inmate to remain in full restraints during out-of-cell\n\nexercise would not comport with the clearly established scope of the Eighth Amendment as to a\n\nparticular inmate, unless there were a persuasive safety justification for that inmate’s restraints.\n\n       In this case, the district court did not adequately consider whether material factual disputes\n\nremained as to the adequacy of the safety justification for the prison’s policy as it applied to\n\nEdwards. If there were in fact insufficient justification for applying this policy to Edwards, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that the defendants acted in violation of clearly established law.\n\nThe district court therefore erred by failing to consider the adequacy of the justification for the\n\nprison’s imposition of exercise restraints on Edwards.\n\n       The defendants nevertheless press that, even if the district court did not consider the\n\nadequacy of the safety justification, we should affirm because, at the time of the defendants’\n\nactions, “there was no decisional law requiring that inmates in [Phase I of Administrative\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fSegregation] exercise without handcuffs and leg restraints.” Appellees’ Br. 16. But “the absence of\n\nlegal precedent addressing an identical factual scenario does not necessarily yield a conclusion that\n\nthe law is not clearly established.” Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 239 F.3d 246, 251\n\n(2d Cir. 2001); see also Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002) (“[O]fficials can still be on\n\nnotice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”). Under\n\nexisting clearly established case law, a reasonable juror may conclude that reasonable officers\n\nwould agree that fully restraining inmates during out-of-cell exercise without an adequate safety\n\njustification is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the district court erred in granting qualified\n\nimmunity to the defendants without first considering whether disputed issues of fact precluded\n\nsummary judgment with respect to the adequacy of the defendants’ proffered safety justification\n\nfor the exercise-restraint policy imposed on Edwards. We therefore vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for the district court to consider in the first instance the adequacy of the safety justification\n\nfor the imposition of this policy on Edwards.\n\n       In vacating the district court’s judgment, we clarify that on this appeal we do not reach\n\nseveral questions, some of which may become relevant at later stages of this litigation. First, we do\n\nnot decide whether there is in fact a genuine factual dispute regarding the adequacy of the\n\ndefendants’ proffered safety justification or of their consideration of feasible alternatives.1\n\n\n1\n  In its decision below, the district court noted “that the plaintiff has not presented evidence to\nshow that he suffered any injury from attending recreation in full restraints.” Appellant’s App. 7.\nBut this statement is incorrect because Edwards produced a sworn affidavit in which he stated that\nhe suffered certain physical injuries as a result of the prison’s exercise-restraint policy. Although\nwe take no position as to the materiality of the dispute over Edwards’s alleged physical injuries,\nthe affidavit, which is consistent with the allegations that Edwards makes in his complaint, suffices\nto create a factual dispute on this issue. See, e.g., Hathaway v. Coughlin, 841 F.2d 48, 50–51 (2d\nCir. 1988). If necessary, the district court can consider on remand the materiality of the injuries\nthat Edwards allegedly suffered as a result of the exercise-restraint policy.\n\n                                                   6\n\fSecond, we do not resolve the factual disputes necessary to decide the merits of Edwards’s\n\nunderlying constitutional claim. As a result, we do not consider whether the defendants would be\n\nentitled to qualified immunity if there were in fact an adequate safety justification for imposing the\n\nexercise-restraint policy on Edwards. We similarly do not determine Edwards’s entitlement to\n\nequitable relief, which does not depend on the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity. See\n\nFord v. Reynolds, 316 F.3d 351, 356 & n.3 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n       For the reasons stated herein, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND\n\nthe case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.\n\n\n                                               FOR THE COURT:\n                                               Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f",

Accordingly, we have recognized that “the Eighth Amendment requires that\n\nprison inmates be allowed some out-of-cell exercise.” Williams v. Greifinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727315\"><a href=\"/opinion/727315/bobby-williams-v-robert-b-greifinger-deputy-commissioner-and-chief/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704 n.5\n\n(2d Cir. 1996). That right is limited, however, where there is a valid safety exception or certain\n\nunusual circumstances. See id. at 704. Additionally, when a restriction on exercise is imposed,\n\nprison officials must perform “a detailed review” of feasible alternatives. Id. at 705 (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). Taken together, our earlier decisions have clearly\n\nestablished a right for inmates to have some meaningful opportunity for exercise, unless the prison\n\nhas a legitimate safety justification and has adequately considered feasible alternatives. As such,\n\nthe district court erred by defining the scope of the right at issue too narrowly and by concluding\n\nthat no right implicated in this case is clearly established.\n\n       Next, even though inmates have a clearly established right to some meaningful opportunity\n\nto exercise subject to a safety exception and adequate consideration of alternatives, the question\n\nremains whether “‘reasonable persons in [the defendants’] position would not have understood\n\nthat their conduct was within the scope of the established prohibition.’” LaBounty, 137 F.3d at 73\n\n(quoting In re State Police Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721310\"><a href=\"/opinion/721310/in-re-state-police-litigation-connecticut-criminal-defense-lawyers/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (2d Cir. 1996)). To be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on this basis, a defendant must demonstrate that “no rational jury could fail to conclude”\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fthat it was reasonable for him to believe that his conduct did not violate the prisoner’s\n\nconstitutional right. Id. at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       We have recognized that a restriction on the meaningful opportunity to exercise must be\n\nbased on a valid security exception. See Williams, 97 F.3d at 704. Here, it is undisputed that while\n\nin Phase I of the Administrative Segregation Program, Edwards was permitted to attend outdoor\n\nrecreation only in full restraints, with his hands cuffed behind his back and his ankles shackled.\n\nSuch a restriction may be found to infringe an inmate’s right to some meaningful opportunity for\n\nexercise, and, if so, must be justified by legitimate safety considerations. Accordingly, if it finds\n\nunpersuasive a proffered safety justification, a reasonable jury could readily conclude that a\n\ncorrections official acted unreasonably by permitting an inmate to exercise only in full restraints.\n\nAfter all, a prison policy that required every inmate to remain in full restraints during out-of-cell\n\nexercise would not comport with the clearly established scope of the Eighth Amendment as to a\n\nparticular inmate, unless there were a persuasive safety justification for that inmate’s restraints.\n\n       In this case, the district court did not adequately consider whether material factual disputes\n\nremained as to the adequacy of the safety justification for the prison’s policy as it applied to\n\nEdwards. If there were in fact insufficient justification for applying this policy to Edwards, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that the defendants acted in violation of clearly established law.\n\nThe district court therefore erred by failing to consider the adequacy of the justification for the\n\nprison’s imposition of exercise restraints on Edwards.\n\n       The defendants nevertheless press that, even if the district court did not consider the\n\nadequacy of the safety justification, we should affirm because, at the time of the defendants’\n\nactions, “there was no decisional law requiring that inmates in [Phase I of Administrative\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fSegregation] exercise without handcuffs and leg restraints.” Appellees’ Br. 16. But “the absence of\n\nlegal precedent addressing an identical factual scenario does not necessarily yield a conclusion that\n\nthe law is not clearly established.” Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771972\"><a href=\"/opinion/771972/timothy-johnson-sr-and-luaine-sims-on-behalf-of-their-minor-son-tj-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251\n\n(2d Cir. 2001); see also Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (2002) (“[O]fficials can still be on\n\nnotice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”). Under\n\nexisting clearly established case law, a reasonable juror may conclude that reasonable officers\n\nwould agree that fully restraining inmates during out-of-cell exercise without an adequate safety\n\njustification is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the district court erred in granting qualified\n\nimmunity to the defendants without first considering whether disputed issues of fact precluded\n\nsummary judgment with respect to the adequacy of the defendants’ proffered safety justification\n\nfor the exercise-restraint policy imposed on Edwards. We therefore vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for the district court to consider in the first instance the adequacy of the safety justification\n\nfor the imposition of this policy on Edwards.\n\n       In vacating the district court’s judgment, we clarify that on this appeal we do not reach\n\nseveral questions, some of which may become relevant at later stages of this litigation. First, we do\n\nnot decide whether there is in fact a genuine factual dispute regarding the adequacy of the\n\ndefendants’ proffered safety justification or of their consideration of feasible alternatives.1\n\n\n1\n  In its decision below, the district court noted “that the plaintiff has not presented evidence to\nshow that he suffered any injury from attending recreation in full restraints.” Appellant’s App. 7.\nBut this statement is incorrect because Edwards produced a sworn affidavit in which he stated that\nhe suffered certain physical injuries as a result of the prison’s exercise-restraint policy. Although\nwe take no position as to the materiality of the dispute over Edwards’s alleged physical injuries,\nthe affidavit, which is consistent with the allegations that Edwards makes in his complaint, suffices\nto create a factual dispute on this issue. See, e.g., Hathaway v. Coughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502491\"><a href=\"/opinion/502491/william-hathaway-v-thomas-a-coughlin-commissioner-ew-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50–51 (2d\nCir. 1988). If necessary, the district court can consider on remand the materiality of the injuries\nthat Edwards allegedly suffered as a result of the exercise-restraint policy.\n\n                                                   6\n\fSecond, we do not resolve the factual disputes necessary to decide the merits of Edwards’s\n\nunderlying constitutional claim. As a result, we do not consider whether the defendants would be\n\nentitled to qualified immunity if there were in fact an adequate safety justification for imposing the\n\nexercise-restraint policy on Edwards. We similarly do not determine Edwards’s entitlement to\n\nequitable relief, which does not depend on the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity. See\n\nFord v. Reynolds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780506\"><a href=\"/opinion/780506/erica-ford-miriam-plata-quentin-walcott-jose-rivas-cinque-viola-plummer/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 & n.3 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n       For the reasons stated herein, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND\n\nthe case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.\n\n\n                                               FOR THE COURT:\n                                               Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f</pre>",
