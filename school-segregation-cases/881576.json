By their motion,\n\nplaintiffs challenge certain aspects of the final results of the\n\nUnited States Department of Commerce’s (“Commerce” or the\n\n“Department”) second administrative review of the antidumping\n\nduty order on honey from the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)\n\nfor the period of review, December 1, 2002, through November 30,\n\n2003 (“POR”).   See Honey from the PRC, 70 Fed. Reg. 38,873 (Dep’t\n\nof Commerce July 6, 2005) (final results) and the accompanying\n\nIssues and Decision Memorandum (June 27, 2005), Pub.

For the reasons that\n\nfollow, the court sustains the Final Results in part and remands\n\nthis case to Commerce for further action consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 3\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiffs Wuhan Bee and Presstek are, respectively, a\n\nproducer and exporter of honey from the PRC, and a honey importer\n\nand distributor in the United States.    During the POR, Wuhan Bee\n\nexported honey from the PRC (the “subject merchandise”) to its\n\naffiliate Presstek, which in turn sold the honey to Pure Sweet\n\nHoney (“PSH”), an affiliated honey blender.1    PSH then blended\n\nplaintiffs’ merchandise with honey from other countries and\n\nresold it to unaffiliated customers in the United States.\n\n\n\n     On December 2, 2003, Commerce published a notice of\n\nopportunity to request an administrative review of the\n\nantidumping duty order on honey from the PRC.    See Antidumping or\n\nCountervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation,\n\n68 Fed. Reg. 67,401 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 2, 2003) (notice).\n\nPursuant to the notice, Wuhan Bee asked for a review of its\n\nentries during the POR.   See Honey From the PRC, 69 Fed. Reg.\n\n77,184 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 27, 2004) (prelim.).    Commerce\n\ninitiated the second administrative review on January 22, 2003.\n\nSee Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Admin.\n\nRevs. and Req. for Revocation in Part, 68 Fed. Reg. 3009 (Dep’t\n\n\n\n     1\n          Commerce found Wuhan Bee was affiliated with Presstek\nfor a part of the POR, i.e., from July 20, 2003, forward.\nPresstek and PSH were affiliated during the entire POR. See\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 68.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 4\n\nof Commerce Jan. 22, 2003) (notice).\n\n\n\n     During the course of its review, Commerce issued\n\nquestionnaires to Wuhan Bee asking for information concerning,\n\namong other things, its sales to the United States (Section C);\n\nfactors of production (Section D); and costs associated with\n\nfurther manufacturing in the United States (Section E).    Commerce\n\nalso issued supplemental questionnaires to Wuhan Bee, which\n\nfocused on its calculation of “blend ratios.”2   That is, by these\n\nsupplemental questionnaires, Commerce sought to determine the\n\npercentage of Wuhan Bee’s honey contained in each sale of blended\n\nhoney made by PSH to unaffiliated U.S. customers.   As Commerce\n\nnoted in the Final Results, blend ratios are “essential to the\n\nreported U.S. sales and further manufacturing databases because\n\nthe ratios determine whether a particular honey sale is of\n\nsubject or non-subject merchandise and the quantity of the sale\n\nof subject merchandise.”   Issues & Dec. Mem. at 80.\n\n\n\n     Commerce notified Wuhan Bee that it would verify its\n\nquestionnaire responses pertaining to U.S. sales made through\n\n\n\n     2\n          Wuhan Bee first identified “blend ratios” in its\nSection C response as “the percentage of subject honey contained\nwithin the honey resold by Wuhan Bee’s U.S. affiliate . . . .”\nWuhan Bee’s Sec. C Ques. Resp., Conf.

See CEP\n\nVerification Outline (Apr. 20, 2005), Conf. Doc. 101 at 7, 9.      In\n\nparticular, Commerce asked Wuhan Bee to be prepared to provide\n\n“[d]ocumentation supporting the ‘blend ratio,’” so that the\n\nverifiers could trace data from documents to the responses.      CEP\n\nVerification Outline, Conf. Doc. 101 at 8.    It also instructed\n\nWuhan Bee to “[p]lease be prepared to demonstrate the blend ratio\n\nfor all sales . . . and provide support documentation for all\n\ncosts associated with further manufacturing . . . as reported in\n\nyour questionnaire responses.”   CEP Verification Outline, Conf.\n\nDoc. 101 at 9.\n\n\n\n     At verification, Commerce selected fifty-one U.S. sales\n\ninvoices for review from Wuhan Bee’s U.S. sales databases.\n\n\n     3\n          Presstek and PSH shared a physical address in Verona,\nWisconsin. See Verification of U.S. Sales and Further\nManufacturing Expenses for Wuhan Bee, Conf. Doc. 106 at 1 n.2.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 6\n\nTwenty-six of the invoices were selected from a database\n\nproviding information about sales of subject and non-subject\n\nmerchandise during the POR.   For five of the twenty-six invoices,\n\ncompany officials failed to provide supporting documentation.      As\n\nfor the other twenty-one invoices, Commerce found discrepancies\n\nin blend ratios in three of them.    The remaining twenty-five\n\ninvoices were selected from a database that quantified the\n\ndifferences between the amount of subject merchandise sold by\n\nWuhan Bee to its affiliates and the amount of subject merchandise\n\nin the blended honey sold to unaffiliated U.S. customers.    For\n\nnine of the twenty-five invoices, company officials were unable\n\nto provide supporting documentation, and for the remaining\n\nsixteen, Commerce found discrepancies with respect to the\n\nreported blend ratios/blend content for thirteen of the invoices.\n\nSee Verification Rep., Conf. Doc. 106 at 3.\n\n\n\n     On May 19, 2005, plaintiffs filed a brief with Commerce\n\n(“Case Brief”) in an attempt to correct deficiencies in blend\n\nratios discovered at verification.    Commerce rejected an\n\nattachment to the Case Brief and the narrative references to the\n\nattachment, claiming they were “new information” that was\n\nuntimely filed and thus could not be verified.    Plaintiffs were\n\ngiven an opportunity to submit a redacted version of the Case\n\nBrief, i.e., one with the claimed untimely new information\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 7\n\nomitted, which they did on May 24, 2005.    See Letter from\n\nCommerce to Bruce M. Mitchell of 5/23/05, Conf. Doc. 113; see\n\nalso Letter from Bruce M. Mitchell to Commerce of 5/24/05, Conf.\n\nDoc. 116.\n\n\n\n     On July 6, 2005, Commerce published notice of the Final\n\nResults.    See Honey from the PRC, 70 Fed. Reg. at 38,873.   In the\n\nFinal Results, Commerce applied adverse facts available (“AFA”)\n\nto sales made by Wuhan Bee through affiliated parties in the\n\nUnited States, i.e., Presstek and PSH, after July 20, 2003, and\n\nassigned an antidumping duty rate of 183.80% to those sales.\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 82.\n\n\n\n     By their motion, plaintiffs challenge Commerce’s decision to\n\nuse AFA.    They also challenge Commerce’s valuation of the factors\n\nof production of the subject merchandise (in particular, raw\n\nhoney and labor) and Commerce’s calculation of surrogate\n\nfinancial ratios, i.e., the cost of factory overhead; selling,\n\ngeneral and administrative expenses; and profit.   Finally, they\n\nchallenge Commerce’s decision to change the methodology it used\n\nto calculate the assessment rate and cash deposit rate from an ad\n\nvalorem basis to a per kilogram basis.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 8\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     The court reviews the Final Results under the substantial\n\nevidence and in accordance with law standard, set forth in\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i) (“The court shall hold unlawful any\n\ndetermination, finding, or conclusion found . . . to be\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise\n\nnot in accordance with law . . . .”).    “Substantial evidence is\n\n‘such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n\nadequate to support a conclusion.’”     Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp.\n\n(30) v.

Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, 744 F.2d 1556, 1562\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1984)).   The court “must affirm [Commerce’s]\n\ndetermination if it is reasonable and supported by the record as\n\na whole, even if some evidence detracts from [Commerce’s]\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                      Page 9\n\nconclusion.”   Nippon Steel Corp. v.

In addition, “[a]s long as the agency’s methodology\n\nand procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory\n\npurpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record\n\nsupporting the agency’s conclusions, the court will not impose\n\nits own views as to the sufficiency of the agency’s investigation\n\nor question the agency’s methodology.”   Ceramica Regiomontana,\n\nS.A. v.

Commerce’s Use of Facts Available/Adverse Facts Available\n     with respect to Wuhan Bee’s U.S. Sales\n\n     In determining whether the subject merchandise is being, or\n\nis likely to be, sold at less than fair value, 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677b(a) requires Commerce to make “a fair comparison . . .\n\nbetween the export price or constructed export price and normal\n\nvalue.”   Because a portion of Wuhan Bee’s U.S. sales during the\n\nPOR were made through its U.S. affiliates, Presstek and PSH,\n\nCommerce compared the “constructed export price” of the subject\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 10\n\nmerchandise to normal value.4   “Constructed export price” is\n\n“the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold . . .\n\nin the United States . . . by or for the account of the producer\n\nor exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with\n\nthe producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the\n\nproducer or exporter,” as adjusted.   19 U.S.C. § 1677a(b).\n\n\n\n     In this case, the first sale of Wuhan Bee’s honey to an\n\nunaffiliated U.S. purchaser was made through PSH after it had\n\nblended Wuhan Bee’s honey with honey from other sources.    The\n\n“blend ratios” for the sales Wuhan Bee made through PSH, i.e.,\n\nthe percentage of subject merchandise in each sale, were an\n\nimportant element in the calculation of constructed export price.\n\nIn the Final Results, Commerce found that many of Wuhan Bee’s\n\nreported blend ratios could not be verified as accurate.    Issues\n\n& Dec. Mem. at 79 (“Of the invoices that we reviewed at\n\nverification, 43 percent failed to be verified as accurate.\n\nThus, the Department determines that Wuhan Bee’s reported blend\n\nratios cannot be verified.”).\n\n\n\n     Where a respondent in an administrative review provides\n\ninformation that Commerce cannot verify, the Department is\n\n\n\n     4\n          Commerce’s construction of normal value is discussed\ninfra in Part II.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 11\n\npermitted to “fill[] gaps in the record” using facts otherwise\n\navailable.   Statement of Administrative Action, H.R. Doc. No.\n\n103-316, at 869 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040,\n\n4198–99 (“SAA”).   The relevant section of the antidumping duty\n\nstatute, 19 U.S.C. § 1677e, requires Commerce to determine (1)\n\nwhether to use facts otherwise available; and, if reliance on\n\nsuch facts is warranted, (2) whether to use an adverse inference\n\nin selecting from among the facts otherwise available.   First,\n\nunder subsection 1677e(a):\n\n          If——\n                 (1) necessary information is not\n                 available on the record, or\n\n                 (2) an interested party or any\n                 other person——\n\n                      (A) withholds information\n                      that has been requested\n                      by [Commerce] . . .\n                      under this subtitle,\n\n                      (B) fails to provide such\n                      information by the\n                      deadlines for submission\n                      of the information or in\n                      the form and manner\n                      requested . . .,\n\n                      (C) significantly impedes\n                      a proceeding under this\n                      subtitle, or\n\n                      (D) provides such\n                      information but the\n                      information cannot be\n                      verified as provided in\n                      section 1677m(i) of this\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 12\n\n                     title,5\n\n          [Commerce] . . . shall, subject to section\n          1677m(d) of this title, use the facts\n          otherwise available in reaching the\n          applicable determination under this subtitle.\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1677e(a).   As the Court of Appeals for the Federal\n\nCircuit has held:\n\n          The focus of subsection (a) is respondent’s\n          failure to provide information. The reason\n          for the failure is of no moment. The mere\n          failure of a respondent to furnish requested\n          information—for any reason—requires Commerce\n          to resort to other sources of information to\n          complete the factual record on which it makes\n          its determination.\n\nNippon Steel Corp. v. United States, 337 F.3d 1373, 1381 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2003) (emphasis in original).   Thus, subsection (a) mandates\n\nthe use of facts otherwise available when a respondent provides\n\nCommerce with information that “cannot be verified.”   19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677e(a)(2)(D).\n\n\n\n     Once it determines that the use of facts otherwise available\n\nis required, Commerce, in some circumstances, may use an\n\ninference that is adverse to the interests of the respondent in\n\nselecting from the facts on the record.   Pursuant to subsection\n\n\n\n     5\n          Subsection 1677m(i) requires Commerce to verify all\ninformation relied upon in reaching its final results under 19\nU.S.C. § 1675(a), if (1) verification is timely requested by an\ninterested party; and (2) no verification was made during the two\nimmediately preceding reviews of the same order. See 19 U.S.C.\n§ 1677m(i)(3)(A)-(B).\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                          Page 13\n\n1677e(b):\n\n            If [Commerce] . . . finds that an interested\n            party has failed to cooperate by not acting\n            to the best of its ability to comply with a\n            request for information from\n            [Commerce] . . ., [Commerce] . . ., in\n            reaching the applicable determination under\n            this subtitle, may use an inference that is\n            adverse to the interests of that party in\n            selecting from among the facts otherwise\n            available.\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1677e(b).    The Nippon Steel Court stated that, as\n\ndistinguished from subsection (a),\n\n            subsection (b) permits Commerce to “use an\n            inference that is adverse to the interests of\n            [a respondent] in selecting from among the\n            facts otherwise available,” only if Commerce\n            makes the separate determination that the\n            respondent “has failed to cooperate by not\n            acting to the best of its ability to comply.”\n            The focus of subsection (b) is respondent’s\n            failure to cooperate to the best of its\n            ability, not its failure to provide requested\n            information.\n\nNippon Steel, 337 F.3d at 1381 (quoting 19 U.S.C. § 1677e(b))\n\n(emphasis and alteration in original).    “[T]he statutory mandate\n\nthat a respondent act to ‘the best of its ability’ requires the\n\nrespondent to do the maximum it is able to do.”    Id. at 1382.\n\n\n\n     Determining whether a respondent did the maximum it was able\n\nto do to comply with Commerce’s requests involves both objective\n\nand subjective inquiries.    First, Commerce must make “an\n\nobjective showing that a reasonable and responsible importer\n\nwould have known that the requested information was required to\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 14\n\nbe kept and maintained under the applicable statutes, rules, and\n\nregulations.”     Nippon Steel, 337 F.3d at 1382 (citation omitted).\n\nSecond, Commerce must make a subjective showing that the\n\nrespondent not only has failed promptly to produce the requested\n\ninformation, “but further that the failure to fully respond is\n\nthe result of the respondent’s lack of cooperation in either: (a)\n\nfailing to keep and maintain all required records, or (b) failing\n\nto put forth its maximum efforts to investigate and obtain the\n\nrequested information from its records.”     Id. at 1382-83.\n\n\n\n     Finally, for the court to sustain the application of AFA,\n\nCommerce must “articulate why it concluded that a party failed to\n\nact to the best of its ability, and explain why the absence of\n\nthis information [was] of significance to the progress of its\n\ninvestigation.”     Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG v. United States, 23\n\nCIT 826, 839, 77 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1313-14 (1999).\n\n\n\n     In the Final Results, Commerce concluded that the use of\n\nfacts available was required for Wuhan Bee’s U.S. sales to its\n\naffiliates because its reported blend ratios could not be\n\nverified as accurate.    Issues & Dec. Mem. at 79.   Further,\n\nCommerce found that resort to facts available was appropriate\n\n“[b]ecause Wuhan Bee did not inform the Department that its blend\n\nratios were not accurate until the Department discovered the fact\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 15\n\nat verification . . . .”   Id. at 80; see SAA at 869, 1994\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 4198 (“[Subsection 1677e(a)] requires\n\nCommerce . . . to make determinations on the basis of the facts\n\navailable where requested information is missing from the record\n\nor cannot be used because, for example, it has not been provided,\n\nit was provided late, or Commerce could not verify the\n\ninformation.”).   In addition, because this discovery was made at\n\nverification, Commerce found that it “did not have the\n\nopportunity to allow Wuhan Bee to correct its deficient data,”\n\npursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1677m(d).   Id.\n\n\n\n     Next, Commerce used an adverse inference in selecting from\n\namong the facts available because it concluded that Wuhan Bee had\n\nfailed to act to the “best of its ability,” i.e., failed to do\n\nthe maximum it was able to do, to produce documents related to\n\nreported blend ratios:\n\n          Wuhan Bee had sufficient opportunity to\n          inform the Department that its blend ratios\n          were not accurate, yet as late into the\n          proceeding as March 15, 2005, respondent\n          asserted on the record just the opposite —\n          that its blend ratios were accurate and could\n          be easily verified. . . . [R]espondent’s own\n          letters to the Department in December 2004\n          and March 2005, addressing various issues\n          regarding the blend ratios and further\n          manufacturing cost, make it clear that\n          respondent knew how important and central\n          these ratios were to the Department’s\n          ultimate margin calculations. Nevertheless,\n          the Department gave respondent appropriate\n          notice in its verification outline that it\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 16\n\n          would be verifying respondent’s blend ratios\n          and that respondent should “be prepared to\n          demonstrate the blend ratio for all\n          sales . . . and provide supporting\n          documentation for all costs associated with\n          further manufacturing.” . . .\n\n          At verification, the Department discovered\n          that the blend ratios were not accurate, at\n          least not with the documentation that\n          respondent was prepared to show the\n          Department. Only at this time did respondent\n          claim that the ratios could not be verified.\n          Wuhan Bee hindered the calculation of\n          accurate dumping margins in this review\n          because it was not more forthcoming about the\n          problems and issues surrounding the reporting\n          of the blend ratios, even though the issue\n          was discussed numerous times throughout this\n          proceeding.\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 81.   In other words, Commerce concluded\n\nthat Wuhan Bee failed to put forth its maximum effort by failing\n\nto inform Commerce of problems surrounding its ability to\n\naccurately report blend ratios and by representing that the blend\n\nratios were accurate and could easily be verified.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs do not challenge the propriety of Commerce’s\n\ndecision to resort to facts available under 19 U.S.C. § 1677e(a).\n\nSee Pls.’ Mem. 32 (acknowledging “errors in the calculation of\n\nblended ratios and the inability of PSH to fully comply with\n\nCommerce’s . . . document and reconciliation requests”).\n\nPlaintiffs do, however, challenge Commerce’s decision to take an\n\nadverse inference against Wuhan Bee in selecting from among the\n\nfacts available.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 17\n\n     First, plaintiffs object to Commerce’s decision to use AFA\n\nbased on the finding that Wuhan Bee and its affiliates did not\n\nact to the best of their abilities.   They argue that Commerce\n\nfailed to articulate why it concluded that a party failed to act\n\nto the best of its ability through a reasoned inquiry into the\n\nfacts.”   Pls.’ Mem. 32.   Plaintiffs insist that the record does\n\nnot support a finding “that Wuhan and its affiliates failed to\n\ncooperate fully with Commerce, or that the errors in blend\n\nratio[s] were intended, or in fact, would have enabled Wuhan to\n\nobtain a more favorable result.”   Pls.’s Mem. 32.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that Commerce decided to apply AFA based on\n\na presumption “that Wuhan was aware, or should have been aware,\n\nthat some of the blend ratios it calculated were in error.”\n\nPls.’ Mem. 21.   They claim this presumption is unreasonable and\n\nunfounded given the “commercial realities” of PSH’s honey\n\nblending.   Pls.’ Mem. 24.   In particular, plaintiffs contend that\n\nthe record evidence shows that: (1) blending honey is an “art\n\nform,” which is done according to customer preferences with\n\nrespect to moisture content and color; (2) “honey is blended\n\naccording to a plan recorded on . . . daily processing\n\nreport[s],” which “do not specify the quantity or source of the\n\nhoney barrels that enter into production”; and (3) “for\n\ncommercial purposes, the amount of either subject or non-subject\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 18\n\nmerchandise is considered immaterial.”   Pls.’ Mem. 23-24.    As a\n\nresult, for this review, Wuhan Bee manually reviewed documents to\n\ncalculate blend ratios, since “PSH did not maintain blend ratios\n\nin the normal course of its record keeping,” then reported the\n\nblend ratios in its section C and supplemental questionnaire\n\nresponses.   Pls.’ Mem. 28.\n\n\n\n      For its part, defendant argues that “Commerce properly\n\ndetermined that [Wuhan Bee] and PSH failed promptly to produce or\n\nput forth the maximum effort to investigate and obtain the\n\nrequested information” about blended honey sales.   Def.’s Opp’n\n\n12.   Defendant insists that: (1) a reasonable importer would have\n\nknown that the requested information was required to be kept and\n\nmaintained, Def.’s Opp’n 15; and (2) Wuhan Bee failed to\n\ncooperate fully because it knew that blend ratios were a\n\nsignificant issue in Commerce’s investigation and had notice that\n\nCommerce would examine those ratios at verification, yet failed\n\nto put forth the maximum effort to investigate and obtain the\n\nrequested information.   Def.’s Opp’n 18-22.\n\n\n\n      The court finds that Commerce’s application of AFA is\n\njustified.   Although not explicitly identified as such, the first\n\nrequired finding under Nippon Steel, i.e., an objective inquiry,\n\nhas been satisfied.   The key to this inquiry is whether\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 19\n\nplaintiffs’ behavior has been reasonable and responsible.    As\n\nexpressed in the Final Results, Commerce apparently found that\n\nplaintiffs were neither reasonable nor responsible in their\n\nrecord keeping and in representing that their questionnaire\n\nresponses were accurate and could easily be verified.    Commerce\n\nfurther apparently found that a reasonable and responsible\n\nrespondent would have brought any problems surrounding its\n\nsupporting documentation to Commerce’s attention before the\n\nverification.   These assumptions are consistent with the Nippon\n\nSteel Court’s injunction that a reasonable importer “have\n\nfamiliarity with all of the records it maintains in its\n\npossession, custody, or control; and   . . . conduct prompt,\n\ncareful, and comprehensive investigations of all relevant records\n\nthat refer or relate to the imports in question . . . .”       Nippon\n\nSteel, 337 F.3d at 1382.\n\n\n\n     The second required finding, that Wuhan Bee failed to act to\n\nthe best of its ability, has also been satisfied.   Based on\n\ncorrespondence between Wuhan Bee and Commerce, it is clear that\n\nWuhan Bee recognized that blended honey sales and further\n\nmanufacturing expenses were significant issues in this review and\n\nthat the databases submitted in response to Commerce’s\n\nquestionnaires on these issues would be the subject of\n\nverification.   See, e.g., Letter from Jeffrey S. Grimson to\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                          Page 20\n\nCommerce of 12/3/04, Pub.

Indeed, it represented that its questionnaire\n\nresponses could be verified:\n\n            Wuhan Bee’s responses to the Department’s\n            questionnaires have been sufficiently\n            complete and accurate for the Department to\n            be able to complete its verification of PSH’s\n            resale prices and U.S. expenses, including\n            further manufacturing expenses, when\n            verification takes place . . . .\n\nLetter from Bruce M.

With respect to those invoices for which PSH supplied\n\nsupporting documentation, Commerce discovered inaccuracies forty-\n\n\n     6\n      (...continued)\nin the way of Commerce’s application of an adverse inference\nbecause the “best of its ability” standard, particularly with\nrespect to a successive review,\n\n            assumes that importers are familiar with the\n            rules and regulations that apply to the\n            import activities undertaken and requires\n            that importers, to avoid a risk of an adverse\n            inference determination in responding to\n            Commerce’s inquiries: (a) take reasonable\n            steps to keep and maintain full and complete\n            records documenting the information that a\n            reasonable importer should anticipate being\n            called upon to produce; (b) have familiarity\n            with all of the records it maintains in its\n            possession, custody, or control; and (c)\n            conduct prompt, careful, and comprehensive\n            investigations of all relevant records that\n            refer or relate to the imports in question to\n            the full extent of the importers’ ability to\n            do so.\n\nNippon Steel, 337 F.3d at 1382. While the “best of its ability”\nstandard recognizes that mistakes sometimes occur, it “does not\ncondone inattentiveness, carelessness, or inadequate record\nkeeping.” Id.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 22\n\nthree percent of the time.    See Issues & Dec. Mem. at 79;\n\nVerification Rep., Conf. Doc. 106 at 3.    That the errors in blend\n\nratios may not have been intended is not relevant to Commerce’s\n\ndecision to take an adverse inference.    Nippon Steel, 337 F.3d at\n\n1383 (“While intentional conduct, such as deliberate concealment\n\nor inaccurate reporting, surely evinces a failure to cooperate,\n\nthe statute does not contain an intent element.    ‘Inadequate\n\ninquiries’ may suffice.    The statutory trigger for Commerce's\n\nconsideration of an adverse inference is simply a failure to\n\ncooperate to the best of respondent's ability, regardless of\n\nmotivation or intent.”).    Commerce’s subjective inquiry, then,\n\nfocuses on plaintiffs’ “fail[ure] to put forth [their] maximum\n\nefforts to investigate and obtain the requested information from\n\n[their] records.”    Id. at 1382-83.\n\n\n\n     Finally, plaintiffs make the argument that the Case Brief as\n\noriginally submitted, i.e., with the attachment, confirmed that\n\nthe errors in blend ratios that Commerce discovered at\n\nverification did not result in any advantage to Wuhan Bee.    That\n\nis, Wuhan Bee insists that it “[did] not obtain a more favorable\n\nresult by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully.”\n\nPls.’ Mem. 31 (internal quotation marks & citation omitted).\n\nCommerce may take an adverse inference to induce compliance with\n\nits requests, and, indeed, to ensure that uncooperative\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 23\n\nrespondents do not receive a benefit as a result.    See Timken Co.\n\nv. United States, 354 F.3d 1334, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n\nCommerce’s decision whether or not to take an adverse inference,\n\nhowever, does not turn on whether Wuhan Bee’s failure to comply\n\nwith Commerce’s requests resulted in any advantage to it.    That\n\nWuhan Bee did not comply to the best of its ability is enough to\n\ntrigger the use of an adverse inference.    Nippon Steel, 337 F.3d\n\nat 1381.    Moreover, to the extent plaintiffs argue that Wuhan Bee\n\ndid not “intend” the errors in blend ratios, this argument is\n\nimmaterial because intent is not relevant to Commerce’s decision\n\nto use AFA.    Id. at 1383 (“The statutory trigger for Commerce's\n\nconsideration of an adverse inference is simply a failure to\n\ncooperate to the best of respondent’s ability, regardless of\n\nmotivation or intent.”).   It may be true, as plaintiffs contend,\n\nthat the Case Brief and the attachment did not contain new\n\ninformation, but rather a resorting of information that had been\n\nverified.   See Pls.’ Mem. 30-32.   Nonetheless, because the sole\n\npurpose of the attachment to the Case Brief was to show that “any\n\ndifferences between ‘precise’ quantities sold and ‘actual’\n\nquantities reported would not have [had] an advantageous impact\n\non Wuhan Bee’s margins,” Case Brief, Conf. Doc. 113, Attach. 1 at\n\n20, Commerce’s rejection of the attachment and narrative\n\nreferences thereto, if in error, was harmless error.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 24\n\n      In light of the foregoing, Commerce justifiably found that a\n\nreasonable importer would have known that blend ratios were an\n\nimportant issue in this investigation and that the questionnaire\n\nresponses, and the documents to support the responses, with\n\nrespect to such ratios would be subject to verification.\n\nCommerce also reasonably concluded that Wuhan Bee was aware that\n\nthe mix of subject and nonsubject merchandise in U.S. sales would\n\nbe the subject of inquiry by Commerce at verification.\n\nFurthermore, Wuhan Bee’s failure to maintain adequate records of\n\nblended honey sales and to bring any of the documentary problems\n\nto Commerce’s attention prior to verification justified\n\nCommerce’s finding that Wuhan Bee failed to do the maximum it was\n\nable to do.   The court thus sustains Commerce’s use of AFA.\n\n\n\nII.   Commerce’s Construction of Normal Value\n\n      Next, the court turns to plaintiffs’ challenges to\n\nCommerce’s construction of normal value under 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677b(c)(1).   When merchandise that is the subject of an\n\nantidumping investigation is exported from a nonmarket economy\n\n(“NME”)7 country, such as the PRC, Commerce generally determines\n\n\n      7\n          A “nonmarket economy” country is “any foreign country\nthat [Commerce] determines does not operate on market principles\nof cost or pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in\nsuch country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise.”\n19 U.S.C. § 1677(18)(A). “Because it deems China to be a\nnonmarket economy country, Commerce generally considers\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 25\n\nits normal value by valuing the factors of production used in\n\nproducing the merchandise to which it adds “an amount for general\n\nexpenses and profit plus the cost of containers, coverings, and\n\nother expenses.”   19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(1).   Factors of production\n\ninclude the quantities of raw materials consumed and the hours of\n\nlabor needed to produce the subject merchandise.    See 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677b(c)(3).\n\n\n\n     Commerce is directed to use “the best available information\n\nregarding the values of such factors in a market economy country\n\nor countries considered to be appropriate by the administering\n\nauthority.”   19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(1).   What constitutes best\n\navailable information is not defined by statute or regulation,\n\nbut Commerce normally considers the quality, specificity and\n\ncontemporaneity of the data and prefers to use public, country-\n\nwide data, where it is available.   See Goldlink Indus. Co. v.\n\nUnited States, 30 CIT __, __, 431 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1337 (2006);\n\nFreshwater Crawfish Tail Meat from the PRC, 66 Fed. Reg. 20,634\n\n(Dep’t of Commerce Apr. 24, 2001) (notice), Issues and Decision\n\n\n     7\n      (...continued)\ninformation on sales in China and financial information obtained\nfrom Chinese producers to be unreliable for determining, under 19\nU.S.C. § 1677b(a), the normal value of the subject merchandise.”\nShanghai Foreign Trade Enters. Co. v. United States, 28 CIT __,\n__, 318 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1341 (2004). Therefore, since the\nsubject merchandise came from the PRC, Commerce constructed\nnormal value by valuing the factors of production using surrogate\ndata from India. See 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(4).\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                          Page 26\n\nMem., cmt. 2.\n\n\n\n     A.    Valuation of the Factors of Production\n\n     Plaintiffs dispute Commerce’s decision as to what\n\nconstitutes the “best available information” to value: (1) raw\n\nhoney; and (2) labor costs.\n\n\n\n           1.    Raw Honey\n\n     In the Final Results, Commerce valued raw honey using data\n\nsubmitted by plaintiffs from a Web site maintained by EDA Rural\n\nSystems Pvt. Ltd., an organization that provides business\n\ndevelopment services to the honey and beekeeping sector in India\n\n(“EDA Data”).    See Factors of Production Valuation Mem. for the\n\nFinal Results, Pub. Doc. 340, Attach. I.    Based on this\n\ninformation, Commerce derived an average price for raw honey of\n\n74.90 Rupees per kilogram during the POR.    See Factors of\n\nProduction Valuation Mem. for the Final Results, Pub. Doc. 340 at\n\n2.\n\n\n\n     Commerce decided to use EDA Data exclusively in valuing raw\n\nhoney.    In doing so, it rejected three articles also submitted by\n\nplaintiffs, which contained different values of honey, from: (1)\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 27\n\nHindu Business Line;8 (2) Indiainfoline;9 and (3) Indian\n\nExpress.10    Plaintiffs argue that the values contained in the\n\nthree articles should be averaged with the value of honey found\n\nin the EDA Data.\n\n\n\n     In the Final Results, Commerce explained its decision to\n\nvalue raw honey using just the EDA Data: “[T]he EDA Data . . .\n\nconstitute[s] a[n] . . . appropriate surrogate value source for\n\nthis POR.    [It is] . . . the best information currently available\n\nbecause it is publicly available, quality data, specific to the\n\nraw honey beekeeping industry in India, and contemporaneous with\n\nthe POR.”    Issues & Dec. Mem. at 10.   With respect to quality,\n\nCommerce found that “the EDA Data source is highly documented,\n\nincluding numerous specific price points over a six year period\n\nfor multiple types of honey from many suppliers, and includes\n\ndetailed information on production, inputs, and beekeepers.”        Id.\n\nat 11.    With respect to specificity, Commerce noted that “the\n\nprices quoted in the EDA Data are specific to the raw honey\n\nbeekeeping industry in the state of Bihar in India.”     Id.

[T]he exceptionally\n          limited nature of [this] data renders [it]\n          unpersuasive of Indian prices as a whole in\n          comparison with the broader EDA Data.\n\nIssues & Dec.

Rather, they argue that Commerce’s rejection of the other\n\nsources plaintiffs proposed was unreasonable.   According to\n\nplaintiffs, the three articles “covered different regions of\n\nIndia but showed a relatively narrow range of prices for raw\n\nhoney . . . .”   Pls.’ Reply Br. to Def.’s & Def.-Ints.’ Resp.\n\nBrs. (“Pls.’ Reply”) 10.   Plaintiffs further maintain that the\n\nprices contained in the EDA Data are not representative of the\n\nprice of honey found in India generally.   Pls.’ Mem. 34; Pls.’\n\nReply 9.   Thus, plaintiffs contend that “[a]s all information on\n\nthe record is region-specific, the most reasonable method to\n\narrive at a country-wide surrogate value is to calculate an\n\naverage price derived from all this data . . . .”   Pls.’ Mem. 37.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs therefore insist that “Commerce’s reasons for\n\nrejecting [the Hindu Business Line, Indiainfoline and Indian\n\nExpress articles] were arbitrary and capricious.”   Pls.’ Reply 9.\n\n           Commerce rejected the [Hindu Business Line\n           article] because the information related to a\n           cooperative, while using the data from\n           another cooperative, [Mahabaleshwar Honey\n           Production Cooperative Society Ltd.], to\n           determine financial ratios. Commerce\n           rejected the [Indiainfoline article] as it\n           had concerns over the origins of the article\n           written by a business student, but used the\n           EDA Data, found on a random website.\n           Further, Commerce relied upon articles\n           published in . . . Indiainfoline . . . in\n           other proceedings. Finally, Commerce\n           rejected [the Indian Express article] as it\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 30\n\n          was limited to the results of a single\n          beekeeper and had previously rejected this\n          information before. Yet, there is nothing to\n          suggest that the price information in the\n          article was unreliable.\n\nPls.’ Reply 9.   Plaintiffs thus seek a remand with instructions\n\nto value raw honey based on an average of the honey values found\n\nin the Hindu Business Line, the Indiainfoline and the Indian\n\nExpress articles as well as the EDA Data.\n\n\n\n     In response, defendant contends that Commerce’s explanations\n\nfor rejecting plaintiffs’ proposed data are reasonable, and that\n\nthe record supports Commerce’s decision not to average the honey\n\nvalues:\n\n          [T]he [Hindu Business Line, Indiainfoline and\n          Indian Express] articles either quote prices\n          from single producers, or contain data from\n          unknown origins, which Commerce determined\n          not to be comparable with the EDA data.\n          Further Commerce “continue[d] to find that\n          the [three articles] are unreliable sources\n          for valuing honey.” . . .\n\n          In this case, the sources for the surrogate\n          value of raw honey contained upon the record\n          were all regionally limited. EDA data are\n          based upon the raw honey beekeeping industry\n          in the second largest honey producing state\n          in India, offering more representative prices\n          than the article from Indiainfoline, the\n          prices for which are from the Kerala region,\n          which accounts for only nine percent of\n          India’s honey production. In addition,\n          Commerce rejected the articles from\n          [Indiainfoline] and Hindu Business Line\n          because they either quote prices from single\n          producers, making them less representative\n          than EDA data, or contain data from unknown\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 31\n\n           origins rather than from public sources,\n           unlike the EDA data.\n\nDef.’s Opp’n 29 & 31.   Thus, defendant insists that, since the\n\nalternative data sources proposed by plaintiffs were not\n\nreliable, Commerce’s decision not to average them with the EDA\n\nData is justified.\n\n\n\n     Commerce enjoys some latitude in selecting among the\n\navailable information in valuing the factors of production.     See\n\nNation Ford Chem. Co. v. United States, 166 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1999).   In choosing from among the available data, Commerce\n\n“must act in a manner consistent with the underlying objective of\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c) – to obtain the most accurate dumping\n\nmargins possible.”   Shandong Huarong Gen. Corp. v. United States,\n\n25 CIT 834, 838, 159 F. Supp. 2d 714, 719 (2001) (citation\n\nomitted); Shakeproof Assembly Components, Div. of Ill. Tool\n\nWorks, Inc. v. United States, 268 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir.\n\n2001)).   To determine whether Commerce’s selection of surrogate\n\nvalues furthers this statutory purpose, the court must determine\n\nwhether “Commerce’s choice of what constitutes the best available\n\ninformation evidences a rational and reasonable relationship to\n\nthe factor of production it represents.”   Shandong Huarong, 25\n\nCIT at 838, 159 F. Supp. 2d at 719 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n     Here, the court finds reasonable Commerce’s use of the EDA\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 32\n\nData and the exclusion of the other three sources proposed by\n\nplaintiffs.   First, plaintiffs do not dispute the reliability of\n\nthe EDA Data.   Indeed, although now declaring the data as being\n\nfrom a “random website,” at the administrative level they argued\n\nin favor of Commerce using it as a part of an average.     See\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 10.    Moreover, Commerce’s decision not to\n\naverage the EDA Data with the three articles proposed by\n\nplaintiffs was reasonable in light of the deficiencies Commerce\n\nfound in those sources.\n\n\n\n     First, Commerce was justified in rejecting the Hindu\n\nBusiness Line article.    In a single sentence the article states a\n\nrange of prices received by a single producer, the Girijan Co-\n\noperative Corporation Ltd.    See Hindu Business Line Article at 2.\n\nThe EDA Data, on the other hand, contains information on numerous\n\nproducers and therefore represents a wider range of prices.      In\n\naddition, there is no indication that the sources of the data\n\ncontained in the Hindu Business Line article are publicly\n\navailable.    See Issues & Dec. Mem. at 12.\n\n\n\n     Second, the court finds no error in Commerce’s conclusion\n\nthat the Indiainfoline article was unreliable.    Commerce found\n\nthat unlike the EDA Data, the sources of which were well-\n\ndocumented and made available by a business entity, the\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 33\n\nIndiainfoline article contained nothing to indicate it was\n\nreliable.    In particular, there was “no additional information on\n\nthe author’s qualifications or the sources of his information”\n\nother than his status as a first-year business student.     Id. 12-\n\n13.\n\n\n\n      Third, the Indian Express article was found not to be as\n\nrepresentative as the EDA Data because it pertained to the\n\nexperience of only a single beekeeper.\n\n\n\n      In light of the proposed sources’ deficiencies, the court\n\nfinds reasonable Commerce’s decision not to average this data\n\nwith the EDA Data, which Commerce found was (1) publicly\n\navailable; (2) well-documented, with numerous price points for\n\nmultiple types of honey from many suppliers; (3) detailed\n\ninformation on production, inputs and beekeepers; (4) based on\n\nIndia’s second largest honey-producing region (Bihar); and (5)\n\ncontemporaneous with the POR.   Thus, Commerce’s conclusion that\n\nthe EDA Data was the “best available information” on the record\n\non which to base its valuation of raw honey is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence and in accordance with law.\n\n\n\n            2.   Labor Costs\n\n      The cost of labor is another factor of production used to\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 34\n\nconstruct normal value.   As this Court has observed, “Commerce\n\ntreats the wage rate differently from all other factors of\n\nproduction[.] [F]or labor, Commerce employs regression-based wage\n\nrates reflective of the observed relationship between wages and\n\nnational income in market economy countries.”11    Dorbest Ltd. v.\n\nUnited States, 30 CIT __, __, 462 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1291 (2006).\n\n“Using this regression analysis, Commerce determines the\n\nrelationship between countries’ per capita Gross National Product\n\n[(“GNI”)] and their wage rates; Commerce approximates the wage\n\nrate of the PRC by using the PRC’s GNI as the variable in the\n\nequation that was the result of the regression.”    Id. at __, 462\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 1291.\n\n\n\n     Here, Commerce based its regression analysis upon the\n\naverage wages from a basket of fifty-six market economy\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          In full text, Commerce’s regulation with respect to how\nlabor is to be valued in the nonmarket economy context provides:\n\n          For labor, the Secretary will use regression-\n          based wage rates reflective of the observed\n          relationship between wages and the national\n          income in market economy countries. The\n          Secretary will calculate the wage rate to be\n          applied in nonmarket economy proceedings each\n          year. The calculation will be based on\n          current data, and will be made available to\n          the public.\n\n19 C.F.R. § 351.408(c)(3) (2005).\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 35\n\ncountries.12   Factors of Production Valuation Mem. for the\n\nPrelim.

Therefore, after\n\nmaking its calculation, it “use[d] the 2004-revised expected wage\n\nrate of $0.93/hour as a surrogate for Chinese labor costs, in\n\naccordance with its regulations and long-standing practice.”\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 28.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs challenge Commerce’s methodology for calculating\n\nthe surrogate wage rate, arguing that in determining which\n\ncountries make up the basket of fifty-six countries, Commerce\n\n“selectively excluded many low wage countries and selectively\n\nincluded non-comparable source countries.”    Pls.’ Mem. 41.   For\n\nexample, plaintiffs point out that Commerce included “source\n\ncountries, such as Switzerland, the U.K., Norway, and Germany,”\n\nPls.’ Mem. 18, and excluded available data, which plaintiffs\n\nplaced on the record, for twenty-two additional countries, e.g.,\n\nAlbania, Bangladesh, Cambodia and the Czech Republic.

Commerce’s exclusion of available\n\ndata, plaintiffs argue, was arbitrary and contrary to Commerce’s\n\nown position that “more data is better than less data.”    Pls.’\n\nMem. 41.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that in performing its regression\n\nanalysis, Commerce improperly combined data from 2001 (regarding\n\nthe wage rates and per capita GNI of the fifty-six market economy\n\ncountries) with data from 2002 (regarding Chinese GNI), when 2002\n\ndata was available with respect to the wage rates and per capita\n\nGNI of the market economy countries.    Pls.’ Mem. 17 (citing\n\narguments raised below in plaintiffs’ Case Brief dated May 10,\n\n2005, Pub. Doc. 301 at 38-39).    Plaintiffs charge that by mixing\n\nChinese GNI data from 2002 with wage rate and per capita GNI data\n\nfrom 2001, Commerce violated its regulations which require use of\n\n“current data.”   Pls.’ Mem. 41 (quoting 19 C.F.R.\n\n§ 351.408(c)(3)).    Thus, plaintiffs argue, Commerce’s methodology\n\n“critically undermines any assertion that the regression based\n\nwage calculation significantly enhances the accuracy and fairness\n\nin the NME case.”    Pls.’ Mem. 41.\n\n\n\n     Defendant responds that because “Commerce has consistently\n\nbased its regression analysis upon average wages from a basket of\n\n56 countries since it updated its regression analysis in 2000,”\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 37\n\nthe twin aims of predictability and fairness are served by using\n\nthis method of calculating wage rate.   Def.’s Opp’n 43.    In\n\naddition, Commerce insists that changing the methodology as\n\nplaintiffs propose, i.e., to add twenty-two countries to the\n\nbasket currently compiled, is a significant change that would\n\nrequire comment from the general public, which would be\n\nimpracticable in this review.   Def.’s Opp’n 43-44.\n\n\n\n     As to its wage rate finding, however, Commerce requests\n\nremand because it acknowledges that it “mistakenly relied upon\n\nincome data from two different years [i.e., 2001 and 2002,] in\n\nits calculation of the surrogate wage rate.”    Def.’s Opp’n 41.\n\nThus, defendant asks the court to sustain its wage rate\n\ncalculation methodology and to remand for the limited purpose of\n\nrecalculating the labor wage rate using “the correct GNI data.”\n\nDef.’s Opp’n 45.\n\n\n\n     The court cannot sustain Commerce’s labor calculation.      When\n\nvaluing factors of production, Commerce is required to use “the\n\nbest available information regarding the values of such factors\n\nin a market economy country or countries considered to be\n\nappropriate.”   19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(1).   In the Final Results,\n\nCommerce rejected plaintiffs’ request to recalculate the\n\nsurrogate wage:\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 38\n\n          The Department is reviewing its regression-\n          based wage rate calculation . . .; however,\n          comprehensively re-examining each country in\n          the existing dataset and recalculating the\n          wage rate regression using GNI requires more\n          time than is currently available. To revise\n          the data here would be impracticable given\n          the time constraints of this review. The\n          Department is fully satisfied that the\n          current figures are reasonable and correct,\n          and will use them unless and until they are\n          changed as a result of a thorough review.\n          Recalculating the regression analysis using a\n          significantly different basket of countries\n          would amount to a significant change in the\n          Department’s methodology; such a change\n          should be subject to notice and comment from\n          the general public. Thus, it would be\n          inappropriate to restrict this public-comment\n          process to the context of the instant review.\n          Consequently, the Department will invite\n          comments from the general public on this\n          matter in a proceeding separate from the\n          current review of this order.\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 28.   In other words, Commerce declined to\n\nrevise the data set it relied upon in the Final Results because:\n\n(1) it was impracticable under the statutory deadlines for\n\ncompleting its investigation; and (2) recalculating the\n\nregression analysis using a significantly different basket of\n\ncountries would likely result in a significant change in\n\nmethodology that would require comment from the public.    This\n\nCourt has rejected both of these arguments.\n\n\n\n     In Dorbest Ltd., the Court found wanting the argument that\n\nstatutory deadlines for completing investigations prevented\n\nCommerce from considering available information in updating its\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 39\n\nregression model:\n\n          Congress was certainly sensitive to this\n          concern [of completing investigations within\n          statutory deadlines] by limiting Commerce’s\n          choice of data to that “available” during the\n          investigation. But in recognizing this\n          concern, Congress nonetheless required that\n          if information was available, i.e., placed on\n          the record, Commerce was compelled to\n          consider it. Therefore, Commerce’s defense\n          runs directly against its statutory duty.\n          Consequently, Commerce’s . . . defense\n          must . . . be rejected.\n\nId. at __, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1296.   As to Commerce’s past\n\npractice of relying on data from fifty-six countries in making\n\nPRC wage rate calculations and the need for public comment prior\n\nto any change in that practice, the Dorbest Ltd. Court observed:\n\n          Commerce’s . . . argument . . . that the data\n          set in question must be developed through\n          notice-and-comment rulemaking[] appears to be\n          inconsistent with Commerce’s past practice.\n          Commerce has in the past updated and expanded\n          the number of countries within the data set\n          without resorting to notice and comment\n          rulemaking. In fact, during the\n          investigation here, Commerce used a basket of\n          fifty-six countries, but during the voluntary\n          remand, used a basket of only fifty-four. No\n          notice-and-comment rulemaking was used to\n          effect the change. Commerce has also, over\n          time, expanded its data set of countries from\n          forty-five countries to fifty-six countries\n          without vetting its choices through notice-\n          and-comment rulemaking.\n\nId. at __, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1295.   The court agrees with the\n\nDorbest Ltd.

In the event that on remand Commerce rejects\n\nthe data from the twenty-two additional countries, it must\n\nexplain its decision with reference to specific evidence and\n\nwithout reference to time constraints.   In addition, Commerce\n\nmust explain its decision to rely on a methodology that results\n\nin the disparity observed between the hourly wage rate in, e.g.,\n\nIndia ($0.15/hour), a market economy country found to be\n\neconomically comparable to the PRC, and the hourly wage rate\n\n\n\n\n     13\n          The court also notes that Commerce announced a revised\nmethodology in a notice published on October 19, 2006.

For the manufacturing\n            overhead ratio, Commerce typically divides\n            total manufacturing overhead expenses by\n            total direct manufacturing expenses.\n            Finally, to determine a surrogate ratio for\n            profit, Commerce divides before-tax profit by\n            the sum of direct expenses, manufacturing\n            overhead and SG & A expenses.   These ratios\n            are converted to percentages (“rates”) and\n            multiplied by the surrogate values assigned\n            by Commerce for the direct expenses,\n            manufacturing overhead and SG & A expenses.\n\nId. at __, 318 F.

The MHPC financial statement,\n\nhowever, did not include a raw material cost for honey.\n\nAccordingly, Commerce extrapolated the raw material cost, using\n\nthe following methodology:\n\n           [The] raw material cost was derived by\n           dividing the total cost of honey by the\n           quantity [MHPC] purchased [from its members]\n           and then multiplying this figure by the sum\n           of the quantities [MHPC] sold [to its\n           customers] and lost during production.\n\nIssued & Dec.

See\n\nFactors of Production Valuation Mem. for the Final Results, Pub.\n\nDoc. 340, Attach. II (Surrogate Financial Ratios).\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that: (1) Commerce’s use of the MHPC\n\nfinancial statement was unreasonable because it did not include a\n\nfigure representing the raw material cost for honey; and (2) the\n\nmethodology Commerce used to extrapolate the raw material cost\n\nfor honey is flawed because it is based on unsupported\n\nassumptions.   Pls.’ Mem. 37-38.\n\n\n\n     First, plaintiffs claim that without “separate opening and\n\nclosing raw materials inventories or [an] indicat[ion] [of] the\n\namount of honey processed during the reported accounting period,”\n\nthe MHPC financial statement is incomplete on its face.    Pls.’\n\nMem. 37.   Plaintiffs contend that the absence of this information\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 45\n\nmakes Commerce’s decision to use the MHPC financial statement\n\nunreasonable.\n\n\n\n     Second, the methodology Commerce used to extrapolate the raw\n\nmaterial cost for honey, plaintiffs claim, is based on\n\nunsupported assumptions.    According to plaintiffs:\n\n          In the absence of . . . data [on either the\n          opening and closing raw materials inventories\n          or the amount of honey processed during the\n          reported accounting period], Commerce assumed\n          [1] any raw honey processed from opening\n          period inventory was valued at the price of\n          raw honey purchased during the [reported\n          accounting period]. Commerce further assumed\n          [2] all honey sold during the [reported\n          accounting period] was processed during the\n          [reported accounting period].\n\n          Commerce’s calculation of financial ratios is\n          predicated on these assumptions. However,\n          there is nothing in the MHPC Financials to\n          support these assumptions, as opposed to\n          alternative assumptions that honey consumed\n          from inventory to process finished honey was\n          priced higher or lower than purchased raw\n          honey or that MHPC processed more honey than\n          it sold during the [reported accounting\n          period] or less than it sold – any of which\n          would radically change the surrogate\n          financial ratios. As such it was impossible\n          for Commerce to calculate accurate, actual\n          surrogate financial ratios from the MHPC\n          Financials.\n\nPls.’ Mem. 37-38.    In other words, plaintiffs charge that the\n\nMHPC financial statement does not support the assumptions that\n\n(1) the cost of raw honey (if any) taken from MHPC’s inventory\n\nwas the same as later purchased raw honey; and that (2) all of\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 46\n\nthe honey MHPC sold during the reported accounting period was\n\nprocessed during that period.   Commerce would not have had to\n\nmake these assumptions, plaintiffs argue, had it used the Apis\n\nfinancial statement.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs also argue that the MHPC financial statement\n\nlacks a report indicating it is in accordance with Indian\n\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).    Pls.’ Mem.\n\n38-39.   Plaintiffs argue that as a cooperative, MHPC is not\n\nrequired to report its financial statements in accordance with\n\nthe Indian GAAP.   Pls.’ Mem. 39.   They further contend that Apis\n\nis so required, and “therefore its auditor’s report illustrates\n\nthat the statements are reliable as in accordance with the\n\nfinancial/accounting standards of India.”   Pls.’ Reply 13 n.18.\n\nPlaintiffs thus seek a remand to Commerce with instructions to\n\nuse the Apis financial statement to calculate the surrogate\n\nvalues for factory overhead, SG&A expenses and profit.\n\n\n\n     For its part, defendant contends Commerce’s use of the 2003-\n\n2004 MHPC financial statement to derive surrogate financial\n\nratios was reasonable because the statement was contemporaneous\n\nwith the POR and included complete and detailed information\n\nregarding MHPC’s financial and business operations.    Def.’s Opp’n\n\n35-36.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 47\n\n      Next, defendant argues that the methodology Commerce used to\n\nextrapolate the cost of raw materials consumed is reasonable.\n\nFirst, defendant contends that the methodology “is consistent\n\nwith [the antidumping statute,]17 which permits Commerce to\n\nallocate costs and make adjustments where the reported costs do\n\nnot reasonably reflect the costs associated with the subject\n\nmerchandise.”   Def.’s Opp’n 37; see also Issues & Dec. Mem. at\n\n18.   Second, defendant states: “[R]espondents have cited no\n\nspecific evidence that the derived MHPC raw material cost of\n\nhoney is distortive.”   Def.’s Opp’n 37 (quoting Issues & Dec.\n\nMem. at 18).    Finally, with respect to plaintiffs’ argument that\n\nthe MHPC financial statement is not GAAP compliant, defendant\n\ncontends that plaintiffs’ argument is barred because it was not\n\npreviously raised before Commerce.   Def.’s Opp’n 32; see also\n\nDef.-Ints.’ Opp’n 30.\n\n\n\n      The court finds that Commerce was justified in determining\n\nthat the 2003-2004 MHPC financial statement was the best\n\navailable information to value factory overhead, SG&A expenses\n\nand profit.    It is apparent from the Final Results that Commerce\n\nexamined both the MHPC and Apis financial statements and compared\n\n\n\n      17\n          In its opposition brief, defendant incorrectly cites 19\nU.S.C. § 1677a(c), which pertains to adjustments for export price\nand constructed export price. The court presumes that defendant\nintended to cite 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(f).\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 48\n\ntheir quality, specificity and contemporaneity.    It then\n\nconcluded based on this examination that “the Apis financial\n\nstatement . . . is not a reliable source for calculating the\n\nsurrogate financial ratios because it is neither complete, nor\n\nsufficiently detailed to provide a reliable source for surrogate\n\nvalues.”   Issues & Dec. Mem. at 17.   As Commerce observed, “the\n\nApis statement does not include any auditor notes, nor does it\n\nappear to include complete schedules or details on Apis’\n\noperations.”   Id.    The MHPC’s statement, on the other hand,\n\n“include[s] a complete annual report, an auditors report, and\n\ncomplete profit and loss and business statements that segregate\n\nMHPC’s honey and fruit canning businesses.”    Issues & Dec. Mem.\n\nat 17; Factors of Production Valuation Mem. for the Final\n\nResults, Pub. Doc. 340, Attach. II.    Unlike Apis’s statement,\n\nMHPC’s statement details its honey operations with both narrative\n\ntext and schedules indicating, for example, the number of\n\nkilograms of honey produced by particular MHPC members and the\n\nprice per kilogram.     See Rebuttal to Pet’r Surrogate Data, Pub.\n\nDoc. 265, Attach. 1.    The court thus finds that Commerce’s\n\ndetermination that the MHPC financial statement was the best\n\navailable information to value financial ratios was reasonable.\n\n\n\n     While Commerce reasonably found the MHPC’s financial\n\nstatement to be more reliable than Apis’s, as has been noted, the\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 49\n\nMHPC financial statement lacks a figure representing the raw\n\nmaterial cost for honey.   In the absence of this data, Commerce\n\nextrapolated the data using a methodology, which it expressed\n\nmathematically as follows: total cost of honey purchased during\n\nMHPC’s reporting year, i.e., April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2004\n\n(2,598,344 Rs.)/quantity purchased during that year (29,433.80\n\nkg.) X the sum of the quantities sold and lost during production\n\nduring that year (40,540.20 Rs.) = 3,578,789.88 Rs.   See Factors\n\nof Production Valuation Mem. for the Final Results, Pub. Doc.\n\n340, Attach. II.   The court will sustain Commerce’s chosen\n\nmethodology “[a]s long as the agency’s methodology and procedures\n\nare reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and\n\nthere is substantial evidence on the record supporting the\n\nagency’s conclusions . . . .”   Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A., 10\n\nCIT at 404-05, 636 F.

First, while\n\nplaintiffs complain that the methodology was unsupported by the\n\nrecord, they do not propose an alternative methodology.

Commerce’s Calculation of Plaintiffs’ Assessment Rate and\n     Cash Deposit Rate\n\n     The court next turns to plaintiffs’ challenge to Commerce’s\n\nmethod of calculating cash deposit and assessment rates.       In the\n\nFinal Results, Commerce “determined that, with respect to the\n\nantidumping duty order on honey from the PRC, per-kilogram\n\nantidumping duty cash deposit and assessment rates are\n\nappropriate.”     Issues & Dec. Mem. at 30 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that “[t]hroughout the prior annual\n\nreviews and new shipper reviews on honey, Commerce’s practice was\n\nto base its assessment rate and cash deposit rate upon an ad\n\nvalorem basis.”    Pls.’ Reply 14.   Yet, “after all case briefs and\n\nrebuttal briefs had been filed, and the record closed . . .\n\nCommerce requested comments regarding a possible revision to\n\nCommerce’s standard methodology for calculating assessments and\n\ncash deposits, from an ad valorem basis to a per kilogram basis,”\n\nand allowed “less than two days for commenting on the issue,\n\ndenying Wuhan an opportunity to fully review and comment on [the]\n\nissue.”   Pls.’ Mem. 42.    Plaintiffs argue that “‘principles of\n\nfairness prevent Commerce from changing its methodology at this\n\nlate stage {and} Commerce is required to administer the\n\nantidumping laws fairly.’”     Pls.’ Reply 14 (quoting Shikoku Chem.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                           Page 53\n\nCorp. v.

With\n\nrespect to the amount of time given to the parties to comment on\n\nthe proposed use of a per kilogram methodology, defendant asserts\n\nthat “Wuhan could have requested an extension of time, but did\n\nnot.”     Def.’s Opp’n 40.   Thus, defendant urges the court to\n\nsustain Commerce’s decision to apply an assessment rate and the\n\n\n     18\n          Title 19 C.F.R. § 351.212 states that “normally” the\nassessment rate will be based on the entered value of\nmerchandise. Entered value is not, however, the sole means by\nwhich Commerce may calculate assessment rate:\n\n             If the Secretary has conducted a review of an\n             antidumping order under § 351.213\n             (administrative review), . . . the Secretary\n             normally will calculate an assessment rate\n             for each importer of subject merchandise\n             covered by the review. The Secretary\n             normally will calculate the assessment rate\n             by dividing the dumping margin found on the\n             subject merchandise examined by the entered\n             value of such merchandise for normal customs\n             duty purposes. The Secretary then will\n             instruct the Customs Service to assess\n             antidumping duties by applying the assessment\n             rate to the entered value of the merchandise.\n\n19 C.F.R. § 351.212(b)(1).\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 54\n\ncash deposit rate on a per kilogram basis.\n\n\n\n     Here, because (1) Commerce used the ad valorem methodology\n\nto calculate such rates in the first annual review and new\n\nshipper reviews on honey,19 and (2) Commerce asked for comments\n\non a possible change from an ad valorem to a per kilogram basis\n\nlate in the course of this review, i.e., after the record was\n\nclosed, the court finds that Commerce unreasonably restricted the\n\ntime in which the parties could comment to two days.20    While the\n\nregulations do not require Commerce to use the ad valorem method\n\nin all situations, as evidenced by the word “normally,”\n\nconsiderations of fairness favor allowing plaintiffs more time to\n\nrespond to Commerce’s proposed change in methodology after having\n\nused the ad valorem methodology in this and prior reviews.    As\n\n\n\n     19\n          See, e.g., Honey from the PRC, 68 Fed. Reg. 69,988,\n69,994 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 16, 2003) (prelim. results of\nfirst antidumping duty admin. rev.)

Letter from Commerce to All\nInterested Parties of 5/24/05, Pub. Doc. 317 at 1.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 55\n\nnoted in the Final Results, Commerce’s decision to use a per\n\nkilogram methodology here was based on its finding that “there\n\ncan be a substantial difference between the U.S. sales price for\n\nhoney and the average entered value reported to U.S. Customs and\n\nBorder Protection.”   Issues & Dec. Mem. at 30.   This finding led\n\nCommerce to conclude that it “[was] unable to calculate ad\n\nvalorem cash deposit rates that [would] ensure the collection of\n\ntotal antidumping duties due.”    Id.   Commerce reached its\n\ndecision, however, without adequate time being allotted for\n\neither the giving of comments or for consideration of comments.\n\nAs a result, plaintiffs were prejudiced by the Department’s\n\nactions.   See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. United States, 14 CIT 253,\n\n257, 735 F. Supp. 1059, 1063 (1990) (requiring a showing that\n\nprocedural errors by the agency “‘were prejudicial to the party\n\nseeking to have the action declared invalid’”) (citations\n\nomitted), aff’d and adopted, 923 F.2d 838 (Fed. Cir. 1991).     The\n\ncourt thus finds that on remand plaintiffs shall have the\n\nopportunity to submit further comments on whether Commerce should\n\ncalculate assessment and cash deposit rates on an ad valorem\n\nbasis or a per kilogram basis, in light of Commerce’s concern\n\nthat it would be unable to “ensure the collection of total\n\nantidumping duties due.”   Id.   Furthermore, plaintiff shall be\n\nallowed to place evidence on the record, should it find it\n\nnecessary to do so, specifically with respect to how an ad\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 56\n\nvalorem methodology furthers, or does not further, the collection\n\nof total duties owed.   Finally, Commerce must fully explain its\n\ndecision to use a per kilogram or ad valorem methodology by\n\nreference to evidence placed on the record.\n\n\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the forgoing reasons, the court sustains the Final\n\nResults in part and remands for further action consistent with\n\nthis opinion.

For the reasons that\n\nfollow, the court sustains the Final Results in part and remands\n\nthis case to Commerce for further action consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 3\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiffs Wuhan Bee and Presstek are, respectively, a\n\nproducer and exporter of honey from the PRC, and a honey importer\n\nand distributor in the United States.    During the POR, Wuhan Bee\n\nexported honey from the PRC (the “subject merchandise”) to its\n\naffiliate Presstek, which in turn sold the honey to Pure Sweet\n\nHoney (“PSH”), an affiliated honey blender.1    PSH then blended\n\nplaintiffs’ merchandise with honey from other countries and\n\nresold it to unaffiliated customers in the United States.\n\n\n\n     On December 2, 2003, Commerce published a notice of\n\nopportunity to request an administrative review of the\n\nantidumping duty order on honey from the PRC.    See Antidumping or\n\nCountervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation,\n\n68 Fed. Reg. 67,401 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 2, 2003) (notice).\n\nPursuant to the notice, Wuhan Bee asked for a review of its\n\nentries during the POR.   See Honey From the PRC, 69 Fed. Reg.\n\n77,184 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 27, 2004) (prelim.).    Commerce\n\ninitiated the second administrative review on January 22, 2003.\n\nSee Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Admin.\n\nRevs. and Req. for Revocation in Part, 68 Fed. Reg. 3009 (Dep’t\n\n\n\n     1\n          Commerce found Wuhan Bee was affiliated with Presstek\nfor a part of the POR, i.e., from July 20, 2003, forward.\nPresstek and PSH were affiliated during the entire POR. See\nIssues & Dec.

Commerce\n\nalso issued supplemental questionnaires to Wuhan Bee, which\n\nfocused on its calculation of “blend ratios.”2   That is, by these\n\nsupplemental questionnaires, Commerce sought to determine the\n\npercentage of Wuhan Bee’s honey contained in each sale of blended\n\nhoney made by PSH to unaffiliated U.S. customers.   As Commerce\n\nnoted in the Final Results, blend ratios are “essential to the\n\nreported U.S. sales and further manufacturing databases because\n\nthe ratios determine whether a particular honey sale is of\n\nsubject or non-subject merchandise and the quantity of the sale\n\nof subject merchandise.”   Issues & Dec. Mem. at 80.\n\n\n\n     Commerce notified Wuhan Bee that it would verify its\n\nquestionnaire responses pertaining to U.S. sales made through\n\n\n\n     2\n          Wuhan Bee first identified “blend ratios” in its\nSection C response as “the percentage of subject honey contained\nwithin the honey resold by Wuhan Bee’s U.S. affiliate . . . .”\nWuhan Bee’s Sec. C Ques. Resp., Conf.

See CEP\n\nVerification Outline (Apr. 20, 2005), Conf. Doc. 101 at 7, 9.      In\n\nparticular, Commerce asked Wuhan Bee to be prepared to provide\n\n“[d]ocumentation supporting the ‘blend ratio,’” so that the\n\nverifiers could trace data from documents to the responses.

It also instructed\n\nWuhan Bee to “[p]lease be prepared to demonstrate the blend ratio\n\nfor all sales . . . and provide support documentation for all\n\ncosts associated with further manufacturing . . . as reported in\n\nyour questionnaire responses.”   CEP Verification Outline, Conf.\n\nDoc. 101 at 9.\n\n\n\n     At verification, Commerce selected fifty-one U.S. sales\n\ninvoices for review from Wuhan Bee’s U.S. sales databases.\n\n\n     3\n          Presstek and PSH shared a physical address in Verona,\nWisconsin.

For five of the twenty-six invoices,\n\ncompany officials failed to provide supporting documentation.      As\n\nfor the other twenty-one invoices, Commerce found discrepancies\n\nin blend ratios in three of them.    The remaining twenty-five\n\ninvoices were selected from a database that quantified the\n\ndifferences between the amount of subject merchandise sold by\n\nWuhan Bee to its affiliates and the amount of subject merchandise\n\nin the blended honey sold to unaffiliated U.S. customers.    For\n\nnine of the twenty-five invoices, company officials were unable\n\nto provide supporting documentation, and for the remaining\n\nsixteen, Commerce found discrepancies with respect to the\n\nreported blend ratios/blend content for thirteen of the invoices.\n\nSee Verification Rep., Conf. Doc. 106 at 3.\n\n\n\n     On May 19, 2005, plaintiffs filed a brief with Commerce\n\n(“Case Brief”) in an attempt to correct deficiencies in blend\n\nratios discovered at verification.    Commerce rejected an\n\nattachment to the Case Brief and the narrative references to the\n\nattachment, claiming they were “new information” that was\n\nuntimely filed and thus could not be verified.    Plaintiffs were\n\ngiven an opportunity to submit a redacted version of the Case\n\nBrief, i.e., one with the claimed untimely new information\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 7\n\nomitted, which they did on May 24, 2005.

In the\n\nFinal Results, Commerce applied adverse facts available (“AFA”)\n\nto sales made by Wuhan Bee through affiliated parties in the\n\nUnited States, i.e., Presstek and PSH, after July 20, 2003, and\n\nassigned an antidumping duty rate of 183.80% to those sales.\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 82.\n\n\n\n     By their motion, plaintiffs challenge Commerce’s decision to\n\nuse AFA.    They also challenge Commerce’s valuation of the factors\n\nof production of the subject merchandise (in particular, raw\n\nhoney and labor) and Commerce’s calculation of surrogate\n\nfinancial ratios, i.e., the cost of factory overhead; selling,\n\ngeneral and administrative expenses; and profit.   Finally, they\n\nchallenge Commerce’s decision to change the methodology it used\n\nto calculate the assessment rate and cash deposit rate from an ad\n\nvalorem basis to a per kilogram basis.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 8\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     The court reviews the Final Results under the substantial\n\nevidence and in accordance with law standard, set forth in\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i) (“The court shall hold unlawful any\n\ndetermination, finding, or conclusion found . . . to be\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise\n\nnot in accordance with law . . . .”).    “Substantial evidence is\n\n‘such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n\nadequate to support a conclusion.’”     Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp.\n\n(30) v.

Commerce’s Use of Facts Available/Adverse Facts Available\n     with respect to Wuhan Bee’s U.S. Sales\n\n     In determining whether the subject merchandise is being, or\n\nis likely to be, sold at less than fair value, 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677b(a) requires Commerce to make “a fair comparison . . .\n\nbetween the export price or constructed export price and normal\n\nvalue.”   Because a portion of Wuhan Bee’s U.S. sales during the\n\nPOR were made through its U.S. affiliates, Presstek and PSH,\n\nCommerce compared the “constructed export price” of the subject\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 10\n\nmerchandise to normal value.4   “Constructed export price” is\n\n“the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold . . .\n\nin the United States . . . by or for the account of the producer\n\nor exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with\n\nthe producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the\n\nproducer or exporter,” as adjusted.   19 U.S.C. § 1677a(b).\n\n\n\n     In this case, the first sale of Wuhan Bee’s honey to an\n\nunaffiliated U.S. purchaser was made through PSH after it had\n\nblended Wuhan Bee’s honey with honey from other sources.    The\n\n“blend ratios” for the sales Wuhan Bee made through PSH, i.e.,\n\nthe percentage of subject merchandise in each sale, were an\n\nimportant element in the calculation of constructed export price.\n\nIn the Final Results, Commerce found that many of Wuhan Bee’s\n\nreported blend ratios could not be verified as accurate.

The relevant section of the antidumping duty\n\nstatute, 19 U.S.C. § 1677e, requires Commerce to determine (1)\n\nwhether to use facts otherwise available; and, if reliance on\n\nsuch facts is warranted, (2) whether to use an adverse inference\n\nin selecting from among the facts otherwise available.   First,\n\nunder subsection 1677e(a):\n\n          If——\n                 (1) necessary information is not\n                 available on the record, or\n\n                 (2) an interested party or any\n                 other person——\n\n                      (A) withholds information\n                      that has been requested\n                      by [Commerce] . . .\n                      under this subtitle,\n\n                      (B) fails to provide such\n                      information by the\n                      deadlines for submission\n                      of the information or in\n                      the form and manner\n                      requested . . .,\n\n                      (C) significantly impedes\n                      a proceeding under this\n                      subtitle, or\n\n                      (D) provides such\n                      information but the\n                      information cannot be\n                      verified as provided in\n                      section 1677m(i) of this\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 12\n\n                     title,5\n\n          [Commerce] . . . shall, subject to section\n          1677m(d) of this title, use the facts\n          otherwise available in reaching the\n          applicable determination under this subtitle.\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1677e(a).   As the Court of Appeals for the Federal\n\nCircuit has held:\n\n          The focus of subsection (a) is respondent’s\n          failure to provide information. The reason\n          for the failure is of no moment. The mere\n          failure of a respondent to furnish requested\n          information—for any reason—requires Commerce\n          to resort to other sources of information to\n          complete the factual record on which it makes\n          its determination.\n\nNippon Steel Corp. v.

Thus, subsection (a) mandates\n\nthe use of facts otherwise available when a respondent provides\n\nCommerce with information that “cannot be verified.”   19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677e(a)(2)(D).\n\n\n\n     Once it determines that the use of facts otherwise available\n\nis required, Commerce, in some circumstances, may use an\n\ninference that is adverse to the interests of the respondent in\n\nselecting from the facts on the record.   Pursuant to subsection\n\n\n\n     5\n          Subsection 1677m(i) requires Commerce to verify all\ninformation relied upon in reaching its final results under 19\nU.S.C. § 1675(a), if (1) verification is timely requested by an\ninterested party; and (2) no verification was made during the two\nimmediately preceding reviews of the same order.

The Nippon Steel Court stated that, as\n\ndistinguished from subsection (a),\n\n            subsection (b) permits Commerce to “use an\n            inference that is adverse to the interests of\n            [a respondent] in selecting from among the\n            facts otherwise available,” only if Commerce\n            makes the separate determination that the\n            respondent “has failed to cooperate by not\n            acting to the best of its ability to comply.”\n            The focus of subsection (b) is respondent’s\n            failure to cooperate to the best of its\n            ability, not its failure to provide requested\n            information.\n\nNippon Steel, 337 F.3d at 1381 (quoting 19 U.S.C. § 1677e(b))\n\n(emphasis and alteration in original).    “[T]he statutory mandate\n\nthat a respondent act to ‘the best of its ability’ requires the\n\nrespondent to do the maximum it is able to do.”    Id. at 1382.\n\n\n\n     Determining whether a respondent did the maximum it was able\n\nto do to comply with Commerce’s requests involves both objective\n\nand subjective inquiries.    First, Commerce must make “an\n\nobjective showing that a reasonable and responsible importer\n\nwould have known that the requested information was required to\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 14\n\nbe kept and maintained under the applicable statutes, rules, and\n\nregulations.”     Nippon Steel, 337 F.3d at 1382 (citation omitted).\n\nSecond, Commerce must make a subjective showing that the\n\nrespondent not only has failed promptly to produce the requested\n\ninformation, “but further that the failure to fully respond is\n\nthe result of the respondent’s lack of cooperation in either: (a)\n\nfailing to keep and maintain all required records, or (b) failing\n\nto put forth its maximum efforts to investigate and obtain the\n\nrequested information from its records.”     Id. at 1382-83.\n\n\n\n     Finally, for the court to sustain the application of AFA,\n\nCommerce must “articulate why it concluded that a party failed to\n\nact to the best of its ability, and explain why the absence of\n\nthis information [was] of significance to the progress of its\n\ninvestigation.”     Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG v.

Issues & Dec. Mem. at 79.   Further,\n\nCommerce found that resort to facts available was appropriate\n\n“[b]ecause Wuhan Bee did not inform the Department that its blend\n\nratios were not accurate until the Department discovered the fact\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 15\n\nat verification . . . .”   Id. at 80; see SAA at 869, 1994\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 4198 (“[Subsection 1677e(a)] requires\n\nCommerce . . . to make determinations on the basis of the facts\n\navailable where requested information is missing from the record\n\nor cannot be used because, for example, it has not been provided,\n\nit was provided late, or Commerce could not verify the\n\ninformation.”).   In addition, because this discovery was made at\n\nverification, Commerce found that it “did not have the\n\nopportunity to allow Wuhan Bee to correct its deficient data,”\n\npursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1677m(d).   Id.\n\n\n\n     Next, Commerce used an adverse inference in selecting from\n\namong the facts available because it concluded that Wuhan Bee had\n\nfailed to act to the “best of its ability,” i.e., failed to do\n\nthe maximum it was able to do, to produce documents related to\n\nreported blend ratios:\n\n          Wuhan Bee had sufficient opportunity to\n          inform the Department that its blend ratios\n          were not accurate, yet as late into the\n          proceeding as March 15, 2005, respondent\n          asserted on the record just the opposite —\n          that its blend ratios were accurate and could\n          be easily verified. . . . [R]espondent’s own\n          letters to the Department in December 2004\n          and March 2005, addressing various issues\n          regarding the blend ratios and further\n          manufacturing cost, make it clear that\n          respondent knew how important and central\n          these ratios were to the Department’s\n          ultimate margin calculations. Nevertheless,\n          the Department gave respondent appropriate\n          notice in its verification outline that it\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 16\n\n          would be verifying respondent’s blend ratios\n          and that respondent should “be prepared to\n          demonstrate the blend ratio for all\n          sales . . . and provide supporting\n          documentation for all costs associated with\n          further manufacturing.” . . .\n\n          At verification, the Department discovered\n          that the blend ratios were not accurate, at\n          least not with the documentation that\n          respondent was prepared to show the\n          Department. Only at this time did respondent\n          claim that the ratios could not be verified.\n          Wuhan Bee hindered the calculation of\n          accurate dumping margins in this review\n          because it was not more forthcoming about the\n          problems and issues surrounding the reporting\n          of the blend ratios, even though the issue\n          was discussed numerous times throughout this\n          proceeding.\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 81.   In other words, Commerce concluded\n\nthat Wuhan Bee failed to put forth its maximum effort by failing\n\nto inform Commerce of problems surrounding its ability to\n\naccurately report blend ratios and by representing that the blend\n\nratios were accurate and could easily be verified.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs do not challenge the propriety of Commerce’s\n\ndecision to resort to facts available under 19 U.S.C. § 1677e(a).\n\nSee Pls.’ Mem. 32 (acknowledging “errors in the calculation of\n\nblended ratios and the inability of PSH to fully comply with\n\nCommerce’s . . . document and reconciliation requests”).\n\nPlaintiffs do, however, challenge Commerce’s decision to take an\n\nadverse inference against Wuhan Bee in selecting from among the\n\nfacts available.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 17\n\n     First, plaintiffs object to Commerce’s decision to use AFA\n\nbased on the finding that Wuhan Bee and its affiliates did not\n\nact to the best of their abilities.   They argue that Commerce\n\nfailed to articulate why it concluded that a party failed to act\n\nto the best of its ability through a reasoned inquiry into the\n\nfacts.”   Pls.’ Mem. 32.   Plaintiffs insist that the record does\n\nnot support a finding “that Wuhan and its affiliates failed to\n\ncooperate fully with Commerce, or that the errors in blend\n\nratio[s] were intended, or in fact, would have enabled Wuhan to\n\nobtain a more favorable result.”   Pls.’s Mem. 32.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that Commerce decided to apply AFA based on\n\na presumption “that Wuhan was aware, or should have been aware,\n\nthat some of the blend ratios it calculated were in error.”\n\nPls.’ Mem. 21.   They claim this presumption is unreasonable and\n\nunfounded given the “commercial realities” of PSH’s honey\n\nblending.   Pls.’ Mem. 24.   In particular, plaintiffs contend that\n\nthe record evidence shows that: (1) blending honey is an “art\n\nform,” which is done according to customer preferences with\n\nrespect to moisture content and color; (2) “honey is blended\n\naccording to a plan recorded on . . . daily processing\n\nreport[s],” which “do not specify the quantity or source of the\n\nhoney barrels that enter into production”; and (3) “for\n\ncommercial purposes, the amount of either subject or non-subject\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 18\n\nmerchandise is considered immaterial.”   Pls.’ Mem. 23-24.    As a\n\nresult, for this review, Wuhan Bee manually reviewed documents to\n\ncalculate blend ratios, since “PSH did not maintain blend ratios\n\nin the normal course of its record keeping,” then reported the\n\nblend ratios in its section C and supplemental questionnaire\n\nresponses.   Pls.’ Mem. 28.\n\n\n\n      For its part, defendant argues that “Commerce properly\n\ndetermined that [Wuhan Bee] and PSH failed promptly to produce or\n\nput forth the maximum effort to investigate and obtain the\n\nrequested information” about blended honey sales.   Def.’s Opp’n\n\n12.   Defendant insists that: (1) a reasonable importer would have\n\nknown that the requested information was required to be kept and\n\nmaintained, Def.’s Opp’n 15; and (2) Wuhan Bee failed to\n\ncooperate fully because it knew that blend ratios were a\n\nsignificant issue in Commerce’s investigation and had notice that\n\nCommerce would examine those ratios at verification, yet failed\n\nto put forth the maximum effort to investigate and obtain the\n\nrequested information.   Def.’s Opp’n 18-22.\n\n\n\n      The court finds that Commerce’s application of AFA is\n\njustified.   Although not explicitly identified as such, the first\n\nrequired finding under Nippon Steel, i.e., an objective inquiry,\n\nhas been satisfied.   The key to this inquiry is whether\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 19\n\nplaintiffs’ behavior has been reasonable and responsible.    As\n\nexpressed in the Final Results, Commerce apparently found that\n\nplaintiffs were neither reasonable nor responsible in their\n\nrecord keeping and in representing that their questionnaire\n\nresponses were accurate and could easily be verified.    Commerce\n\nfurther apparently found that a reasonable and responsible\n\nrespondent would have brought any problems surrounding its\n\nsupporting documentation to Commerce’s attention before the\n\nverification.   These assumptions are consistent with the Nippon\n\nSteel Court’s injunction that a reasonable importer “have\n\nfamiliarity with all of the records it maintains in its\n\npossession, custody, or control; and   . . . conduct prompt,\n\ncareful, and comprehensive investigations of all relevant records\n\nthat refer or relate to the imports in question . . . .”       Nippon\n\nSteel, 337 F.3d at 1382.\n\n\n\n     The second required finding, that Wuhan Bee failed to act to\n\nthe best of its ability, has also been satisfied.   Based on\n\ncorrespondence between Wuhan Bee and Commerce, it is clear that\n\nWuhan Bee recognized that blended honey sales and further\n\nmanufacturing expenses were significant issues in this review and\n\nthat the databases submitted in response to Commerce’s\n\nquestionnaires on these issues would be the subject of\n\nverification.   See, e.g., Letter from Jeffrey S. Grimson to\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                          Page 20\n\nCommerce of 12/3/04, Pub.

Indeed, it represented that its questionnaire\n\nresponses could be verified:\n\n            Wuhan Bee’s responses to the Department’s\n            questionnaires have been sufficiently\n            complete and accurate for the Department to\n            be able to complete its verification of PSH’s\n            resale prices and U.S. expenses, including\n            further manufacturing expenses, when\n            verification takes place . . . .\n\nLetter from Bruce M.

Cir. 2004).\n\nCommerce’s decision whether or not to take an adverse inference,\n\nhowever, does not turn on whether Wuhan Bee’s failure to comply\n\nwith Commerce’s requests resulted in any advantage to it.    That\n\nWuhan Bee did not comply to the best of its ability is enough to\n\ntrigger the use of an adverse inference.    Nippon Steel, 337 F.3d\n\nat 1381.    Moreover, to the extent plaintiffs argue that Wuhan Bee\n\ndid not “intend” the errors in blend ratios, this argument is\n\nimmaterial because intent is not relevant to Commerce’s decision\n\nto use AFA.    Id. at 1383 (“The statutory trigger for Commerce's\n\nconsideration of an adverse inference is simply a failure to\n\ncooperate to the best of respondent’s ability, regardless of\n\nmotivation or intent.”).   It may be true, as plaintiffs contend,\n\nthat the Case Brief and the attachment did not contain new\n\ninformation, but rather a resorting of information that had been\n\nverified.   See Pls.’ Mem. 30-32.   Nonetheless, because the sole\n\npurpose of the attachment to the Case Brief was to show that “any\n\ndifferences between ‘precise’ quantities sold and ‘actual’\n\nquantities reported would not have [had] an advantageous impact\n\non Wuhan Bee’s margins,” Case Brief, Conf. Doc. 113, Attach. 1 at\n\n20, Commerce’s rejection of the attachment and narrative\n\nreferences thereto, if in error, was harmless error.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 24\n\n      In light of the foregoing, Commerce justifiably found that a\n\nreasonable importer would have known that blend ratios were an\n\nimportant issue in this investigation and that the questionnaire\n\nresponses, and the documents to support the responses, with\n\nrespect to such ratios would be subject to verification.\n\nCommerce also reasonably concluded that Wuhan Bee was aware that\n\nthe mix of subject and nonsubject merchandise in U.S. sales would\n\nbe the subject of inquiry by Commerce at verification.\n\nFurthermore, Wuhan Bee’s failure to maintain adequate records of\n\nblended honey sales and to bring any of the documentary problems\n\nto Commerce’s attention prior to verification justified\n\nCommerce’s finding that Wuhan Bee failed to do the maximum it was\n\nable to do.   The court thus sustains Commerce’s use of AFA.\n\n\n\nII.   Commerce’s Construction of Normal Value\n\n      Next, the court turns to plaintiffs’ challenges to\n\nCommerce’s construction of normal value under 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677b(c)(1).

Factors of production\n\ninclude the quantities of raw materials consumed and the hours of\n\nlabor needed to produce the subject merchandise.    See 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677b(c)(3).\n\n\n\n     Commerce is directed to use “the best available information\n\nregarding the values of such factors in a market economy country\n\nor countries considered to be appropriate by the administering\n\nauthority.”   19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(1).   What constitutes best\n\navailable information is not defined by statute or regulation,\n\nbut Commerce normally considers the quality, specificity and\n\ncontemporaneity of the data and prefers to use public, country-\n\nwide data, where it is available.

See Factors of\n\nProduction Valuation Mem. for the Final Results, Pub. Doc. 340 at\n\n2.\n\n\n\n     Commerce decided to use EDA Data exclusively in valuing raw\n\nhoney.    In doing so, it rejected three articles also submitted by\n\nplaintiffs, which contained different values of honey, from: (1)\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 27\n\nHindu Business Line;8 (2) Indiainfoline;9 and (3) Indian\n\nExpress.10    Plaintiffs argue that the values contained in the\n\nthree articles should be averaged with the value of honey found\n\nin the EDA Data.\n\n\n\n     In the Final Results, Commerce explained its decision to\n\nvalue raw honey using just the EDA Data: “[T]he EDA Data . . .\n\nconstitute[s] a[n] . . . appropriate surrogate value source for\n\nthis POR.

Rather, they argue that Commerce’s rejection of the other\n\nsources plaintiffs proposed was unreasonable.   According to\n\nplaintiffs, the three articles “covered different regions of\n\nIndia but showed a relatively narrow range of prices for raw\n\nhoney . . . .”   Pls.’ Reply Br. to Def.’s & Def.-Ints.’ Resp.\n\nBrs.

Pls.’ Mem. 34; Pls.’\n\nReply 9.   Thus, plaintiffs contend that “[a]s all information on\n\nthe record is region-specific, the most reasonable method to\n\narrive at a country-wide surrogate value is to calculate an\n\naverage price derived from all this data . . . .”   Pls.’ Mem. 37.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs therefore insist that “Commerce’s reasons for\n\nrejecting [the Hindu Business Line, Indiainfoline and Indian\n\nExpress articles] were arbitrary and capricious.”   Pls.’ Reply 9.\n\n           Commerce rejected the [Hindu Business Line\n           article] because the information related to a\n           cooperative, while using the data from\n           another cooperative, [Mahabaleshwar Honey\n           Production Cooperative Society Ltd.], to\n           determine financial ratios. Commerce\n           rejected the [Indiainfoline article] as it\n           had concerns over the origins of the article\n           written by a business student, but used the\n           EDA Data, found on a random website.\n           Further, Commerce relied upon articles\n           published in . . . Indiainfoline . . . in\n           other proceedings. Finally, Commerce\n           rejected [the Indian Express article] as it\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 30\n\n          was limited to the results of a single\n          beekeeper and had previously rejected this\n          information before. Yet, there is nothing to\n          suggest that the price information in the\n          article was unreliable.\n\nPls.’ Reply 9.   Plaintiffs thus seek a remand with instructions\n\nto value raw honey based on an average of the honey values found\n\nin the Hindu Business Line, the Indiainfoline and the Indian\n\nExpress articles as well as the EDA Data.\n\n\n\n     In response, defendant contends that Commerce’s explanations\n\nfor rejecting plaintiffs’ proposed data are reasonable, and that\n\nthe record supports Commerce’s decision not to average the honey\n\nvalues:\n\n          [T]he [Hindu Business Line, Indiainfoline and\n          Indian Express] articles either quote prices\n          from single producers, or contain data from\n          unknown origins, which Commerce determined\n          not to be comparable with the EDA data.\n          Further Commerce “continue[d] to find that\n          the [three articles] are unreliable sources\n          for valuing honey.” . . .\n\n          In this case, the sources for the surrogate\n          value of raw honey contained upon the record\n          were all regionally limited. EDA data are\n          based upon the raw honey beekeeping industry\n          in the second largest honey producing state\n          in India, offering more representative prices\n          than the article from Indiainfoline, the\n          prices for which are from the Kerala region,\n          which accounts for only nine percent of\n          India’s honey production. In addition,\n          Commerce rejected the articles from\n          [Indiainfoline] and Hindu Business Line\n          because they either quote prices from single\n          producers, making them less representative\n          than EDA data, or contain data from unknown\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 31\n\n           origins rather than from public sources,\n           unlike the EDA data.\n\nDef.’s Opp’n 29 & 31.   Thus, defendant insists that, since the\n\nalternative data sources proposed by plaintiffs were not\n\nreliable, Commerce’s decision not to average them with the EDA\n\nData is justified.\n\n\n\n     Commerce enjoys some latitude in selecting among the\n\navailable information in valuing the factors of production.     See\n\nNation Ford Chem. Co. v.

To determine whether Commerce’s selection of surrogate\n\nvalues furthers this statutory purpose, the court must determine\n\nwhether “Commerce’s choice of what constitutes the best available\n\ninformation evidences a rational and reasonable relationship to\n\nthe factor of production it represents.”   Shandong Huarong, 25\n\nCIT at 838, 159 F. Supp. 2d at 719 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n     Here, the court finds reasonable Commerce’s use of the EDA\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 32\n\nData and the exclusion of the other three sources proposed by\n\nplaintiffs.   First, plaintiffs do not dispute the reliability of\n\nthe EDA Data.   Indeed, although now declaring the data as being\n\nfrom a “random website,” at the administrative level they argued\n\nin favor of Commerce using it as a part of an average.     See\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 10.    Moreover, Commerce’s decision not to\n\naverage the EDA Data with the three articles proposed by\n\nplaintiffs was reasonable in light of the deficiencies Commerce\n\nfound in those sources.\n\n\n\n     First, Commerce was justified in rejecting the Hindu\n\nBusiness Line article.    In a single sentence the article states a\n\nrange of prices received by a single producer, the Girijan Co-\n\noperative Corporation Ltd.    See Hindu Business Line Article at 2.\n\nThe EDA Data, on the other hand, contains information on numerous\n\nproducers and therefore represents a wider range of prices.      In\n\naddition, there is no indication that the sources of the data\n\ncontained in the Hindu Business Line article are publicly\n\navailable.    See Issues & Dec. Mem. at 12.\n\n\n\n     Second, the court finds no error in Commerce’s conclusion\n\nthat the Indiainfoline article was unreliable.    Commerce found\n\nthat unlike the EDA Data, the sources of which were well-\n\ndocumented and made available by a business entity, the\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 33\n\nIndiainfoline article contained nothing to indicate it was\n\nreliable.    In particular, there was “no additional information on\n\nthe author’s qualifications or the sources of his information”\n\nother than his status as a first-year business student.     Id. 12-\n\n13.\n\n\n\n      Third, the Indian Express article was found not to be as\n\nrepresentative as the EDA Data because it pertained to the\n\nexperience of only a single beekeeper.\n\n\n\n      In light of the proposed sources’ deficiencies, the court\n\nfinds reasonable Commerce’s decision not to average this data\n\nwith the EDA Data, which Commerce found was (1) publicly\n\navailable; (2) well-documented, with numerous price points for\n\nmultiple types of honey from many suppliers; (3) detailed\n\ninformation on production, inputs and beekeepers; (4) based on\n\nIndia’s second largest honey-producing region (Bihar); and (5)\n\ncontemporaneous with the POR.   Thus, Commerce’s conclusion that\n\nthe EDA Data was the “best available information” on the record\n\non which to base its valuation of raw honey is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence and in accordance with law.\n\n\n\n            2.   Labor Costs\n\n      The cost of labor is another factor of production used to\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 34\n\nconstruct normal value.   As this Court has observed, “Commerce\n\ntreats the wage rate differently from all other factors of\n\nproduction[.] [F]or labor, Commerce employs regression-based wage\n\nrates reflective of the observed relationship between wages and\n\nnational income in market economy countries.”11    Dorbest Ltd. v.\n\nUnited States, 30 CIT __, __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"818337\"><a href=\"/opinion/818337/dorbest-ltd-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Commerce’s exclusion of available\n\ndata, plaintiffs argue, was arbitrary and contrary to Commerce’s\n\nown position that “more data is better than less data.”    Pls.’\n\nMem. 41.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that in performing its regression\n\nanalysis, Commerce improperly combined data from 2001 (regarding\n\nthe wage rates and per capita GNI of the fifty-six market economy\n\ncountries) with data from 2002 (regarding Chinese GNI), when 2002\n\ndata was available with respect to the wage rates and per capita\n\nGNI of the market economy countries.    Pls.’ Mem. 17 (citing\n\narguments raised below in plaintiffs’ Case Brief dated May 10,\n\n2005, Pub. Doc. 301 at 38-39).    Plaintiffs charge that by mixing\n\nChinese GNI data from 2002 with wage rate and per capita GNI data\n\nfrom 2001, Commerce violated its regulations which require use of\n\n“current data.”   Pls.’ Mem. 41 (quoting 19 C.F.R.\n\n§ 351.408(c)(3)).    Thus, plaintiffs argue, Commerce’s methodology\n\n“critically undermines any assertion that the regression based\n\nwage calculation significantly enhances the accuracy and fairness\n\nin the NME case.”    Pls.’ Mem. 41.\n\n\n\n     Defendant responds that because “Commerce has consistently\n\nbased its regression analysis upon average wages from a basket of\n\n56 countries since it updated its regression analysis in 2000,”\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 37\n\nthe twin aims of predictability and fairness are served by using\n\nthis method of calculating wage rate.   Def.’s Opp’n 43.    In\n\naddition, Commerce insists that changing the methodology as\n\nplaintiffs propose, i.e., to add twenty-two countries to the\n\nbasket currently compiled, is a significant change that would\n\nrequire comment from the general public, which would be\n\nimpracticable in this review.   Def.’s Opp’n 43-44.\n\n\n\n     As to its wage rate finding, however, Commerce requests\n\nremand because it acknowledges that it “mistakenly relied upon\n\nincome data from two different years [i.e., 2001 and 2002,] in\n\nits calculation of the surrogate wage rate.”    Def.’s Opp’n 41.\n\nThus, defendant asks the court to sustain its wage rate\n\ncalculation methodology and to remand for the limited purpose of\n\nrecalculating the labor wage rate using “the correct GNI data.”\n\nDef.’s Opp’n 45.\n\n\n\n     The court cannot sustain Commerce’s labor calculation.      When\n\nvaluing factors of production, Commerce is required to use “the\n\nbest available information regarding the values of such factors\n\nin a market economy country or countries considered to be\n\nappropriate.”   19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(1).   In the Final Results,\n\nCommerce rejected plaintiffs’ request to recalculate the\n\nsurrogate wage:\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 38\n\n          The Department is reviewing its regression-\n          based wage rate calculation . . .; however,\n          comprehensively re-examining each country in\n          the existing dataset and recalculating the\n          wage rate regression using GNI requires more\n          time than is currently available. To revise\n          the data here would be impracticable given\n          the time constraints of this review. The\n          Department is fully satisfied that the\n          current figures are reasonable and correct,\n          and will use them unless and until they are\n          changed as a result of a thorough review.\n          Recalculating the regression analysis using a\n          significantly different basket of countries\n          would amount to a significant change in the\n          Department’s methodology; such a change\n          should be subject to notice and comment from\n          the general public. Thus, it would be\n          inappropriate to restrict this public-comment\n          process to the context of the instant review.\n          Consequently, the Department will invite\n          comments from the general public on this\n          matter in a proceeding separate from the\n          current review of this order.\n\nIssues & Dec. Mem. at 28.   In other words, Commerce declined to\n\nrevise the data set it relied upon in the Final Results because:\n\n(1) it was impracticable under the statutory deadlines for\n\ncompleting its investigation; and (2) recalculating the\n\nregression analysis using a significantly different basket of\n\ncountries would likely result in a significant change in\n\nmethodology that would require comment from the public.    This\n\nCourt has rejected both of these arguments.\n\n\n\n     In Dorbest Ltd., the Court found wanting the argument that\n\nstatutory deadlines for completing investigations prevented\n\nCommerce from considering available information in updating its\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 39\n\nregression model:\n\n          Congress was certainly sensitive to this\n          concern [of completing investigations within\n          statutory deadlines] by limiting Commerce’s\n          choice of data to that “available” during the\n          investigation. But in recognizing this\n          concern, Congress nonetheless required that\n          if information was available, i.e., placed on\n          the record, Commerce was compelled to\n          consider it. Therefore, Commerce’s defense\n          runs directly against its statutory duty.\n          Consequently, Commerce’s . . . defense\n          must . . . be rejected.\n\nId. at __, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1296.   As to Commerce’s past\n\npractice of relying on data from fifty-six countries in making\n\nPRC wage rate calculations and the need for public comment prior\n\nto any change in that practice, the Dorbest Ltd. Court observed:\n\n          Commerce’s . . . argument . . . that the data\n          set in question must be developed through\n          notice-and-comment rulemaking[] appears to be\n          inconsistent with Commerce’s past practice.\n          Commerce has in the past updated and expanded\n          the number of countries within the data set\n          without resorting to notice and comment\n          rulemaking. In fact, during the\n          investigation here, Commerce used a basket of\n          fifty-six countries, but during the voluntary\n          remand, used a basket of only fifty-four. No\n          notice-and-comment rulemaking was used to\n          effect the change. Commerce has also, over\n          time, expanded its data set of countries from\n          forty-five countries to fifty-six countries\n          without vetting its choices through notice-\n          and-comment rulemaking.\n\nId. at __, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1295.   The court agrees with the\n\nDorbest Ltd. Court’s observations and likewise rejects Commerce’s\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                      Page 40\n\narguments.13\n\n\n\n     In light of the foregoing, this matter is remanded so that\n\nCommerce may consider the information plaintiffs have placed on\n\nthe record with respect to the twenty-two additional countries.\n\nFurther, Commerce must explain its decisions: (1) to exclude the\n\ntwenty-two low-wage countries with respect to which plaintiffs\n\nplaced information on the record; and (2) to include data from\n\nhigh-wage countries, such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom and\n\nthe United States.   In the event that on remand Commerce rejects\n\nthe data from the twenty-two additional countries, it must\n\nexplain its decision with reference to specific evidence and\n\nwithout reference to time constraints.   In addition, Commerce\n\nmust explain its decision to rely on a methodology that results\n\nin the disparity observed between the hourly wage rate in, e.g.,\n\nIndia ($0.15/hour), a market economy country found to be\n\neconomically comparable to the PRC, and the hourly wage rate\n\n\n\n\n     13\n          The court also notes that Commerce announced a revised\nmethodology in a notice published on October 19, 2006.

For the manufacturing\n            overhead ratio, Commerce typically divides\n            total manufacturing overhead expenses by\n            total direct manufacturing expenses.\n            Finally, to determine a surrogate ratio for\n            profit, Commerce divides before-tax profit by\n            the sum of direct expenses, manufacturing\n            overhead and SG & A expenses.   These ratios\n            are converted to percentages (“rates”) and\n            multiplied by the surrogate values assigned\n            by Commerce for the direct expenses,\n            manufacturing overhead and SG & A expenses.\n\nId. at __, 318 F.

With respect to specificity, we\n            note that MHPC is a honey processor in India,\n            and the financial statements include details\n            on MHPC’s costs and revenues related to its\n            honey processing business.

The MHPC financial statement,\n\nhowever, did not include a raw material cost for honey.\n\nAccordingly, Commerce extrapolated the raw material cost, using\n\nthe following methodology:\n\n           [The] raw material cost was derived by\n           dividing the total cost of honey by the\n           quantity [MHPC] purchased [from its members]\n           and then multiplying this figure by the sum\n           of the quantities [MHPC] sold [to its\n           customers] and lost during production.\n\nIssued & Dec.

See\n\nFactors of Production Valuation Mem. for the Final Results, Pub.\n\nDoc. 340, Attach. II (Surrogate Financial Ratios).\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that: (1) Commerce’s use of the MHPC\n\nfinancial statement was unreasonable because it did not include a\n\nfigure representing the raw material cost for honey; and (2) the\n\nmethodology Commerce used to extrapolate the raw material cost\n\nfor honey is flawed because it is based on unsupported\n\nassumptions.   Pls.’ Mem. 37-38.\n\n\n\n     First, plaintiffs claim that without “separate opening and\n\nclosing raw materials inventories or [an] indicat[ion] [of] the\n\namount of honey processed during the reported accounting period,”\n\nthe MHPC financial statement is incomplete on its face.    Pls.’\n\nMem. 37.   Plaintiffs contend that the absence of this information\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 45\n\nmakes Commerce’s decision to use the MHPC financial statement\n\nunreasonable.\n\n\n\n     Second, the methodology Commerce used to extrapolate the raw\n\nmaterial cost for honey, plaintiffs claim, is based on\n\nunsupported assumptions.    According to plaintiffs:\n\n          In the absence of . . . data [on either the\n          opening and closing raw materials inventories\n          or the amount of honey processed during the\n          reported accounting period], Commerce assumed\n          [1] any raw honey processed from opening\n          period inventory was valued at the price of\n          raw honey purchased during the [reported\n          accounting period]. Commerce further assumed\n          [2] all honey sold during the [reported\n          accounting period] was processed during the\n          [reported accounting period].\n\n          Commerce’s calculation of financial ratios is\n          predicated on these assumptions. However,\n          there is nothing in the MHPC Financials to\n          support these assumptions, as opposed to\n          alternative assumptions that honey consumed\n          from inventory to process finished honey was\n          priced higher or lower than purchased raw\n          honey or that MHPC processed more honey than\n          it sold during the [reported accounting\n          period] or less than it sold – any of which\n          would radically change the surrogate\n          financial ratios. As such it was impossible\n          for Commerce to calculate accurate, actual\n          surrogate financial ratios from the MHPC\n          Financials.\n\nPls.’ Mem. 37-38.    In other words, plaintiffs charge that the\n\nMHPC financial statement does not support the assumptions that\n\n(1) the cost of raw honey (if any) taken from MHPC’s inventory\n\nwas the same as later purchased raw honey; and that (2) all of\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 46\n\nthe honey MHPC sold during the reported accounting period was\n\nprocessed during that period.   Commerce would not have had to\n\nmake these assumptions, plaintiffs argue, had it used the Apis\n\nfinancial statement.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs also argue that the MHPC financial statement\n\nlacks a report indicating it is in accordance with Indian\n\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).    Pls.’ Mem.\n\n38-39.   Plaintiffs argue that as a cooperative, MHPC is not\n\nrequired to report its financial statements in accordance with\n\nthe Indian GAAP.   Pls.’ Mem. 39.   They further contend that Apis\n\nis so required, and “therefore its auditor’s report illustrates\n\nthat the statements are reliable as in accordance with the\n\nfinancial/accounting standards of India.”   Pls.’ Reply 13 n.18.\n\nPlaintiffs thus seek a remand to Commerce with instructions to\n\nuse the Apis financial statement to calculate the surrogate\n\nvalues for factory overhead, SG&A expenses and profit.\n\n\n\n     For its part, defendant contends Commerce’s use of the 2003-\n\n2004 MHPC financial statement to derive surrogate financial\n\nratios was reasonable because the statement was contemporaneous\n\nwith the POR and included complete and detailed information\n\nregarding MHPC’s financial and business operations.    Def.’s Opp’n\n\n35-36.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                       Page 47\n\n      Next, defendant argues that the methodology Commerce used to\n\nextrapolate the cost of raw materials consumed is reasonable.\n\nFirst, defendant contends that the methodology “is consistent\n\nwith [the antidumping statute,]17 which permits Commerce to\n\nallocate costs and make adjustments where the reported costs do\n\nnot reasonably reflect the costs associated with the subject\n\nmerchandise.”   Def.’s Opp’n 37; see also Issues & Dec. Mem. at\n\n18.   Second, defendant states: “[R]espondents have cited no\n\nspecific evidence that the derived MHPC raw material cost of\n\nhoney is distortive.”   Def.’s Opp’n 37 (quoting Issues & Dec.\n\nMem. at 18).    Finally, with respect to plaintiffs’ argument that\n\nthe MHPC financial statement is not GAAP compliant, defendant\n\ncontends that plaintiffs’ argument is barred because it was not\n\npreviously raised before Commerce.   Def.’s Opp’n 32; see also\n\nDef.-Ints.’ Opp’n 30.\n\n\n\n      The court finds that Commerce was justified in determining\n\nthat the 2003-2004 MHPC financial statement was the best\n\navailable information to value factory overhead, SG&A expenses\n\nand profit.    It is apparent from the Final Results that Commerce\n\nexamined both the MHPC and Apis financial statements and compared\n\n\n\n      17\n          In its opposition brief, defendant incorrectly cites 19\nU.S.C. § 1677a(c), which pertains to adjustments for export price\nand constructed export price.

It then\n\nconcluded based on this examination that “the Apis financial\n\nstatement . . . is not a reliable source for calculating the\n\nsurrogate financial ratios because it is neither complete, nor\n\nsufficiently detailed to provide a reliable source for surrogate\n\nvalues.”   Issues & Dec.

The court thus finds that Commerce’s\n\ndetermination that the MHPC financial statement was the best\n\navailable information to value financial ratios was reasonable.\n\n\n\n     While Commerce reasonably found the MHPC’s financial\n\nstatement to be more reliable than Apis’s, as has been noted, the\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 49\n\nMHPC financial statement lacks a figure representing the raw\n\nmaterial cost for honey.   In the absence of this data, Commerce\n\nextrapolated the data using a methodology, which it expressed\n\nmathematically as follows: total cost of honey purchased during\n\nMHPC’s reporting year, i.e., April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2004\n\n(2,598,344 Rs.)/quantity purchased during that year (29,433.80\n\nkg.) X the sum of the quantities sold and lost during production\n\nduring that year (40,540.20 Rs.) = 3,578,789.88 Rs.   See Factors\n\nof Production Valuation Mem. for the Final Results, Pub. Doc.\n\n340, Attach. II.   The court will sustain Commerce’s chosen\n\nmethodology “[a]s long as the agency’s methodology and procedures\n\nare reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and\n\nthere is substantial evidence on the record supporting the\n\nagency’s conclusions . . . .”   Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A., 10\n\nCIT at 404-05, 636 F. Supp. at 966; Shakeproof Assembly\n\nComponents, 268 F.3d at 1382 (“[T]he critical question is whether\n\nthe methodology used by Commerce is based upon the best available\n\ninformation and establishes antidumping margins as accurately as\n\npossible.”).\n\n\n\n     The court finds reasonable Commerce’s methodology for\n\ndetermining the raw material cost of honey.   First, while\n\nplaintiffs complain that the methodology was unsupported by the\n\nrecord, they do not propose an alternative methodology.    Second,\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 50\n\nCommerce’s use of the methodology was not unreasonable because it\n\nresulted in Commerce’s use of prices that are closest in time to\n\nthe POR.   Issues & Dec. Mem. at 17 (“[I]t is the Department’s\n\nestablished practice to select the most contemporaneous surrogate\n\nvalues to value the factors-of-production and financial\n\nratios.”).\n\n\n\n     With respect to plaintiffs’ GAAP argument, the court finds\n\nit is barred because it was not raised before the agency.    Title\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2637(d) provides that “the Court of International\n\nTrade shall, where appropriate, require the exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies.”   Id.   The doctrine of exhaustion is not\n\nan absolute requirement in Commerce cases; it is left to this\n\nCourt to determine when exhaustion is appropriate.     Koyo Seiko\n\nCo. v.

Commerce’s Calculation of Plaintiffs’ Assessment Rate and\n     Cash Deposit Rate\n\n     The court next turns to plaintiffs’ challenge to Commerce’s\n\nmethod of calculating cash deposit and assessment rates.       In the\n\nFinal Results, Commerce “determined that, with respect to the\n\nantidumping duty order on honey from the PRC, per-kilogram\n\nantidumping duty cash deposit and assessment rates are\n\nappropriate.”     Issues & Dec. Mem. at 30 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that “[t]hroughout the prior annual\n\nreviews and new shipper reviews on honey, Commerce’s practice was\n\nto base its assessment rate and cash deposit rate upon an ad\n\nvalorem basis.”    Pls.’ Reply 14.   Yet, “after all case briefs and\n\nrebuttal briefs had been filed, and the record closed . . .\n\nCommerce requested comments regarding a possible revision to\n\nCommerce’s standard methodology for calculating assessments and\n\ncash deposits, from an ad valorem basis to a per kilogram basis,”\n\nand allowed “less than two days for commenting on the issue,\n\ndenying Wuhan an opportunity to fully review and comment on [the]\n\nissue.”   Pls.’ Mem. 42.    Plaintiffs argue that “‘principles of\n\nfairness prevent Commerce from changing its methodology at this\n\nlate stage {and} Commerce is required to administer the\n\nantidumping laws fairly.’”     Pls.’ Reply 14 (quoting Shikoku Chem.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                           Page 53\n\nCorp. v. United States, 16 CIT 382, 388, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596468\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596468/shikoku-chemicals-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421\n\n(1992)).\n\n\n\n     Defendant responds that while Commerce’s regulations\n\n“provide for the agency to ‘normally’18 calculate the assessment\n\nrate upon an ad valorem basis,” the “regulation does not require\n\nCommerce to calculate the assessment rate on an ad valorem\n\nbasis.”     Def.’s Opp’n 38, 39 (emphasis in original).   With\n\nrespect to the amount of time given to the parties to comment on\n\nthe proposed use of a per kilogram methodology, defendant asserts\n\nthat “Wuhan could have requested an extension of time, but did\n\nnot.”     Def.’s Opp’n 40.   Thus, defendant urges the court to\n\nsustain Commerce’s decision to apply an assessment rate and the\n\n\n     18\n          Title 19 C.F.R. § 351.212 states that “normally” the\nassessment rate will be based on the entered value of\nmerchandise. Entered value is not, however, the sole means by\nwhich Commerce may calculate assessment rate:\n\n             If the Secretary has conducted a review of an\n             antidumping order under § 351.213\n             (administrative review), . . . the Secretary\n             normally will calculate an assessment rate\n             for each importer of subject merchandise\n             covered by the review. The Secretary\n             normally will calculate the assessment rate\n             by dividing the dumping margin found on the\n             subject merchandise examined by the entered\n             value of such merchandise for normal customs\n             duty purposes. The Secretary then will\n             instruct the Customs Service to assess\n             antidumping duties by applying the assessment\n             rate to the entered value of the merchandise.\n\n19 C.F.R. § 351.212(b)(1).\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 54\n\ncash deposit rate on a per kilogram basis.\n\n\n\n     Here, because (1) Commerce used the ad valorem methodology\n\nto calculate such rates in the first annual review and new\n\nshipper reviews on honey,19 and (2) Commerce asked for comments\n\non a possible change from an ad valorem to a per kilogram basis\n\nlate in the course of this review, i.e., after the record was\n\nclosed, the court finds that Commerce unreasonably restricted the\n\ntime in which the parties could comment to two days.20    While the\n\nregulations do not require Commerce to use the ad valorem method\n\nin all situations, as evidenced by the word “normally,”\n\nconsiderations of fairness favor allowing plaintiffs more time to\n\nrespond to Commerce’s proposed change in methodology after having\n\nused the ad valorem methodology in this and prior reviews.    As\n\n\n\n     19\n          See, e.g., Honey from the PRC, 68 Fed. Reg. 69,988,\n69,994 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 16, 2003) (prelim. results of\nfirst antidumping duty admin. rev.) (“[T]he Department will issue\nappraisement instructions directly to CBP to assess antidumping\nduties on appropriate entries by applying the assessment rate to\nthe entered value of the merchandise.”); Honey from the PRC, 69\nFed. Reg. 69,350, 69,356 (Dep’t of Commerce Nov. 29, 2004)\n(notice of prelim. results of new shipper revs.) (“[W]e will\ncalculate importer-specific ad valorem duty assessment rates\nbased on the ratio of the total amount of the dumping margins\ncalculated for the examined sales to the total entered value of\nthose same sales.”).\n     20\n          By letter dated May 24, 2005, Commerce requested\ncomments from the interested parties regarding its proposed\nrevision to the assessment and cash deposit methodology by the\nclose of business on May 26, 2005. Letter from Commerce to All\nInterested Parties of 5/24/05, Pub. Doc. 317 at 1.\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                        Page 55\n\nnoted in the Final Results, Commerce’s decision to use a per\n\nkilogram methodology here was based on its finding that “there\n\ncan be a substantial difference between the U.S. sales price for\n\nhoney and the average entered value reported to U.S. Customs and\n\nBorder Protection.”   Issues & Dec. Mem. at 30.   This finding led\n\nCommerce to conclude that it “[was] unable to calculate ad\n\nvalorem cash deposit rates that [would] ensure the collection of\n\ntotal antidumping duties due.”    Id.   Commerce reached its\n\ndecision, however, without adequate time being allotted for\n\neither the giving of comments or for consideration of comments.\n\nAs a result, plaintiffs were prejudiced by the Department’s\n\nactions.   See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. United States, 14 CIT 253,\n\n257, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1459584\"><a href=\"/opinion/1459584/sea-land-service-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Cir. 1991).     The\n\ncourt thus finds that on remand plaintiffs shall have the\n\nopportunity to submit further comments on whether Commerce should\n\ncalculate assessment and cash deposit rates on an ad valorem\n\nbasis or a per kilogram basis, in light of Commerce’s concern\n\nthat it would be unable to “ensure the collection of total\n\nantidumping duties due.”   Id.   Furthermore, plaintiff shall be\n\nallowed to place evidence on the record, should it find it\n\nnecessary to do so, specifically with respect to how an ad\n\fCourt No. 05-00438                                         Page 56\n\nvalorem methodology furthers, or does not further, the collection\n\nof total duties owed.   Finally, Commerce must fully explain its\n\ndecision to use a per kilogram or ad valorem methodology by\n\nreference to evidence placed on the record.\n\n\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the forgoing reasons, the court sustains the Final\n\nResults in part and remands for further action consistent with\n\nthis opinion.
