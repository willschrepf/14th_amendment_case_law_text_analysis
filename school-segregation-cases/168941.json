Plaintiffs-appellants, seven\n\nCaucasian officers of the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\" or the\n\n\"Department\"),1 allege that their constitutional rights to equal\n\nprotection    were    violated     when    the    Department    promoted    three\n\nAfrican-American      police     officers    to    sergeant     instead    of   the\n\nappellants, who had the same ranking on the list of officers\n\neligible for promotion.2          The district court found that the race-\n\nconscious    action    of   the    City    was    narrowly     tailored   to    the\n\ncompelling state interests of remedying past discrimination and\n\navoiding litigation, and therefore, passed strict scrutiny. Cotter\n\nv. City of Boston, 193 F. Supp. 2d 323, 357 (D. Mass. 2002).                    The\n\ndistrict    court    also   retained      jurisdiction   to    consider    future\n\nracially motivated decisions by the Department.                 Id. at 356-57.\n\nAppellants appeal the district court's decision, and the City\n\ncross-appeals on the issues of standing and retained jurisdiction.\n\nFirst, we find that appellants have standing to seek immediate\n\n\n1\n  The officers are Winifred N. Cotter, Vincent J. DiFazio, John P.\nDoris, William J. Dwan, William G. Knecht, Patrick L. Murphy, and\nThomas L. Sexton.\n2\n   Plaintiffs originally filed suit against the City of Boston and\nJames J. Hartnett, Jr., in his official capacity as Personnel\nAdministrator of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Human Resources\nDivision. Hartnett settled with plaintiffs and was dropped from\nthe suit. We permitted the Massachusetts Association of Minority\nLaw Enforcement Officers (\"MAMLEO\"), and Dennis A. White and Harold\nWhite, two of the African-American officers who were promoted to\nsergeant, to intervene as defendants. Cotter v. Mass. Ass'n of\nMinority Law Enforcement Officers, 219 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2000).\nExcept where their interests diverge, we refer to all defendants-\nappellees collectively as the \"City.\"\n\n                                       -3-\n\fpromotion only. Next, we affirm the district court's decision that\n\nthe City's action was constitutional, finding that the City has\n\ndemonstrated      the   compelling   state    interest     of   remedying   past\n\ndiscrimination. Finally, we reverse the district court's retention\n\nof jurisdiction.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\nA.    Facts\n\n              In December, 1997, the BPD sought to promote thirty\n\npolice officers to sergeant.             A score was computed for each\n\ncandidate who took a 1996 sergeant promotion examination given by\n\nthe Human Resources Division (\"HRD\").               The score was based on a\n\nstate examination, a Boston examination, education, and training.\n\nFollowing standard hiring procedure, the Department obtained a list\n\nranking the top sixty-nine performers.\n\n              If promotions had been made in strict rank order, twenty-\n\nnine non-African-American officers and one African-American officer\n\nwould have been promoted, all of whom had a score of eighty-five or\n\nhigher.       The Department determined that this promotional decision\n\nwould    violate    the   \"four-fifths      rule\"    in   the   EEOC's   Uniform\n\nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, indicating possible\n\nadverse impact on minority candidates.3             See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D)\n\n\n3\n     The four-fifths rule provides that\n\n       [a] selection rate for any race . . . which is less than\n       four-fifths (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group\n       with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the\n\n                                      -4-\n\f(2003).    Such adverse impact may signify that the testing or past\n\nhiring was discriminatory.          For this reason, and others that we\n\nwill   discuss    below,     the   BPD    sought      greater     African-American\n\nrepresentation among sergeants. Therefore, the Department promoted\n\nthe top twenty-six officers in strict rank order; this included all\n\nofficers scoring eighty-six and above, with the exception of one\n\nofficer who was bypassed for cause.                 Seven non-African-American\n\nofficers   had    scored     eighty-five;      two    of   them    were    promoted.\n\nFinally,    the   Department       promoted     the    three      African-American\n\nofficers who had scored 84 (the \"African-American Officers\"), while\n\nchoosing not to promote ten Caucasion officers who also scored\n\neighty-four.\n\n            Because     it   had   elected     to    promote    officers    scoring\n\neighty-four    before    officers     scoring       eighty-five,     the    BPD   was\n\nrequired by Massachusetts law to provide a statement to the HRD\n\nexplaining the reasons for its departure from strict rank order.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, § 27 (2002).               The BPD sent a letter to\n\n\n       Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse\n       impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will\n       generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies\n       as evidence of adverse impact.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D). Had the BPD promoted in strict rank order,\nthe selection rate for African-Americans would have been three\npercent (one African-American officer selected out of thirty-three\nwho passed the examination) and the selection rate for non-African-\nAmericans would have been fifteen percent (twenty-nine promoted out\nof 192 who passed the examination), for a selection ratio of twenty\npercent (three percent divided by fifteen percent). This result is\nwell below the eighty percent guideline established by the EEOC.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe HRD stating that the departure from strict rank order to\n\npromote     the   African-American       Officers      was    done     to   \"ensure\n\ncompliance with current EEOC guidelines, and applicable federal and\n\nstate discrimination laws.\"          The HRD rejected this explanation,\n\ncontending that the BPD was erroneously acting under a terminated\n\nconsent decree.4\n\n            In    response   to   the   HRD’s       rejection,   the    Department\n\npromoted six additional officers (one formerly bypassed for cause\n\nand five with a score of eighty-five).                Thus, the end result was\n\nthat all thirty-three officers scoring eighty-five and higher were\n\npromoted, the three African-American Officers scoring eighty-four\n\nwere    promoted,    and    ten   non-African-American         officers     scoring\n\neighty-four, including the seven Caucasian plaintiffs, were not\n\npromoted.     Of the thirty-six officers promoted to sergeant, four\n\nwere African-American and thirty-two were not African-American.\n\nB.     History of the Case\n\n             On May 21, 1999, plaintiffs filed suit against the City\n\nalleging that the Department violated plaintiffs’ civil rights\n\nunder 42 U.S.C § 1983 (2003) by failing to promote plaintiffs to\n\nsergeant because of their race.\n\n             After   full    discovery,       the    City    moved   for    summary\n\njudgment, alleging that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and that\n\n\n\n4\n   A consent decree governing sergeant promotions at the BPD was\nallowed to lapse in 1995.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe promotions of the African-American Officers were a narrowly-\n\ntailored     means    of    meeting     several     compelling   governmental\n\ninterests.        Specifically, the City claimed that the promotions\n\nfurthered compelling governmental interests by (a) remedying past\n\ndiscrimination in the Department’s promotions of minority officers\n\nto sergeant; (b) avoiding the reasonable likelihood of Title VII\n\nlitigation if the Department made strict rank order promotions; and\n\n(c) meeting the Department’s operational needs.\n\n             On    March   22,    2002,     the   district   court     dismissed\n\nplaintiffs’ claims and entered judgment in favor of the City.                 The\n\ndistrict court found that the City’s actions were a narrowly-\n\ntailored     means   of    remedying      the   continuing   effects    of   past\n\ndiscrimination and avoiding litigation.             See Cotter, 193 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 350.    The district court retained jurisdiction post-judgment\n\nto oversee all of the Department’s future hiring and promotional\n\ndecisions involving race.          Id. at 356-57.     This appeal and cross-\n\nappeal timely followed.\n\n                                 II.   Discussion\n\n             Summary judgment is appropriate upon a showing \"that\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"                Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c) (2003).            We review the district court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment de novo, in the light most favorable to the losing\n\nparty.     Houlton Citizen’s Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).             We may affirm the district court's\n\ndecision on      \"any       independent   ground     that   is   apparent       in   the\n\nrecord.\" United States v. Puerto Rico, 287 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\nA.   Standing\n\n            Article III of the Constitution confines the federal\n\ncourts to deciding actual cases or controversies. Allen v. Wright,\n\n468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984).             Inherent in this limitation is the\n\nnotion that \"federal courts may exercise power only as a last\n\nresort,   and    as     a    necessity,    and     only   when   adjudication         is\n\nconsistent with a system of separated powers and the dispute is one\n\ntraditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the\n\njudicial process.\"           Id. at 752 (internal quotations and citations\n\nomitted).     The most important Article III doctrine is that of\n\nstanding, which ensures that plaintiffs have alleged a personal\n\nstake in the outcome of the controversy.               Requiring a plaintiff to\n\nhave standing sharpens the presentation of issues and illuminates\n\ndifficult constitutional questions.               Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186,\n\n204 (1962).\n\n            At   an     irreducible       constitutional     minimum,       a    party\n\nattempting to invoke federal jurisdiction must establish that (1)\n\nhe has suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury was caused by the\n\nchallenged action of the defendant, and (3) a favorable ruling\n\nwould likely redress his injury.                Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). The standing inquiry requires careful\n\njudicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain\n\nwhether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of\n\nthe particular claims asserted.     Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. at 752.\n\nWe review the district court's standing decision de novo.       Donahue\n\nv. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 116 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           The plaintiffs sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking\n\ndamages,   immediate   promotion,   and   an   order   prohibiting   the\n\nDepartment from considering race in future promotions.         Since a\n\nplaintiff must establish standing for each type of relief sought,\n\nid. at 116, we consider appellants' standing to seek damages and\n\ninjunctive relief separately.5\n\n           The appellants first argue that they have standing to\n\nobtain damages.   Prior precedent bars this effort.        In Texas v.\n\nLesage, 528 U.S. 18 (1999), the Supreme Court held that \"where a\n\nplaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being\n\nbased on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the\n\ngovernment would have made the same decision regardless, there is\n\nno cognizable injury warranting relief under § 1983.\"        Id. at 21.\n\nIt is uncontested that had the Department not used race-conscious\n\ncriteria, it would have only promoted candidates with a score of\n\n\n\n\n5\n   The district court decision preceded our decision in Donahue,\nand the court found that plaintiffs had standing to pursue damages\nand injunctive relief. Cotter, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 337.\n\n                                  -9-\n\feighty-five or higher. Because appellants only scored eighty-four,\n\nthey cannot show standing for damages.\n\n           Lesage could be distinguished on the ground that the\n\nplaintiff in that case received a lower score than all of the\n\napplicants who were admitted to the university program at issue\n\nthere.   By contrast, the appellants here earned the same score as\n\nthe African-American Officers.    However, this court in Donahue v.\n\nCity of Boston, 304 F.3d at 114, read Lesage to encompass a\n\nsituation similar to this one.        In Donahue, the plaintiff police\n\ncandidate had received a higher score on the relevant exam than did\n\na minority officer who was hired.       We applied Lesage, noting that\n\nthe plaintiff had no chance of being hired regardless of the\n\nDepartment's   affirmative   action    program.   Id. at   119.   This\n\ninterpretation of Lesage controls here as law of the circuit.\n\nSeveral of our sister circuits have also found that plaintiffs lack\n\nstanding to sue for damages if they cannot show that they would\n\nhave benefitted had the government not considered race.      See Aiken\n\nv. Hackett, 281 F.3d 516 (6th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Ashton\n\nv. City of Memphis, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 5550 (Oct. 7, 2002); McNamara\n\nv. City of Chicago, 138 F.3d 1219, 1221 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n525 U.S. 981 (1998) (\"A plaintiff who would have been no better off\n\nhad the defendant refrained from the unlawful acts of which the\n\nplaintiff is complaining does not have standing under Article III\n\nof the Constitution to challenge those acts in a suit in federal\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcourt.\"); Grahek v. City of St. Paul, 84 F.3d 296, 298 (8th Cir.\n\n1996)    (finding   Caucasian     male     candidates    for     police    officer\n\npositions lacked standing because they could not show that they\n\nwould have been promoted, even if the police department had not\n\nmade use of a list of \"protected class applicants\").\n\n             Appellants next argue that they have standing to seek\n\nimmediate promotion. While one could imagine that this issue could\n\nsimilarly be resolved against the appellants under Donahue and\n\nLesage, neither of those cases addressed standing for this type of\n\nimmediate injunctive relief.         Instead, both of those cases focused\n\nonly    on   standing   to    seek   an    injunction       to   prevent    future\n\nviolations.     Thus, neither of those cases, nor any other binding\n\nprecedent, mandates a certain result here.\n\n             Two of the appellants have been promoted to sergeant\n\nsince this lawsuit was filed, and therefore lack standing to seek\n\nimmediate promotion.         We think that the remaining appellants have\n\nmade a colorable claim of standing to seek immediate promotion.\n\nThe Department has promoted African-American officers who obtained\n\nthe same score as the appellants and there is no indication that\n\nthe    Department   would     consider    demoting    the    promoted      African-\n\nAmerican Officers. If we assume arguendo that the Equal Protection\n\nClause prohibits racial discrimination on these facts and permits\n\nthe    injunctive   relief     sought     by   the   appellants,    then     it   is\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fsufficiently clear that the appellants would have suffered a\n\ncognizable injury for standing purposes.\n\n             There is a different form of injunctive relief not\n\nexplicitly mentioned in the plaintiffs' complaint but arguably\n\nembraced by their briefs, namely, that if unlawful discrimination\n\noccurred in this case, such discrimination should be barred in\n\nfuture promotion contests involving these plaintiffs.           A plaintiff\n\nchallenging an ongoing race-conscious program satisfies the injury\n\nrequirement if he shows (1) a likelihood that he will compete for\n\nthe governmental benefit in question in the future, and (2) that he\n\nwill be prevented from competing on equal footing because of the\n\ngovernment's discriminatory practice.         Donahue, 304 F.3d at 119;\n\naccord N.E. Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City\n\nof Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).         The difficulty here is\n\nthat   the   circumstances   are   so   peculiar   that   it   is   at   least\n\ndebatable whether a likelihood of recurrence is sufficient to\n\njustify standing on a future repetition theory.           See, e.g., Yeager\n\nv. Gen. Motors Corp., 265 F.3d 389, 395 (6th Cir. 2001) (finding\n\nplaintiff's possible future injury too speculative to grant him\n\nstanding).    Since on the merits we find that there was no unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, the question of whether there would be standing for\n\nthis form of relief need not be resolved here.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fB.   Affirmative Actions and Strict Scrutiny\n\n           There          is    rich   public    debate   about   the   issue   of\n\naffirmative action.             Some argue it is racial discrimination and is\n\ninconsistent with a color-blind constitution, while others believe\n\nthat it is necessary to put long-oppressed groups on equal footing\n\nwith the majority.              Our job is not to endorse one view over the\n\nother,   but    to    simply        evaluate    the   constitutionality    of   any\n\nracially-motivated governmental program.\n\n           The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nprovides, in part, that \"no State shall make or enforce any law\n\nwhich shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\n\nequal protection of the laws.\"             U.S. Const. amend. XIV.      The Clause\n\ndoes not mandate that every citizen be treated identically, rather,\n\nit   requires        an        adequate   explanation     for   treating   groups\n\ndifferently.     Race-based distinctions are inherently suspect and\n\nare therefore subject to the most searching examination. Wygant v.\n\nJackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 273 (1986).                         The BPD's\n\nracially-based promotional decision must withstand strict scrutiny\n\n-- the government must show that the classification is narrowly\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\ftailored to further a compelling governmental interest.6             Adarand\n\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995).\n\n            Whether each proffered reason satisfies strict scrutiny\n\nis a question of law or a question of how the law applies to the\n\nfacts; therefore, our review is plenary.          Wessmann v. Gittens, 160\n\nF.3d 790, 795 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            In order to be a \"compelling interest,\" the government\n\nmust show that the alleged objective was its actual purpose for the\n\ndiscriminatory classification and must have a \"strong basis in\n\nevidence to support that justification before it implements the\n\nclassification.\"       Shaw v. Hunt, 577 U.S. 899, 908 n.4 (1996).\n\nAppellants    argue     that   the    Department       only   presented   one\n\njustification for its decision to the HRD, and is therefore barred\n\nfrom asserting any other motivations.          We disagree.     Commissioner\n\nEvans testified that there were several reasons for his decision to\n\ndepart from strict rank order in awarding promotions, including\n\nremedying    past     discrimination,       avoiding    lawsuits,   and   the\n\noperational needs of the Department.            It is plausible that the\n\n\n\n6\n   The district court stated that \"the burden of persuasion rests\nupon the Plaintiffs to show that the promotion decisions were\nunconstitutional.\" Cotter, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 338 (citing Wygant,\n476 U.S. at 277-78 (O'Connor, J., concurring)). While it is true\nthat the ultimate burden of proof in a civil trial lies with the\nplaintiffs, the Supreme Court has made clear that the government\nhas a burden of production to justify a racial preference. See\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 224; cf. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S.\n515, 533 (1996) (placing the burden on the state to justify a\ngender classification).\n\n                                     -14-\n\fDepartment did not feel the need to identify the multiple factors\n\ninfluencing its decision.        If any of the justifications is a\n\ncompelling state interest, and the City's actions were narrowly\n\ntailored to that end, the City's actions are constitutional.7\n\nC.    Remedying Past Discrimination\n\n            The City asserts that the race-conscious action was\n\nnecessary to ameliorate \"vestiges\" of past discrimination by the\n\nDepartment against African-American applicants and officers.          The\n\nremedying of past discrimination is a compelling state interest, so\n\nlong as there is a \"strong basis in evidence for the conclusion\n\nthat the [government action] serves a remedial purpose with respect\n\nto past discrimination.\"      Stuart v. Roache, 951 F.2d 446, 450 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (citation omitted); Boston Police Superior Officers\n\nFederation v. City of Boston, 147 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(hereinafter \"Boston Superior Officers\").      There must be evidence\n\nof discrimination specific to the governmental agency seeking to\n\nuse racial preference; \"societal\" discrimination, on its own, will\n\nnot   support   affirmative   action.    Wygant,   476   U.S.   at   276.\n\n\"[W]hether past discrimination necessitates current action is a\n\n\n\n7\n   Appellants also argue that the government is prohibited from\nasserting alternative \"compelling interests\" because if one\ninterest fails it demonstrates that the action taken by the\ngovernment cannot be narrowly tailored, and the entire action\ntherefore fails. We disagree with this argument. A governmental\nactor may have several reasons for racially-motivated action; if\nany legitimate reason satisfies strict scrutiny, the action is\nconstitutional.\n\n                                  -15-\n\ffact-sensitive inquiry.\"      Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 802.       The \"strong\n\nbasis in evidence\" may consist of \"either a contemporaneous or\n\nantecedent finding of past discrimination by a court or other\n\ncompetent body, or evidence approaching a prima facie case of a\n\nconstitutional or statutory violation.\"         Boston Superior Officers,\n\n147 F.3d at 20 (citation omitted).\n\n           The   Department's   history    of   discrimination   is    well-\n\ndocumented by past litigation and records. We outlined the history\n\nof past discrimination at the Department a few years ago in Boston\n\nSuperior Officers, where we found:\n\n           In 1972, we affirmed a district court's\n           finding that the BPD discriminated against\n           black applicants through the use of entry-\n           level testing procedures that favored whites.\n           . . . [T]hat discrimination resulted in a\n           gross racial disparity among the BPD's ranks .\n           . . .\n           [Nineteen years later we found] . . . that\n           racial discrimination in entry-level hiring\n           had adversely affected blacks' representation\n           at the rank of sergeant.     \"Remedial action\n           takes time,\" we reasoned, \"and discrimination\n           may linger for many years in an organization\n           that had excluded blacks from its ranks.\"\n\nBoston Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 20 (quoting Stuart, 951 F.2d\n\nat 452).   In his deposition, Commissioner Evans also expressed the\n\nconcern that     remedying   past   discrimination    takes   time.8     The\n\n\n8\n    Commissioner Evans stated:\n\n      When I came on the Department there [were] very small\n      numbers of minority officers, and I think there [were]\n      none in my class of 66, and pretty much my class and\n      classes before me are running the organization right now,\n\n                                    -16-\n\fDepartment has been working for many years to address racial\n\ndisparity and bias within its ranks.         In 1965, only two percent of\n\npolice officers in the City were not Caucasian, and only one\n\nminority held a position of sergeant or above.         In 1978, only five-\n\nand-a-half percent of officers were African-American, and only\n\nthree officers held a position of sergeant or above.               While the\n\nnumbers are more representative today, we are not prepared to rule\n\nthat all effects of past discrimination have been eliminated.              See\n\nBoston Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 23 (\"Given the BPD's halting\n\nand, at time, quite modest progress in remedying its earlier\n\ndiscrimination, we are reluctant to infer that the vestiges of that\n\ndiscrimination had substantially disappeared when the BPD [made the\n\naffirmative action promotion at issue.]\").\n\n           At    the   time   of   the   promotions   at   issue   here,   the\n\ndisparity between the number of African-American officers eligible\n\nfor promotion and the number of non-African-American officers\n\neligible   for    promotion    was   statistically     significant.        One\n\nexplanation for this discrepancy is the fact that the rankings were\n\nbased, in part, on experience.            Because of the well-documented\n\nhistory of discrimination within the Department, fewer African-\n\n\n\n     . . . and I think it takes a while within any\n     organization, that there has to be role models and other\n     people in position so that other people will move up and\n     I think it takes a while for that type of historic\n     discrimination that was found in Castro v. Beecher to\n     work itself out. It doesn't happen overnight.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fAmericans are in position to be promoted to sergeant.                See United\n\nStates v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 168 (1987) (\"Discrimination at\n\nthe entry level necessarily precluded blacks from competing for\n\npromotions, and resulted in a departmental hierarchy dominated\n\nexclusively by nonminorities.\").\n\n              The Department was faced with facts that its efforts at\n\nremedying past discrimination had not been successful.                A public\n\nemployer has the requisite firm basis for believing that remedial\n\naction is necessary if there is a statistical disparity between the\n\nracial composition of the workforce and the relevant, qualified\n\nemployment      pool.      Wygant,    476    U.S.   at   292    (O'Connor,    J.,\n\nconcurring); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 803 (\"The greater the\n\ndisparity [between the number of qualified minority applicants with\n\nthose   who    gain     entrance],    the    stronger    the    inference    that\n\ndiscrimination is the cause of non-entry.\").\n\n              In October, 1996 (the latest date before the African-\n\nAmerican Officers were promoted for which data is available),\n\nAfrican-Americans comprised 25.02% of the BPD's 1,547 officers, but\n\nonly    16.49%    of    the   BPD's   sergeants.         This   difference     is\n\nstatistically significant, and not reasonably attributed to chance.\n\nThis disparity is not just a simple assurance of good intention\n\nfrom the City, but concrete evidence that discrimination existed at\n\nthe time the African-American Officers were promoted.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f           In addition, as noted above, had the Department promoted\n\nin strict rank order, the selection rate for African-Americans\n\nwould have been only three percent, while the selection rate for\n\nCaucasians would have been fifteen percent.                   This would have\n\nyielded a selection ratio of twenty percent, well below the eighty\n\npercent guideline established by the EEOC, and therefore suggested\n\nadverse impact on minorities.        While not \"conclusive evidence of\n\ndiscrimination,\" this discrepancy in selection rate does serve as\n\na \"'benchmark against which . . . to gauge [the City's] efforts to\n\nremedy past discrimination.'\"       Boston Superior Officers, 147 F.3d\n\nat 21 (quoting Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n v. EEOC,\n\n478 U.S. 421, 478 (1986) (plurality opinion)).                In this case, the\n\nselection ratio would have been only twenty percent, indicating\n\nthat the City had not yet remedied past discrimination.\n\n           Commissioner Evans, who made the decision to promote the\n\nAfrican-American Officers, was aware of racial tensions within the\n\nDepartment.     Officers    had   complained     to     him    about    disparate\n\ntreatment, including racially-based punishment and job assignment.\n\nOfficers had    also   complained    to    him   that    they    felt    racially\n\ntargeted following an incident where a noose was placed on an\n\nofficer’s motorcycle.\n\n           The City’s evidence of disparity in the promotion of\n\nofficers   to   sergeant,    current       racial     tensions     within     the\n\nDepartment, and the documented history of past discrimination\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fwithin the BPD created the strong basis in evidence required for\n\nthe    Department     to   conclude     that    race-conscious         action    was\n\nnecessary.      Past discrimination in the hiring of minorities has\n\nlimited the opportunity for minorities to move up through the\n\nranks, and recent statistics show that these effects remain.                      We\n\nhold that the City has therefore demonstrated that it acted in\n\nresponse to a compelling state interest -- that of remedying past\n\ndiscrimination.      See Majeske v. City of Chicago, 218 F.3d 816, 823\n\n(7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1079 (2001) (holding that\n\nstatistical     evidence    of   disparity     within    a    police    department\n\ncoupled with anecdotal evidence of discrimination sufficiently\n\nestablishes      a   compelling      state    interest       that   justifies    an\n\naffirmative action plan).         At this point in time, we find that the\n\nCity has presented sufficient evidence that past discrimination\n\nwithin the Department justified its race-conscious decision.\n\n              Next, we determine whether the action taken by the City\n\nin its effort to remedy past discrimination was narrowly tailored\n\nto rectify the specific harm in question.                Wessmann, 160 F.3d at\n\n807.     We   consider     several   factors    in   determining       whether   an\n\naffirmative action order was narrowly tailored, including\n\n              the extent to which (i) the beneficiaries of\n              the order are specially advantaged; (ii) the\n              legitimate   expectancies  of   others   are\n              frustrated or encumbered; (iii) the order\n              interferes with other valid state or local\n              policies; and (iv) the order contains (or\n              fails to contain) built-in mechanisms which\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f            will, if time and events warrant, shrink its\n            scope and limit its duration.\n\nBoston Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 23 (quoting Mackin v. Boston,\n\n969 F.2d 1273, 1278 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n            The City departed from strict rank order to promote three\n\nAfrican-American       officers      out    of    thirty-six    promotions.       The\n\nDepartment    would    have    had    to     promote   twenty    African-American\n\nofficers to create a situation whereby the percentage of African-\n\nAmerican officers and African-American sergeants was approximately\n\nequal. The necessity for relief was great, but the means chosen by\n\nthe Department were modest -- only three African-American officers\n\nwere promoted out of rank -- indicating narrow tailoring.                         See\n\nMcNamara, 138 F.3d at 1224 (\"The [narrow tailoring] test is . . .\n\nwhether the increase is a plausible lowerbound estimate of a\n\nshortfall in minority representation among [sergeants] that is due\n\nto the [Department's] intentional discrimination in the past.\").\n\n            Only     qualified    minorities        were   promoted;     they    were\n\ntherefore     not    \"specially,\"      or     unfairly     advantaged    by     their\n\npromotions.        See Boston Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 24.                 All\n\nofficers were competing for a limited number of spots.                   Because of\n\nthis competition, the City's promotion of the African-American\n\nOfficers did not disturb any legitimate, firmly rooted expectations\n\nof the appellants.       See id.; accord Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1278.               Had\n\nthe City     not    departed   from    strict       rank   order,   no   additional\n\n\n\n                                           -21-\n\fCaucasian officers would have been hired.9         See McNamara, 138 F.3d\n\nat 1222 (defining narrow tailoring as that which \"discriminates\n\nagainst Caucasians as little as possible consistent with effective\n\nremediation\").\n\n          No valid policies have been disturbed by hiring three\n\nqualified African-American sergeants.            While Massachusetts law\n\nrequires an explanation for promotions made outside of strict rank\n\norder, there is no prohibition on such out-of-rank decisions.            See\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, § 27.\n\n          Finally, there were no quotas or long-term guidelines\n\nestablished,   and   there   is   nothing   in    the   decision   requiring\n\naffirmative action in future decisions.          The decision is therefore\n\nlimited in scope and duration.            We therefore agree with the\n\ndistrict court that the City’s actions were a narrowly-tailored\n\nmeans of addressing demonstrated past discrimination.10\n\n\n9\n  Had the City not considered race in the promotions, only thirty\npromotions would have been made -- twenty-nine Caucasian officers\nand one African-American officer. As a result of the affirmative\naction plan, those same twenty-nine Caucasian officers were\npromoted.\n10\n   We need not reach the issues of whether avoiding litigation or\nmeeting the operational needs of the Department are compelling\nstate interests.    We are skeptical of the first justification,\nhowever: the City's claim that it promoted the African-American\nOfficers in order to avoid litigation rings hollow, as litigation\nnevertheless ensued. We are much more sympathetic to the argument\nthat communities place more trust in a diverse police force and\nthat the resulting trust reduces crime rates and improves policing.\nThis operational needs justification has been cited as a compelling\nstate interest by other Circuits. See Patrolmen's Benevolent Ass'n\nof N.Y., Inc. v. City of N.Y., 310 F.3d 43, 52 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"[A]\n\n                                   -22-\n\fD.   Retained Jurisdiction\n\n           At the conclusion of its analysis, the district court\n\nsought   to   eliminate   future    litigation   regarding   race-based\n\ndecisions by the City.       Analogizing to the cy pres doctrine of\n\ntrusts and estates, whereby parties may petition the court to\n\nmodify the purpose of a gift because the original purpose has\n\nbecome impractical or impossible, the court retained jurisdiction\n\nto review future race-conscious decisions by the City.        The court\n\nheld:\n\n           Accordingly,    this    Court    will    retain\n           jurisdiction post judgment, and directs the\n           City, whenever the Department seeks to use\n           racial   factors   in   hiring   or   promotion\n           decisions, to formulate its personnel decision\n           and then petition the Court for instructions\n           concerning whether such a racially motivated\n           decision passes constitutional muster. The\n           Department shall so petition this Court both\n           when it \"reaches down\" to hire or promote a\n           lower scoring individual on the basis of race,\n           and when it picks among candidates who are\n           tied on a civil service exam on the basis of\n           race. On its part, the Court will give notice\n           to all affected parties, including MAMLEO, and\n           promptly will hold a hearing, entertain\n           argument,   and   render   a   decision.

The issue of\n\nracial preference in hiring by the BPD was never a live, on-going\n\ncase or controversy in this litigation, and any future decision by\n\nthe district court regarding hiring would simply be an advisory\n\nopinion.      The district court therefore lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction to retain jurisdiction over hiring decisions of the\n\nDepartment.\n\n             We further conclude that the retention of jurisdiction\n\nover future promotional decisions was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\"Ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is, at its core, a creature of\n\nnecessity.      When a party has obtained a valid federal judgment,\n\nonly extraordinary circumstances, if any, can justify ancillary\n\njurisdiction over a subsequent\" action.          Peacock, 516 U.S. at 359.\n\nThere are simply no extraordinary circumstances in this case\n\nnecessitating the retention of jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f           First, the district court found in favor of the City, and\n\nupheld the racially-motivated promotional decision.            There was no\n\norder by the district court that required enforcement and there is\n\nno longer a live issue in this case.           Second, this case is not\n\nanalogous to the situations where the Supreme Court has found\n\ncontinued jurisdiction necessary.        Such measures were taken in\n\nschool desegregation cases, where retention of jurisdiction was\n\nnecessary because of the continued refusal of school districts to\n\nrectify their   unconstitutional   segregation,        and   prison   reform\n\ncases, where continued jurisdiction was necessary because states\n\nrefused to follow court orders.          See Regensburger v. City of\n\nBowling Green, 278 F.3d 588, 598 (6th Cir. 2002) (Batchelder, J.,\n\nconcurring) (finding that a case was not analogous to school\n\ndesegregation or prison reform cases, and that the district court\n\ntherefore abused its discretion in retaining jurisdiction); Sierra\n\nClub v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43, 66-67 (5th Cir. 1974) (finding no\n\nconstitutional basis to support continued exercise of federal\n\njudicial power where no analogy could be made to desegregation\n\ncases).   In the present case, the City has done nothing to           violate\n\nappellants'   constitutional   rights,   and    has    never   demonstrated\n\nunwillingness to comply with a court order.           Further, there is no\n\nevidence that the City will make future unjustified race-based\n\ndecisions simply because it has prevailed in this case.            The City\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fhas    not   behaved   in    such   a   way     that    would   require   ongoing\n\nsupervision of its decisions.\n\n              The district court was frustrated in being faced with a\n\nlawsuit      challenging    affirmative        action   after   what    the   court\n\nperceived as the City's promise, in a prior lawsuit, that it would\n\nno longer use affirmative action.              See Cotter, 193 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n355.    We believe that the district court misreads Boston Superior\n\nOfficers, which did not include a promise by the City to refrain\n\nfrom race-conscious decisionmaking.                  Rather, the fact that the\n\nDepartment promoted one sergeant, rather than establishing a quota\n\nor some other long-term program, demonstrated that the action was\n\nnarrowly tailored.          Boston Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 25.\n\nFurthermore, we explicitly left open the question of whether the\n\nDepartment could make future race-based decisions.                   We stated:\n\n              Our conclusion that the BPD was justified in\n              taking race-based remedial action is based\n              strictly on these unique circumstances, and\n              does not give the BPD a license to depart from\n              strict rank order in future promotions.\n              Whether any similar factors are left that\n              might warrant future remedial action is a\n              question that we need not now address . . . .\n\nId.    (emphasis   added).      So      long    as    the   City's    actions   are\n\nconstitutional (as the promotion of the African-American Officers\n\nwas in this case), the City is permitted to consider race in its\n\ndecisions.\n\n              We have no doubt that a lawsuit will be filed should\n\nappellants or anyone else believe that a future racially-motivated\n\n                                        -27-\n\fdecision of the Department violates their constitutional rights.\n\nSubject to the standing requirements discussed above, this will\n\ncreate an actual case or controversy for the federal courts to\n\nadjudicate.    Until that time, the court lacks the power and\n\nnecessity to decide constitutional issues regarding the City's\n\npromotional decisions.\n\n           In short, the district court lacked the subject matter\n\njurisdiction to retain jurisdiction over future hiring decisions,\n\nand lacked the necessity required to retain jurisdiction over\n\nfuture promotional decisions.         We therefore vacate the district\n\ncourt's retention of jurisdiction over future race-based decisions\n\nof the Department.    \"This solution relegates the federal judiciary\n\nto its proper limited position, allows the legislative branch full\n\nsway within constitutional boundaries, and prevents continuing\n\nfriction   between   the   federal    judiciary   and   a   state   entity.\"\n\nRegensburger, 278 F.3d at 598-99 (Batchelder, J., concurring).\n\n                            III.     Conclusion\n\n           \"The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the\n\nlingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups\n\nin this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not\n\ndisqualified from acting in response to it.\"        Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n\n237.   The City has sought to remedy its past discrimination within\n\nthe Department through the selective promotion of three African-\n\nAmerican officers. The City's action was constitutional. There is\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fno reason for the district court to retain sweeping jurisdiction\n\nover all hiring and promotional race-conscious decisions of the\n\nDepartment.\n\n          We therefore affirm the district court’s decision that\n\nthe City’s actions did not violate appellants’ constitutional\n\nrights and reverse the district court’s retention of jurisdiction.\n\n          Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                              -29-\n\f",

Appellants appeal the district court's decision, and the City cross-appeals on the issues of standing and retained jurisdiction. First, we find that appellants have standing to seek immediate promotion only. Next, we affirm the district court's decision that the City's action was constitutional, finding that the City has demonstrated the compelling state interest of remedying past discrimination. Finally, we reverse the district court's retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December, 1997, the BPD sought to promote thirty police officers to sergeant. A score was computed for each candidate who took a 1996 sergeant promotion examination given by the Human Resources Division (\"HRD\"). The score was based on a state examination, a Boston examination, education, and training. Following standard hiring procedure, the Department obtained a list ranking the top sixty-nine performers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If promotions had been made in strict rank order, twenty-nine non-African-American officers and one African-American officer would have been promoted, all of whom had a score of eighty-five or higher. The Department determined that this promotional decision would violate the \"four-fifths rule\" in the EEOC's Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, indicating possible adverse impact on minority candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.4(D) (2003). Such adverse impact may signify that the testing or past hiring was discriminatory. For this reason, and others that we will discuss below, the BPD sought greater African-American representation among sergeants. Therefore, the Department promoted the top twenty-six officers in strict rank order; this included all officers scoring eighty-six and above, with the exception of one officer who was bypassed for cause. Seven non-African-American officers had scored eighty-five; two of them were promoted. Finally, the Department promoted the three African-American officers who had scored 84 (the \"African-American Officers\"), while choosing not to promote ten Caucasian officers who also scored eighty-four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it had elected to promote officers scoring eighty-four before officers scoring eighty-five, the BPD was required by Massachusetts law to provide a statement to the HRD explaining the reasons for its departure from strict rank order. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 27 (2002). The BPD sent a letter to the HRD stating that the departure from strict rank order to promote the African-American Officers was done to \"ensure compliance with current EEOC guidelines, and applicable federal and state discrimination laws.\" The HRD rejected this explanation, contending that the BPD was erroneously acting under a terminated consent decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the HRD's rejection, the Department promoted six additional officers (one formerly bypassed for cause and five with a score of eighty-five). Thus, the end result was that all thirty-three officers scoring eighty-five and higher were promoted, the three African-American Officers scoring eighty-four were promoted, and ten non-African-American officers scoring eighty-four, including the seven Caucasian plaintiffs, were not promoted. Of the thirty-six officers promoted to sergeant, four were African-American and thirty-two were not African-American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. History of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1999, plaintiffs filed suit against the City alleging that the Department violated plaintiffs' civil rights under 42 U.S.C &#167; 1983 (2003) by failing to promote plaintiffs to sergeant because of their race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After full discovery, the City moved for summary judgment, alleging that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and that the promotions of the African-American Officers were a narrowly-tailored means of meeting several compelling governmental interests. Specifically, the City claimed that the promotions furthered compelling governmental interests by (a) remedying past discrimination in the Department's promotions of minority officers to sergeant; (b) avoiding the reasonable likelihood of Title VII litigation if the Department made strict rank order promotions; and (c) meeting the Department's operational needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2002, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims and entered judgment in favor of the City. The district court found that the City's actions were a narrowly-tailored means of remedying the continuing effects of past discrimination and avoiding litigation. <i>See Cotter,</i> 193 F.Supp.2d at 350. The district court retained jurisdiction post-judgment to oversee all of the Department's future hiring and promotional decisions involving race. <i>Id.</i> at 356-57. This appeal and cross-appeal timely followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate upon a showing \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (2003). We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, in the light most favorable to the losing party. <i>Houlton Citizen's Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999). We may affirm the district court's decision on \"any independent ground that is apparent in the record.\" <i>United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 287 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III of the Constitution confines the federal courts to deciding actual cases or controversies. <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). Inherent in this limitation is the notion that \"federal courts may exercise power only as a last resort, and as a necessity, and only when adjudication is consistent with a system of separated powers and the dispute is one traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The most important Article III doctrine is that of standing, which ensures that plaintiffs have alleged a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. Requiring a plaintiff to have standing sharpens the presentation of issues and illuminates difficult constitutional questions. <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an irreducible constitutional minimum, a party attempting to invoke federal jurisdiction must establish that (1) he has suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury was caused by the challenged action of the defendant, and (3) a favorable ruling would likely redress his injury. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted. <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315. We review the district court's standing decision de novo. <i>Donahue v. City of Boston,</i> 304 F.3d 110, 116 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs sue under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, seeking damages, immediate promotion, and an order prohibiting the Department from considering race in future promotions. Since a plaintiff must establish standing for each type of relief sought, <i>id.</i> at 116, we consider appellants' standing to seek damages and injunctive relief separately.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants first argue that they have standing to obtain damages. Prior precedent bars this effort. In <i>Texas v. Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. 18, 120 S.Ct. 467, 145 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999), the Supreme Court held that \"where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under &#167; 1983.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467. It is uncontested that had the Department not used race-conscious criteria, it would have only promoted candidates with a score of eighty-five or higher. Because appellants only scored eighty-four, they cannot show standing for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lesage</i> could be distinguished on the ground that the plaintiff in that case received a lower score than all of the applicants who were admitted to the university program at issue there. By contrast, the appellants here earned the same score as the African-American Officers. However, this court in <i>Donahue v. City of Boston,</i> 304 F.3d at 114, read <i>Lesage</i> to encompass a situation similar to this one. In <i>Donahue,</i> the plaintiff police candidate had received a higher score on the relevant exam than did a minority officer who was hired. We applied <i>Lesage,</i> noting that the plaintiff had no chance of being hired regardless of the Department's affirmative action program. <i>Id.</i> at 119. This interpretation of <i>Lesage</i> controls here as law of the circuit. Several of our sister circuits have also found that plaintiffs lack standing to sue for damages if they cannot show that they would have benefitted had the government not considered race. <i>See Aiken v. Hackett,</i> 281 F.3d 516 (6th Cir.), <i>cert. denied sub nom. Ashton v. City of Memphis,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 87, 154 L.Ed.2d 23 (2002); <i>McNamara v. City of Chicago,</i> 138 F.3d 1219, 1221 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 981, 119 S.Ct. 444, 142 L.Ed.2d 398 (1998) (\"A plaintiff who would have been no better off had the defendant refrained from the unlawful acts of which the plaintiff is complaining does not have standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge those acts in a suit in federal court.\"); <i>Grahek v. City of St. Paul,</i> 84 F.3d 296, 298 (8th Cir.1996) (finding Caucasian male candidates for police officer positions lacked standing because they could not show that they would have been promoted, even if the police department had not made use of a list of \"protected class applicants\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next argue that they have standing to seek immediate promotion. While one could imagine that this issue could similarly be resolved against the appellants under <i>Donahue</i> and <i>Lesage,</i> neither of those cases addressed standing for this type of immediate injunctive relief. Instead, both of those cases focused only on standing to seek an injunction to prevent future violations. Thus, neither of those cases, nor any other binding precedent, mandates a certain result here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of the appellants have been promoted to sergeant since this lawsuit was filed, and therefore lack standing to seek immediate promotion. We think that the remaining appellants have made a colorable claim of standing to seek immediate promotion. The Department has promoted African-American officers who obtained the same score as the appellants and there is no indication that the Department would consider demoting the promoted African-American Officers. If we assume <i>arguendo</i> that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits racial discrimination on these facts and permits the injunctive relief sought by the appellants, then it is sufficiently clear that the appellants would have suffered a cognizable injury for standing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a different form of injunctive relief not explicitly mentioned in the plaintiffs' complaint but arguably embraced by their briefs, namely, that if unlawful discrimination occurred in this case, such discrimination should be barred in future promotion contests involving these plaintiffs. A plaintiff challenging an ongoing race-conscious program satisfies the injury requirement if he shows (1) a likelihood that he will compete for the governmental benefit in question in the future, and (2) that he will be prevented from competing on equal footing because of the government's discriminatory practice. <i>Donahue,</i> 304 F.3d at 119; <i>accord N.E. Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville,</i> 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993). The difficulty here is that the circumstances are so peculiar that it is at least debatable whether a likelihood of recurrence is sufficient to justify standing on a future repetition theory. <i>See, e.g., Yeager v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 265 F.3d 389, 395 (6th Cir.2001) (finding plaintiff's possible future injury too speculative to grant him standing). Since on the merits we find that there was no unlawful discrimination, the question of whether there would be standing for this form of relief need not be resolved here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Affirmative Actions and Strict Scrutiny</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is rich public debate about the issue of affirmative action. Some argue it is racial discrimination and is inconsistent with a color-blind constitution, while others believe that it is necessary to put long-oppressed groups on equal footing with the majority. Our job is not to endorse one view over the other, but to simply evaluate the constitutionality of any racially-motivated governmental program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in part, that \"no State shall make or enforce any law which shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Clause does not mandate that every citizen be treated identically, rather, it requires an adequate explanation for treating groups differently. Race-based distinctions are inherently suspect and are therefore subject to the most searching examination. <i>Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ.,</i> 476 U.S. 267, 273, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986). The BPD's racially-based promotional decision must withstand strict scrutiny &#8212; the government must show that the classification is narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether each proffered reason satisfies strict scrutiny is a question of law or a question of how the law applies to the facts; therefore, our review is plenary. <i>Wessmann v. Gittens,</i> 160 F.3d 790, 795 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to be a \"compelling interest,\" the government must show that the alleged objective was its actual purpose for the discriminatory classification and must have a \"strong basis in evidence to support that justification before it implements the classification.\" <i>Shaw v. Hunt,</i> 517 U.S. 899, 908 n. 4, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996). Appellants argue that the Department only presented one justification for its decision to the HRD, and is therefore barred from asserting any other motivations. We disagree. Commissioner Evans testified that there were several reasons for his decision to depart from strict rank order in awarding promotions, including remedying past discrimination, avoiding lawsuits, and the operational needs of the Department. It is plausible that the Department did not feel the need to identify the multiple factors influencing its decision. If any of the justifications is a compelling state interest, and the City's actions were narrowly tailored to that end, the City's actions are constitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Remedying Past Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City asserts that the race-conscious action was necessary to ameliorate \"vestiges\" of past discrimination by the Department against African-American applicants and officers. The remedying of past discrimination is a compelling state interest, so long as there is a \"strong basis in evidence for the conclusion that the [government action] serves a remedial purpose with respect to past discrimination.\" <i>Stuart v. Roache,</i> 951 F.2d 446, 450 (1st Cir.1991) (citation omitted); <i>Boston Police Superior Officers Federation v. City of Boston,</i> 147 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.1998) (hereinafter \"<i>Boston Superior Officers</i>\"). There must be evidence of discrimination specific to the governmental agency seeking to use racial preference; \"societal\" discrimination, on its own, will not support affirmative action. <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U.S. at 276, 106 S.Ct. 1842. \"[W]hether past discrimination necessitates current action is a fact-sensitive inquiry.\" <i>Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 802. The \"strong basis in evidence\" may consist of \"either a contemporaneous or antecedent finding of past discrimination by a court or other competent body, or evidence approaching a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation.\" <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 20 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department's history of discrimination is well-documented by past litigation and records. We outlined the history of past discrimination at the Department a few years ago in <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> where we found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1972, we affirmed a district court's finding that the BPD discriminated against black applicants through the use of entry-level testing procedures that favored whites....

In his deposition, Commissioner Evans also expressed the concern that remedying past discrimination takes time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The Department has been working for many years to address racial disparity and bias within its ranks. In 1965, only two percent of police officers in the City were not Caucasian, and only one minority held a position of sergeant or above. In 1978, only five-and-a-half percent of officers were African-American, and only three officers held a position of sergeant or above. While the numbers are more representative today, we are not prepared to rule that all effects of past discrimination have been eliminated. <i>See Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 23 (\"Given the BPD's halting and, at time, quite modest progress in remedying its earlier discrimination, we are reluctant to infer that the vestiges of that discrimination had substantially disappeared when the BPD [made the affirmative action promotion at issue.]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the promotions at issue here, the disparity between the number of African-American officers eligible for promotion and the number of non-African-American officers eligible for promotion was statistically significant. One explanation for this discrepancy is the fact that the rankings were based, in part, on experience. Because of the well-documented history of discrimination within the Department, fewer African-Americans are in position to be promoted to sergeant. <i>See United States v. Paradise,</i> 480 U.S. 149, 168, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987) (\"Discrimination at the entry level necessarily precluded blacks from competing for promotions, and resulted in a departmental hierarchy dominated exclusively by nonminorities.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department was faced with facts that its efforts at remedying past discrimination had not been successful. A public employer has the requisite firm basis for believing that remedial action is necessary if there is a statistical disparity between the racial composition of the workforce and the relevant, qualified employment pool. <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U.S. at 292, 106 S.Ct. 1842 (O'Connor, J., concurring); <i>see also Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 803 (\"The greater the disparity [between the number of qualified minority applicants with those who gain entrance], the stronger the inference that discrimination is the cause of non-entry.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, 1996 (the latest date before the African-American Officers were promoted for which data is available), African-Americans comprised 25.02% of the BPD's 1,547 officers, but only 16.49% of the BPD's sergeants. This difference is statistically significant, and not reasonably attributed to chance. This disparity is not just a simple assurance of good intention from the City, but concrete evidence that discrimination existed at the time the African-American Officers were promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as noted above, had the Department promoted in strict rank order, the selection rate for African-Americans would have been only three percent, while the selection rate for Caucasians would have been fifteen percent. This would have yielded a selection ratio of twenty percent, well below the eighty percent guideline established by the EEOC, and therefore suggested adverse impact on minorities. While not \"conclusive evidence of discrimination,\" this discrepancy in selection rate does serve as a \"`benchmark against which ... to gauge [the City's] efforts to remedy past discrimination.'\" <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 21 (quoting <i>Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n v. EEOC,</i> 478 U.S. 421, 478, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) (plurality opinion)). In this case, the selection ratio would have been only twenty percent, indicating that the City had not yet remedied past discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commissioner Evans, who made the decision to promote the African-American Officers, was aware of racial tensions within the Department. Officers had complained to him about disparate treatment, including racially-based punishment and job assignment. Officers had also complained to him that they felt racially targeted following an incident where a noose was placed on an officer's motorcycle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City's evidence of disparity in the promotion of officers to sergeant, current racial tensions within the Department, and the documented history of past discrimination within the BPD created the strong basis in evidence required for the Department to conclude that race-conscious action was necessary. Past discrimination in the hiring of minorities has limited the opportunity for minorities to move up through the ranks, and recent statistics show that these effects remain. We hold that the City has therefore demonstrated that it acted in response to a compelling state interest &#8212; that of remedying past discrimination. <i>See Majeske v. City of Chicago,</i> 218 F.3d 816, 823 (7th Cir.2000), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 1079, 121 S.Ct. 779, 148 L.Ed.2d 676 (2001) (holding that statistical evidence of disparity within a police department coupled with anecdotal evidence of discrimination sufficiently establishes a compelling state interest that justifies an affirmative action plan). At this point in time, we find that the City has presented sufficient evidence that past discrimination within the Department justified its race-conscious decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we determine whether the action taken by the City in its effort to remedy past discrimination was narrowly tailored to rectify the specific harm in question. <i>Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 807. We consider several factors in determining whether an affirmative action order was narrowly tailored, including</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the extent to which (i) the beneficiaries of the order are specially advantaged; (ii) the legitimate expectancies of others are frustrated or encumbered; (iii) the order interferes with other valid state or local policies; and (iv) the order contains (or fails to contain) built-in mechanisms which will, if time and events warrant, shrink its scope and limit its duration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 23 (quoting <i>Mackin v. Boston,</i> 969 F.2d 1273, 1278 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City departed from strict rank order to promote three African-American officers out of thirty-six promotions. The Department would have had to promote twenty African-American officers to create a situation whereby the percentage of African-American officers and African-American sergeants was approximately equal. The necessity for relief was great, but the means chosen by the Department were modest &#8212; only three African-American officers were promoted out of rank &#8212; indicating narrow tailoring. <i>See McNamara,</i> 138 F.3d at 1224 (\"The [narrow tailoring] test is ... whether the increase is a plausible lowerbound estimate of a shortfall in minority representation among [sergeants] that is due to the [Department's] intentional discrimination in the past.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only qualified minorities were promoted; they were therefore not \"specially,\" or unfairly advantaged by their promotions. <i>See Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 24. All officers were competing for a limited number of spots. Because of this competition, the City's promotion of the African-American Officers did not disturb any legitimate, firmly rooted expectations of the appellants. <i>See id.; accord Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1278. Had the City not departed from strict rank order, no additional Caucasian officers would have been hired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See McNamara,</i> 138 F.3d at 1222 (defining narrow tailoring as that which \"discriminates against Caucasians as little as possible consistent with effective remediation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No valid policies have been disturbed by hiring three qualified African-American sergeants. While Massachusetts law requires an explanation for promotions made outside of strict rank order, there is no prohibition on such out-of-rank decisions. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there were no quotas or long-term guidelines established, and there is nothing in the decision requiring affirmative action in future decisions. The decision is therefore limited in scope and duration. We therefore agree with the district court that the City's actions were a narrowly-tailored means of addressing demonstrated past discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Retained Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of its analysis, the district court sought to eliminate future litigation regarding race-based decisions by the City. Analogizing to the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine of trusts and estates, whereby parties may petition the court to modify the purpose of a gift because the original purpose has become impractical or impossible, the court retained jurisdiction to review future race-conscious decisions by the City. The court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, this Court will retain jurisdiction post judgment, and directs the City, whenever the Department seeks to use racial factors in hiring or promotion decisions, to formulate its personnel decision and then petition the Court for instructions concerning whether such a racially motivated decision passes constitutional muster. The Department shall so petition this Court both when it \"reaches down\" to hire or promote a lower scoring individual on the basis of race, and when it picks among candidates who are tied on a civil service exam on the basis of race. On its part, the Court will give notice to all affected parties, including MAMLEO, and promptly will hold a hearing, entertain argument, and render a decision. Done properly, such a procedure ought further predictability, hold down the burgeoning legal costs of this sort of litigation, and, most important, further the general societal acceptance of the required nuanced balancing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Cotter,</i> 193 F.Supp.2d at 356-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the district court has the authority to retain jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo. <i>See David C. v. Leavitt,</i> 242 F.3d 1206, 1209-10 (10th Cir.2001). If the court has such discretion, we review its decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>See id.</i> at 1210.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction to enforce its judgments. <i>Peacock v. Thomas,</i> 516 U.S. 349, 354, 116 S.Ct. 862, 133 L.Ed.2d 817 (1996); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 (\"in any civil action over which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action ... that they form part of the same case and controversy.\"). While a federal court has the power to retain jurisdiction to enforce its decision, the Supreme Court has cautioned against the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction \"over proceedings that are entirely new and original.\" <i>Peacock,</i> 516 U.S. at 358, 116 S.Ct. 862 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the district court's attempt to retain jurisdiction over future hiring decisions, neither party addressed hiring at any point in the litigation. The hiring policies of the BPD were not before the court, and it therefore lacks authority to retain jurisdiction over those absent claims. <i>Cf. Rodr&#237;guez v. Doral Mort. Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1174 (1st Cir.1995) (\"A federal district court may not, of its own volition, after the parties have rested, recast the complaint and, without notice, predicate its decision on a theory that was neither pleaded nor tried.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the standing requirement discussed in Part IIA, <i>supra,</i> Article III's cases and controversies language prohibits federal courts from issuing advisory opinions. <i>Preiser v. Newkirk,</i> 422 U.S. 395, 401, 95 S.Ct. 2330, 45 L.Ed.2d 272 (1975). A court may not \"decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case\" before it. <i>Id.</i> (quotation and citation omitted). The issue of racial preference in hiring by the BPD was never a live, on-going case or controversy in this litigation, and any future decision by the district court regarding hiring would simply be an advisory opinion. The district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction to retain jurisdiction over hiring decisions of the Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further conclude that the retention of jurisdiction over future promotional decisions was an abuse of discretion. \"Ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is, at its core, a creature of necessity. When a party has obtained a valid federal judgment, only extraordinary circumstances, if any, can justify ancillary jurisdiction over a subsequent\" action. <i>Peacock,</i> 516 U.S. at 359, 116 S.Ct. 862. There are simply no extraordinary circumstances in this case necessitating the retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court found <i>in favor</i> of the City, and upheld the racially-motivated promotional decision. There was no order by the district court that required enforcement and there is no longer a live issue in this case. Second, this case is not analogous to the situations where the Supreme Court has found continued jurisdiction necessary. Such measures were taken in school desegregation cases, where retention of jurisdiction was necessary because of the continued refusal of school districts to rectify their unconstitutional segregation, and prison reform cases, where continued jurisdiction was necessary because states refused to follow court orders. <i>See Regensburger v. City of Bowling Green,</i> 278 F.3d 588, 598 (6th Cir.2002) (Batchelder, J., concurring) (finding that a case was not analogous to school desegregation or prison reform cases, and that the district court therefore abused its discretion in retaining jurisdiction); <i>Sierra Club v. Lynn,</i> 502 F.2d 43, 66-67 (5th Cir.1974) (finding no constitutional basis to support continued exercise of federal judicial power where no analogy could be made to desegregation cases). In the present case, the City has done nothing to violate appellants' constitutional rights, and has never demonstrated unwillingness to comply with a court order. Further, there is no evidence that the City will make future unjustified race-based decisions simply because it has prevailed in this case. The City has not behaved in such a way that would require ongoing supervision of its decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was frustrated in being faced with a lawsuit challenging affirmative action after what the court perceived as the City's promise, in a prior lawsuit, that it would no longer use affirmative action. <i>See Cotter,</i> 193 F.Supp.2d at 355. We believe that the district court misreads <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> which did not include a promise by the City to refrain from race-conscious decisionmaking. Rather, the fact that the Department promoted one sergeant, rather than establishing a quota or some other long-term program, demonstrated that the action was narrowly tailored. <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 25. Furthermore, we explicitly left open the question of whether the Department could make future race-based decisions. We stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the BPD was justified in taking race-based remedial action is based strictly on these unique circumstances, and does not give the BPD a license to depart from strict rank order in future promotions. <i>Whether any similar factors are left that might warrant future remedial action is a question that we need not now address</i> ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). So long as the City's actions are constitutional (as the promotion of the African-American Officers was in this case), the City is permitted to consider race in its decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that a lawsuit will be filed should appellants or anyone else believe that a future racially-motivated decision of the Department violates their constitutional rights. Subject to the standing requirements discussed above, this will create an actual case or controversy for the federal courts to adjudicate. Until that time, the court lacks the power and necessity to decide constitutional issues regarding the City's promotional decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to retain jurisdiction over future hiring decisions, and lacked the necessity required to retain jurisdiction over future promotional decisions. We therefore vacate the district court's retention of jurisdiction over future race-based decisions of the Department. \"This solution relegates the federal judiciary to its proper limited position, allows the legislative branch full sway within constitutional boundaries, and prevents continuing friction between the federal judiciary and a state entity.\" <i>Regensburger,</i> 278 F.3d at 598-99 (Batchelder, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Finally, we reverse the district court's retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December, 1997, the BPD sought to promote thirty police officers to sergeant. A score was computed for each candidate who took a 1996 sergeant promotion examination given by the Human Resources Division (\"HRD\"). The score was based on a state examination, a Boston examination, education, and training. Following standard hiring procedure, the Department obtained a list ranking the top sixty-nine performers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If promotions had been made in strict rank order, twenty-nine non-African-American officers and one African-American officer would have been promoted, all of whom had a score of eighty-five or higher. The Department determined that this promotional decision would violate the \"four-fifths rule\" in the EEOC's Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, indicating possible adverse impact on minority candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.4(D) (2003). Such adverse impact may signify that the testing or past hiring was discriminatory. For this reason, and others that we will discuss below, the BPD sought greater African-American representation among sergeants. Therefore, the Department promoted the top twenty-six officers in strict rank order; this included all officers scoring eighty-six and above, with the exception of one officer who was bypassed for cause. Seven non-African-American officers had scored eighty-five; two of them were promoted. Finally, the Department promoted the three African-American officers who had scored 84 (the \"African-American Officers\"), while choosing not to promote ten Caucasian officers who also scored eighty-four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it had elected to promote officers scoring eighty-four before officers scoring eighty-five, the BPD was required by Massachusetts law to provide a statement to the HRD explaining the reasons for its departure from strict rank order. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 27 (2002). The BPD sent a letter to the HRD stating that the departure from strict rank order to promote the African-American Officers was done to \"ensure compliance with current EEOC guidelines, and applicable federal and state discrimination laws.\" The HRD rejected this explanation, contending that the BPD was erroneously acting under a terminated consent decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the HRD's rejection, the Department promoted six additional officers (one formerly bypassed for cause and five with a score of eighty-five). Thus, the end result was that all thirty-three officers scoring eighty-five and higher were promoted, the three African-American Officers scoring eighty-four were promoted, and ten non-African-American officers scoring eighty-four, including the seven Caucasian plaintiffs, were not promoted. Of the thirty-six officers promoted to sergeant, four were African-American and thirty-two were not African-American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. History of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1999, plaintiffs filed suit against the City alleging that the Department violated plaintiffs' civil rights under 42 U.S.C &#167; 1983 (2003) by failing to promote plaintiffs to sergeant because of their race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After full discovery, the City moved for summary judgment, alleging that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and that the promotions of the African-American Officers were a narrowly-tailored means of meeting several compelling governmental interests. Specifically, the City claimed that the promotions furthered compelling governmental interests by (a) remedying past discrimination in the Department's promotions of minority officers to sergeant; (b) avoiding the reasonable likelihood of Title VII litigation if the Department made strict rank order promotions; and (c) meeting the Department's operational needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2002, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims and entered judgment in favor of the City. The district court found that the City's actions were a narrowly-tailored means of remedying the continuing effects of past discrimination and avoiding litigation. <i>See Cotter,</i> 193 F.Supp.2d at 350. The district court retained jurisdiction post-judgment to oversee all of the Department's future hiring and promotional decisions involving race. <i>Id.</i> at 356-57.

It is uncontested that had the Department not used race-conscious criteria, it would have only promoted candidates with a score of eighty-five or higher.

By contrast, the appellants here earned the same score as the African-American Officers. However, this court in <i>Donahue v. City of Boston,</i> 304 F.3d at 114, read <i>Lesage</i> to encompass a situation similar to this one. In <i>Donahue,</i> the plaintiff police candidate had received a higher score on the relevant exam than did a minority officer who was hired. We applied <i>Lesage,</i> noting that the plaintiff had no chance of being hired regardless of the Department's affirmative action program. <i>Id.</i> at 119. This interpretation of <i>Lesage</i> controls here as law of the circuit.

While one could imagine that this issue could similarly be resolved against the appellants under <i>Donahue</i> and <i>Lesage,</i> neither of those cases addressed standing for this type of immediate injunctive relief. Instead, both of those cases focused only on standing to seek an injunction to prevent future violations. Thus, neither of those cases, nor any other binding precedent, mandates a certain result here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of the appellants have been promoted to sergeant since this lawsuit was filed, and therefore lack standing to seek immediate promotion. We think that the remaining appellants have made a colorable claim of standing to seek immediate promotion. The Department has promoted African-American officers who obtained the same score as the appellants and there is no indication that the Department would consider demoting the promoted African-American Officers. If we assume <i>arguendo</i> that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits racial discrimination on these facts and permits the injunctive relief sought by the appellants, then it is sufficiently clear that the appellants would have suffered a cognizable injury for standing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a different form of injunctive relief not explicitly mentioned in the plaintiffs' complaint but arguably embraced by their briefs, namely, that if unlawful discrimination occurred in this case, such discrimination should be barred in future promotion contests involving these plaintiffs. A plaintiff challenging an ongoing race-conscious program satisfies the injury requirement if he shows (1) a likelihood that he will compete for the governmental benefit in question in the future, and (2) that he will be prevented from competing on equal footing because of the government's discriminatory practice. <i>Donahue,</i> 304 F.3d at 119; <i>accord N.E.

Some argue it is racial discrimination and is inconsistent with a color-blind constitution, while others believe that it is necessary to put long-oppressed groups on equal footing with the majority.

In 1978, only five-and-a-half percent of officers were African-American, and only three officers held a position of sergeant or above. While the numbers are more representative today, we are not prepared to rule that all effects of past discrimination have been eliminated. <i>See Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 23 (\"Given the BPD's halting and, at time, quite modest progress in remedying its earlier discrimination, we are reluctant to infer that the vestiges of that discrimination had substantially disappeared when the BPD [made the affirmative action promotion at issue.]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the promotions at issue here, the disparity between the number of African-American officers eligible for promotion and the number of non-African-American officers eligible for promotion was statistically significant.

The issue of racial preference in hiring by the BPD was never a live, on-going case or controversy in this litigation, and any future decision by the district court regarding hiring would simply be an advisory opinion. The district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction to retain jurisdiction over hiring decisions of the Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further conclude that the retention of jurisdiction over future promotional decisions was an abuse of discretion. \"Ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is, at its core, a creature of necessity. When a party has obtained a valid federal judgment, only extraordinary circumstances, if any, can justify ancillary jurisdiction over a subsequent\" action. <i>Peacock,</i> 516 U.S. at 359, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117998\"><a href=\"/opinion/117998/peacock-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There are simply no extraordinary circumstances in this case necessitating the retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court found <i>in favor</i> of the City, and upheld the racially-motivated promotional decision. There was no order by the district court that required enforcement and there is no longer a live issue in this case. Second, this case is not analogous to the situations where the Supreme Court has found continued jurisdiction necessary. Such measures were taken in school desegregation cases, where retention of jurisdiction was necessary because of the continued refusal of school districts to rectify their unconstitutional segregation, and prison reform cases, where continued jurisdiction was necessary because states refused to follow court orders. <i>See Regensburger v. City of Bowling Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776322\"><a href=\"/opinion/776322/joseph-j-regensburger-jeremy-neff-v-city-of-bowling-green-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 598 (6th Cir.2002) (Batchelder, J., concurring) (finding that a case was not analogous to school desegregation or prison reform cases, and that the district court therefore abused its discretion in retaining jurisdiction); <i>Sierra Club v. Lynn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321197\"><a href=\"/opinion/321197/sierra-club-plaintiffs-appellants-cross-edwards-underground-water/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 66-67 (5th Cir.1974) (finding no constitutional basis to support continued exercise of federal judicial power where no analogy could be made to desegregation cases). In the present case, the City has done nothing to violate appellants' constitutional rights, and has never demonstrated unwillingness to comply with a court order. Further, there is no evidence that the City will make future unjustified race-based decisions simply because it has prevailed in this case. The City has not behaved in such a way that would require ongoing supervision of its decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was frustrated in being faced with a lawsuit challenging affirmative action after what the court perceived as the City's promise, in a prior lawsuit, that it would no longer use affirmative action. <i>See Cotter,</i> 193 F.Supp.2d at 355. We believe that the district court misreads <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> which did not include a promise by the City to refrain from race-conscious decisionmaking. Rather, the fact that the Department promoted one sergeant, rather than establishing a quota or some other long-term program, demonstrated that the action was narrowly tailored. <i>Boston Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 25. Furthermore, we explicitly left open the question of whether the Department could make future race-based decisions. We stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the BPD was justified in taking race-based remedial action is based strictly on these unique circumstances, and does not give the BPD a license to depart from strict rank order in future promotions. <i>Whether any similar factors are left that might warrant future remedial action is a question that we need not now address</i> ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). So long as the City's actions are constitutional (as the promotion of the African-American Officers was in this case), the City is permitted to consider race in its decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that a lawsuit will be filed should appellants or anyone else believe that a future racially-motivated decision of the Department violates their constitutional rights. Subject to the standing requirements discussed above, this will create an actual case or controversy for the federal courts to adjudicate. Until that time, the court lacks the power and necessity to decide constitutional issues regarding the City's promotional decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to retain jurisdiction over future hiring decisions, and lacked the necessity required to retain jurisdiction over future promotional decisions. We therefore vacate the district court's retention of jurisdiction over future race-based decisions of the Department. \"This solution relegates the federal judiciary to its proper limited position, allows the legislative branch full sway within constitutional boundaries, and prevents continuing friction between the federal judiciary and a state entity.\" <i>Regensburger,</i> 278 F.3d at 598-99 (Batchelder, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 237, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
