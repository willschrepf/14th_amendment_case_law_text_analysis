The plaintiffs brought suit against the state officials under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their Fourteenth Amendment right to be safe\n\n\n       *\n           Honorable Richard Mills, United States District Judge for the Central District of\nIllinois, sitting by designation.\n       1\n          The defendant-officials are as follows: Edward Feaver, Secretary of the Department of\nChildren and Family Services; Johnny Brown, District 10 Administrator; Katherine Kaufman, a\nProgram Operations Administrator of Protective Investigations and later Acting Child Welfare\nDirector; Corinne Millikan, Family Services Specialist and Operations Management Consultant;\nSharon Woodroof, Family Services Specialist and later Program Operations Administrator for\nRe-licensing and Foster Care; Susan Kanaskie, Protective Investigations Supervisor; Susan\nWorsley, Protective Investigator and later Foster Care Supervisor; Jennifer Chang, Program\nOperations Administrator for Licensing and Placement and later Family Services Specialist;\nMargaret Andrews, Licensing Counselor and later Licensing Supervisor; and Loubert\nDesmangles, Sharon Pollack, and Susan Wilburn, Family Services Counselors.\n       The complaint also named Winsome Smith, a Family Services Counselor, as a defendant.\nBecause the only claim against Smith was brought by R.K., who has since settled, plaintiffs’\nappeal with respect to Smith is moot.\n\n                                                 2\n\ffrom an unreasonable risk of physical harm while in state custody. After careful\n\nreview of the allegations against each defendant, we affirm in part, and reverse in\n\npart.\n\n        As to defendants Feaver, Brown, Kanaskie, and Pollack, we find no error,\n\nand affirm the dismissal of A.P., N.M. and R.M.’s claims against them.\n\n        As to defendants Chang, Woodroof, Millikan, Worsley, Andrews, Kaufman,\n\nDesmangles, and Wilburn, we find that the district court erred in dismissing A.P.,\n\nN.M. and R.M.’s claims against them and reverse the dismissal of these claims in\n\nthe Second Amended Complaint.\n\n        Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part;\n\nREVERSED in part; and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part:\n\n       Judges Barkett and Mills and I sharply disagree as to whether the factual\n\nallegations of plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to state constitutional violations\n\nagainst the defendants in their provision of foster care and as to whether they are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.1 For the reasons advanced in this opinion, I concur\n\nin the part of the court’s judgment affirming the district court’s dismissal of the\n\nclaims against Feaver, Brown, Kanaskie, and Pollack, and I dissent from the part of\n\nthe court’s judgment reversing the district court’s dismissal of the remaining\n\ndefendants. I write separately to provide the factual context in which plaintiffs’\n\nclaims are presented and the legal rationale for my view that plaintiffs’ factual\n\nallegations failed to establish that defendants possessed the requisite subjective\n\n\n\n       1\n          I also disagree with Judges Barkett and Mills as to whether the court’s per curiam\nopinion and my separate opinion should be published. This court’s Local Rules and Internal\nOperating Procedures express the court’s policy regarding the publication of opinions. 11th\nCircuit Rule 36-2 states that “[a]n opinion shall be unpublished unless a majority of the panel\ndecides to publish it.” The court’s Internal Operating Procedures (I.O.P.) are to the same effect.\nThe I.O.P. appended to Rule 36-2, states: “A majority of the panel determine whether an opinion\nshould be published.” The I.O.P further states that “[o]pinions that the panel believes to have no\nprecedential value are not published.” My colleagues are of the view that the opinions in this\ncase have no precedential value; as unpublished, they should not be “considered binding\nprecedent.” 11th Cir. R. 36-2. My view is that these opinions have precedential value because of\nthe questions the case presents. Suits against foster care workers are commonplace. Those\nadministering foster care – whether, as here, the case workers who visit the children, their\nsupervisors, or those occupying high-level administrative positions – need to know, they are\nentitled to know, where they stand, whether they are subject to suit simply for doing their job.\nUnpublished decisions, although “persuasive authority,” id., do not give these workers much\ncomfort. In parts IV. A. and B.1 supra, I cite five unpublished decisions, which, had they been\npublished, would have dictated the outcome of this case.\n\n                                                4\n\fknowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to plaintiffs that the Constitution\n\nrequires as a basis for personal liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. I would therefore\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment as to all defendants.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       This appeal concerns the second phase of a controversy over the quality of\n\nfoster care provided by the State of Florida’s Department of Children and Family\n\nServices (the “Department” or “DCF”) to dependent children in District 10,\n\nBroward County, in the late 1990s.2 The first phase involved a class action suit for\n\ninjunctive relief brought on behalf of the foster children in District 10; the district\n\ncourt granted prospective relief in the form of a consent decree. In the second\n\nphase, four members of the plaintiff class who had allegedly suffered child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse while living in a foster home sought damages from thirteen\n\nDepartment officials in their individual capacities for violations of the Fourteenth\n\n\n2\n  In Florida, the Department of Children and Family Services is responsible for children who\nhave become dependents of the State. The Department may take into custody a child who has no\nlegal custodian or any child it has probable cause to believe has been “abused, neglected, or\nabandoned, or is suffering from or is in imminent danger of illness or injury as a result of abuse,\nneglect, or abandonment.” Fla. Stat. § 39.401(1)(b) (1997). Once a child has been taken into\ncustody, DCF may seek to have the child declared a dependent. Fla. Stat. § 39.402 (setting forth\nstandards for placement of children in shelter care); Fla. Stat. § 39.501 (describing the\nrequirements of a petition for dependency). The dependency decision, however, ultimately lies\nwith the state circuit courts. Fla. Stat. § 39.013(2) (granting jurisdiction over juvenile matters to\nthe circuit court); Fla. Stat. § 39.507 (setting forth the requirements for an adjudicatory hearing\non dependency). Once declared a dependent, the child may be placed in foster care. See Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.014(1) (1997) (setting forth the requirements for foster care\nplacement).\n\n                                                  5\n\fAmendment. The district court denied relief, dismissing the claims under Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). This appeal challenges this ruling.\n\n                                                    A.\n\n         On October 20, 1998, a class action suit for injunctive relief was filed under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 3 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\n\nFlorida on behalf of the over 1,000 dependent children in District 10 against the\n\nSecretary of the Department and the Administrator of District 10 in their official\n\ncapacities.4 The suit alleged that the Department and District 10 were denying the\n\ndependent children their constitutional right to safety and freedom from harm 5 by\n\nfailing to provide proper care that was consistent with both professional judgment\n\n\n\n\n3\n    42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n         Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\n         usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to\n         be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the\n         jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\n         secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\n         action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress[.]\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n4\n  At the time suit commenced, Edward Feaver and Johnny Brown served as Secretary of the\nDepartment and as District 10 Administrator, respectively. Kathleen Kearney and Robert Cohen\nassumed their positions in 2000 and shortly thereafter were substituted as the defendants in the\ncase.\n5\n  According to the complaint, this substantive constitutional right was guaranteed the dependent\nchildren by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                                    6\n\fand Florida’s foster care statutory and regulatory regime6 – a failure so profound\n\nthat it caused the children “to suffer harm which is often more severe than that\n\nwhich caused them to be removed from the custody of their parents” in the first\n\nplace. The suit exposed the Florida foster care system as having reached a state of\n\nsystemic crisis, and nowhere was this more evident than in District 10. A yearly\n\nstaff turnover rate of 80% and a dearth of adequate placements spawned a rapidly\n\nincreasing number of severely overcrowded homes with little supervision by the\n\nDepartment.7 Burdened by caseloads that were between two and eight times the\n\n6\n  According to the complaint, in placing dependent children in foster homes, the Department and\nDistrict 10 failed to heed the requirements of the following statutory and regulatory provisions:\nFla. Stat. § 39.001(1)(I) (1998) (children should be placed in licensed foster home with “custody,\ncare, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by the\nparents” and which is drug and alcohol free), Fla. Stat. § 39.001(1)(m) (disruptions to a child’s\neducation should be minimized), Fla. Stat. § 39.001(3)(c) (children should be placed in “[a] safe\nand nurturing environment which will preserve a sense of personal dignity and integrity”), Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.010(5)(g) (1995) (child counselor will visit a child placed in foster\ncare at least once per month), Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.010(1)(b)(6) (foster parents\nobligated to see that children receive adequate medical service), Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-\n13.010(1)(b)(9) (foster parents obligated to see that children receive adequate educational\nservices), Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.010(5)(b)–(f) (information sharing obligations\nbetween foster parents and counselors). Perhaps most pointedly, the complaint alleged that the\nSecretary and the District Administrator failed to develop and implement adequate procedures\nfor the prevention of abuse, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.015(1), and continually placed\nchildren in homes that failed to meet basic regulatory licensing requirements. Fla. Admin. Code\nAnn. r. 65C-13.011(2) (no more than five total children in a home without good cause); Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.011(4) (foster parents must “have sufficient income to assure their\nstability and the security of their own family without relying on board payments”); Fla. Admin.\nCode Ann. r. 65C-13.011(9) (foster parents must meet regulatory screening requirements); Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.011(11) (foster home must be comparable to other homes in the\nneighborhood, be free from unreasonably dangerous objects or materials, and be inspected by a\nlocal health inspector).\n7\n  The complaint alleged that over 400 children in District 10 were placed in overcrowded foster\nand shelter homes – more than twice that of the previous year. Additionally, 80 children in\n\n                                                7\n\frecommended national standards, counselors were regularly unable to meet their\n\nmonthly visitation requirements; in fact, a sampling of foster children in District 10\n\nduring this time revealed that nearly a quarter of the children surveyed had not\n\nbeen visited by their caseworker in over two months.8 Contributing further to the\n\ninstitutional malady was the overall lack of proper screening procedures, which\n\nresulted in emotionally disturbed and potentially dangerous children being\n\nimproperly placed in homes that were unable to provide them with adequate care\n\nor monitoring.9 As a result, the complaint alleged that physical, sexual, and\n\nemotional abuse and neglect pervaded the District 10 foster care system.\n\n       After the defendants answered the complaint and following months of\n\ndiscovery and negotiations, the parties entered into a settlement agreement and, on\n\nJanuary 26, 2000, presented it to the district court. The court approved the\n\nsettlement agreement and, treating it as a proposed consent decree enforceable\n\n\nDistrict 10’s custody were missing.\n8\n  Another study in 1996 revealed that 58% of foster children in District 10 were not visited\nmonthly by their caseworker and that 77% were not receiving appropriate services. Later that\nyear, a District 10 juvenile court dependency judge captured the general sentiment as to the\nalarming state of affairs: “I am more than scared, I am petrified relative to the lack of shelter\nplacements and foster homes in District 10. . . . Things are now at the point where children’s\nlives are in danger.” Compl. ¶ 62.\n9\n  In September 1995, the Department studied 177 children receiving targeted case management\nservices (mental health) in District 10. The study revealed that 41% of these children were\nknown to have been sexually abused, a percentage that was significantly higher than those\nreported in other large metropolitan areas. The study also revealed that 15% of the children had\ncommitted sexual assaults. Compl. ¶ 58.\n\n                                                 8\n\fthrough the court’s civil contempt power, entered the decree on May 31, 2000.10\n\nThe decree required the Secretary and the District 10 Administrator to develop and\n\nimplement an adequate system of foster care for the dependent children of District\n\n10. The decree also required the Secretary and the District 10 Administrator to\n\nadhere to the commands of the Florida statutes and regulations governing the care\n\nof dependent children 11 and to meet numerous minimum standards regarding the\n\nplacement and monitoring of children in foster homes.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       On October 28, 2002, counsel for the plaintiff class in Ward brought the\n\npresent lawsuit in the district court on behalf of A.P., a District 10 dependent\n\n\n10\n   The decree was captioned “Order Approving Settlement Agreement” rather than “Consent\nDecree.” Despite this caption, it had all the indicia of, and was in effect, a consent decree. The\norder recited that on February 18, 2000, the court, after tentatively approving the settlement as\n“fair [and] reasonable,” and “adequate [to] protect the plaintiff class,” had ordered “that notice of\nthe proposed Settlement Agreement be published to class members and that comments or\nobjections be filed by May 18, 2000.” A final hearing was held on May 31, 2000, at which the\ncourt “considered all comments and objections” and “finally approved” the settlement\nagreement. The order then stated that “the Court retains jurisdiction for the purposes of\nenforcing the Settlement Agreement.”\n11\n   The part of the court’s order that required the Secretary and the District 10 Administrator to\nadhere to the commands of the Florida statutes and regulations governing the care of dependent\nchildren constituted what we have often treated as an unenforceable “obey the law” injunction.\nSee S.E.C. v. Smyth, 420 F.3d 1225, 1233 n.14 (11th Cir. 2005) (“This Circuit has held\nrepeatedly that ‘obey the law’ injunctions are unenforceable.”) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Prosecuting a future violation of a statute or regulation via an order to show cause why\nthe defendant should not be held in civil contempt and sanctioned – which is what the Secretary\nand District 10 Administrator would face if plaintiffs’ counsel wanted them brought to heel for\nviolating a statute or regulation cited in the consent decree – would deny the defendant the\nprocess the law provides for such violation.\n\n                                                  9\n\fchild,12 against the Department’s former Secretary, Edward Feaver, two former\n\nDistrict 10 Administrators, including Johnny Brown, seventeen District 10\n\ncaseworkers charged with the day-to-day, on-the-ground monitoring of the\n\nchildren in the District’s foster care system, and their supervisors between\n\nSeptember 15 and November 23, 1998, alleging that A.P. suffered child-on-child\n\nsexual abuse while residing in the Calhoun foster home (the “Calhoun home”).13\n\nA.P. sought money damages against each of these defendants, in their individual\n\ncapacities, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, on the ground that the defendants effectively\n\ncaused such sexual abuse and thereby deprived him of his substantive and\n\nprocedural rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n         A.P.’s case was assigned to the district judge who had entered the consent\n\ndecree in Ward. Also assigned to that judge was a case brought by District 10\n\ndependents shortly after A.P. filed suit. The plaintiffs were N.M. and R.M., two\n\nsiblings who joined in one complaint.14 The complaint sought money damages\n\nagainst Feaver, Brown, another former District 10 administrator, and various\n\nDistrict 10 caseworkers and supervisors under § 1983 relying on the same legal\n\n\n12\n     Since A.P. was a minor, he sued through his next friend, David S. Bazerman.\n13\n   The Calhoun home was operated by Joann Calhoun and her ex-husband, Mr. Calhoun, who\nare not named as defendants. Mr. Calhoun’s first name is not revealed in the record.\n14\n     N.M. and R.M. are minors. Like A.P., they sue through their next friend, David S. Bazerman.\n\n\n                                                10\n\ftheory A.P. was advancing as a basis for recovering damages for the sexual abuse\n\nhe suffered while in the Calhoun home. Since the case was similar to A.P.’s case,\n\nthe court dismissed it without prejudice with leave to replead the claims in a single\n\ncomplaint in the action filed by A.P.15\n\n         On April 3, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The\n\ncomplaint focused on the Calhoun home, alleging that it suffered from many of the\n\nills the Ward complaint had listed as characteristic of District 10: the home was\n\nseverely overcrowded and housed children with histories of violence and deviant\n\nbehavior, many of whom had been perpetrators as well as victims of sexual abuse.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the defendants failed to monitor properly the Calhouns\n\nand the children in their care, and that had they followed DCF’s procedures and\n\nimplemented corrective measures, the plaintiffs would not have been abused. The\n\ndefendants had allegedly acted with deliberate indifference to the significant risk of\n\nharm the plaintiffs faced and thereby denied them due process of law.\n\n         The defendants severally moved to dismiss the first amended complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.16 The district court\n\n\n15\n   Initially, five additional cases arising from similar events in the Calhoun home were assigned\nto the same judge. One case was successfully mediated and settled. The remaining four cases\nwere repled in A.P.’s case but subsequently settled. This includes the claim of minor plaintiff\nR.K., which settled during the pendency of this appeal and was dismissed with prejudice\npursuant to the parties’ joint motion on June 11, 2008. I confine this discussion accordingly.\n16\n     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n                                                11\n\freferred the motion to a magistrate judge who recommended that the motions be\n\ndenied. The defendants objected to the recommendation, and on March 30, 2004,\n\nfollowing oral argument on their objections, the district court, relying on Ray v.\n\nFoltz, 370 F.3d 1079 (11th Cir. 2004), concluded that the complaint should be\n\namended.17 Like the plaintiffs in Foltz, the plaintiffs before the district court had\n\nnot alleged that each defendant, individually, actually knew of the substantial risk\n\nof harm the plaintiffs faced in the Calhoun home and were deliberately indifferent\n\nto such harm. In directing the plaintiffs to amend their first amended complaint,\n\nthe district court gave them an opportunity to cure that deficiency.\n\n       The plaintiffs responded with a second amended complaint (the\n\n“complaint”) on May 3, 2004. The complaint consisted of 265 pages with 1,355\n\nnumbered paragraphs, named as defendants Feaver, Brown,18 and fifteen\n\nindividuals involved in the administration of District 10’s foster care system, and\n\n\n\n\n17\n   Ray v. Foltz was a § 1983 damages action brought by the parents of a child who had been\nmurdered in a foster home, R.M., against the three employees in DCF’s licensing unit who had\nbeen involved in licensing the home. 370 F.3d 1079, 1080–81 (11th Cir. 2004). The defendants,\ninvoking the doctrine of qualified immunity, moved the district court to dismiss the parents’\ncomplaint. Id. at 1081. The court denied their motion, and they appealed. Id. We reversed, and\nremanded the case with the direction that the district court dismiss the complaint because it\nfailed to allege that “the defendants actually knew of the substantial risk of harm to R.M. and\nthat they were deliberately indifferent to it.” Id. at 1085.\n18\n  By this time plaintiffs had dropped their claims against Brown’s predecessor, who had been\nnamed as a defendant in the earlier complaints.\n\n                                              12\n\fasserted 71 claims for relief.19 Each defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim for relief on two grounds: first, the complaint failed to recite\n\nfacts sufficient to state a constitutional violation against the defendant; and second,\n\nassuming a constitutional violation, the defendant was nonetheless entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n         On September 17, 2004, the district court entered an omnibus order\n\ndismissing all 40 claims brought by the three plaintiffs, A.P., N.M., and R.M.,\n\nbecause the allegations were insufficient under Foltz to make out a case of\n\ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm.20 A.P. v. Feaver, No. 02-\n\n61534, at 49–50 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2004) (Omnibus Order on Defs.’ Mot. to\n\nDismiss Pls.’ Second Am. Compl.) (“Omnibus Order”). The plaintiffs moved the\n\ncourt pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) to enter a final judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants on the claims the court had dismissed for failure to state a\n\nconstitutional violation. The court granted their motion on October 15, 2004, and\n\n                                                                                          1\nentered final judgment on those claims. This appeal is from that judgment.                    2\n\n\n\n\n19\n     Thirty-one of these claims were brought by J.K. and R.K., who have since settled.\n20\n   The court went on to hold that because these claims failed to state a constitutional violation,\nthe defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n21\n   Though the plaintiffs included all of the dismissed claims in their notice of appeal, they now\nappeal the district court’s ruling on only 36 of the 40 dismissals. The four dismissals which the\nplaintiffs do not appeal are the dismissal of A.P.’s claim against Richard Walsh and all three of\nplaintiffs’ claims against Pat Spratling.\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                               II.\n\n       The Florida Department of Children and Family Services, headed by the\n\nSecretary, is the state executive branch agency that provides services in the areas of\n\neconomic self-sufficiency; developmental disability; alcohol, drug abuse, and\n\nmental health; and children and families. During the pertinent time period, the\n\nstate was divided into 15 service districts, each headed by a District\n\nAdministrator.22 As reflected in the organizational chart appended to this opinion,\n\none of the persons reporting to the District Administrator of District 10 was the\n\nChild Welfare Director. A Program Administrator and a number of Family\n\nServices Specialists assisted the Child Welfare Director via consultation and\n\nadministrative support.23 The Child Welfare Director also supervised three\n\nProgram Operations Administrators (“POAs”) who collectively managed the four\n\nunits responsible for administering foster care in District 10: “Protective\n\n\n22\n  At least one health and human services board existed in each service district for the purpose of\nencouraging the initiation and support of interagency cooperation and collaboration in\naddressing family services needs.\n23\n   Neither the Florida Administrative Code nor the complaint describes the qualifications of a\nProgram Administrator and a Family Services Specialist. The sole mention of a Program\nAdministrator in the complaint is that this person may participate in lieu of the Child Welfare\nDirector in approving foster home capacity waivers, which I describe at part II.B, infra. The\ncomplaint alleges that the Family Services Specialists assisted District 10 staff with development\nand program planning; provided ongoing technical assistance; monitored the provision of\nchildren’s services; performed quality assurance reviews; ensured that policy guidance was\navailable and understandable to support staff and direct services; and, most pertinent to the case\nat hand, participated in foster parent re-licensing and the approval of foster home capacity\nwaivers.\n\n                                                14\n\fInvestigations,” “Licensing,” “Placement,” and “Foster Care.”24 During the time\n\nperiod covered by the allegations of the complaint, District 10 provided foster care\n\nto over 1,000 children in several hundred homes; accordingly, the four units\n\ncontained numerous Supervisors, Investigators, and Counselors.\n\n       The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that they were subjected to child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse in the Calhoun home from April 24 until November 23, 1998.\n\nTheir complaint therefore focuses on District 10’s licensing of the foster parent in\n\ncharge of that home, Joann Calhoun, and the placement and supervision of the\n\nplaintiffs and those who allegedly abused them, namely M.M. and D.L., in her\n\nhome. My discussion is similarly focused. I begin by explaining the process for\n\nlicensing a foster parent, including Joann Calhoun, prior to the time of the alleged\n\nabuse.25 Next, I explain the process for adjudicating a child a dependent of the\n\nState of Florida, identify the District 10 officials involved in the child’s custodial\n\nplacement, and describe the supervision protocol. After that, I review the\n\nallegations regarding the placement and supervision of the plaintiffs before us,\n\nA.P., N.M., and R.M., and the alleged abusers, M.M. and D.L.26\n\n24\n   Each unit was managed by a different POA, with the exception of the Licensing Unit and the\nPlacement Unit, which were managed by the same POA.\n25\n   More than one foster parent may be responsible for a foster home. In this case, there was one\nfoster parent, Joann Calhoun.\n26\n   In the first amended complaint plaintiffs’ counsel filed in this case, M.M. and D.L. were\nalleged to have been victims of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. In their\n\n                                                15\n\f                                        A. Licensing\n\n       An applicant seeking a license to operate a foster home was subjected to a\n\ncomprehensive background investigation conducted by a Licensing Counselor.27\n\nThe investigation centered on the applicant’s financial and emotional stability and\n\noverall character, and involved a “home study” of the suitability of the applicant’s\n\nhome for foster care. If the results of the investigation favored granting a license,\n\nthe applicant would participate in a foster parent training program. Then, if she\n\nsatisfactorily completed the training program, the applicant would receive a license\n\nto operate a specific foster home for a designated number of children – the home’s\n\ncapacity.\n\n       The license had a term of one year and could be renewed annually. The\n\nannual re-licensing process involved a home visit by the Licensing Counselor, who\n\nwould review the results of the initial home study, consider any relevant\n\ninformation the Foster Care Unit may have acquired in supervising children housed\n\nthere during the previous year, and report her findings to her Supervisor. Absent\n\nan unfavorable report from the Counselor, the Licensing Unit would license the\n\nfoster parent to operate her home for another year at the same or a different\n\n\nsecond amended complaint, counsel dropped M.M. and D.L. as plaintiffs and then alleged that\nthey perpetrated the sexual abuse A.P., N.M., and R.M. allegedly sustained.\n27\n   The Counselor conducted the investigation under the supervision of her Supervisor, who, in\nturn, answered to the Licensing and Placement POA.\n\n                                              16\n\fcapacity.\n\n       Joann Calhoun became a licensed foster parent in 1990.28 By 1992, her\n\nhome had gained a reputation for being able to handle troubled and unruly boys,\n\nsome with histories of sexual abuse both as a perpetrator and as a victim. District\n\n10 regarded the Calhoun home as a therapeutic setting, although it was not licensed\n\nexplicitly as a therapeutic facility. Over the next six years, until November 23,\n\n1998 – when the incident giving rise to this lawsuit was reported – there were no\n\nreported incidents of child-on-child sexual abuse in the home, which housed as\n\nmany as eleven children at a time, including emotionally disturbed children with\n\nhistories of sexual and physical aggression.\n\n                      B. Foster Home Placement and Supervision\n\n       A child normally first came within DCF’s jurisdiction on a complaint of\n\nabuse, neglect, or abandonment. The complaint was channeled to the Protective\n\nInvestigations Unit and assigned to a Protective Investigator who looked into the\n\nallegations of the complaint under the supervision of a Protective Investigations\n\nSupervisor. If the inquiry yielded “probable cause to support a finding of\n\nreasonable grounds for removal and that removal [was] necessary to protect the\n\n28\n   The initial licensed capacity of the Calhoun home was two children. The capacity thereafter\nfluctuated from time to time on re-licensing. For example, the capacity was five in 1992, three\nand later four in 1994, five in 1995, and seven in 1997. As I explain infra, the number of\nchildren residing in the Calhoun home at one time sometimes exceeded the licensed capacity due\nto the granting of waivers.\n\n                                              17\n\fchild,” 29 the Department would take the child into custody. Fla. Stat.\n\n§ 39.401(1)(b) (1997). If the Department’s legal staff agreed with the Investigator\n\nthat the facts supporting removal sufficiently established probable cause, the\n\nDepartment would then file an emergency shelter petition with the circuit court and\n\nrequest a hearing. Fla. Stat. § 39.401(3).\n\n       Thereafter, within 24 hours of the child’s removal, a detention or “shelter”\n\nhearing had to be convened before the circuit court. Fla. Stat. §§ 39.401(3),\n\n39.402(5)(a).30 At the hearing, the court would appoint a guardian ad litem\n\n(“GAL”) to “represent the child” unless it found that “such representation [was]\n\nunnecessary.” Fla. Stat. § 39.402(7)(a).31 The court would then hear from the\n\nProtective Investigator assigned to the case and the child’s custodian to determine\n\nwhether the “probable cause” standard had been met warranting the child’s\n\ndetention. Id. If the court found that it had, it would order the Department to\n\n\n29\n  Reasonable grounds for removal included: “the child has been abused, neglected, or\nabandoned, or is suffering from or is in imminent danger of illness or injury as a result of abuse,\nneglect, or abandonment.” Fla. Stat. § 39.401(1)(b)(1) (1997).\n30\n   Broward County is in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit of Florida. The Broward County\nCircuit Court is divided into divisions, one being the Juvenile Division. In this opinion,\nreferences to the circuit court are to the Juvenile Division of the Broward County Circuit Court.\n31\n   A GAL is “a responsible adult who is appointed by the court to represent the best interests of\nthe child in a proceeding as provided for by law, who shall be a party to any judicial proceeding\nas a representative of the child, and who shall serve until discharged by the court.” Fla. Admin.\nCode Ann. r. 65C-13.013(p). Generally, the GAL investigates the child’s situation, identifies\nresources and services, advocates for the child to the court and relevant agencies, and monitors\nwhether court orders or case plans are carried out.\n\n                                                 18\n\fdetain the child in a shelter or foster home for a period not to exceed 21 days,\n\nunless the child was adjudicated a dependent in the meantime. Id.\n\n       If detention was ordered, a petition to have the court adjudicate the child a\n\ndependent had to be filed within seven days after the child was taken into\n\ncustody.32 Fla. Stat. § 39.402(8) (1997). Unless the parents or legal custodian of\n\nthe child had admitted the allegations of the petition, the court would convene a\n\nhearing to receive the parties’ evidence. Id. If the court found that dependency\n\nhad been proven by a preponderance of the evidence,33 Fla. Stat. § 39.408(2)(b), it\n\nwould enter an order adjudicating the child a dependent of the State, Fla. Stat. §\n\n39.409, determine the most appropriate services and placement for the child,34 and\n\nretain jurisdiction over the case for the purpose of reviewing the child’s progress,\n\nFla. Stat. § 39.453.\n\n       If the court ordered a dependent child placed in foster care, the Protective\n\nInvestigator would contact the Placement Unit and provide that unit with sufficient\n\n\n\n32\n   The petition may be filed by the Department, through an attorney, or “by any other person\nwho has knowledge of the facts alleged or is informed of them and believes that they are true.”\nFla. Stat. § 39.404(1).\n33\n   A dependent includes a child whom the court has found “[t]o have been abandoned, abused,\nor neglected by the child’s parents or other custodians.” Fla. Stat. § 39.01(14).\n34\n   This included placing the child in the temporary legal custody of an adult relative, non-\nrelative, licensed child-caring agency, or the Department. Fla. Stat. § 39.41. Temporary custody\nlasted until terminated by the court or when the child reached the age of 18. Fla. Stat. §\n39.41(2)(a)(8)\n\n                                               19\n\finformation about the child to enable it to identify a suitable foster home. If the\n\nfoster home the Placement Unit selected was operating at its licensed capacity, the\n\nPlacement Unit would initiate a waiver process; a waiver, if granted, would permit\n\n                                    5\nthe placement to go forward.            3\n\n\n\n         The waiver process proceeded as follows. The Placement Supervisor\n\nconferred with the Licensing Supervisor who had been responsible for licensing or\n\nre-licensing the foster parent – and thus was acquainted with the home at issue –\n\nregarding the appropriateness of the placement. If these Supervisors agreed that an\n\novercapacity waiver would be appropriate, they would submit a written waiver\n\nrequest to the POA of Licensing and Placement, to a Family Services Specialist,\n\nand to the Child Welfare Director.36 Compl. ¶ 41. If these officials agreed that a\n\nwaiver should issue, they would approve the waiver and the child would be placed\n\nin the foster home.\n\n35\n     The Florida Administrative Code provided:\n\n         Generally there should be no more than five children in a home, including the\n         substitute care parents’ own children. These criteria may be varied for good\n         cause and with the written approval of the Family Safety and Preservation\n         program office. If a family has the emotional and physical capacity to nurture\n         more than five children, it is not against policy to establish a capacity above the\n         rule of five. A family must have the physical room and emotional capacity to\n         provide this care.\n\nFla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.011(2)(b). There is no allegation that the approval of the\nFamily Safety and Preservation program office was not obtained with respect to placing more\nthan five children in the Calhoun home.\n36\n     The Program Administrator could be substituted for the Child Welfare Director.\n\n                                                  20\n\f       In deciding whether to grant an overcapacity waiver, the Department’s\n\nLicensing Manual required that the following questions be addressed:\n\n       1.      Is this the only resource available for the children [needing] placement?\n               Have all available homes been considered and has it been determined that\n               this particular home is the most appropriate?\n       2.      Can the home physically accommodate the additional child/children? This\n               includes a bed, adequate closet space and room for personal possessions.\n       3.      Can the substitute parents meet the needs of another child or children? Is\n               help, relief, or other support available to the family? Is the family managing\n               well with the children already in the home? Will the addition of another\n               child/children affect the quality of care being given to the children currently\n               in the home?\n       4.      Can the children already in placement in the home accept additional\n               children? Are there any children in the home who are particularly\n               vulnerable? Can those children be adequately protected?\n       5.      What is the planned duration of the new capacity? 73\n\n       Once the child was placed in a foster home, a Foster Care Supervisor would\n\nassign the child’s case to a caseworker, also known as a Family Services\n\nCounselor.38 According to the complaint, the Family Services Counselor was\n\nresponsible for communicating the child’s background information to the foster\n\nparents and formulating a plan of care if the child had a history of sexual abuse or\n\n\n\n\n37\n   Compl. ¶ 42. As the elaborate approval process and multifactor analysis suggest, the Department had\na strong presumption in favor of upholding the original licensed capacity of the home as established by\nthe Licensing Unit; granting an overcapacity waiver, therefore, meant that under the circumstances, the\naddition of a child to a particular foster home would not depreciate the quality of care being provided\nthere.\n38\n  The formal transfer of the child’s case from the Protective Investigations Unit to the Foster\nCare Unit did not normally occur until after the child had been declared a dependent.\n\n                                                21\n\fvictimization in order to guard against further sexual assaults.39 Additionally, the\n\ncounselor was required to visit the child at least monthly40 and, as alleged in the\n\ncomplaint, assess the safety of the placement and report any concerns about the\n\ncondition of the foster home to the Licensing Unit or any suspected abuse or\n\nneglect to the District’s abuse prevention hotline. If the foster parents ever came to\n\nbelieve that they were no longer able to manage the child in their home, the Family\n\nServices Counselor would work with the foster parents and the child to remedy the\n\nissues that prompted the removal request and would help facilitate the replacement\n\nprocess if the problems were not corrected. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-\n\n13.010(5)(m).\n\n       C. Placement of Alleged Abusers M.M. and D.L. in the Calhoun Home\n\n                                     1. M.M.’s Placement\n\n       On January 6, 1997, 12-year-old M.M., who had an extensive history of\n\npsychological problems and violent outbursts, threatened to harm himself and\n\nseveral family members with a knife. M.M. was thereafter involuntarily\n\ncommitted to an in-patient psychiatric facility.41 On January 14, 1997, while M.M.\n\n39\n   The District staff and foster parents were required to “outline a plan of care to handle any\nspecial management issues identified in the child’s history and assessment” to help prevent\nsexual assaults from occurring in the foster home.

Katherine Kaufman, the POA of Protective\n\nInvestigations, subsequently contacted a contract mental health services provider\n\nabout placing M.M. in a residential treatment facility. The provider responded that\n\nit could only offer M.M. and his family in-home therapeutic services.42 Thus, upon\n\nhis release from the hospital, M.M. returned home on January 23, 1997, and began\n\nto receive in-home therapy. M.M.’s violent behavior resumed, and fearing for her\n\nsafety and the safety of her daughter, M.M.’s mother asked that he be removed\n\nfrom her home.\n\n        M.M. was placed in the Department’s custody at the Lippman Shelter – a\n\nshort-term residential shelter – on February 3, 1997. On that date, Protective\n\nInvestigator Susan Worsley was assigned to M.M.’s case and was informed of\n\nM.M.’s psychological and behavioral history. Shortly after his placement, on\n\nFebruary 12, 1997, Worsley was told that M.M. could no longer remain at the\n\n\nmentally ill, and, inter alia, there is a substantial likelihood that, based on recent behavior, the\nperson will inflict serious bodily harm on himself or another person.” Turner v. Crosby, 339\nF.3d 1247, 1256 n.7 (11th Cir. 2003).\n42\n   A 1991 study conducted by the Department reported that 94% of foster care counselors\n“stated that residential treatment for sexual offenders was either not available in their district or\navailable in a limited area or on a limited basis.” Compl. ¶ 50. This shortage apparently had not\nbeen alleviated by the time Kaufman inquired about a residential treatment facility for M.M. in\nJanuary 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fshelter because of his background and need for 24-hour one-on-one supervision.43\n\nWorsley therefore contacted the Placement Unit to inquire about a new placement\n\nfor M.M.; she suggested the Calhoun home. An inquiry was conducted into\n\nM.M.’s behavioral history and special needs, as well as the make-up of the five\n\nchildren already in the Calhoun home.44 An overcapacity waiver to permit M.M. to\n\nbe placed in the Calhoun home was considered and approved by a Placement\n\nSupervisor, by Margaret Andrews (then a Licensing Supervisor), by Sharon\n\nWoodroof (a Family Services Specialist), by Jennifer Chang (POA of Licensing\n\nand Placement), and by the Child Welfare Director. Accordingly, on February 14,\n\n1997, Worsley placed M.M. with the Calhouns, and on March 24, 1997, M.M. was\n\nadjudicated dependant. M.M. was then assigned to Sharon Pollack, a Family\n\nServices Counselor; there is no allegation that Pollack failed to perform regular\n\nmonthly visits to M.M. in the Calhoun home from March 24 through August 1997.\n\nPollack was again assigned to M.M. from May through September 1998; plaintiffs\n\nallege that she visited him only once during this time, on June 25, 1998.\n\n\n\n43\n     It is unclear from the complaint who provided the District 10 officials with this information.\n44\n  In addition to 12-year-old M.M., I deduce from the complaint that the other children in the\nhome were R.D., a 17-year-old child who had lived in the home since 1992; B.J., who was about\n17 years old; R.T., who was about 13 years old; and two other children of unknown age, one of\nwhom was R.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f                                   2. D.L.’s Placement\n\n       On June 27, 1995, after numerous allegations of abuse, 11-year-old D.L. was\n\nadjudicated dependent and placed in the custody of his stepfather. In late August\n\nof that year, the Department received a report that D.L. had sexually abused a\n\nyounger boy who was also residing in his stepfather’s home. In addition, the\n\nreport indicated that D.L. himself was the victim of sexual abuse. D.L. would\n\nremain in the home for over a year, until approximately December 6, 1996, when\n\nhe was removed from his stepfather’s custody and placed in a shelter home. D.L.\n\nwas adjudicated dependent on January 3, 1997, and moved to a foster home four\n\ndays later.\n\n       On April 7, 1997, D.L. admitted to a Department official that he had\n\nsexually assaulted three or four young boys who lived near the foster home where\n\nhe was residing. After the foster parents requested that D.L. be immediately\n\nremoved, an overcapacity waiver for the Calhoun home was requested and was\n\napproved by Department officials, including Woodroof, a Family Services\n\nSpecialist, and Chang, POA of Licensing and Placement.45 D.L. was subsequently\n\nplaced in the Calhoun home by Loubert Desmangles, a Family Services Counselor,\n\n45\n   Plaintiffs do not identify the other officials involved in the waiver process, but they\npresumably included a Placement Supervisor, a Licensing Supervisor, and the Child Welfare\nDirector.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\fon April 8, 1997;46 the home now housed seven foster children.47 There is no\n\nallegation that Desmangles failed to make regular visits to D.L. in the Calhoun\n\nhome.48 From February 27 to May 5, 1998, Pollack temporarily served as D.L.’s\n\ncaseworker; plaintiffs allege that she visited him at the Calhoun home on only one\n\noccasion – March 5, 1998. Susan Wilburn, another Family Services Counselor,\n\nwas then assigned to D.L.’s case from May 12 until September 11, 1998, when she\n\nleft the Department. There is no allegation that Wilburn failed to visit D.L.\n\nregularly.\n\n           D. Placement of Plaintiffs N.M. and R.M. in the Calhoun Home\n\n       On September 23, 1993, N.M. and his younger brother, R.M., were\n\nadjudicated dependent and placed in their father’s custody. In early June 1994, the\n\nDepartment received a report that N.M. had been sexually abused by his male\n\n\n46\n   The complaint does not indicate whether Desmangles also served as D.L.’s counselor prior to\nhis placement in the Calhoun home.\n47\n   From the complaint, I deduce that in addition to D.L. – who was now twelve years old – the\nsix other children were 17-year-old R.D., 17-year-old B.J., 13-year-old R.T., 12-year-old M.M.,\nand two other children, one of whom may have been in the tenth grade. R.B. had left the\nCalhoun home a few days earlier, on April 2, 1997.\n48\n   The exact duration of time that Desmangles served as counselor to D.L. is unclear from the\ncomplaint. The complaint suggests that Desmangles was still D.L.’s counselor as of July 1,\n1997, but there is no indication of whether he continued to serve in that capacity until Pollack\nbecame D.L.’s counselor on February 27, 1998. Regardless, there is no allegation that whoever\nserved as D.L.’s counselor from July 1, 1997 to February 27, 1998 failed to visit him regularly in\nthe Calhoun home.\n\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fbabysitter. Approximately four years later, N.M. and R.M. were moved from their\n\nfather’s home to shelter care and, on April 6, 1998, placed in the legal and physical\n\ncustody of the Department. Due to their behavioral problems, 8-year-old N.M. and\n\n5-year-old R.M. were placed in several different foster homes before arriving at the\n\nCalhoun home on April 24 and May 6, 1998, respectively. Eleven foster children\n\nwere now living in the Calhoun home.49 From May 21 through September 11,\n\n1998, Wilburn served as Family Services Counselor to N.M. and R.M., in addition\n\nto D.L.50 There are no allegations that she failed to visit these three children\n\nregularly in the home.\n\n                                  E. Home by Home Review\n\n       In August of 1998, the Department began a Home by Home Review of\n\napproximately 50 “high priority” homes that District 10 identified as being\n\n\n\n49\n   Plaintiffs allege that no overcapacity waivers were requested for N.M. or R.M. at the time “as\nno waiver could be approved”; according to the complaint, this was because the May 16, 1997\nre-licensing of the Calhoun home had restricted the home to the seven children already living\nthere. The Calhoun home was re-licensed on June 1, 1998. A waiver for R.M.’s placement in\nthe Calhoun home was subsequently approved on November 23, 1998, with Corinne Millikan, a\nFamily Services Specialist, allegedly participating in the approval. The complaint does not\nallege when the waiver for N.M.’s placement was approved.\n        According to the complaint, granting an overcapacity waiver after the child had been\nplaced in the foster home violated Department policy.\n50\n   The complaint does not indicate who subsequently became counselor to N.M., R.M., and\nD.L., but there is no specific allegation that these three children were not assigned a caseworker\nbetween September 11, 1998 and November 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fovercapacity or having had some previous report of abuse or neglect. Woodroof\n\nand Chang had designated the Calhoun home as one of the high-priority homes to\n\nbe reviewed. As part of the Review, multiple foster children in the Calhoun home\n\nwere interviewed, the foster children’s records were inspected, and the home’s\n\nlicensing records were examined. On September 8, 1998, the results of the Review\n\nwere issued in a report, copies of which went to Feaver, Brown, Kaufman,\n\nMillikan, Woodroof, and Chang. Compl. ¶ 147.\n\n       Among other things, the report described the Calhoun home as “cramped,”\n\nwith eight children, two of whom, D.L. and M.M., had histories of sexual\n\nperpetration and mental health problems.51 M.M., D.L., and others required the\n\nfrequent attention of mental health technicians visiting the home. Notably, N.M.\n\nwas one of the children who was interviewed by the reviewers; his claim of\n\nmaltreatment was that “everyone at the home was mean to him.” Compl. ¶ 144.\n\nThe Review contained no report of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun\n\n51\n   The following information was documented about the Calhoun home in the report: (1) eleven\nindividuals resided in the Calhoun home – Mr. Calhoun, Joann Calhoun, their son G. Brock (one\nof the Calhouns’ natural children who was living in the home at the time), and eight foster\nchildren; (2) the house was “cramped” and there were often up to three mental health technicians\nin the home visiting the children; (3) Mr. Calhoun would discipline one of the children by\nspanking; (4) D.L. had a history of sexual perpetration; (5) M.M. had a history of sexual and\nphysical aggression; (6) D.L. should not be allowed to sleep in the same room with younger\nchildren; and (7) N.M. informed the reviewers that everyone in the house was mean to him. The\nreport also noted that previously there were multiple “direct[ives] to limit the number of children\nand reduce capacity” that had not been followed. Compl. ¶¶ 144–45.\n\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fhome. District 10 responded to the report’s findings by preparing and\n\nimplementing “Corrective Action Plans” for each of the 50 homes.\n\n         F. Placement of A.P. in the Calhoun Home and Report of Sexual Abuse\n\n         Around May 11, 1998, A.P. was ordered into the legal and physical custody\n\nof the Department. Eight-year-old A.P. had a documented history of sexual\n\nvictimization and perpetration, having previously acted out sexually on his younger\n\nsister. A.P. was placed in the Calhoun home on September 17, 1998, which\n\nbrought the total number of foster children to nine. 25\n\n A waiver approving A.P.’s placement in the Calhoun home was obtained about\n\neleven days later; Corinne Millikan, a Family Services Specialist, was allegedly\n\none of the persons who participated in the approval.\n\n         On November 23, 1998,53 A.P. told his natural mother’s therapist that he was\n\nbeing subjected to repeated sexual abuse by the other foster children in the\n\nCalhoun home, particularly by M.M. and D.L.54 This information was immediately\n\n\n\n\n52\n   Three children had left the home since the placements of N.M. and R.M. on April 24 and May\n6, 1998, respectively.\n53\n     The population of the Calhoun home had risen to thirteen foster children by this time.\n54\n   The complaint alleges that A.P., N.M., and R.M. were all subjected to regular abuse from the\ntime of their placement in the Calhoun home until their removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  29\n\freported to the abuse prevention hotline,55 and A.P. was removed from the Calhoun\n\nhome on November 23, 1998.\n\n       On November 24, 1998, an emergency meeting was called before Judge\n\nBirken, who concurred in the Department’s decision to remove A.P. from the\n\nhome. Pursuant to a court order, N.M. and R.M. were removed from the Calhoun\n\nhome that same day, and 24-hour “awake” supervision was imposed on the home\n\nto prevent any further child-on-child sexual activity. The Department also\n\nimmediately commenced an investigation into the allegations. The investigation\n\nconcluded on December 3, 1998, with a finding that there were “no indicators of\n\nabuse.” The 24-hour awake supervision was subsequently canceled on December\n\n11, 1998. Several months later, a second abuse report was made to the hotline on\n\nMarch 22, 1999, alleging that N.M. and R.M. had also been sexually abused during\n\nthe time that they had lived in the Calhoun home. A 2-day investigation verified\n\nthat there was child-on-child sexual abuse occurring in the home, and the\n\nremaining children were removed on March 25, 1999.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       Each of the 40 claims dismissed by the district court was dismissed pursuant\n\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which\n\n\n55\n   See Fla. Stat. § 415.504 (requiring anyone “who knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect,\nthat a child is an abused, abandoned, or neglected child” to report “such knowledge or suspicion\nto the department”).\n                                                30\n\frelief can be granted. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted\n\nwhen a defendant is found to be immune from suit due to qualified immunity. See\n\nWilliams v. Bd. of Regents, 477 F.3d 1282, 1300 (11th Cir. 2007). An order\n\ngranting a motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity is reviewed de\n\nnovo by applying the same standard as the district court did, “accepting all\n\nallegations as true and construing facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiff[s].”\n\nGJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, 132 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir. 1998).\n\nHowever, such acceptance should not be given blindly; only well pleaded factual\n\nallegations are taken as true and only reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of\n\nthe plaintiff. See Oladeinde v. City of Birmingham, 963 F.2d 1481, 1485 (11th\n\nCir. 1992); Marrero v. City of Hialeah, 625 F.2d 499, 502 (5th Cir. 1980);56 see\n\nalso Long v. Satz, 181 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (“reasonable\n\ninferences”); Associated Builders, Inc. v. Ala. Power Co., 505 F.2d 97, 100 (5th\n\nCir. 1974) (“unwarranted deductions of fact are not admitted as true”). A plaintiff\n\nmust allege more than mere “labels and conclusions”; the complaint must include\n\n“[f]actual allegations . . . [sufficient] to raise a right to relief above the speculative\n\n\n56\n  In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court\nadopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to\nOctober 1, 1981.\n\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\flevel.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. ___ , 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964–65, 167\n\nL. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citations and internal quotations omitted). Indeed, “any\n\nconclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact or legal conclusions\n\nmasquerading as facts do not prevent dismissal.” Weissman v. Nat’l Ass’n of Sec.\n\nDealers, 500 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting)\n\n(citing Associated Builders, Inc., 505 F.2d at 99).\n\n       While Rule 8 allows a plaintiff a great deal of latitude in the manner in\n\nwhich a complaint presents a claim,57 this court has implemented more stringent\n\npleading requirements in § 1983 actions in which qualified immunity is likely to be\n\nraised as a defense. See Swann v. S. Health Partners, Inc., 388 F.3d 834, 838 (11th\n\nCir. 2004) (noting that the heightened pleading standard for qualified immunity\n\ncases survives the Supreme Court’s decision in Leatherman v. Tarrant County\n\nNarcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 122\n\nL. Ed. 2d 517 (1993), which struck down the heightened pleading\n\nrequirement in non-qualified immunity § 1983 suits).58 This heightened specificity\n\n\n57\n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e)(1) (2006) provides that “[e]ach averment of a pleading shall be simple,\nconcise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.”\n58\n   For an additional discussion of the Swann opinion and qualified immunity, see Weissman v.\nNational Association of Securities Dealers, 500 F.3d 1293, 1309 n.6 (11th Cir. 2007) (en banc)\n(Tjoflat, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fis necessary so that the court has sufficient factual allegations to allow it to assess\n\nwhether a defendant’s actions violated a clearly established right. GJR Invs., Inc.,\n\n132 F.3d at 1367. If it is impossible to make this determination from the face of\n\nthe plaintiff’s complaint, the purpose of the qualified immunity defense – shielding\n\ngovernment officials from the demands of defending oneself from damages suits –\n\nmay well be frustrated. 95\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       It is undisputed that the actions of which plaintiffs complain were\n\nundertaken by the defendants in the course of their “discretionary functions.” See\n\nHolloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1265 (11th Cir. 2004) (considering whether\n\nthe official engaged in acts “of a type that fell within the employee’s job\n\nresponsibilities”). Therefore, to overcome the defendants’ entitlement to qualified\n\nimmunity, plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) the defendants violated their federal\n\nconstitutional or statutory rights, and that (2) those rights were clearly established\n\nat the time of the defendants’ actions. Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th\n\n\n\n59\n   Qualified immunity “is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,”\nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2815, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985), and\ntherefore its purposes would be “thwarted if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.”\nHarrell v. Decatur County, 22 F.3d 1570, 1578 (11th Cir. 1994) (Dubina, J., dissenting), vacated\nby 41 F.3d 1494 (11th Cir. 1995) (per curiam) (adopting Judge Dubina’s dissenting opinion).\n\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fCir. 2002); Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340, 1350 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\n       The complaint in this case does not allege that any of the defendants directly\n\nparticipated in the sexual abuse that the plaintiffs allegedly suffered; that is, they\n\nwere not the direct instruments of the abuse. Rather, plaintiffs claim that it was the\n\ndefendants’ failure to act on plaintiffs’ behalf, their failure to follow DCF\n\nguidelines and regulatory mandates and to heed warnings, that led to the abuse.\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument is, in short, that the defendants each were positioned either to\n\nprevent the abuse from occurring or to curtail further abuse once it had begun and,\n\nby failing to do so, violated the substantive component of the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n       As an initial matter, it is important to expound upon the difference between a\n\n§ 1983 suit seeking injunctive relief and the case before us, a § 1983 suit for\n\ndamages. The defendant-officials in a suit for injunctive relief, as was the case in\n\nWard v. Feaver, are those individuals who have the power to provide the plaintiffs\n\nwith an adequate remedy – not necessarily the officials who actually violated the\n\nplaintiffs’ rights. The latter question is largely irrelevant in the equitable relief\n\ncontext; that is, it does not matter who specifically violated the rights of the\n\nplaintiffs, merely that the plaintiffs are suffering an ongoing violation of their\n\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\frights and the defendants before the court have the authority to stop it from\n\ncontinuing.\n\n       In a suit for damages, on the other hand, the crucial inquiry is whether each\n\nof the defendant-officials personally violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\n\nIndividual liability under § 1983 cannot arise vicariously through a theory of\n\nrespondeat superior. Monell v. Dep’t. of Soc. Servs. of New York, 436 U.S. 658,\n\n690–95, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 2035–38, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978); Holloman ex rel.\n\nHolloman, 370 F.3d at 1290. Without the liability-extending tool of respondeat\n\nsuperior, “[s]upervisory officials cannot be held liable under § 1983 for the\n\nunconstitutional actions of their subordinates[.]” Gray v. Bostic, 458 F.3d 1295,\n\n1308 (11th Cir. 2006). However, the absence of vicarious liability does not\n\nforeclose holding a supervisor independently liable if he or she acts in a\n\ndeliberately indifferent manner toward the plaintiff. Greason v. Kemp, 891 F.2d\n\n829, 836–37 (11th Cir. 1990).60\n\n60\n   Under the “extremely rigorous” standard for holding a supervisor liable in his individual\ncapacity, supervisory liability is only appropriate “when the supervisor personally participates in\nthe alleged unconstitutional conduct or when there is a causal connection between the actions of\na supervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation.” Cottone v. Jenne, 326 F.3d\n1352, 1360–61 (11th Cir. 2003). “The necessary causal connection can be established when a\nhistory of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the\nalleged deprivation, and he fails to do so,” or “when a supervisor’s custom or policy . . . result[s]\nin deliberate indifference to constitutional rights or when facts support an inference that the\nsupervisor directed the subordinates to act unlawfully and failed to stop them from doing so.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       Having noted this distinction, I proceed to set forth the standard for\n\nestablishing a violation of a federal constitutional or statutory right in a § 1983 suit\n\nfor damages against a government official in his or her individual capacity.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       “[T]he right to personal security constitutes a historic liberty interest\n\nprotected substantively by the Due Process Clause” from government\n\ninfringement. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315, 102 S. Ct. 2452,\n\n2458, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). That right is not\n\nextinguished by confinement in a prison, Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S. Ct.\n\n2565, 57 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1977); commitment to a mental institution, Youngberg,\n\n457 U.S. at 315–16, 102 S. Ct. at 2457–58; or, most pertinently, placement in\n\nfoster care, Taylor v. Ledbetter, 818 F.2d 791, 797 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc).\n\nThis liberty interest, however, is not absolute; the proper question is “not simply\n\nwhether a liberty interest has been infringed but whether the extent or nature of the\n\n. . . lack of absolute safety is such as to violate due process.” Youngberg, 457 U.S.\n\nat 320, 102 S. Ct. at 2460. Therefore, whether an individual’s due process right\n\nhas been violated is determined by weighing “‘the liberty of the individual’”\n\n\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\fagainst “‘the demands of an organized society.’” Taylor, 818 F.2d at 795 (quoting\n\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 320, 102 S. Ct. at 2460).\n\n       To achieve the proper balance between the interests of the state and the\n\nrights of a child in foster care, this court adopted the “deliberate indifference”\n\nstandard. Id. at 795–97 (applying the “deliberate indifference” standard of Estelle\n\nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976), to the foster care\n\ncontext). Under this standard, to establish a constitutional violation, “it [must be]\n\nalleged . . . that the state officials were deliberately indifferent to the welfare of the\n\nchild.” Foltz, 370 F.3d at 1083 (internal quotation marks omitted). To put it\n\ndifferently, a constitutional violation occurs if the plaintiffs’ “injuries were\n\nproximately caused by the deliberate indifference of officials to known risks.”\n\nOmar v. Lindsey, 243 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1343 (M.D. Fla. 2003), aff’d on basis of\n\ndistrict court opinion, 334 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n       Because deliberate indifference requires a much higher standard of fault than\n\nmere or even gross negligence, see Bozeman v. Orum, 422 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th\n\nCir. 2005), the risk involved must be of sufficiently serious magnitude – a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm, which in this context denotes a “strong likelihood”\n\nof serious harm. See Cook v. Sheriff of Monroe County, 402 F.3d 1092, 1115\n\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f(11th Cir. 2005) (“[D]eliberate indifference requires that the defendant deliberately\n\ndisregard a strong likelihood rather than a mere possibility that the . . . harm will\n\noccur.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Stinson v. County of\n\nMontgomery, No. 07-15671, 2008 WL 2610762, at *5 (11th Cir. July 3, 2008)\n\n(unpublished) (noting that “mere general calls for staff assistance and assertion that\n\nC.P. was ‘messing with’ him were not enough to inform the Officers that [plaintiff]\n\nfaced a substantial risk of serious harm”).\n\n      Furthermore, the Supreme Court has expressly rejected “an objective test for\n\ndeliberate indifference” in favor of a subjective approach. Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 837, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1979, 128 L. Ed. 811 (1994). An official acts with\n\ndeliberate indifference only when he disregards a substantial risk of serious harm\n\n“of which he is actually aware.” Foltz, 370 F.3d at 1083 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S.\n\nat 836, 114 S. Ct. at 1978). It is not enough to show that an official is “aware of\n\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm exists”; “he must also draw the inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.\n\nCt. at 1979 (emphasis added); see also Burnette v. Taylor, No. 07-11061, 2008 WL\n\n2685678, at *4 (11th Cir. July 10, 2008) (“No liability arises under the\n\nConstitution for an official’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should\n\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\fhave perceived but did not . . . . As such, imputed or collective knowledge cannot\n\nserve as the basis for a claim of deliberate indifference. Each individual Defendant\n\nmust be judged separately and on the basis of what that person knows.”) (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Nor is it enough for a plaintiff to demonstrate a defendant’s subjective\n\nknowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm; the plaintiff must also show that\n\nwith that knowledge, the defendant nonetheless knowingly or recklessly\n\n“disregard[ed] that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.” Hale v.\n\nTallapoosa County, 50 F.3d 1579, 1583 (11th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844, 114 S. Ct. at 1982–83 (“[P]rison\n\nofficials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may be\n\nfound free from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm\n\nultimately was not averted.”). Implicit in that inquiry is the requirement that the\n\ndefendant must have known of feasible “means to cure that condition, so that a\n\nconscious, culpable refusal to prevent the harm can be inferred from the\n\ndefendant’s failure to prevent it.” LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1536 (11th\n\nCir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hale, 50 F.3d at 1583\n\n(“[U]nder this standard, a jury could reasonably find that [the defendant] failed to\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\ftake reasonable measures to abate a known risk of harm if the evidence showed\n\nthat he knew of ways to reduce the harm but knowingly declined to act, or that he\n\nknew of ways to reduce the harm but recklessly declined to act.”) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The court must remain mindful of the need to avoid\n\n“second-guessing the difficult choices that . . . officials must face and of\n\nimproperly extending deliberate indifference standards to mere inadvertence or\n\nerrors in good faith.” Hale, 50 F.3d at 1584 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Therefore, in order to establish deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must\n\nallege that the defendant had (1) subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm, and yet (2) disregarded that risk (3) “by conduct that is more than\n\nmere” or gross negligence. See McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th\n\nCir. 1999); Bozeman, 422 F.3d at 1272.61 In short, our task in this case is to\n\n61\n   Ray v. Foltz mistakenly cites McElligott as requiring a defendant to be “objectively aware of\na risk of serious harm.” 370 F.3d 1079, 1083 (11th Cir. 2004) (emphasis added). And this error\nappears to have been replicated by later decisions. See, e.g., Nichols v. Maynard, 204 Fed.\nAppx. 826, 828 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (noting that plaintiffs are required to allege that\nthe defendant “was objectively aware of a risk of serious harm.” (quoting Ray, 370 F.3d at 1083\n(citing McElligott, 182 F.3d at 1255))); Lavender v. Kearney, 206 Fed. Appx. 860, 863 (11th\nCir. 2006) (unpublished) (same); Maldonado v. Snead, 168 Fed. Appx. 373, 379 (11th Cir. 2006)\n(unpublished) (same). Though these decisions appear to apply the proper subjective test despite\nthis error, I hope that this discussion will add further clarity to this difficult area of the law.\n        To be sure, there is a related objective component to the standard; it would not be enough\nfor the defendant subjectively to believe his conduct created a substantial risk of serious harm, if\nin fact no such risk was created. The facts of which the defendant is subjectively aware must\nalso be such that “the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists.”\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1979, 128 L. Ed. 811 (1994) (emphasis\n\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fdetermine what each defendant actually knew prior to the alleged abuse and what\n\nactions he or she took in response to that knowledge.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       In the case at hand, the crux of our deliberate indifference analysis is\n\nwhether, prior to the alleged abuse reported on November 23, the defendant-\n\nofficial possessed subjective knowledge that the plaintiffs faced a substantial risk\n\nof child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home – the first prong of the\n\nMcElligott test. Only if the complaint sufficiently alleges, under our heightened\n\npleading standard, that the defendant possessed this actual awareness can we then\n\nevaluate the sufficiency of the actions he or she took in response – the second and\n\nadded); see also Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1030 (11th Cir. 2001) (“We conclude\nthat Plaintiffs adequately allege 1) an objective, substantial risk of serious harm to inmates\nexisted, 2) the Sheriff was subjectively aware of this risk . . . .”); Purcell v. Toombs County, 400\nF.3d 1313 (11th Cir. 2005) (finding that “[t]he record does not support Purcell’s contentions that\nthe conditions – bearing everything in mind – rose to the level of a substantial or sufficiently\nserious risk as opposed to some lesser risk of harm”) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is\nthis latter, objective inquiry that informed our disposition of Jorge T. v. Florida Department of\nChildren and Families, 250 Fed. Appx. 954 (11th Cir. 2007) (unpublished). In that case, Jorge\nT. brought a § 1983 claim against seven DCF employees after Julian, another foster child living\nin the home in which Jorge T. had been placed, sexually assaulted him in the home’s bathroom.\nId.. at 955. In determining whether the defendants were immune from suit, we put aside as\nirrelevant the plaintiff’s various allegations that “one DCF employee received reports that Jorge\nT. and his brother were not well-kept, were dirty and lacked proper care”; that “the defendants\nfailed to respond to various structural errors and a general increase in reports of abuse in the\nfoster care system”; and that “the defendants improperly screened Jorge T.’s foster mother’s\nbackground.” Id.. The only relevant and specific allegation was that “one of the seven\ndefendants knew that Julian had previously entered the bathroom [several times] when it was\noccupied by Jorge T.,” which we concluded was insufficient “to support the inference that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to Jorge T. existed.” Id. at 955–56.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fthird prongs of McElligott.\n\n      To guide this decision, I look to some of the cases that have addressed what\n\nconstitutes subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm. In other\n\nwords, what facts or circumstances must be pled in order to allege sufficiently that\n\nthe government official actually knew of a strong likelihood that future serious\n\nharm would befall the plaintiff? I first canvass cases in the foster care context, and\n\nthen consider the relevance of cases arising from the analogous context of\n\nprisoners and pretrial detainees.\n\n                                           1.\n\n      The cases that I review from the foster care context – both published and\n\nunpublished – all concern § 1983 suits filed by or on behalf of children against\n\nemployees of the DCF on the basis of abuse from their foster parents or other\n\nchildren in the foster homes. The complaint in Omar v. Lindsey, 243 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1339, 1343 (M.D. Fla. 2003), aff’d on basis of district court opinion, 334 F.3d\n\n1246 (11th Cir. 2003), easily satisfied the first prong of McElligott. In that case,\n\nthe plaintiff alleged that the defendants placed the child in an inappropriate foster\n\nhome and allowed him to be adopted by an abusive parent, resulting in a\n\n“childhood of unremitting and intense abuse.” Id. at 1342. In denying the\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fdefendants’ motion to dismiss, the court found that the foster child’s “repeated\n\nalleg[ations] that Defendants knew that Plaintiff was being egregiously abused” by\n\nhis foster mother constituted sufficient notice under the deliberate indifference\n\nanalysis. Id. at 1343.\n\n       Other than Lindsey, none of the remaining cases involved allegations that\n\nwere sufficient to satisfy McElligott’s requirement of subjective knowledge. Ray\n\nv. Foltz, 370 F.3d 1079 (11th Cir. 2004), which involved a child who had been\n\nneglected and abused by his foster parents, stands for the proposition that neither\n\nthe negligent failure to gather information that would have led to the discovery of\n\nadverse information about the foster parents,62 nor the negligent failure to follow\n\ncertain DCF guidelines and procedures,63 are sufficient to demonstrate deliberate\n\nindifference in the absence of allegations that the defendants actually knew of a\n\n\n\n62\n   In support of their deliberate indifference claim, plaintiffs allege that “the defendants failed to\ntake various actions that, if taken, would have led to the discovery of adverse information about\nthe [foster parents] and their fitness to serve as foster parents,” and “ignored certain adverse\ninformation about the [foster parents] and their fitness to serve as foster parents,” such as two\nprevious abuse reports in regards to another child. Foltz, 370 F.3d at 1084 & n.5.\n63\n   Plaintiffs allege that the defendant-officials “violated certain Department guidelines and\nprocedures in licensing the [foster] home, which both allowed [the child] to be placed in a\ndangerous environment for foster children, and aggravated the likelihood that he would be\nabused there,” Foltz, 370 F.3d at 1081, and also “failed to require the [foster parents] to\ncomplete certain training that might have produced more information about them and violated\nDepartment rules by placing too many children in that home.” Id. at 1084.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  43\n\fsubstantial risk of serious harm or “deliberately chose not to learn of the abuse.”\n\nId. at 1085.\n\n      In both Omar v. Babcock, 177 Fed. Appx. 59 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(unpublished), and Maldonado v. Snead, 168 Fed. Appx. 373 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(unpublished), there was no evidence that the defendants’ failure to draw the\n\ninference that the minor children were being abused “was anything other than an\n\nunfortunate miscue.” See Omar, 177 Fed. Appx. at 64. To establish that the\n\nofficials were on notice of a serious risk of abuse, the plaintiff in Omar presented\n\nevidence that after he was placed in the foster home, but before his adoption was\n\napproved by the Department, the suspicion of abuse was raised but later dismissed\n\nby the Department after a doctor found multiple “loop marks” on the plaintiff’s\n\nbody and was “concerned that these marks might have resulted from abuse.” Id. at\n\n61. Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that the officials were aware that he\n\ndisplayed evidence of various psychological problems and physical illness\n\nfollowing his placement. Id. at 61–64. These allegations were held to be an\n\ninsufficient predicate for a claim of deliberate indifference because “there was no\n\nevidence . . . that any of the [defendants] actually drew the inference that these\n\nfacts meant [the child] was being abused.” Id. at 63–64. The court in Maldonado\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\flikewise concluded that the evidence was too weak to support the allegation that\n\ndefendants were actually aware of the risk of harm to the plaintiff prior to her\n\ninjury. 168 Fed. Appx. at 383–85 (considering a sore which the child’s doctor\n\nconcluded was impetigo, rather than a cigarette burn; a cut described in an incident\n\nreport as a “small gash under left eye,” possibly caused accidentally from playing\n\nwith a toy; and a statement made by the aggressor after the child’s injury had\n\noccurred).\n\n      In Nichols v. Maynard, 204 Fed. Appx. 826 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished),\n\nin which a 5-year-old foster child was sexually abused by an older foster child, JK,\n\nwe concluded both that the defendants were not subjectively aware of a substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm, and that they did not recklessly disregard any such risk. The\n\ncomplaint made two allegations that were the focus of the court’s review. First, it\n\nalleged that the officials “deliberately and recklessly disregarded adverse\n\ninformation regarding JK’s background of sexually acting out and deliberately\n\nignored the obvious, serious risk of harm JK’s placement . . . presented to\n\n[plaintiff] and the other children in the foster home.” Id. at 828 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). In support of this allegation, the plaintiff asserted that the officials\n\nhad actual knowledge of the following facts: (1) “JK had sexually acted out in at\n\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\fleast five prior foster homes”; (2) “JK got into bed naked with one of his foster\n\nparents’ natural sons”; and (3) “JK had been sexually victimized numerous times in\n\nprior foster homes.” Id. at 828–29 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the\n\ncomplaint alleged that the defendants “deliberately violated their own department\n\nguidelines by placing JK, in an already overcrowded home, in a bedroom with\n\nyounger children.” Id. at 828.\n\n      Observing that “the records indicate that JK’s part in sexual abuse had been\n\nas a victim, not an aggressor,” we concluded that the alleged facts did not\n\ndemonstrate that the defendants were on notice of “any serious risk of harm to [the\n\n5-year-old child].” Id. at 829. Moreover, even assuming that the defendants had\n\nbeen aware of a substantial risk of serious harm, the allegations describing the\n\ndefendants’ actions showed that the defendants did not recklessly disregard that\n\nrisk through their conduct. Id. Three days after placing JK in the home, the\n\ndefendants had “informed the foster parents of JK’s history of being a sexual abuse\n\nvictim,” and that after the sexual abuse incident occurred months later, the\n\ndefendants “removed JK and conducted an investigation into the incident.” Id.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      In addition to our foster care decisions, prison cases are also instructive on\n\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fthe issue of notice because these decisions originally served as the theoretical\n\nunderpinnings of our decision in Taylor – which first recognized a child’s\n\nconstitutional right to physical safety and freedom from unnecessary harm while in\n\nfoster care. However, it is important to note a caveat that must be observed when\n\nconsidering these cases. Although we recognized in Taylor that foster homes are\n\nsufficiently “analogous” to penal institutions to support a § 1983 action, we\n\ncautioned that the contexts “are not parallel.” 818 F.2d at 796. We echoed the\n\nSecond Circuit’s earlier observations in Doe v. New York City Department of\n\nSocial Services, 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir. 1981):\n\n          There is a closer and firmer line of authority running from\n   superiors and subordinates within [a penal] institution than exists in\n   the foster care context, particularly in respect of the relationship\n   between agency personnel and the foster parent. [Prison]\n   administrators can readily call in subordinates for consultation. They\n   can give strict orders with reasonable assurance that their mandates\n   will be followed, and as added insurance other employees stationed in\n   proximity of the subordinates to whom orders are directed may be\n   instructed to monitor compliance.\n          By contrast, the [foster care agency] had to rely upon\n   occasional visits for its information gathering, and its relationship to\n   the foster family was less unequivocally hierarchical than is the case\n   with prison guards and a warden.\n\nId. at 142; see also Taylor, 818 F.2d at 796 (“Obviously, a closer relationship\n\nexists between superior officers, subordinate officers, and the inmates within a\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fprison than exists between a state agency, the foster parents, and the foster child in\n\na foster care setting. In a penal institution, all the persons involved are in close and\n\ndaily contact. Wardens and supervisors have the ability to daily monitor the\n\nactivities of subordinates as well as the effect of certain conduct upon inmates.”).64\n\nSimply put, it is the foster care parents, not DCF officials, who are comparable to\n\nthe prison warden and guards; the foster parents are the ones with primary\n\nresponsibility for the safety of the children. Certain DCF officials are more\n\nanalogous to officials in the Federal Bureau of Prisons whose posts are remote\n\nfrom the correctional facility. Based on this distinction, we asserted that “[t]he\n\nlack of proximity in the foster home [between the children and state officials] . . .\n\nsuggests that deliberate indifference is not as easily inferred or shown from a\n\nfailure to act.” Taylor, 818 F.2d at 796. Children in plaintiffs’ situation\n\nconsequently “will be faced with the difficult problem of showing actual\n\nknowledge of abuse or that agency personnel deliberately failed to learn what was\n\noccurring in the foster home.” Id.\n\n64\n   Furthermore, as noted by the partial dissent in Taylor, there are also normative pressures\nconstricting the supervisory role of officials in the foster care context that their counterparts in\nprisons do not face. “[T]o give the child a normal family environment, foster care officials\nunderstandably feel ‘constrained to respect the foster family’s autonomy and integrity[,] and\n[feel] pressured to minimize intrusiveness,’” a pressure that prison officials do not feel as “their\nrole is to monitor and control an inmate’s environment and activities on a day-to-day basis.\nConsequently, prison officials will normally have more information available to them about the\nconditions of an inmate’s confinement than officials overseeing foster care will have about the\nconditions of a foster home placement.” Taylor, 818 F.2d at 815 (Tjoflat, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (quoting Doe v. New York City Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 649 F.2d 134, 142\n(2d Cir. 1981)) (alterations in original).\n                                                   48\n\f       In view of this distinction, prison cases more effectively elucidate the kind\n\nof allegations that do not sufficiently allege subjective awareness on the part of\n\nstate officials in the foster care context, than those that do. To put it differently,\n\nallegations that fail to establish subjective awareness in the prison context are also\n\ngenerally insufficient to establish subjective awareness in the foster care context,\n\nbut allegations that properly allege subjective awareness in the prison context are\n\nnot necessarily adequate in the foster care context. With this in mind, I turn to the\n\nprison cases.\n\n       In Carter v. Galloway, 352 F.3d 1346 (11th Cir. 2003), an inmate asserted a\n\n§ 1983 claim for damages against prison officials for allowing him to remain in the\n\nsame cell as another inmate who subsequently attacked him. Id. at 1349. In\n\nfinding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the officials had “a subjective\n\nawareness of a substantial risk of serious physical threat,” id. at 1350, we were\n\nunpersuaded that the following allegations constituted sufficient notice: (1) the\n\nofficials “clearly knew” that the plaintiff’s cellmate was a “problem inmate” who\n\nhad “a well-documented history of prison disobedience and had been prone to\n\nviolence”; and (2) the officials had “specific notice” that the inmate was “act[ing]\n\ncrazy, roaming his cell like a caged animal,” was planning to fake a hanging in\n\n\n\n\n                                            49\n\forder to be transferred to the medical prison, and had informed the plaintiff that he\n\nwould have to help with the fake hanging “one way or another.” Id. at 1349.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We explained that “before Defendants’\n\nawareness arises to a sufficient level of culpability, there must be much more than\n\nmere awareness of [the inmate]’s generally problematic nature”; “the prison\n\nofficial must be aware of specific facts from which an inference could be drawn\n\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists – and the prison official must also\n\ndraw that inference.” Id. (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe observed that although the plaintiff had complained to the defendants many\n\ntimes about his cellmate’s “crazy” actions, the “Plaintiff never told [the\n\ndefendants] that Plaintiff feared [his cellmate] or that [his cellmate] clearly\n\nthreatened Plaintiff.” Id. In short:\n\n      Defendants only possessed an awareness of [the attacker’s] propensity\n      for being a problematic inmate; to find Defendants sufficiently\n      culpable would unduly reduce awareness to a more objective standard,\n      rather than the required subjective standard set by the Supreme Court.\n      Such a generalized awareness of risk in these circumstances does not\n      satisfy the subjective awareness requirement.\n\nId. at 1350; see also id. (noting that the defendant-official remained “unaware of a\n\nparticularized threat or fear felt by Plaintiff in regards to rooming with [the\n\naggressor],” and that allegations of “a generalized awareness of risk” are\n\n\n\n\n                                           50\n\finsufficient to meet the subjective awareness requirement) (emphasis added).\n\n       In Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014 (11th Cir. 2001) (en banc), two\n\nformer inmates brought a § 1983 suit against the county and sheriff to recover for\n\ninjuries they sustained when assaulted by other prisoners, alleging that the\n\nconditions at the jail posed a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates,\n\nspecifically the risk of inmate-on-inmate attacks. Id. at 1023–24. Amidst the\n\nparade of horribles presented in the complaint, we focused on certain allegations\n\nthat indicated the inmates had ready access to makeshift weapons fashioned “by\n\ncannibalizing parts of the decaying building”; that the guards were unable to lock\n\ndown the free-roaming inmates because the locks to cell doors did not work; and\n\nthat there was no visual or audio surveillance of inmates – indeed, “jailers were\n\nafraid to conduct visual inspections.” Id. at 1024–25, 1028. Consequently, the\n\ninmates, who were mostly housed on the second floor of the building, had no\n\n“means to contact guards other than by screaming or banging on the walls.” Id. at\n\n1025.65 In support of their deliberate indifference claim against the sheriff in her\n\n65\n   The complaint also alleged that the prisoners “were not screened for mental health, medical\nconditions or conflicts with other prisoners before entering the Jail”; once inside, “there was no\nsegregation of nonviolent inmates from violent inmates, pretrial detainees from convicted\ncriminals, juveniles from adults, or inmates with mental disorders from those without mental\ndisorders”; “the Jail was routinely understaffed,” with often only one jailer on duty at a time;\n“prisoners were not disciplined or segregated when they attempted to escape, threatened jailers,\ndestroyed property or assaulted other inmates”; and “no head counts of prisoners were made to\n\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\findividual capacity, the plaintiffs alleged that the sheriff was subjectively aware of\n\nthe risk and offered evidence that she was provided with (1) “faultfinding,\n\ninspection reports by state agencies, reports outlining the conditions that existed at\n\nthe Jail”; (2) “many complaints from prisoners and requests for assistance”; (3)\n\n“correspondence from prisoners’ lawyers detailing the staffing problems and\n\nwarning of a ‘serious threat to the safety of inmates’”; and (4) “a lawsuit filed in\n\nthe district court [prior to the attacks], seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on\n\nbehalf of the inmates at the Jail.” Id. at 1029. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat the dangerous conditions at the jail were “longstanding and pervasive.” Id. In\n\nlight of these allegations, we held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pled that the\n\nsheriff was “subjectively aware of the substantial risk to inmate safety at the Jail.”\n\nId.\n\n       What I discern from Marsh is that the alleged prison conditions and the\n\nnotice provided to the defendant were of such a nature that the inference that the\n\ndefendant subjectively knew of a substantial risk of inmate-on-inmate attack was\n\ninescapable. In other words, “a substantial risk of inmate attacks was\n\nlongstanding, pervasive, well-documented, [and] expressly noted by prison\n\n\n\nmake sure they were all accounted for.” Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1029.\n\n\n\n\n                                              52\n\fofficials in the past, and the circumstances suggest[ed] that [the defendant] had\n\nbeen exposed to information concerning the risk and thus must have known about\n\nit” – not merely that “a reasonable person would have known, or that the defendant\n\nshould have known.” See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, 843 & n.8, 114 S. Ct. at 1981,\n\n1982 & n.8 (emphases added and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50 F.3d 1579 (11th Cir. 1995), dealt with an\n\ninmate’s civil rights action against the county, sheriff, and jailer after he was\n\nbeaten by other inmates while being held in a group cell. Id. at 1580. The plaintiff\n\nsought damages due to the defendants’ alleged deliberate indifference to the\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm that he faced while in their custody. Id. With\n\nrespect to the sheriff, the plaintiff offered affidavits, depositions, and other\n\nevidence to support a finding that the sheriff “subjectively knew that a substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm existed at the jail.” Id. at 1583. Specifically, among other\n\nthings, the plaintiff pointed to the sheriff’s deposition where he testified that “he\n\nknew that inmate-on-inmate violence was occurring on a regular basis during [the\n\ntime period of the attack] and other periods of overcrowding” and also that “he\n\nknew the violence sometimes resulted in injuries requiring medical treatment.” Id.\n\n(emphases added). We further noted that the plaintiff was not required to show\n\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\fthat the sheriff “knew precisely who would attack whom, but only that [he] had\n\nsubjective knowledge of a generalized, substantial risk of serious harm from\n\ninmate violence.” Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Based on\n\nthese allegations, we found that the evidence would sufficiently allow a reasonable\n\njury to conclude that the plaintiff had satisfied the notice standard. Id. at 1585.\n\n                                           3.\n\n      Informed by the deliberate indifference case law, I reach several\n\nconclusions. First, allegations that the official actually knew that the plaintiff was\n\nbeing abused satisfy the subjective knowledge standard. Second, allegations that\n\nthe official missed or misread warning signs that the plaintiff was in danger, or\n\nallegations that the officials failed to follow established departmental guidelines or\n\nprocedures are tantamount to allegations of negligence, and are insufficient to\n\nestablish subjective knowledge of a strong likelihood of serious harm. And third,\n\nallegations that an official was aware of the risk to others created by an\n\nindividual’s generally violent or troubled history are likewise insufficient. As we\n\nnoted in Purcell v. Toombs County, 400 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2005), “[i]n\n\nthe jail setting, a risk of harm to some degree always exists by the nature of its\n\nbeing a jail.” Cf. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845, 114 S. Ct. at 1983 (noting due regard\n\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\ffor the fact that prison officials are appointed the “unenviable task of keeping\n\ndangerous men in safe custody under humane conditions” (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)). That is why we held in Carter v. Galloway that even in the\n\ninsular context of the prison community, “before [defendant-officials’] awareness\n\narises to a sufficient level of culpability, there must be much more than mere\n\nawareness of [the aggressor’s] generally problematic nature,” proclivity to\n\nviolence, or “propensity for being a problematic inmate.” 352 F.3d at 1349–50\n\n(emphasis added). The same holds true in the foster care context. The children\n\nwho have been removed from their homes, detained, adjudicated dependents, and\n\nthen placed into foster care are, almost by definition, “at risk” or “troubled.”66\n\nOfficials must have specific notice of something “much more” than that they are\n\nworking with inherently “at risk” children before they are considered to be\n\nsubjectively aware of a substantial risk of serious harm.\n\n       Indeed, a rule that specific knowledge of a child’s prior history of sexual\n\naggression is alone sufficient to constitute actual notice that the child poses a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm would be particularly ill-advised in the foster care\n\ncontext. It would effectively substitute our own judgment for the professional\n\n66\n   See supra note 2. According to plaintiffs’ complaint, “approximately 80% of the children\ncoming into foster care had significant emotional and/or behavioral problems with 27% having a\nhistory of sexual abuse.” Compl. ¶ 56.\n\n\n\n\n                                              55\n\fjudgment of DCF officials. For example, when approving an overcapacity waiver,\n\nthe Licensing Manual requires five specific officials to consider a multitude of\n\nfactors, including the suitability of the home for the particular needs of the child,\n\nthe effect on the quality of care, and the needs of the other children already in the\n\nhome.67 Such a rule would unduly constrict the latitude an official would otherwise\n\nhave to determine that, upon consideration of the factors and the specific history of\n\nthe child, a therapeutic setting such as the Calhoun home – where there had been\n\nno reported incidents of child-on-child sexual abuse for the six years before the\n\nNovember 23, 1998 report – is an appropriate placement that would not pose a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.68\n\n\n67\n     See supra text accompanying note 35.\n68\n   Risk is not a fixed quantity; context modulates the magnitude of the risk. See Gish v.\nThomas, 516 F.3d 952, 954–55 (11th Cir. 2008) (“To be deliberately indifferent to a strong\nlikelihood that the prisoner will commit suicide, the official must be subjectively aware that the\ncombination of the prisoner’s suicidal tendencies and the feasibility of suicide in the context of\nthe prisoner’s surroundings creates a strong likelihood that the prisoner will commit suicide.”).\nTrained professionals such as DCF officials are better equipped to navigate the complex inquiry\nof which home, with which foster parents, and with which other foster children will best mediate\nthe risk posed by a particular child with a so-called “history of sexual perpetration.” As the\ncomplaint itself evidences, the classification of a particular child as a “sexual abuse perpetrator”\nas opposed to a “sexual abuse victim” is not always clear-cut. One could also believe that a\nchild who has committed an isolated incident of sexual assault might not always be regarded by\na trained professional as a sexual abuse perpetrator or a child posing a substantial risk of sexual\nabuse to any other child he or she might encounter. Group dynamics, the experience and training\nof foster parents, the age and characteristics of the sexual abuse perpetrators, and the age and\ncharacteristics of the other children in the home are also significant considerations; certainly a\nchild might pose a risk to one child in a given context and yet not another.\n\n\n\n\n                                                56\n\f      The deliberate indifference standard is compatible with a degree of\n\ndeference to such good-faith professional determinations. Because the deliberate\n\nindifference analysis involves a subjective test, it does not matter if other judges,\n\nsocial workers, therapists, etc. believe that the plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm if the defendants themselves do not share that belief – that is, they\n\n“must also draw the inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S. Ct. at 1979; cf. id.\n\nat 844, 114 S. Ct. at 1983 (“Prison officials charged with deliberate indifference\n\nmight show . . . that they knew the underlying facts but believed (albeit unsoundly)\n\nthat the risk to which the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.”).\n\nReceiving an isolated warning is not the same as believing the contents of that\n\nwarning. For example, the weatherman may advise us that there is a high\n\nprobability of precipitation, but we may look outside, make our own observations,\n\nand draw our own conclusions that the weatherman – though an “expert” – is\n\nwrong; we believe that rain is very unlikely. While we may or may not be\n\nnegligent, we would certainly not be deliberately indifferent to the risk that it will\n\nrain. The same principle applies a fortiori in this context: we are dealing not with\n\nlay persons receiving advice from experts, but with trained experts in child welfare,\n\nDCF officials, receiving and evaluating advice from persons of varying degrees of\n\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\fexperience.\n\n      In addition to these observations, it is important to bear in mind the potential\n\nsources of notice in our case. In other words, an official’s subjective belief about\n\nthe safety of the children in the Calhoun home would have been formed on the\n\nbasis of numerous sources of information: Mr. Calhoun and Joann Calhoun; G.\n\nBrock, the Calhouns’ son; GALs; family members (or those entitled to visit the\n\nfoster child); people in the community (e.g., teachers, doctors, dentists, therapists,\n\ncoaches, friends from school, parents of friends); the circuit judges presiding over\n\ndependency proceedings; other Department employees, especially the caseworkers\n\nassigned to the foster children; and the foster children themselves.\n\n                                           V.\n\n      Although the complaint alleges that M.M. and D.L. began to engage in\n\nsexual activities with other children soon after their placement, there is no\n\nallegation that any of the defendants, the Department, or even the Calhouns ever\n\nhad actual knowledge that these acts were occurring at any time before November\n\n23, 1998, the day that sexual abuse of A.P. was reported to the hotline. Therefore,\n\nthe question is whether the complaint sufficiently alleges that each defendant knew\n\nthat plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of such abuse in the home prior to\n\n\n\n\n                                           58\n\fNovember 23. I conclude that it does not.\n\n                                                A.\n\n         Before embarking on a defendant-by-defendant review of the allegations, I\n\npause to survey plaintiffs’ 265-page complaint against the backdrop of the legal\n\nlandscape. I discern several key features common to all of the defendants. First,\n\nthere is no allegation that any of the defendants turned renegade and acted\n\nunilaterally in licensing the Calhoun home or approving any of the overcapacity\n\nwaivers. The officials worked together – not in ad hoc teams, but in designated\n\nteams composed of five specific members of the Department so as to ensure that\n\nthe outcome would be the product of a collective decision-making process\n\naccording to Department protocol, with inherent checks and balances. Nor is there\n\nany allegation that the defendants who were involved in the waiver process failed\n\nto consider the requisite criteria set forth in the Licensing Manual. In the absence\n\nof a specific allegation to the contrary, therefore, I presume that the defendant-\n\nofficials acted in accordance with the law and that each overcapacity waiver was\n\napproved after each official had mentally performed the multifactor analysis\n\ndescribed above.69 Cf. Cont’l Bank & Trust Co. v. Brandon, 297 F.2d 928, 932\n\n\n\n69\n     See supra text accompanying notes 35–37.\n\n\n\n\n                                                59\n\f(5th Cir. 1962) (“[I]t is a presumption of law that a public officer will faithfully\n\nperform his duty.”); Tecom, Inc. v. United States, 66 Fed. Cl. 736, 762 (Fed. Cl.\n\n2005) (noting that although the presumption of regularity does not entail clear and\n\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, “the burden of proving the non-occurrence of\n\npredicate acts required (by law or regulation) of public officials (such as the\n\nconsidering of certain facts, the review of applications, the receipt of\n\nauthorizations, etc.) falls on the party asserting their absence”).\n\n      Additionally, plaintiffs do not allege that any of the caseworkers\n\ncommunicated falsehoods, failed to report important information, or otherwise\n\nconcealed information from their supervisors or other units. This fact is\n\nparticularly significant, as there is no allegation that D.L. was not visited regularly\n\nin the Calhoun home by either Desmangles or by Wilburn – indeed, Wilburn also\n\nmade contemporaneous visits to R.M. and N.M., and there is no allegation that\n\nWilburn was aware of any child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. Nor\n\nis there any allegation that Pollack failed to visit M.M. regularly from the time of\n\nhis placement in March through August 1997. While plaintiffs allege that Pollack\n\nonly visited D.L. once from February 27 to May 5, 1998, and only visited M.M.\n\nonce from May 5 to September 1998, there is no allegation that her report of\n\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\finformation gathered from those visits was deficient in any way. Every official\n\ninvolved in the licensing or waiver approval process was therefore privy to what\n\nthe caseworkers knew and reported about the Calhoun home and the foster children\n\nliving there.\n\n       Finally, in reviewing the complaint, I remain cognizant of the factual\n\nimplications of plaintiffs’ allegations – that is, what plaintiffs do not allege is\n\nalmost as important as what they do allege. By the time the Home by Home\n\nReview report was issued on September 8, 1998, M.M. and D.L. had been living in\n\nthe Calhoun home for approximately 19 and 17 months, respectively. Presumably,\n\nthe last reported incidents of sexual assault involving M.M. and D.L. were even\n\nmore distant – occurring some time before January 1997 and April 1997,\n\nrespectively. Consistent with the Calhoun home’s track record, no one had ever\n\nreported that sexual abuse was occurring in the home – not any of the Calhouns;\n\nnot any of the caseworkers assigned to the children; not any of the children’s\n\nGALs; not any doctors or therapists or other community members such as teachers,\n\nfriends, or coaches; not any of the circuit judges handling dependency proceedings;\n\nand not any of the children themselves. Significantly, N.M. was one of the foster\n\nchildren who was interviewed in the Home by Home Review; he gave no\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\findication that he was being sexually abused in any fashion, only that everyone\n\nwas “mean to him.” Nothing in the review of the Calhoun home – none of the\n\ninterviews of the children that were conducted, none of the records that were\n\ninspected – indicated that anything sexually untoward was occurring in the home.\n\nThis same configuration of facts was in place for all of the defendants until the\n\nreport of A.P.’s abuse was made to the hotline on November 23, 1998.\n\n      What this survey reveals is that plaintiffs’ allegations boil down to\n\naccusations of negligent wrongdoing on the part of the defendants: that the\n\ndefendants failed to perform the requisite visits to foster children; that they failed\n\nto process overcapacity waivers on time; that they failed to investigate the home\n\nfurther; that they failed to take adequate measures to reduce overcrowding and\n\nimprove supervision; or that reasonable officials would have reviewed the\n\navailable information and come to a different conclusion about the strength of the\n\nrisk of sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. A number of plaintiffs’ allegations\n\nappear to disregard the reality of collective decision-making within the\n\norganizational hierarchy of the Department – the reality of officials assigned to\n\nspecific units and making joint decisions according to specific protocol – and fault\n\n\n\n\n                                           62\n\fthe defendants for failing to act unilaterally.70 Nevertheless, because even gross\n\nnegligence does not satisfy the standard of deliberate indifference, such allegations\n\nare insufficient as a matter of law to support claims for damages against the\n\ndefendants.\n\n                                                B.\n\n       I begin with the claims against the two defendants who occupied supervisory\n\npositions, Edward Feaver, Secretary of the Department, and Johnny Brown,\n\nDistrict Administrator of District 10, and recite the presumed facts and reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom on which those claims are based. I then proceed to the\n\nremaining defendants who occupied positions at varying levels in the Department.\n\n                                               1.\n\n\n\n70\n   For example, plaintiffs make conclusory allegations that defendants at all levels in the\nDepartment’s chain of command had “the ability, authority and the means” to remove or to\ndirect the removal of children from the Calhoun home: Feaver (Secretary of the Department),\nBrown (District Administrator), Kaufman (as Acting Child Welfare Director), Chang (as POA of\nLicensing and Placement), Kanaskie (as POA of Protective Investigations), Woodroof (as POA\nof “re-licensing and foster care”), Worsley (both as a Protective Investigator and as a Foster Care\nSupervisor), Andrews (as a Licensing Supervisor), Desmangles (Family Services Counselor),\nPollack (Family Services Counselor), and Wilburn (Family Services Counselor). The complaint\nimplicitly alleges, therefore, that each of the defendants had the ability to act out of the\nDepartment’s chain of command. Or put another way, the complaint alleges that there was no\neffective chain of command when it came to the removal of children from foster homes, as\nanyone – from the Secretary of the Department to the caseworker in the home – had “the ability,\nauthority and the means” to do so independently. Even assuming each of the defendants had\nsuch authority, however, plaintiffs’ allegations fall short of demonstrating deliberate\nindifference.\n\n\n\n\n                                                63\n\f      As Secretary of the Department, Feaver supervised all fifteen service\n\ndistricts. He was privy to numerous internal studies and reviews, media reports,\n\nand warnings from advocacy groups and the circuit judges who presided over\n\ndependency proceedings, stating that District 10’s foster homes were seriously\n\novercrowded and that children with histories of sexual abuse, both as victims and\n\nas perpetrators, were being placed in these overcrowded homes, increasing the risk\n\nof child-on-child sexual abuse. Among these reports was the September 8, 1998\n\nreport of the Home by Home Review.\n\n      Feaver first learned of the child-on-child sexual abuse at the Calhoun home\n\non November 23, 1998, after someone called the Department’s abuse prevention\n\nhotline to report that A.P. had been sexually abused by other children living in the\n\nhome. A.P., N.M., and R.M. were removed from the Calhoun home within a day.\n\nAn investigation of the Calhoun home followed immediately, resulting in the\n\nformulation and implementation of a plan to curtail further child-on-child sexual\n\nabuse at the home. The plan prescribed the steps that needed to be taken to\n\neliminate the problem, and Feaver relied on the District 10 administrators to ensure\n\nthat those steps were taken.\n\n      These facts fall short of establishing that Feaver was deliberately indifferent\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\fto a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse facing the children living in the\n\nCalhoun home. While Feaver certainly was aware of a heightened system-wide\n\nrisk of child-on-child sexual abuse due to overcrowding and improper placement,\n\nthere are no allegations that he possessed specific knowledge about a substantial\n\nrisk of sexual abuse in the Calhoun home prior to A.P.’s report of abuse on\n\nNovember 23, 1998. Feaver’s receipt of the Home by Home Review report\n\nestablishes, at most, that the Calhoun home was overcrowded during this time – the\n\nreport contained no allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse. The facts alleged in\n\nthe complaint simply do not permit the inference that Feaver actually knew of a\n\nsubstantial risk to the plaintiffs and yet did nothing.71 The district court therefore\n\ndid not err in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims against him.\n\n                                                2.\n\n       Johnny Brown served as Administrator of District 10 from August 1997 to\n\nDecember 1998. In that capacity, he oversaw the operation of the District’s foster\n\nhome service. In July 1998, after having been informed by subordinates of child-\n\n71\n   The inference reasonably drawn from facts recited in the complaint is that the problems in\nDistrict 10 resulted from the Department’s system-wide institutional failures. As the court\nobserved in Foltz, such institutional failures can serve to negate an inference that specific\nindividuals supervising or employed in the system are deliberately indifferent – the failures\nbeing attributed to the system as a whole. Ray v. Foltz, 370 F.3d 1079, 1085 n.9 (11th Cir.\n2004). It was the failure of the system as a whole that enabled the plaintiffs in Ward to obtain\nthe injunctive relief the district court ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                                65\n\fon-child sexual abuse in the District’s foster homes, Brown developed a “Draft\n\nDistrict 10 Family Support and Preservation Child Welfare Improvement Plan.”\n\nThe plan proposed sweeping reforms, including “(1) a thorough case review for\n\neach child reported to have been abused or neglected, (2) a revised incident\n\nreporting system tracked by a Department Specialist with mandatory reporting to\n\nlicensing, foster care, and circuit judges . . . and (6) a plan to significantly increase\n\nfoster homes and decrease the number of children in each home.” Omnibus Order\n\nat 16. The plan was implemented, but not adequately. Some incidents of child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse went unreported,72 and the District’s response to those that were\n\nreported was frequently inadequate. Brown did not cause the under-reporting,\n\nhowever; nor did he have knowledge of any failures by his subordinates adequately\n\nto respond to the incidents of abuse that were reported.\n\n       On September 8, 1998, Brown, like Feaver, received the findings of the\n\nHome by Home Review which included descriptions of overcrowding in the\n\nCalhoun home and the sexual perpetration histories of D.L. and M.M., but did not\n\ncontain any allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. And\n\nhe, like Feaver, first learned of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home on\n\n72\n   I infer from this fact that, whether through negligence or through deliberate disregard, some\nincidents of child-on-child sexual abuse went either unperceived or unreported by foster parents,\ncaseworkers, GALs, circuit judges, community members, etc.\n\n\n\n\n                                               66\n\fNovember 23, 1998. As District 10 Administrator, Brown was ultimately\n\nresponsible for the subsequent investigation and the plan that was devised to\n\nremedy the sexual abuse problem in the Calhoun home. However, he had no\n\ninvolvement in implementing the plan, for he left his employment with the\n\nDepartment in early December 1998. As the facts do not permit an inference that\n\nBrown was aware of and disregarded a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual\n\nabuse in the Calhoun home, the court committed no error in absolving Brown of\n\nliability by dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims against him.\n\n                                            3.\n\n         Katherine Kaufman was POA of Protective Investigations and later served as\n\nthe Acting Child Welfare Director in District 10.73 Plaintiffs allege that Kaufman\n\nfailed to direct the removal of M.M. and D.L. from the Calhoun home. Plaintiffs\n\nalso allege that in October 1998, Kaufman was one of the Department officials\n\nwho participated in the approval of overcapacity waivers that permitted two\n\nsiblings, N.O. and J.O., to be placed in the Calhoun home, bringing to ten the total\n\nnumber of foster children living in the Calhoun home.\n\n         Plaintiffs indicate two sources of notice as demonstrative of subjective\n\n\n\n73\n     The complaint does not allege when Kaufman became Acting Child Welfare Director.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 67\n\fknowledge on Kaufman’s part. First, in January 1997, M.M. had been removed\n\nfrom his natural mother’s home and involuntarily committed to a psychiatric\n\nfacility after having threatened his mother and sister. While he was still in the\n\nhospital, the Department received a report that M.M. had sexually assaulted his\n\nsister repeatedly. It was at this time that Kaufman – as POA of Protective\n\nInvestigations – allegedly learned of M.M.’s case, as she sought unsuccessfully to\n\nplace M.M. in a residential psychiatric facility.74 Upon release from the hospital,\n\nM.M. was returned to his mother’s home and was offered in-home therapeutic\n\nservices.\n\n       Second, in September 1998, Kaufman – now the Acting Child Welfare\n\nDirector – allegedly received a copy of the report of the Home by Home Review.\n\nIn response, she established a Special Review Team to address any concerns\n\nhighlighted in the report through the creation of Corrective Action Plans for each\n\nfoster home.\n\n       Such facts as these cannot establish subjective knowledge of a substantial\n\n\n\n74\n   The district court read ¶¶ 165–66 of the complaint to allege that Kaufman received this report\nwhile M.M. “was living in the Calhoun home,” and that she “did not remove M.M. from the\nCalhoun Home” at that time. Omnibus Order at 39. Upon perusal of the complaint, however, it\nis clear that the plaintiffs allege that M.M. was still in the psychiatric facility at the time\nKaufman was informed of his behavior, and that he was returned to his natural mother’s home\nupon release.\n\n\n\n\n                                               68\n\frisk of sexual abuse to the children in the Calhoun home. Kaufman first learned of\n\nM.M.’s sexual history while he was residing in a psychiatric facility, not in the\n\nCalhoun home. As with Feaver and Brown, the report of the Home by Home\n\nReview informed Kaufman of a generalized risk of harm due to overcrowding in\n\nthe Calhoun home, and indicated that D.L. and M.M. had a history of sexual and\n\nphysical aggression – the kind of notice of a general propensity-to-harm that fails\n\nto establish subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm even in the\n\nprison context, because it is devoid of “specific facts” relating to a “particularized\n\nthreat” to the plaintiffs and establishes, at best, a “generalized awareness of risk.”\n\nSee Carter v. Galloway, 352 F.3d 1346, 1349–50 (11th Cir. 2003 (noting that such\n\ninformation “does not provide a sufficient basis to make the inferential leap that a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm” existed”); see also Nichols v. Maynard, 204 Fed.\n\nAppx. 826, 828–29 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished). In other words, this kind of\n\ninformation might give rise to awareness of a possibility of sexual abuse in the\n\nCalhoun home, but it falls short of permitting the inference that Kaufman was\n\nactually aware of a strong likelihood of sexual abuse. These basic facts remained\n\nunchanged by the time Kaufman participated in the approval of the overcapacity\n\nwaiver for siblings N.O. and J.O. a month later, in October 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                           69\n\f       Kaufman’s first actual notice of an incident of child-on-child sexual abuse\n\ncame on November 23, 1998. On that day, she was the “On Call Administrator”\n\nfielding calls on the abuse prevention hotline, and she received the call regarding\n\nA.P. The caller described A.P.’s allegations – that he was being raped twice a day\n\nand that M.M. was the main perpetrator. Kaufman attended the hearing held in\n\ncircuit court the next day and represented to the court that A.P.’s allegations were\n\nbeing investigated.\n\n       The district court dismissed the claims of A.P., N.M., and R.M. against\n\nKaufman, noting that they were removed from the Calhoun home “just one day\n\nafter Kaufman learned of A.P.’s sexual abuse allegations,” and that “she could not\n\nhave [had] subjective knowledge of sexual abuse allegations at the time they\n\nsuffered their injuries.” Omnibus Order at 42. I would affirm the dismissal.\n\n                                                4.\n\n       Corinne Millikan was a Family Services Specialist and Operations\n\nManagement Consultant75 in District 10 at some point during the time relevant to\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations. As such, she had the authority to review and monitor the\n\nquality and safety of placements. Plaintiffs fault Millikan for her involvement in\n\n75\n  I remain largely in the dark as to the role of an Operations Management Consultant. The\ncomplaint provides no separate description of Millikan’s responsibilities in this role. Compl. ¶\n18. Nor do plaintiffs allege when Millikan served in each position.\n\n\n\n\n                                                70\n\fthe approval of overcapacity waivers that permitted certain children to live in the\n\nCalhoun home, specifically A.P., R.M., and children with mental health problems. 67\n\n       Like the other defendants in this case, Millikan was aware that many of the\n\nDistrict’s foster homes were overcrowded and that the presence of children with\n\nhistories of sexual abuse, both as perpetrators and victims, created a generalized\n\nrisk of child-on-child sexual abuse. Her duties, which did not bring her into day-\n\nto-day contact with the children in foster care, included participating in the\n\napproval of overcapacity waivers and creating Corrective Action Plans following\n\nthe Home by Home Review.\n\n       Millikan was aware of overcrowding in the Calhoun home as early as\n\nJanuary 31, 1995, when she attended a licensing meeting where the home’s\n\nconsistent overcrowding was discussed. In June 1996, she attended a District 10\n\n76\n   It is unclear from the complaint who else was involved in the approval of overcapacity\nwaivers for A.P. and R.M. In the absence of specific allegations to the contrary, I presume that\nthe other participants included a Licensing Supervisor, Placement Supervisor, POA of Licensing\nand Placement, and the Child Welfare Director, and that they followed the decision-making\nprotocol set out in the Licensing Manual.\n         The complaint also alleges that on December 10, 1998, Millikan participated in the\napproval of a waiver placing another child, B.J., in the Calhoun home. It is clear from the\ncomplaint, however, that this particular B.J. is not the same B.J. who is earlier described in the\ncomplaint as having been identified as“a danger to himself and others”; that particular B.J.\nresided in the Calhoun home “until April, 1998 when he turned eighteen.” Compl. ¶ 102. The\nallegation that Millikan approved the placement of another child with the same initials on\nDecember 10, 1998 – over two weeks after all of the plaintiffs had been removed from the\nCalhoun home – cannot support a finding of subjective knowledge and deliberate disregard of a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiffs prior to November 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                                71\n\fmeeting discussing a report of domestic violence in the Calhoun home, wherein\n\nMr. Calhoun had chased Joann Calhoun while brandishing a steak knife. Nearly\n\ntwo years later, in September 1998, Millikan received the report of the Home by\n\nHome Review, which described the Calhoun home as “cramped” and noted that\n\ntwo children with histories of sexual perpetration, D.L. and M.M., had been placed\n\nin that home. At no time during this period was there ever any report of sexual\n\nabuse in the Calhoun home. As part of the Special Review Team, Millikan assisted\n\nin drafting specifically tailored Corrective Action Plans for each of the 50 homes\n\nsurveyed by the Review. Shortly thereafter, Millikan was one of the officials who\n\nparticipated in the approval of belated overcapacity waivers permitting the\n\nplacement of A.P. and R.M. in the Calhoun home.\n\n      Though Millikan might have interpreted the information she had to mean\n\nthat the children in the Calhoun home faced a generalized risk of sexual assault,\n\nthere are no allegations that, prior to the November 23, 1998 report of A.P.’s\n\nabuse, Millikan was aware of specific facts or a “particularized threat” of sexual\n\nabuse from which she could have inferred that the children faced a strong\n\nlikelihood of sexual abuse. See Carter, 352 F.3d at 1350. Indeed, by the time the\n\nreport of the Home by Home Review was issued, M.M. and D.L. had lived in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\foften overcrowded Calhoun home for 19 and 17 months with no reports of sexual\n\nabuse; and by the time that Millikan participated in the waiver approvals, A.P. and\n\nR.M. had resided in the Calhoun home for nearly two weeks and five months,\n\nrespectively, without any reported incident. As it turned out, the conclusion that\n\nA.P. and R.M. did not face a substantial risk of sexual abuse may have been\n\nwrong; but Monday morning quarterbacking alone is insufficient to support a\n\ndamages claim against Millikan.\n\n         The report of A.P.’s abuse in November 1998 was the first specific notice\n\nMillikan received that a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse existed in\n\nthe Calhoun home. For this reason, the district court concluded that with respect to\n\nthe claims of A.P., N.M., and R.M., the facts failed to establish a case of deliberate\n\nindifference. I find no error in the court’s ruling.\n\n                                                 5.\n\n         Sharon Woodroof was a District 10 Family Services Specialist who worked\n\nwith the Licensing Unit and Placement Unit.77 Plaintiffs also allege that at some\n\n77\n     As a Family Services Specialist, Woodroof had the authority to\n\n         1) assist district staff with program planning and development; 2) provide\n         ongoing technical assistance in her area(s) of expertise; 3) monitor the provision\n         of services to children in her area(s) of expertise; 4) perform quality assurance\n         reviews; 5) ensure that policy guidance was available and understandable to direct\n         services and support staff; 6) review and approve allowable exceptions to policy,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 73\n\flater point – I presume in the latter half of 1997 or 1998 – Woodroof became a\n\nPOA supervising “re-licensing and foster care,” 78 in which capacity they allege she\n\nhad the ability “to direct the removal of a child from any foster home placement in\n\nwhich there was a substantial risk of serious harm to the child.” Compl. ¶ 16.\n\n       A.P., R.M., and N.M. allege that Woodroof acted in a deliberately\n\nindifferent manner through the following actions she undertook as a Family\n\nServices Specialist in collaboration with Licensing and Placement: (1) on May 19,\n\n1995, participating in the increase of the Calhoun home’s licensed capacity to five\n\nchildren; (2) in February 1997, participating in the approval of an overcapacity\n\nwaiver that allowed certain children, including M.M., to be placed in the Calhoun\n\nhome; (3) on February 21, 1997, participating in the approval of an overcapacity\n\nwaiver allowing R.B. (described by plaintiffs as a “fire setter and sexual abuser”)\n\nto be placed in the Calhoun home; (4) in April 1997, participating in the approval\n\n\n       including waivers of maximum licensed foster home capacity; 7) deny exceptions\n       to policy and/or waivers of capacity which placed children at substantial risk of\n       serious harm; and 8) ensure that children who posed a known substantial risk of\n       harming other children were not placed in situations where they were in a position\n       to harm other children.\n\nCompl. ¶ 15.\n78\n   The allegation that Woodroof was a POA supervising both the Foster Care Unit and the\nLicensing Unit is contrary to my understanding of the organizational structure of DCF as\ndescribed in the complaint. Nonetheless, I assume for purposes of the defendants’ motions to\ndismiss that such was the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                              74\n\fof an overcapacity waiver that allowed D.L. to be placed in the Calhoun home; and\n\n(5) on May 19, 1997, approving the re-licensing of the Calhoun home for seven\n\nfoster children. Plaintiffs also allege that in Woodroof’s capacity as a POA\n\nsupervising “re-licensing and foster care,” she failed to direct D.L.’s removal from\n\nthe Calhoun home and place him in a residential facility.\n\n      As sources of notice, plaintiffs allege that: (1) on February 14, 1997 and\n\nApril 8, 1997, when M.M. and D.L. were placed in the Calhoun home, Woodroof\n\nwas aware of their behavioral histories and the histories of the children already\n\nliving in the home; (2) on May 17, 1998, Woodroof received a letter from a GAL\n\ndescribing the overcrowded conditions in the Calhoun home, which Woodroof\n\nproceeded to forward to the Licensing Unit; (3) in September 1998, Woodroof\n\nreceived a copy of the report of the Home by Home Review; and (4) in October\n\n1998, Woodroof received a letter from Joann Calhoun stating that D.L.’s case file\n\nreflected “sexual issues” and problems with “lying [and] being physically\n\naggressive,” and that she did not know who D.L.’s caseworker was.\n\n      Because plaintiffs point to specific actions spanning three years and specific\n\nsources of notice that Woodroof allegedly received over the course of those three\n\nyears, it is necessary to parse each allegation with an eye toward what Woodroof\n\n\n\n\n                                          75\n\factually knew at each point in time. To begin with, the allegation that Woodroof’s\n\napproval of a waiver for R.B. demonstrated deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\n\nis groundless. It is perhaps unsurprising that there is no allegation that R.B. abused\n\nthe plaintiffs, because a year had already elapsed between the time that R.B. left\n\nthe Calhoun home (April 1997) and the time that the first of the plaintiffs had\n\nentered it (April 1998). Compl. ¶¶ 120, 228. R.B.’s presence in the Calhoun home\n\ncould not even have contributed to overcrowding in any way that would have\n\naffected the plaintiffs.\n\n       As for the remaining four actions that plaintiffs allege Woodroof committed\n\nas a Family Services Specialist – actions taken in May 1995, February 1997, April\n\n1997, and May 1997 – letters and other materials received by Woodroof at later\n\ndates could not have formed the basis of her subjective knowledge at the time she\n\nmade those decisions. The only relevant allegation is that Woodroof was aware of\n\nthe behavioral histories of M.M., D.L., and the other children in the Calhoun\n\nhome.79 These facts do not permit the inference that Woodroof actually knew of\n\nand deliberately disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe general risk posed by M.M., D.L., and the thousands of other “at risk” children\n\n79\n   Of course, Woodroof could not have been aware of the behavioral histories of M.M. and D.L.\nas of the May 19, 1995 licensing of the Calhoun home for five children, since they did not enter\nthe home until February 14 and April 8, 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                               76\n\fserved by the Department is not enough to make out a case of deliberate\n\nindifference to a particular child’s safety. Nowhere is it alleged that Woodroof\n\nbelieved – actually drew the inference from the surrounding circumstances – that\n\nM.M. or D.L. posed a substantial threat to the children in the Calhoun home either\n\nbefore their initial placement or prior to the home’s re-licensing. In fact, the\n\ncomplaint suggests otherwise: Woodroof, along with a Placement Supervisor, a\n\nLicensing Supervisor, the POA of Licensing and Placement, and the Child Welfare\n\nDirector, considered the available placements for M.M. and D.L. and decided that\n\nthe Calhoun home, known for its ability to handle troubled boys successfully, was\n\nthe most appropriate setting for these children.80 Thereafter, based on her\n\nknowledge of the children in the Calhoun home and the fact that they had\n\npeaceably existed as a group for over a month, Woodroof concurred in the\n\nrecommendation from the Licensing Unit that the home be re-licensed.\n\n       Plaintiffs also allege that in her later capacity as POA of “re-licensing and\n\nfoster care,” Woodroof should have removed or directed the removal of D.L. from\n\nthe Calhoun home and ordered his placement in a residential treatment facility. As\n\nbefore, allegations that Woodroof was aware of a general background risk do not\n\n80\n   I note once more that at the time of M.M. and D.L.’s respective placements, at least three\nother children in the Calhoun home were older than M.M. and D.L., who were both twelve years\nold: 17-year-old R.D., 17-year-old B.J., and 13-year-old R.T.\n\n\n\n\n                                             77\n\freasonably support the inference that Woodroof actually knew of a strong\n\nlikelihood of sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. Although Joann Calhoun’s letter\n\nspecifically related her concern for D.L., the letter does no more than point to\n\nD.L.’s history as described in his case file, which was already known to Woodroof\n\nand the other Department officials who had collectively decided that the Calhoun\n\nhome was an appropriate placement for D.L. Joann Calhoun’s letter does not\n\ncontain a warning that D.L. created such a risk to the other children that he ought\n\nto be removed from the home; rather, Joann Calhoun expresses frustration with the\n\nDepartment and requests that D.L. be provided with another caseworker, whose\n\nservices she regarded as “imperative to being able to maintain D.[L].” Compl. ¶\n\n206. The letter is insufficient to establish that Woodroof thereafter believed that,\n\ncontrary to the conclusion she and other Department officials had earlier drawn,\n\nD.L.’s placement in the Calhoun home created a strong likelihood of sexual abuse\n\nto the other children.\n\n      Woodroof had no knowledge of a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual\n\nabuse in the Calhoun home until after the Department received the November 23\n\ncall to the abuse prevention hotline about A.P. I therefore find no error in the\n\ndismissal of the claims against her.\n\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\f                                             6.\n\n       At the time relevant to plaintiffs’ allegations, Susan Kanaskie was a\n\nProtective Investigations Supervisor for District 10. Plaintiffs contend that\n\nKanaskie approved the placement of M.M. in the Calhoun home despite being\n\naware of the substantial risk of serious harm that decision would create. This claim\n\nis unsupported by specific allegations regarding Kanaskie’s subjective\n\nknowledge.81\n\n       Kanaskie did not learn of the child-on-child sexual abuse at the Calhoun\n\nhome until December 11, 1998, when Susan Worsley, then a Foster Care\n\nSupervisor, and Elaine Corsino, the Acting Protective Investigations Supervisor,\n\ninformed her about the November 23 telephone call to the abuse prevention hotline\n\nregarding A.P. Because Kanaskie was unaware, prior to December 11, of the risk\n\nto the children in the Calhoun home, the district court properly held that she was\n\n81\n   Additionally, my understanding of District 10 operating procedures (based upon plaintiffs’\nown allegations, Compl. ¶ 41) does not permit the inference that Kanaskie was even actively\ninvolved in the decision to place or maintain M.M. in the Calhoun home in February 1997. As\nthe supervisor of Susan Worsley, M.M.’s Protective Investigator, Kanaskie would have reviewed\nM.M.’s background, risk assessments, and placement history and then would have assisted in\nproviding this information to the Placement Unit. Since the Calhoun home was operating at\ncapacity, the decision to place M.M. in the home was thereafter made by the Placement Unit in\ncoordination with the Department officials involved in authorizing overcapacity waivers – the\nPlacement Supervisor, Licensing Supervisor, POA of Licensing and Placement, a Family\nServices Specialist, and the Child Welfare Director. Once M.M. was placed in the Calhoun\nhome and declared a dependent, his case would have been transferred from the Protective\nInvestigations Unit to the Foster Care Unit – ending Kanaskie’s involvement.\n\n\n\n\n                                             79\n\fnot deliberately indifferent to the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to a safe\n\nenvironment.\n\n                                              7.\n\n       Susan Worsley served as a Protective Investigator and subsequently as a\n\nFoster Care Supervisor in District 10.82 She was initially assigned to M.M.’s case\n\non February 3, 1997, while he resided at the Lippman Shelter. As his Protective\n\nInvestigator, Worsley was informed of M.M.’s history of sexual abuse and his\n\npsychological and behavioral problems. As a Foster Care Supervisor, Worsley\n\noversaw M.M.’s caseworker. Plaintiffs allege that Worsley was deliberately\n\nindifferent to their safety by placing M.M. in the Calhoun home, failing to create a\n\nplan of care to ensure the safety of the other children in the Calhoun home, and\n\nfailing to visit M.M.\n\n       On February 12, 1997, Worsley was advised that M.M. could no longer\n\nremain at the Lippman Shelter because of his history and his need for 24-hour one-\n\non-one supervision. Worsley then contacted the Department’s Placement Unit to\n\ninquire about a new placement for M.M. Worsley suggested the Calhoun home (I\n\ninfer that her recommendation was due to the Calhoun home’s reputation for\n\n82\n  The complaint does not allege precisely when Worsley became a Foster Care Supervisor;\nhowever, it alleges that she was a Protective Investigator at least through March 1997 and\nsuggests that she was a Foster Care Supervisor as of November 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                              80\n\fmanaging troubled and unruly boys similar to M.M.) but was advised by an\n\nunspecified employee in the Placement Unit that M.M. was “too dangerous” to be\n\nplaced there. Despite this initial recommendation, the Placement Supervisor\n\nconsidered an overcapacity waiver that would allow M.M. to be placed with the\n\nCalhouns. After examining M.M.’s background, the children already in the\n\nCalhoun home, and the availability of other suitable placements, various officials\n\nin the Department concurred in the approval of an overcapacity waiver: the\n\nPlacement Supervisor, Licensing Supervisor, Family Services Specialist, POA of\n\nLicensing and Placement, and the Child Welfare Director.\n\n       M.M. was placed in the Calhoun home on February 14, 1997, and Worsley\n\ncontinued to serve as his Protective Investigator until his case was transferred to\n\nthe Foster Care Unit on March 27, 1997, following his adjudication as a dependent.\n\nDuring this time period, Worsley visited the Calhoun home on one occasion –\n\nFebruary 19, 1997 – and was informed by Joann Calhoun’s son that M.M. had a\n\n“violent explosion” the previous day. Worsley failed to perform any further home\n\nvisits, though allegedly she was required to visit weekly from February 14 to\n\nMarch 27, 1997. 38\n\n\n83\n  N.M., R.M., and A.P. were not placed in the Calhoun home until over a year later– April 24,\n1998, May 6, 1998, and September 17, 1998, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n                                              81\n\f       On December 9, Worsley learned about the November 23, 1998 call to the\n\nDepartment’s abuse prevention hotline alleging that A.P. had suffered sexual abuse\n\nin the Calhoun home. The facts establish that this was the first notice to Worsley\n\nof a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. Prior to\n\nthis time, Worsley was only aware of M.M.’s troubled background and that he had\n\none violent outburst during his placement in the Calhoun home. One cannot\n\nreasonably infer from these facts that Worsley believed that the children in the\n\nCalhoun home faced a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse. While her\n\nfailure to perform the necessary visitation is deplorable, it does not constitute\n\ndeliberately indifferent behavior. I therefore find no error in the court’s decision to\n\ndismiss the plaintiffs’ claims against Worsley.\n\n                                                8.\n\n       Jennifer Chang was initially POA of Licensing and Placement and later\n\nbecame a Family Services Specialist in March 1998. The main allegation against\n\nChang stems from her involvement as POA in approving overcapacity waivers that\n\nallowed children with sexual perpetration histories and mental health problems to\n\nbe placed in the Calhoun home, including M.M. and D.L.84 In February 1997 and\n\n84\n  Although plaintiffs allege that Chang also improperly approved overcapacity waivers\npermitting B.J. (described by plaintiffs as “a danger to himself and others”) and R.B. (described\nby plaintiffs as a “fire setter and sexual abuser”) to live in the Calhoun home, these allegations\n\n\n\n\n                                                82\n\fApril 1997, when M.M. and D.L. were placed in the Calhoun home, Chang was\n\naware of their behavioral histories and of the general overcrowding of foster homes\n\nin District 10. With respect to M.M., Chang had also attended a court hearing in\n\nM.M.’s dependency case in which the circuit judge “expressed fear that M.M.\n\nwould hurt someone at the Calhoun home due to his history of physical and sexual\n\naggression.” Compl. ¶ 116. Chang was one of the persons who subsequently\n\nparticipated in the approval of overcapacity waivers with respect to M.M. and\n\nD.L.; in accordance with Department policy, the other officials involved in the\n\nwaiver approval process included a Placement Supervisor, a Licensing Supervisor,\n\na Family Services Specialist, and the Child Welfare Director.\n\n       These facts do not make out a claim of deliberate indifference with respect\n\nto Chang. As with Woodroof, the complaint does not indicate that Chang believed\n\nM.M. or D.L. to pose a substantial threat of sexual abuse to the children in the\n\nCalhoun home. The most reasonable inference from these facts is that Chang\n\nevaluated the case files of the children, and in M.M.’s case, the judge’s “fear that\n\nM.M. would hurt someone at the Calhoun home due to his history of physical and\n\nare irrelevant to the plaintiffs’ claims as there is no allegation that B.J. or R.B. abused the\nplaintiffs – logically enough, as B.J. left the Calhoun home when he turned 18 in April 1998\n(Compl. ¶ 102), and R.B. left the Calhoun home a year earlier, in April 1997 (Compl. ¶ 120).\nThey could not have even contributed to overcrowding in the Calhoun home in any way that\nwould have affected the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                83\n\fsexual aggression.” (Recall that M.M. had sexually abused his sister and had\n\nthreatened his family members with a knife.) Then, based on her professional\n\njudgment and experience in the foster care system, she and her colleagues\n\nconcluded that M.M. and D.L. would not in fact pose a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm to the other children then living in the Calhoun home – a home with “the\n\nreputation of taking in troubled and/or difficult to control young males,” Compl. ¶\n\n90 – and approved the overcapacity waivers.85\n\n       Additionally, the plaintiffs allege deliberate indifference in regard to\n\nChang’s actions as a Family Services Specialist following the Department’s\n\nissuance of the report of the Home by Home Review on September 8, 1998.\n\nChang was a member of the Special Review Team that drafted a Corrective Action\n\nPlan for each of the 50 homes examined during the Review. While the complaint\n\ndoes not allege what the Corrective Action Plan for the Calhoun home contained, it\n\ndoes allege that the plan failed to address D.L.’s and M.M.’s histories of sexual\n\nperpetration and failed to reduce the Calhoun home’s capacity. The plaintiffs\n\n85\n   One must remember that neither the size nor the composition of the Calhoun home remained\nthe same from the times that M.M. and D.L. were placed there on February 14, 1997 and April 8,\n1997, and the times that N.M., R.M., and A.P. entered the home on April 24, 1998, May 6, 1998,\nand September 15, 1998. M.M. and D.L. brought the population of the home to six and seven\nchildren, respectively, and were among the younger children in the home. Chang, of course, had\nno knowledge of the individual characteristics of N.M., R.M., and A.P. at the time she\nparticipated in the waiver process for M.M. and D.L.\n\n\n\n\n                                              84\n\fwould have Chang held liable for the sexual abuse A.P., N.M., and R.M. may have\n\nsustained at the hands of D.L. and M.M. based on the inadequacy of the Special\n\nReview Team’s Corrective Action Plan. Because, at best, such liability sounds in\n\nnegligence, not deliberate indifference to the infringement of a constitutional right,\n\nthe district court committed no error in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims against\n\nChang.\n\n                                              9.\n\n         As a Licensing Counselor and later as a Licensing Supervisor,86 Margaret\n\nAndrews was responsible for the annual licensing review of several foster homes in\n\nDistrict 10 and participated in the overcapacity waiver process. The plaintiffs\n\nwould hold Andrews liable for the following alleged actions: (1) in July 1996,\n\nrecommending re-licensing the Calhoun home despite the fact that an investigation\n\ninto neglect and domestic violence allegations had not been finalized, in\n\ncontravention of Department policy; (2) in July 1996, failing to properly\n\ninvestigate another allegation of physical abuse and domestic violence in the\n\nCalhoun home, in contravention of state law and Department policy; (3) in\n\nFebruary 1997, participating with a Placement Supervisor, Woodroof (Family\n\n\n\n86\n     The complaint does not allege when Andrews became a Licensing Supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n                                              85\n\fServices Specialist), Chang (POA of Licensing and Placement), and the Child\n\nWelfare Director in the approval of the overcapacity waiver that allowed M.M.’s\n\nplacement in the Calhoun home; and (4) on May 16, 1997, recommending to her\n\nsupervisor, Woodroof, that the Calhoun home be re-licensed for a capacity of\n\nseven foster children.\n\n      The complaint does not permit the inference that Andrews at any time was\n\nsubjectively aware that the plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of child-on-child\n\nsexual abuse in the Calhoun home. First, even if her conduct in 1996 were\n\ncausally related to the injuries the plaintiffs suffered – which is uncertain because\n\nneither the alleged abusers nor the plaintiffs came to the home until 1997 and 1998,\n\nrespectively – violating state procedural laws or departmental procedures does not\n\nconstitute deliberate indifference. See Ray v. Foltz, 370 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th\n\nCir. 2004) (“Allegations of failure to follow state policies and procedures . . . do\n\nnot support a claim for damages, such as the [plaintiffs’]. Where damages are\n\nsought, more must be shown that negligent failure to follow Department guidelines\n\nand procedures.”). As to her actions in 1997, all I can glean from the complaint is\n\nthat Andrews knew that seven foster children were residing in the Calhoun home\n\nwith mental health issues, including several children with sexual abuse and\n\n\n\n\n                                           86\n\fperpetration histories – a profile that fit the majority of homes in District 10. It\n\ncannot be inferred from these facts that Andrews actually drew the inference that\n\nthe children in the Calhoun home faced a substantial risk of harm, especially in\n\nlight of the fact that child-on-child sexual abuse was never known to have occurred\n\nduring the six years that the Calhouns housed troubled children. The court\n\nproperly found that the allegations against Andrews failed to state a claim for\n\nrelief.\n\n                                           10.\n\n          The district court dismissed the claims against Loubert Desmangles, Susan\n\nWilburn, and Sharon Pollack, District 10 caseworkers who held the title “Family\n\nServices Counselor.” The court did so because the facts failed to show that these\n\ncaseworkers were deliberately indifferent to the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to a\n\nsafe foster home environment. I agree. Plaintiffs’ allegations establish, at best,\n\nthat the defendants were aware of circumstances that may have permitted the\n\ninference that a substantial risk of sexual assault existed in the Calhoun home. But\n\nnone of the allegations, viewed in terms of what each defendant individually knew,\n\npermit the inference that the defendant actually drew such an inference.\n\n          Loubert Desmangles was present when D.L. admitted in April 1997 that he\n\n\n\n\n                                           87\n\fhad sexually assaulted three or four boys who lived near his old foster home. After\n\nan overcapacity waiver permitting D.L.’s placement in the Calhoun home was\n\nrequested and approved by the necessary Department officials, Desmangles placed\n\nD.L. in the Calhoun home. At some point after D.L.’s placement, the Sexual\n\nAssault Treatment Center informed Desmangles that it had terminated D.L.’s\n\nsexual abuse therapy “due to the most recent child-on-child incident involving\n\nD.L.,” and that D.L. would require intensive therapeutic services in a residential\n\nfacility for sexual offenders. Compl. ¶ 192. In June 1997, Joann Calhoun\n\ninformed Desmangles that D.L. was having “behavioral problems,” Compl. ¶ 194 –\n\nof what nature we do not know. Finally, plaintiffs allege that on July 1, 1997,\n\nDesmangles “was ordered” – the complaint does not say by whom – “to place D.L.\n\nin a residential treatment facility specializing in sexual offender treatment,” Compl.\n\n¶ 195, but did not do so.\n\n      In sum, plaintiffs allege that Desmangles knew that D.L. had a history of\n\nsexual perpetration, that at least two other persons believed that D.L. should be\n\nplaced in a residential treatment facility, and that he had unspecified “behavioral\n\nproblems.” But he also knew that at least five Department officials had considered\n\nD.L.’s file and had approved an overcapacity waiver to place D.L. in the Calhoun\n\n\n\n\n                                          88\n\fhome (known for its ability to handle troubled children) with six other boys – at\n\nleast five of whom were at least as old or older than D.L. Desmangles also had his\n\nown first-hand observations. As alleged in the complaint, Desmangles was\n\nrequired to visit D.L. in the home at least monthly; the purpose of these visits was\n\nto assess the safety of the placement and to report any concerns about the condition\n\nof the foster home to the Licensing Unit or any suspected abuse or neglect to the\n\nDistrict’s abuse prevention hotline. There is no allegation that Desmangles failed\n\nto make regular visits to D.L. in the Calhoun home, with concurrent information-\n\ngathering that yielded nothing more. While plaintiffs’ allegations might satisfy an\n\nobjective standard of negligence, therefore, they are insufficient to establish that\n\nDesmangles himself believed that D.L.’s presence in the Calhoun home created a\n\nstrong likelihood of sexual abuse to the other children.\n\n      Susan Wilburn was assigned to D.L. on May 12, 1998. At that time, she was\n\ninformed by D.L.’s GAL that he “was inappropriately placed in the Calhoun foster\n\nhome and needed intensive, in-patient treatment at a facility for sexual offenders.”\n\nCompl. ¶ 203. Later that month, Joann Calhoun informed Wilburn that D.L. was\n\nin “desperate need of help” and had physically assaulted one of the other children.\n\nCompl. ¶ 204. The details of the assault are nowhere alleged; nor is the identity of\n\n\n\n\n                                           89\n\fthe child who was assaulted. On May 21, 1998, Wilburn was assigned to N.M. and\n\nR.M. She continued to serve as counselor to D.L., N.M., and R.M. for a little\n\nunder four months, until she left the Department on September 11, 1998. There is\n\nno allegation that Wilburn failed to make regular visits to all three of these children\n\nin the Calhoun home. Nor is there any allegation that Wilburn learned of child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse in the Calhoun home during her visits to these three children.\n\nRather, plaintiffs allege that Wilburn failed to take adequate steps to ensure that\n\nD.L. did not abuse the other children in the Calhoun home, or to protect N.M. and\n\nR.M.\n\n       Like Desmangles, Wilburn knew that D.L. had a history of sexual\n\nperpetration and that at least one person believed he should be placed in a\n\nresidential treatment facility. She also knew, however, that there had been no\n\nreports of D.L. acting out sexually in the Calhoun home in the thirteen months he\n\nhad lived there. And perhaps most significantly, Wilburn had her own first-hand\n\nobservations from visiting three children – D.L., N.M., and R.M. – in the Calhoun\n\nhome, with the concomitant opportunity to monitor their specific interactions.\n\nPlaintiffs’ additional allegation that Wilburn knew of one occasion where D.L. had\n\nphysically assaulted one of the children in some fashion is insufficient to establish\n\n\n\n\n                                          90\n\fthat Wilburn believed that D.L. created a strong likelihood of sexual abuse to the\n\nchildren in the Calhoun home.\n\n      Sharon Pollack was assigned to M.M. upon his placement in the Calhoun\n\nhome in March 1997, and continued until August 1997. There is no allegation that\n\nshe failed to visit M.M. regularly during this time. A little over ten months after\n\nD.L.’s placement in the Calhoun home, on February 27, 1998, Pollack was\n\ntemporarily assigned to be D.L.’s counselor. She visited him once on March 5,\n\n1998; her assignment ended on May 5, 1998, when she was re-assigned to M.M.\n\nand continued in that capacity until September 1998. During that time, plaintiffs\n\nallege that Pollack visited M.M. only once, on June 25, 1998.\n\n      The sum total of plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Pollack’s state of\n\nknowledge is that she was aware of M.M. and D.L.’s sexual perpetration histories\n\nand knew that they were living in a crowded home with troubled children.\n\nPlaintiffs’ case against Pollack is a classic example of plain vanilla negligence –\n\nthat she should have recognized the risk of sexual abuse to the other children; that\n\nshe should have made regular visits to M.M. and D.L.; and that she should have\n\nremoved M.M. and D.L. or developed a plan to ensure that the children did not\n\nbecome the perpetrators or victims of sexual abuse. While these facts were\n\n\n\n\n                                          91\n\fprobative of the class action claim for injunctive relief in Ward, they do not\n\nestablish the deliberate indifference to a constitutional right necessary to recover\n\nmoney damages against the caseworkers individually.\n\n                                              VI.\n\n       The complaint in this case alleges many facts from which the defendants\n\ncould, or perhaps should, have inferred that a substantial risk of serious harm\n\nexisted in the Calhoun home; however, there are no specific allegations that they\n\nactually drew such an inference and then chose to disregard it.87 I would hold that\n\nthe district court did not err in dismissing the claims before us.\n\n\n\n                                         APPENDIX\n\n                  Florida Department of Children and Family Services\n\n\n\n87\n   Determining which of the facts alleged in the complaint’s 265 pages is relevant to the\nquestion of whether a particular defendant engaged in deliberately indifferent conduct is not an\ninsubstantial task. The difficulty of this case was further compounded by the “shotgun” style of\npleading that we have vehemently criticized time and time again. See, e.g., Davis v. Coca-Cola\nBottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 979–80 (11th Cir. 2008); United States v. McInteer, 470\nF.3d 1350, 1354 n.6 (11th Cir. 2006); M.T.V. v. DeKalb County Sch.

The plaintiffs brought suit against the state officials under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their Fourteenth Amendment right to be safe\n\n\n       *\n           Honorable Richard Mills, United States District Judge for the Central District of\nIllinois, sitting by designation.\n       1\n          The defendant-officials are as follows: Edward Feaver, Secretary of the Department of\nChildren and Family Services; Johnny Brown, District 10 Administrator; Katherine Kaufman, a\nProgram Operations Administrator of Protective Investigations and later Acting Child Welfare\nDirector; Corinne Millikan, Family Services Specialist and Operations Management Consultant;\nSharon Woodroof, Family Services Specialist and later Program Operations Administrator for\nRe-licensing and Foster Care; Susan Kanaskie, Protective Investigations Supervisor; Susan\nWorsley, Protective Investigator and later Foster Care Supervisor; Jennifer Chang, Program\nOperations Administrator for Licensing and Placement and later Family Services Specialist;\nMargaret Andrews, Licensing Counselor and later Licensing Supervisor; and Loubert\nDesmangles, Sharon Pollack, and Susan Wilburn, Family Services Counselors.\n       The complaint also named Winsome Smith, a Family Services Counselor, as a defendant.\nBecause the only claim against Smith was brought by R.K., who has since settled, plaintiffs’\nappeal with respect to Smith is moot.\n\n                                                 2\n\ffrom an unreasonable risk of physical harm while in state custody. After careful\n\nreview of the allegations against each defendant, we affirm in part, and reverse in\n\npart.\n\n        As to defendants Feaver, Brown, Kanaskie, and Pollack, we find no error,\n\nand affirm the dismissal of A.P., N.M. and R.M.’s claims against them.\n\n        As to defendants Chang, Woodroof, Millikan, Worsley, Andrews, Kaufman,\n\nDesmangles, and Wilburn, we find that the district court erred in dismissing A.P.,\n\nN.M. and R.M.’s claims against them and reverse the dismissal of these claims in\n\nthe Second Amended Complaint.\n\n        Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part;\n\nREVERSED in part; and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part:\n\n       Judges Barkett and Mills and I sharply disagree as to whether the factual\n\nallegations of plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to state constitutional violations\n\nagainst the defendants in their provision of foster care and as to whether they are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.1 For the reasons advanced in this opinion, I concur\n\nin the part of the court’s judgment affirming the district court’s dismissal of the\n\nclaims against Feaver, Brown, Kanaskie, and Pollack, and I dissent from the part of\n\nthe court’s judgment reversing the district court’s dismissal of the remaining\n\ndefendants. I write separately to provide the factual context in which plaintiffs’\n\nclaims are presented and the legal rationale for my view that plaintiffs’ factual\n\nallegations failed to establish that defendants possessed the requisite subjective\n\n\n\n       1\n          I also disagree with Judges Barkett and Mills as to whether the court’s per curiam\nopinion and my separate opinion should be published. This court’s Local Rules and Internal\nOperating Procedures express the court’s policy regarding the publication of opinions. 11th\nCircuit Rule 36-2 states that “[a]n opinion shall be unpublished unless a majority of the panel\ndecides to publish it.” The court’s Internal Operating Procedures (I.O.P.) are to the same effect.\nThe I.O.P. appended to Rule 36-2, states: “A majority of the panel determine whether an opinion\nshould be published.” The I.O.P further states that “[o]pinions that the panel believes to have no\nprecedential value are not published.” My colleagues are of the view that the opinions in this\ncase have no precedential value; as unpublished, they should not be “considered binding\nprecedent.” 11th Cir. R. 36-2. My view is that these opinions have precedential value because of\nthe questions the case presents. Suits against foster care workers are commonplace. Those\nadministering foster care – whether, as here, the case workers who visit the children, their\nsupervisors, or those occupying high-level administrative positions – need to know, they are\nentitled to know, where they stand, whether they are subject to suit simply for doing their job.\nUnpublished decisions, although “persuasive authority,” id., do not give these workers much\ncomfort. In parts IV. A. and B.1 supra, I cite five unpublished decisions, which, had they been\npublished, would have dictated the outcome of this case.\n\n                                                4\n\fknowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to plaintiffs that the Constitution\n\nrequires as a basis for personal liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. I would therefore\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment as to all defendants.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       This appeal concerns the second phase of a controversy over the quality of\n\nfoster care provided by the State of Florida’s Department of Children and Family\n\nServices (the “Department” or “DCF”) to dependent children in District 10,\n\nBroward County, in the late 1990s.2 The first phase involved a class action suit for\n\ninjunctive relief brought on behalf of the foster children in District 10; the district\n\ncourt granted prospective relief in the form of a consent decree. In the second\n\nphase, four members of the plaintiff class who had allegedly suffered child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse while living in a foster home sought damages from thirteen\n\nDepartment officials in their individual capacities for violations of the Fourteenth\n\n\n2\n  In Florida, the Department of Children and Family Services is responsible for children who\nhave become dependents of the State. The Department may take into custody a child who has no\nlegal custodian or any child it has probable cause to believe has been “abused, neglected, or\nabandoned, or is suffering from or is in imminent danger of illness or injury as a result of abuse,\nneglect, or abandonment.” Fla. Stat. § 39.401(1)(b) (1997). Once a child has been taken into\ncustody, DCF may seek to have the child declared a dependent. Fla. Stat. § 39.402 (setting forth\nstandards for placement of children in shelter care); Fla. Stat. § 39.501 (describing the\nrequirements of a petition for dependency). The dependency decision, however, ultimately lies\nwith the state circuit courts. Fla. Stat. § 39.013(2) (granting jurisdiction over juvenile matters to\nthe circuit court); Fla. Stat. § 39.507 (setting forth the requirements for an adjudicatory hearing\non dependency). Once declared a dependent, the child may be placed in foster care. See Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.014(1) (1997) (setting forth the requirements for foster care\nplacement).\n\n                                                  5\n\fAmendment. The district court denied relief, dismissing the claims under Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). This appeal challenges this ruling.\n\n                                                    A.\n\n         On October 20, 1998, a class action suit for injunctive relief was filed under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 3 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\n\nFlorida on behalf of the over 1,000 dependent children in District 10 against the\n\nSecretary of the Department and the Administrator of District 10 in their official\n\ncapacities.4 The suit alleged that the Department and District 10 were denying the\n\ndependent children their constitutional right to safety and freedom from harm 5 by\n\nfailing to provide proper care that was consistent with both professional judgment\n\n\n\n\n3\n    42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n         Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\n         usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to\n         be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the\n         jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\n         secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\n         action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress[.]\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n4\n  At the time suit commenced, Edward Feaver and Johnny Brown served as Secretary of the\nDepartment and as District 10 Administrator, respectively. Kathleen Kearney and Robert Cohen\nassumed their positions in 2000 and shortly thereafter were substituted as the defendants in the\ncase.\n5\n  According to the complaint, this substantive constitutional right was guaranteed the dependent\nchildren by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                                    6\n\fand Florida’s foster care statutory and regulatory regime6 – a failure so profound\n\nthat it caused the children “to suffer harm which is often more severe than that\n\nwhich caused them to be removed from the custody of their parents” in the first\n\nplace. The suit exposed the Florida foster care system as having reached a state of\n\nsystemic crisis, and nowhere was this more evident than in District 10. A yearly\n\nstaff turnover rate of 80% and a dearth of adequate placements spawned a rapidly\n\nincreasing number of severely overcrowded homes with little supervision by the\n\nDepartment.7 Burdened by caseloads that were between two and eight times the\n\n6\n  According to the complaint, in placing dependent children in foster homes, the Department and\nDistrict 10 failed to heed the requirements of the following statutory and regulatory provisions:\nFla. Stat. § 39.001(1)(I) (1998) (children should be placed in licensed foster home with “custody,\ncare, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by the\nparents” and which is drug and alcohol free), Fla. Stat. § 39.001(1)(m) (disruptions to a child’s\neducation should be minimized), Fla. Stat. § 39.001(3)(c) (children should be placed in “[a] safe\nand nurturing environment which will preserve a sense of personal dignity and integrity”), Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.010(5)(g) (1995) (child counselor will visit a child placed in foster\ncare at least once per month), Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.010(1)(b)(6) (foster parents\nobligated to see that children receive adequate medical service), Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-\n13.010(1)(b)(9) (foster parents obligated to see that children receive adequate educational\nservices), Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.010(5)(b)–(f) (information sharing obligations\nbetween foster parents and counselors). Perhaps most pointedly, the complaint alleged that the\nSecretary and the District Administrator failed to develop and implement adequate procedures\nfor the prevention of abuse, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.015(1), and continually placed\nchildren in homes that failed to meet basic regulatory licensing requirements. Fla. Admin. Code\nAnn. r. 65C-13.011(2) (no more than five total children in a home without good cause); Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.011(4) (foster parents must “have sufficient income to assure their\nstability and the security of their own family without relying on board payments”); Fla. Admin.\nCode Ann. r. 65C-13.011(9) (foster parents must meet regulatory screening requirements); Fla.\nAdmin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.011(11) (foster home must be comparable to other homes in the\nneighborhood, be free from unreasonably dangerous objects or materials, and be inspected by a\nlocal health inspector).\n7\n  The complaint alleged that over 400 children in District 10 were placed in overcrowded foster\nand shelter homes – more than twice that of the previous year. Additionally, 80 children in\n\n                                                7\n\frecommended national standards, counselors were regularly unable to meet their\n\nmonthly visitation requirements; in fact, a sampling of foster children in District 10\n\nduring this time revealed that nearly a quarter of the children surveyed had not\n\nbeen visited by their caseworker in over two months.8 Contributing further to the\n\ninstitutional malady was the overall lack of proper screening procedures, which\n\nresulted in emotionally disturbed and potentially dangerous children being\n\nimproperly placed in homes that were unable to provide them with adequate care\n\nor monitoring.9 As a result, the complaint alleged that physical, sexual, and\n\nemotional abuse and neglect pervaded the District 10 foster care system.\n\n       After the defendants answered the complaint and following months of\n\ndiscovery and negotiations, the parties entered into a settlement agreement and, on\n\nJanuary 26, 2000, presented it to the district court. The court approved the\n\nsettlement agreement and, treating it as a proposed consent decree enforceable\n\n\nDistrict 10’s custody were missing.\n8\n  Another study in 1996 revealed that 58% of foster children in District 10 were not visited\nmonthly by their caseworker and that 77% were not receiving appropriate services. Later that\nyear, a District 10 juvenile court dependency judge captured the general sentiment as to the\nalarming state of affairs: “I am more than scared, I am petrified relative to the lack of shelter\nplacements and foster homes in District 10. . . . Things are now at the point where children’s\nlives are in danger.” Compl. ¶ 62.\n9\n  In September 1995, the Department studied 177 children receiving targeted case management\nservices (mental health) in District 10. The study revealed that 41% of these children were\nknown to have been sexually abused, a percentage that was significantly higher than those\nreported in other large metropolitan areas. The study also revealed that 15% of the children had\ncommitted sexual assaults. Compl. ¶ 58.\n\n                                                 8\n\fthrough the court’s civil contempt power, entered the decree on May 31, 2000.10\n\nThe decree required the Secretary and the District 10 Administrator to develop and\n\nimplement an adequate system of foster care for the dependent children of District\n\n10. The decree also required the Secretary and the District 10 Administrator to\n\nadhere to the commands of the Florida statutes and regulations governing the care\n\nof dependent children 11 and to meet numerous minimum standards regarding the\n\nplacement and monitoring of children in foster homes.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       On October 28, 2002, counsel for the plaintiff class in Ward brought the\n\npresent lawsuit in the district court on behalf of A.P., a District 10 dependent\n\n\n10\n   The decree was captioned “Order Approving Settlement Agreement” rather than “Consent\nDecree.” Despite this caption, it had all the indicia of, and was in effect, a consent decree. The\norder recited that on February 18, 2000, the court, after tentatively approving the settlement as\n“fair [and] reasonable,” and “adequate [to] protect the plaintiff class,” had ordered “that notice of\nthe proposed Settlement Agreement be published to class members and that comments or\nobjections be filed by May 18, 2000.” A final hearing was held on May 31, 2000, at which the\ncourt “considered all comments and objections” and “finally approved” the settlement\nagreement. The order then stated that “the Court retains jurisdiction for the purposes of\nenforcing the Settlement Agreement.”\n11\n   The part of the court’s order that required the Secretary and the District 10 Administrator to\nadhere to the commands of the Florida statutes and regulations governing the care of dependent\nchildren constituted what we have often treated as an unenforceable “obey the law” injunction.\nSee S.E.C. v.

Also assigned to that judge was a case brought by District 10\n\ndependents shortly after A.P. filed suit. The plaintiffs were N.M. and R.M., two\n\nsiblings who joined in one complaint.14 The complaint sought money damages\n\nagainst Feaver, Brown, another former District 10 administrator, and various\n\nDistrict 10 caseworkers and supervisors under § 1983 relying on the same legal\n\n\n12\n     Since A.P. was a minor, he sued through his next friend, David S.

Mr. Calhoun’s first name is not revealed in the record.\n14\n     N.M. and R.M. are minors. Like A.P., they sue through their next friend, David S.

Since the case was similar to A.P.’s case,\n\nthe court dismissed it without prejudice with leave to replead the claims in a single\n\ncomplaint in the action filed by A.P.15\n\n         On April 3, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The\n\ncomplaint focused on the Calhoun home, alleging that it suffered from many of the\n\nills the Ward complaint had listed as characteristic of District 10: the home was\n\nseverely overcrowded and housed children with histories of violence and deviant\n\nbehavior, many of whom had been perpetrators as well as victims of sexual abuse.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the defendants failed to monitor properly the Calhouns\n\nand the children in their care, and that had they followed DCF’s procedures and\n\nimplemented corrective measures, the plaintiffs would not have been abused. The\n\ndefendants had allegedly acted with deliberate indifference to the significant risk of\n\nharm the plaintiffs faced and thereby denied them due process of law.\n\n         The defendants severally moved to dismiss the first amended complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.16 The district court\n\n\n15\n   Initially, five additional cases arising from similar events in the Calhoun home were assigned\nto the same judge. One case was successfully mediated and settled. The remaining four cases\nwere repled in A.P.’s case but subsequently settled. This includes the claim of minor plaintiff\nR.K., which settled during the pendency of this appeal and was dismissed with prejudice\npursuant to the parties’ joint motion on June 11, 2008.

The defendants objected to the recommendation, and on March 30, 2004,\n\nfollowing oral argument on their objections, the district court, relying on Ray v.\n\nFoltz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76580\"><a href=\"/opinion/76580/grace-ray-v-e-j-foltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2004), concluded that the complaint should be\n\namended.17 Like the plaintiffs in Foltz, the plaintiffs before the district court had\n\nnot alleged that each defendant, individually, actually knew of the substantial risk\n\nof harm the plaintiffs faced in the Calhoun home and were deliberately indifferent\n\nto such harm. In directing the plaintiffs to amend their first amended complaint,\n\nthe district court gave them an opportunity to cure that deficiency.\n\n       The plaintiffs responded with a second amended complaint (the\n\n“complaint”) on May 3, 2004.

The defendants,\ninvoking the doctrine of qualified immunity, moved the district court to dismiss the parents’\ncomplaint. Id. at 1081. The court denied their motion, and they appealed. Id. We reversed, and\nremanded the case with the direction that the district court dismiss the complaint because it\nfailed to allege that “the defendants actually knew of the substantial risk of harm to R.M. and\nthat they were deliberately indifferent to it.” Id. at 1085.\n18\n  By this time plaintiffs had dropped their claims against Brown’s predecessor, who had been\nnamed as a defendant in the earlier complaints.\n\n                                              12\n\fasserted 71 claims for relief.19 Each defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim for relief on two grounds: first, the complaint failed to recite\n\nfacts sufficient to state a constitutional violation against the defendant; and second,\n\nassuming a constitutional violation, the defendant was nonetheless entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n         On September 17, 2004, the district court entered an omnibus order\n\ndismissing all 40 claims brought by the three plaintiffs, A.P., N.M., and R.M.,\n\nbecause the allegations were insufficient under Foltz to make out a case of\n\ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm.20 A.P. v. Feaver, No. 02-\n\n61534, at 49–50 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2004) (Omnibus Order on Defs.’ Mot. to\n\nDismiss Pls.’ Second Am. Compl.) (“Omnibus Order”). The plaintiffs moved the\n\ncourt pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) to enter a final judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants on the claims the court had dismissed for failure to state a\n\nconstitutional violation. The court granted their motion on October 15, 2004, and\n\n                                                                                          1\nentered final judgment on those claims. This appeal is from that judgment.                    2\n\n\n\n\n19\n     Thirty-one of these claims were brought by J.K. and R.K., who have since settled.\n20\n   The court went on to hold that because these claims failed to state a constitutional violation,\nthe defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n21\n   Though the plaintiffs included all of the dismissed claims in their notice of appeal, they now\nappeal the district court’s ruling on only 36 of the 40 dismissals. The four dismissals which the\nplaintiffs do not appeal are the dismissal of A.P.’s claim against Richard Walsh and all three of\nplaintiffs’ claims against Pat Spratling.\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                               II.\n\n       The Florida Department of Children and Family Services, headed by the\n\nSecretary, is the state executive branch agency that provides services in the areas of\n\neconomic self-sufficiency; developmental disability; alcohol, drug abuse, and\n\nmental health; and children and families. During the pertinent time period, the\n\nstate was divided into 15 service districts, each headed by a District\n\nAdministrator.22 As reflected in the organizational chart appended to this opinion,\n\none of the persons reporting to the District Administrator of District 10 was the\n\nChild Welfare Director. A Program Administrator and a number of Family\n\nServices Specialists assisted the Child Welfare Director via consultation and\n\nadministrative support.23 The Child Welfare Director also supervised three\n\nProgram Operations Administrators (“POAs”) who collectively managed the four\n\nunits responsible for administering foster care in District 10: “Protective\n\n\n22\n  At least one health and human services board existed in each service district for the purpose of\nencouraging the initiation and support of interagency cooperation and collaboration in\naddressing family services needs.\n23\n   Neither the Florida Administrative Code nor the complaint describes the qualifications of a\nProgram Administrator and a Family Services Specialist. The sole mention of a Program\nAdministrator in the complaint is that this person may participate in lieu of the Child Welfare\nDirector in approving foster home capacity waivers, which I describe at part II.B, infra. The\ncomplaint alleges that the Family Services Specialists assisted District 10 staff with development\nand program planning; provided ongoing technical assistance; monitored the provision of\nchildren’s services; performed quality assurance reviews; ensured that policy guidance was\navailable and understandable to support staff and direct services; and, most pertinent to the case\nat hand, participated in foster parent re-licensing and the approval of foster home capacity\nwaivers.\n\n                                                14\n\fInvestigations,” “Licensing,” “Placement,” and “Foster Care.”24 During the time\n\nperiod covered by the allegations of the complaint, District 10 provided foster care\n\nto over 1,000 children in several hundred homes; accordingly, the four units\n\ncontained numerous Supervisors, Investigators, and Counselors.\n\n       The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that they were subjected to child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse in the Calhoun home from April 24 until November 23, 1998.\n\nTheir complaint therefore focuses on District 10’s licensing of the foster parent in\n\ncharge of that home, Joann Calhoun, and the placement and supervision of the\n\nplaintiffs and those who allegedly abused them, namely M.M. and D.L., in her\n\nhome. My discussion is similarly focused. I begin by explaining the process for\n\nlicensing a foster parent, including Joann Calhoun, prior to the time of the alleged\n\nabuse.25 Next, I explain the process for adjudicating a child a dependent of the\n\nState of Florida, identify the District 10 officials involved in the child’s custodial\n\nplacement, and describe the supervision protocol. After that, I review the\n\nallegations regarding the placement and supervision of the plaintiffs before us,\n\nA.P., N.M., and R.M., and the alleged abusers, M.M. and D.L.26\n\n24\n   Each unit was managed by a different POA, with the exception of the Licensing Unit and the\nPlacement Unit, which were managed by the same POA.\n25\n   More than one foster parent may be responsible for a foster home. In this case, there was one\nfoster parent, Joann Calhoun.\n26\n   In the first amended complaint plaintiffs’ counsel filed in this case, M.M. and D.L. were\nalleged to have been victims of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. In their\n\n                                                15\n\f                                        A. Licensing\n\n       An applicant seeking a license to operate a foster home was subjected to a\n\ncomprehensive background investigation conducted by a Licensing Counselor.27\n\nThe investigation centered on the applicant’s financial and emotional stability and\n\noverall character, and involved a “home study” of the suitability of the applicant’s\n\nhome for foster care. If the results of the investigation favored granting a license,\n\nthe applicant would participate in a foster parent training program. Then, if she\n\nsatisfactorily completed the training program, the applicant would receive a license\n\nto operate a specific foster home for a designated number of children – the home’s\n\ncapacity.\n\n       The license had a term of one year and could be renewed annually. The\n\nannual re-licensing process involved a home visit by the Licensing Counselor, who\n\nwould review the results of the initial home study, consider any relevant\n\ninformation the Foster Care Unit may have acquired in supervising children housed\n\nthere during the previous year, and report her findings to her Supervisor. Absent\n\nan unfavorable report from the Counselor, the Licensing Unit would license the\n\nfoster parent to operate her home for another year at the same or a different\n\n\nsecond amended complaint, counsel dropped M.M. and D.L. as plaintiffs and then alleged that\nthey perpetrated the sexual abuse A.P., N.M., and R.M. allegedly sustained.\n27\n   The Counselor conducted the investigation under the supervision of her Supervisor, who, in\nturn, answered to the Licensing and Placement POA.\n\n                                              16\n\fcapacity.\n\n       Joann Calhoun became a licensed foster parent in 1990.28 By 1992, her\n\nhome had gained a reputation for being able to handle troubled and unruly boys,\n\nsome with histories of sexual abuse both as a perpetrator and as a victim. District\n\n10 regarded the Calhoun home as a therapeutic setting, although it was not licensed\n\nexplicitly as a therapeutic facility. Over the next six years, until November 23,\n\n1998 – when the incident giving rise to this lawsuit was reported – there were no\n\nreported incidents of child-on-child sexual abuse in the home, which housed as\n\nmany as eleven children at a time, including emotionally disturbed children with\n\nhistories of sexual and physical aggression.\n\n                      B. Foster Home Placement and Supervision\n\n       A child normally first came within DCF’s jurisdiction on a complaint of\n\nabuse, neglect, or abandonment. The complaint was channeled to the Protective\n\nInvestigations Unit and assigned to a Protective Investigator who looked into the\n\nallegations of the complaint under the supervision of a Protective Investigations\n\nSupervisor.

The capacity thereafter\nfluctuated from time to time on re-licensing. For example, the capacity was five in 1992, three\nand later four in 1994, five in 1995, and seven in 1997.

If the Department’s legal staff agreed with the Investigator\n\nthat the facts supporting removal sufficiently established probable cause, the\n\nDepartment would then file an emergency shelter petition with the circuit court and\n\nrequest a hearing. Fla. Stat. § 39.401(3).\n\n       Thereafter, within 24 hours of the child’s removal, a detention or “shelter”\n\nhearing had to be convened before the circuit court. Fla. Stat. §§ 39.401(3),\n\n39.402(5)(a).30 At the hearing, the court would appoint a guardian ad litem\n\n(“GAL”) to “represent the child” unless it found that “such representation [was]\n\nunnecessary.” Fla. Stat. § 39.402(7)(a).31 The court would then hear from the\n\nProtective Investigator assigned to the case and the child’s custodian to determine\n\nwhether the “probable cause” standard had been met warranting the child’s\n\ndetention. Id. If the court found that it had, it would order the Department to\n\n\n29\n  Reasonable grounds for removal included: “the child has been abused, neglected, or\nabandoned, or is suffering from or is in imminent danger of illness or injury as a result of abuse,\nneglect, or abandonment.” Fla.

If the\n\nfoster home the Placement Unit selected was operating at its licensed capacity, the\n\nPlacement Unit would initiate a waiver process; a waiver, if granted, would permit\n\n                                    5\nthe placement to go forward.            3\n\n\n\n         The waiver process proceeded as follows. The Placement Supervisor\n\nconferred with the Licensing Supervisor who had been responsible for licensing or\n\nre-licensing the foster parent – and thus was acquainted with the home at issue –\n\nregarding the appropriateness of the placement. If these Supervisors agreed that an\n\novercapacity waiver would be appropriate, they would submit a written waiver\n\nrequest to the POA of Licensing and Placement, to a Family Services Specialist,\n\nand to the Child Welfare Director.36 Compl. ¶ 41. If these officials agreed that a\n\nwaiver should issue, they would approve the waiver and the child would be placed\n\nin the foster home.\n\n35\n     The Florida Administrative Code provided:\n\n         Generally there should be no more than five children in a home, including the\n         substitute care parents’ own children. These criteria may be varied for good\n         cause and with the written approval of the Family Safety and Preservation\n         program office. If a family has the emotional and physical capacity to nurture\n         more than five children, it is not against policy to establish a capacity above the\n         rule of five. A family must have the physical room and emotional capacity to\n         provide this care.\n\nFla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 65C-13.011(2)(b). There is no allegation that the approval of the\nFamily Safety and Preservation program office was not obtained with respect to placing more\nthan five children in the Calhoun home.\n36\n     The Program Administrator could be substituted for the Child Welfare Director.\n\n                                                  20\n\f       In deciding whether to grant an overcapacity waiver, the Department’s\n\nLicensing Manual required that the following questions be addressed:\n\n       1.      Is this the only resource available for the children [needing] placement?\n               Have all available homes been considered and has it been determined that\n               this particular home is the most appropriate?\n       2.      Can the home physically accommodate the additional child/children? This\n               includes a bed, adequate closet space and room for personal possessions.\n       3.      Can the substitute parents meet the needs of another child or children? Is\n               help, relief, or other support available to the family? Is the family managing\n               well with the children already in the home? Will the addition of another\n               child/children affect the quality of care being given to the children currently\n               in the home?\n       4.      Can the children already in placement in the home accept additional\n               children? Are there any children in the home who are particularly\n               vulnerable? Can those children be adequately protected?\n       5.      What is the planned duration of the new capacity? 73\n\n       Once the child was placed in a foster home, a Foster Care Supervisor would\n\nassign the child’s case to a caseworker, also known as a Family Services\n\nCounselor.38 According to the complaint, the Family Services Counselor was\n\nresponsible for communicating the child’s background information to the foster\n\nparents and formulating a plan of care if the child had a history of sexual abuse or\n\n\n\n\n37\n   Compl. ¶ 42. As the elaborate approval process and multifactor analysis suggest, the Department had\na strong presumption in favor of upholding the original licensed capacity of the home as established by\nthe Licensing Unit; granting an overcapacity waiver, therefore, meant that under the circumstances, the\naddition of a child to a particular foster home would not depreciate the quality of care being provided\nthere.\n38\n  The formal transfer of the child’s case from the Protective Investigations Unit to the Foster\nCare Unit did not normally occur until after the child had been declared a dependent.\n\n                                                21\n\fvictimization in order to guard against further sexual assaults.39 Additionally, the\n\ncounselor was required to visit the child at least monthly40 and, as alleged in the\n\ncomplaint, assess the safety of the placement and report any concerns about the\n\ncondition of the foster home to the Licensing Unit or any suspected abuse or\n\nneglect to the District’s abuse prevention hotline. If the foster parents ever came to\n\nbelieve that they were no longer able to manage the child in their home, the Family\n\nServices Counselor would work with the foster parents and the child to remedy the\n\nissues that prompted the removal request and would help facilitate the replacement\n\nprocess if the problems were not corrected.

M.M.’s Placement\n\n       On January 6, 1997, 12-year-old M.M., who had an extensive history of\n\npsychological problems and violent outbursts, threatened to harm himself and\n\nseveral family members with a knife. M.M. was thereafter involuntarily\n\ncommitted to an in-patient psychiatric facility.41 On January 14, 1997, while M.M.\n\n39\n   The District staff and foster parents were required to “outline a plan of care to handle any\nspecial management issues identified in the child’s history and assessment” to help prevent\nsexual assaults from occurring in the foster home.

Katherine Kaufman, the POA of Protective\n\nInvestigations, subsequently contacted a contract mental health services provider\n\nabout placing M.M. in a residential treatment facility. The provider responded that\n\nit could only offer M.M. and his family in-home therapeutic services.42 Thus, upon\n\nhis release from the hospital, M.M. returned home on January 23, 1997, and began\n\nto receive in-home therapy. M.M.’s violent behavior resumed, and fearing for her\n\nsafety and the safety of her daughter, M.M.’s mother asked that he be removed\n\nfrom her home.\n\n        M.M. was placed in the Department’s custody at the Lippman Shelter – a\n\nshort-term residential shelter – on February 3, 1997. On that date, Protective\n\nInvestigator Susan Worsley was assigned to M.M.’s case and was informed of\n\nM.M.’s psychological and behavioral history. Shortly after his placement, on\n\nFebruary 12, 1997, Worsley was told that M.M. could no longer remain at the\n\n\nmentally ill, and, inter alia, there is a substantial likelihood that, based on recent behavior, the\nperson will inflict serious bodily harm on himself or another person.” Turner v. Crosby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76237\"><a href=\"/opinion/76237/turner-v-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1256 n.7 (11th Cir. 2003).\n42\n   A 1991 study conducted by the Department reported that 94% of foster care counselors\n“stated that residential treatment for sexual offenders was either not available in their district or\navailable in a limited area or on a limited basis.” Compl. ¶ 50. This shortage apparently had not\nbeen alleviated by the time Kaufman inquired about a residential treatment facility for M.M. in\nJanuary 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fshelter because of his background and need for 24-hour one-on-one supervision.43\n\nWorsley therefore contacted the Placement Unit to inquire about a new placement\n\nfor M.M.; she suggested the Calhoun home. An inquiry was conducted into\n\nM.M.’s behavioral history and special needs, as well as the make-up of the five\n\nchildren already in the Calhoun home.44 An overcapacity waiver to permit M.M. to\n\nbe placed in the Calhoun home was considered and approved by a Placement\n\nSupervisor, by Margaret Andrews (then a Licensing Supervisor), by Sharon\n\nWoodroof (a Family Services Specialist), by Jennifer Chang (POA of Licensing\n\nand Placement), and by the Child Welfare Director. Accordingly, on February 14,\n\n1997, Worsley placed M.M. with the Calhouns, and on March 24, 1997, M.M. was\n\nadjudicated dependant. M.M. was then assigned to Sharon Pollack, a Family\n\nServices Counselor; there is no allegation that Pollack failed to perform regular\n\nmonthly visits to M.M. in the Calhoun home from March 24 through August 1997.\n\nPollack was again assigned to M.M. from May through September 1998; plaintiffs\n\nallege that she visited him only once during this time, on June 25, 1998.\n\n\n\n43\n     It is unclear from the complaint who provided the District 10 officials with this information.\n44\n  In addition to 12-year-old M.M., I deduce from the complaint that the other children in the\nhome were R.D., a 17-year-old child who had lived in the home since 1992; B.J., who was about\n17 years old; R.T., who was about 13 years old; and two other children of unknown age, one of\nwhom was R.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f                                   2. D.L.’s Placement\n\n       On June 27, 1995, after numerous allegations of abuse, 11-year-old D.L. was\n\nadjudicated dependent and placed in the custody of his stepfather. In late August\n\nof that year, the Department received a report that D.L. had sexually abused a\n\nyounger boy who was also residing in his stepfather’s home. In addition, the\n\nreport indicated that D.L. himself was the victim of sexual abuse. D.L. would\n\nremain in the home for over a year, until approximately December 6, 1996, when\n\nhe was removed from his stepfather’s custody and placed in a shelter home. D.L.\n\nwas adjudicated dependent on January 3, 1997, and moved to a foster home four\n\ndays later.\n\n       On April 7, 1997, D.L. admitted to a Department official that he had\n\nsexually assaulted three or four young boys who lived near the foster home where\n\nhe was residing. After the foster parents requested that D.L. be immediately\n\nremoved, an overcapacity waiver for the Calhoun home was requested and was\n\napproved by Department officials, including Woodroof, a Family Services\n\nSpecialist, and Chang, POA of Licensing and Placement.45 D.L. was subsequently\n\nplaced in the Calhoun home by Loubert Desmangles, a Family Services Counselor,\n\n45\n   Plaintiffs do not identify the other officials involved in the waiver process, but they\npresumably included a Placement Supervisor, a Licensing Supervisor, and the Child Welfare\nDirector.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\fon April 8, 1997;46 the home now housed seven foster children.47 There is no\n\nallegation that Desmangles failed to make regular visits to D.L. in the Calhoun\n\nhome.48 From February 27 to May 5, 1998, Pollack temporarily served as D.L.’s\n\ncaseworker; plaintiffs allege that she visited him at the Calhoun home on only one\n\noccasion – March 5, 1998. Susan Wilburn, another Family Services Counselor,\n\nwas then assigned to D.L.’s case from May 12 until September 11, 1998, when she\n\nleft the Department. There is no allegation that Wilburn failed to visit D.L.\n\nregularly.\n\n           D. Placement of Plaintiffs N.M. and R.M. in the Calhoun Home\n\n       On September 23, 1993, N.M. and his younger brother, R.M., were\n\nadjudicated dependent and placed in their father’s custody. In early June 1994, the\n\nDepartment received a report that N.M. had been sexually abused by his male\n\n\n46\n   The complaint does not indicate whether Desmangles also served as D.L.’s counselor prior to\nhis placement in the Calhoun home.\n47\n   From the complaint, I deduce that in addition to D.L. – who was now twelve years old – the\nsix other children were 17-year-old R.D., 17-year-old B.J., 13-year-old R.T., 12-year-old M.M.,\nand two other children, one of whom may have been in the tenth grade. R.B. had left the\nCalhoun home a few days earlier, on April 2, 1997.\n48\n   The exact duration of time that Desmangles served as counselor to D.L. is unclear from the\ncomplaint. The complaint suggests that Desmangles was still D.L.’s counselor as of July 1,\n1997, but there is no indication of whether he continued to serve in that capacity until Pollack\nbecame D.L.’s counselor on February 27, 1998. Regardless, there is no allegation that whoever\nserved as D.L.’s counselor from July 1, 1997 to February 27, 1998 failed to visit him regularly in\nthe Calhoun home.\n\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fbabysitter. Approximately four years later, N.M. and R.M. were moved from their\n\nfather’s home to shelter care and, on April 6, 1998, placed in the legal and physical\n\ncustody of the Department. Due to their behavioral problems, 8-year-old N.M. and\n\n5-year-old R.M. were placed in several different foster homes before arriving at the\n\nCalhoun home on April 24 and May 6, 1998, respectively. Eleven foster children\n\nwere now living in the Calhoun home.49 From May 21 through September 11,\n\n1998, Wilburn served as Family Services Counselor to N.M. and R.M., in addition\n\nto D.L.50 There are no allegations that she failed to visit these three children\n\nregularly in the home.\n\n                                  E. Home by Home Review\n\n       In August of 1998, the Department began a Home by Home Review of\n\napproximately 50 “high priority” homes that District 10 identified as being\n\n\n\n49\n   Plaintiffs allege that no overcapacity waivers were requested for N.M. or R.M. at the time “as\nno waiver could be approved”; according to the complaint, this was because the May 16, 1997\nre-licensing of the Calhoun home had restricted the home to the seven children already living\nthere. The Calhoun home was re-licensed on June 1, 1998. A waiver for R.M.’s placement in\nthe Calhoun home was subsequently approved on November 23, 1998, with Corinne Millikan, a\nFamily Services Specialist, allegedly participating in the approval. The complaint does not\nallege when the waiver for N.M.’s placement was approved.\n        According to the complaint, granting an overcapacity waiver after the child had been\nplaced in the foster home violated Department policy.\n50\n   The complaint does not indicate who subsequently became counselor to N.M., R.M., and\nD.L., but there is no specific allegation that these three children were not assigned a caseworker\nbetween September 11, 1998 and November 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fovercapacity or having had some previous report of abuse or neglect. Woodroof\n\nand Chang had designated the Calhoun home as one of the high-priority homes to\n\nbe reviewed. As part of the Review, multiple foster children in the Calhoun home\n\nwere interviewed, the foster children’s records were inspected, and the home’s\n\nlicensing records were examined. On September 8, 1998, the results of the Review\n\nwere issued in a report, copies of which went to Feaver, Brown, Kaufman,\n\nMillikan, Woodroof, and Chang. Compl. ¶ 147.\n\n       Among other things, the report described the Calhoun home as “cramped,”\n\nwith eight children, two of whom, D.L. and M.M., had histories of sexual\n\nperpetration and mental health problems.51 M.M., D.L., and others required the\n\nfrequent attention of mental health technicians visiting the home. Notably, N.M.\n\nwas one of the children who was interviewed by the reviewers; his claim of\n\nmaltreatment was that “everyone at the home was mean to him.” Compl. ¶ 144.\n\nThe Review contained no report of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun\n\n51\n   The following information was documented about the Calhoun home in the report: (1) eleven\nindividuals resided in the Calhoun home – Mr. Calhoun, Joann Calhoun, their son G. Brock (one\nof the Calhouns’ natural children who was living in the home at the time), and eight foster\nchildren; (2) the house was “cramped” and there were often up to three mental health technicians\nin the home visiting the children; (3) Mr. Calhoun would discipline one of the children by\nspanking; (4) D.L. had a history of sexual perpetration; (5) M.M. had a history of sexual and\nphysical aggression; (6) D.L. should not be allowed to sleep in the same room with younger\nchildren; and (7) N.M. informed the reviewers that everyone in the house was mean to him. The\nreport also noted that previously there were multiple “direct[ives] to limit the number of children\nand reduce capacity” that had not been followed.

District 10 responded to the report’s findings by preparing and\n\nimplementing “Corrective Action Plans” for each of the 50 homes.\n\n         F. Placement of A.P. in the Calhoun Home and Report of Sexual Abuse\n\n         Around May 11, 1998, A.P. was ordered into the legal and physical custody\n\nof the Department. Eight-year-old A.P. had a documented history of sexual\n\nvictimization and perpetration, having previously acted out sexually on his younger\n\nsister. A.P. was placed in the Calhoun home on September 17, 1998, which\n\nbrought the total number of foster children to nine. 25\n\n A waiver approving A.P.’s placement in the Calhoun home was obtained about\n\neleven days later; Corinne Millikan, a Family Services Specialist, was allegedly\n\none of the persons who participated in the approval.\n\n         On November 23, 1998,53 A.P. told his natural mother’s therapist that he was\n\nbeing subjected to repeated sexual abuse by the other foster children in the\n\nCalhoun home, particularly by M.M. and D.L.54 This information was immediately\n\n\n\n\n52\n   Three children had left the home since the placements of N.M. and R.M. on April 24 and May\n6, 1998, respectively.\n53\n     The population of the Calhoun home had risen to thirteen foster children by this time.\n54\n   The complaint alleges that A.P., N.M., and R.M. were all subjected to regular abuse from the\ntime of their placement in the Calhoun home until their removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  29\n\freported to the abuse prevention hotline,55 and A.P. was removed from the Calhoun\n\nhome on November 23, 1998.\n\n       On November 24, 1998, an emergency meeting was called before Judge\n\nBirken, who concurred in the Department’s decision to remove A.P. from the\n\nhome. Pursuant to a court order, N.M. and R.M. were removed from the Calhoun\n\nhome that same day, and 24-hour “awake” supervision was imposed on the home\n\nto prevent any further child-on-child sexual activity. The Department also\n\nimmediately commenced an investigation into the allegations. The investigation\n\nconcluded on December 3, 1998, with a finding that there were “no indicators of\n\nabuse.” The 24-hour awake supervision was subsequently canceled on December\n\n11, 1998.

Rather, plaintiffs claim that it was the\n\ndefendants’ failure to act on plaintiffs’ behalf, their failure to follow DCF\n\nguidelines and regulatory mandates and to heed warnings, that led to the abuse.\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument is, in short, that the defendants each were positioned either to\n\nprevent the abuse from occurring or to curtail further abuse once it had begun and,\n\nby failing to do so, violated the substantive component of the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n       As an initial matter, it is important to expound upon the difference between a\n\n§ 1983 suit seeking injunctive relief and the case before us, a § 1983 suit for\n\ndamages. The defendant-officials in a suit for injunctive relief, as was the case in\n\nWard v. Feaver, are those individuals who have the power to provide the plaintiffs\n\nwith an adequate remedy – not necessarily the officials who actually violated the\n\nplaintiffs’ rights. The latter question is largely irrelevant in the equitable relief\n\ncontext; that is, it does not matter who specifically violated the rights of the\n\nplaintiffs, merely that the plaintiffs are suffering an ongoing violation of their\n\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\frights and the defendants before the court have the authority to stop it from\n\ncontinuing.\n\n       In a suit for damages, on the other hand, the crucial inquiry is whether each\n\nof the defendant-officials personally violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\n\nIndividual liability under § 1983 cannot arise vicariously through a theory of\n\nrespondeat superior.

The only relevant and specific allegation was that “one of the seven\ndefendants knew that Julian had previously entered the bathroom [several times] when it was\noccupied by Jorge T.,” which we concluded was insufficient “to support the inference that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to Jorge T. existed.” Id. at 955–56.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fthird prongs of McElligott.\n\n      To guide this decision, I look to some of the cases that have addressed what\n\nconstitutes subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.

Appx. 373 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(unpublished), there was no evidence that the defendants’ failure to draw the\n\ninference that the minor children were being abused “was anything other than an\n\nunfortunate miscue.” See Omar, 177 Fed. Appx. at 64. To establish that the\n\nofficials were on notice of a serious risk of abuse, the plaintiff in Omar presented\n\nevidence that after he was placed in the foster home, but before his adoption was\n\napproved by the Department, the suspicion of abuse was raised but later dismissed\n\nby the Department after a doctor found multiple “loop marks” on the plaintiff’s\n\nbody and was “concerned that these marks might have resulted from abuse.” Id. at\n\n61. Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that the officials were aware that he\n\ndisplayed evidence of various psychological problems and physical illness\n\nfollowing his placement. Id. at 61–64. These allegations were held to be an\n\ninsufficient predicate for a claim of deliberate indifference because “there was no\n\nevidence . . . that any of the [defendants] actually drew the inference that these\n\nfacts meant [the child] was being abused.” Id. at 63–64. The court in Maldonado\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\flikewise concluded that the evidence was too weak to support the allegation that\n\ndefendants were actually aware of the risk of harm to the plaintiff prior to her\n\ninjury. 168 Fed. Appx. at 383–85 (considering a sore which the child’s doctor\n\nconcluded was impetigo, rather than a cigarette burn; a cut described in an incident\n\nreport as a “small gash under left eye,” possibly caused accidentally from playing\n\nwith a toy; and a statement made by the aggressor after the child’s injury had\n\noccurred).\n\n      In Nichols v. Maynard, 204 Fed. Appx. 826 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished),\n\nin which a 5-year-old foster child was sexually abused by an older foster child, JK,\n\nwe concluded both that the defendants were not subjectively aware of a substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm, and that they did not recklessly disregard any such risk. The\n\ncomplaint made two allegations that were the focus of the court’s review. First, it\n\nalleged that the officials “deliberately and recklessly disregarded adverse\n\ninformation regarding JK’s background of sexually acting out and deliberately\n\nignored the obvious, serious risk of harm JK’s placement . . . presented to\n\n[plaintiff] and the other children in the foster home.” Id. at 828 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). In support of this allegation, the plaintiff asserted that the officials\n\nhad actual knowledge of the following facts: (1) “JK had sexually acted out in at\n\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\fleast five prior foster homes”; (2) “JK got into bed naked with one of his foster\n\nparents’ natural sons”; and (3) “JK had been sexually victimized numerous times in\n\nprior foster homes.” Id. at 828–29 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the\n\ncomplaint alleged that the defendants “deliberately violated their own department\n\nguidelines by placing JK, in an already overcrowded home, in a bedroom with\n\nyounger children.” Id. at 828.\n\n      Observing that “the records indicate that JK’s part in sexual abuse had been\n\nas a victim, not an aggressor,” we concluded that the alleged facts did not\n\ndemonstrate that the defendants were on notice of “any serious risk of harm to [the\n\n5-year-old child].” Id. at 829. Moreover, even assuming that the defendants had\n\nbeen aware of a substantial risk of serious harm, the allegations describing the\n\ndefendants’ actions showed that the defendants did not recklessly disregard that\n\nrisk through their conduct. Id. Three days after placing JK in the home, the\n\ndefendants had “informed the foster parents of JK’s history of being a sexual abuse\n\nvictim,” and that after the sexual abuse incident occurred months later, the\n\ndefendants “removed JK and conducted an investigation into the incident.” Id.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      In addition to our foster care decisions, prison cases are also instructive on\n\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fthe issue of notice because these decisions originally served as the theoretical\n\nunderpinnings of our decision in Taylor – which first recognized a child’s\n\nconstitutional right to physical safety and freedom from unnecessary harm while in\n\nfoster care. However, it is important to note a caveat that must be observed when\n\nconsidering these cases. Although we recognized in Taylor that foster homes are\n\nsufficiently “analogous” to penal institutions to support a § 1983 action, we\n\ncautioned that the contexts “are not parallel.” 818 F.2d at 796. We echoed the\n\nSecond Circuit’s earlier observations in Doe v. New York City Department of\n\nSocial Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390440\"><a href=\"/opinion/390440/maria-doe-and-cruz-doe-individually-and-on-behalf-of-their-minor-son/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1981):\n\n          There is a closer and firmer line of authority running from\n   superiors and subordinates within [a penal] institution than exists in\n   the foster care context, particularly in respect of the relationship\n   between agency personnel and the foster parent. [Prison]\n   administrators can readily call in subordinates for consultation. They\n   can give strict orders with reasonable assurance that their mandates\n   will be followed, and as added insurance other employees stationed in\n   proximity of the subordinates to whom orders are directed may be\n   instructed to monitor compliance.\n          By contrast, the [foster care agency] had to rely upon\n   occasional visits for its information gathering, and its relationship to\n   the foster family was less unequivocally hierarchical than is the case\n   with prison guards and a warden.\n\nId. at 142; see also Taylor, 818 F.2d at 796 (“Obviously, a closer relationship\n\nexists between superior officers, subordinate officers, and the inmates within a\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fprison than exists between a state agency, the foster parents, and the foster child in\n\na foster care setting. In a penal institution, all the persons involved are in close and\n\ndaily contact. Wardens and supervisors have the ability to daily monitor the\n\nactivities of subordinates as well as the effect of certain conduct upon inmates.”).64\n\nSimply put, it is the foster care parents, not DCF officials, who are comparable to\n\nthe prison warden and guards; the foster parents are the ones with primary\n\nresponsibility for the safety of the children. Certain DCF officials are more\n\nanalogous to officials in the Federal Bureau of Prisons whose posts are remote\n\nfrom the correctional facility. Based on this distinction, we asserted that “[t]he\n\nlack of proximity in the foster home [between the children and state officials] . . .\n\nsuggests that deliberate indifference is not as easily inferred or shown from a\n\nfailure to act.” Taylor, 818 F.2d at 796. Children in plaintiffs’ situation\n\nconsequently “will be faced with the difficult problem of showing actual\n\nknowledge of abuse or that agency personnel deliberately failed to learn what was\n\noccurring in the foster home.” Id.\n\n64\n   Furthermore, as noted by the partial dissent in Taylor, there are also normative pressures\nconstricting the supervisory role of officials in the foster care context that their counterparts in\nprisons do not face. “[T]o give the child a normal family environment, foster care officials\nunderstandably feel ‘constrained to respect the foster family’s autonomy and integrity[,] and\n[feel] pressured to minimize intrusiveness,’” a pressure that prison officials do not feel as “their\nrole is to monitor and control an inmate’s environment and activities on a day-to-day basis.\nConsequently, prison officials will normally have more information available to them about the\nconditions of an inmate’s confinement than officials overseeing foster care will have about the\nconditions of a foster home placement.” Taylor, 818 F.2d at 815 (Tjoflat, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (quoting Doe v.

In\n\nfinding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the officials had “a subjective\n\nawareness of a substantial risk of serious physical threat,” id. at 1350, we were\n\nunpersuaded that the following allegations constituted sufficient notice: (1) the\n\nofficials “clearly knew” that the plaintiff’s cellmate was a “problem inmate” who\n\nhad “a well-documented history of prison disobedience and had been prone to\n\nviolence”; and (2) the officials had “specific notice” that the inmate was “act[ing]\n\ncrazy, roaming his cell like a caged animal,” was planning to fake a hanging in\n\n\n\n\n                                            49\n\forder to be transferred to the medical prison, and had informed the plaintiff that he\n\nwould have to help with the fake hanging “one way or another.” Id. at 1349.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

(emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe observed that although the plaintiff had complained to the defendants many\n\ntimes about his cellmate’s “crazy” actions, the “Plaintiff never told [the\n\ndefendants] that Plaintiff feared [his cellmate] or that [his cellmate] clearly\n\nthreatened Plaintiff.” Id. In short:\n\n      Defendants only possessed an awareness of [the attacker’s] propensity\n      for being a problematic inmate; to find Defendants sufficiently\n      culpable would unduly reduce awareness to a more objective standard,\n      rather than the required subjective standard set by the Supreme Court.\n      Such a generalized awareness of risk in these circumstances does not\n      satisfy the subjective awareness requirement.\n\nId. at 1350; see also id. (noting that the defendant-official remained “unaware of a\n\nparticularized threat or fear felt by Plaintiff in regards to rooming with [the\n\naggressor],” and that allegations of “a generalized awareness of risk” are\n\n\n\n\n                                           50\n\finsufficient to meet the subjective awareness requirement) (emphasis added).\n\n       In Marsh v.

Id. at 1023–24. Amidst the\n\nparade of horribles presented in the complaint, we focused on certain allegations\n\nthat indicated the inmates had ready access to makeshift weapons fashioned “by\n\ncannibalizing parts of the decaying building”; that the guards were unable to lock\n\ndown the free-roaming inmates because the locks to cell doors did not work; and\n\nthat there was no visual or audio surveillance of inmates – indeed, “jailers were\n\nafraid to conduct visual inspections.” Id. at 1024–25, 1028. Consequently, the\n\ninmates, who were mostly housed on the second floor of the building, had no\n\n“means to contact guards other than by screaming or banging on the walls.” Id. at\n\n1025.65 In support of their deliberate indifference claim against the sheriff in her\n\n65\n   The complaint also alleged that the prisoners “were not screened for mental health, medical\nconditions or conflicts with other prisoners before entering the Jail”; once inside, “there was no\nsegregation of nonviolent inmates from violent inmates, pretrial detainees from convicted\ncriminals, juveniles from adults, or inmates with mental disorders from those without mental\ndisorders”; “the Jail was routinely understaffed,” with often only one jailer on duty at a time;\n“prisoners were not disciplined or segregated when they attempted to escape, threatened jailers,\ndestroyed property or assaulted other inmates”; and “no head counts of prisoners were made to\n\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\findividual capacity, the plaintiffs alleged that the sheriff was subjectively aware of\n\nthe risk and offered evidence that she was provided with (1) “faultfinding,\n\ninspection reports by state agencies, reports outlining the conditions that existed at\n\nthe Jail”; (2) “many complaints from prisoners and requests for assistance”; (3)\n\n“correspondence from prisoners’ lawyers detailing the staffing problems and\n\nwarning of a ‘serious threat to the safety of inmates’”; and (4) “a lawsuit filed in\n\nthe district court [prior to the attacks], seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on\n\nbehalf of the inmates at the Jail.” Id. at 1029. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat the dangerous conditions at the jail were “longstanding and pervasive.” Id. In\n\nlight of these allegations, we held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pled that the\n\nsheriff was “subjectively aware of the substantial risk to inmate safety at the Jail.”\n\nId.\n\n       What I discern from Marsh is that the alleged prison conditions and the\n\nnotice provided to the defendant were of such a nature that the inference that the\n\ndefendant subjectively knew of a substantial risk of inmate-on-inmate attack was\n\ninescapable. In other words, “a substantial risk of inmate attacks was\n\nlongstanding, pervasive, well-documented, [and] expressly noted by prison\n\n\n\nmake sure they were all accounted for.” Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1029.\n\n\n\n\n                                              52\n\fofficials in the past, and the circumstances suggest[ed] that [the defendant] had\n\nbeen exposed to information concerning the risk and thus must have known about\n\nit” – not merely that “a reasonable person would have known, or that the defendant\n\nshould have known.” See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, 843 & n.8, 114 S.

Id. at 1580. The plaintiff\n\nsought damages due to the defendants’ alleged deliberate indifference to the\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm that he faced while in their custody. Id. With\n\nrespect to the sheriff, the plaintiff offered affidavits, depositions, and other\n\nevidence to support a finding that the sheriff “subjectively knew that a substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm existed at the jail.” Id. at 1583. Specifically, among other\n\nthings, the plaintiff pointed to the sheriff’s deposition where he testified that “he\n\nknew that inmate-on-inmate violence was occurring on a regular basis during [the\n\ntime period of the attack] and other periods of overcrowding” and also that “he\n\nknew the violence sometimes resulted in injuries requiring medical treatment.” Id.\n\n(emphases added). We further noted that the plaintiff was not required to show\n\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\fthat the sheriff “knew precisely who would attack whom, but only that [he] had\n\nsubjective knowledge of a generalized, substantial risk of serious harm from\n\ninmate violence.” Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Based on\n\nthese allegations, we found that the evidence would sufficiently allow a reasonable\n\njury to conclude that the plaintiff had satisfied the notice standard. Id. at 1585.\n\n                                           3.\n\n      Informed by the deliberate indifference case law, I reach several\n\nconclusions. First, allegations that the official actually knew that the plaintiff was\n\nbeing abused satisfy the subjective knowledge standard. Second, allegations that\n\nthe official missed or misread warning signs that the plaintiff was in danger, or\n\nallegations that the officials failed to follow established departmental guidelines or\n\nprocedures are tantamount to allegations of negligence, and are insufficient to\n\nestablish subjective knowledge of a strong likelihood of serious harm. And third,\n\nallegations that an official was aware of the risk to others created by an\n\nindividual’s generally violent or troubled history are likewise insufficient. As we\n\nnoted in Purcell v. Toombs County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76841\"><a href=\"/opinion/76841/mollie-jo-purcell-v-toombs-county-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1323 (11th Cir. 2005), “[i]n\n\nthe jail setting, a risk of harm to some degree always exists by the nature of its\n\nbeing a jail.” Cf. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845, 114 S. Ct. at 1983 (noting due regard\n\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\ffor the fact that prison officials are appointed the “unenviable task of keeping\n\ndangerous men in safe custody under humane conditions” (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)). That is why we held in Carter v. Galloway that even in the\n\ninsular context of the prison community, “before [defendant-officials’] awareness\n\narises to a sufficient level of culpability, there must be much more than mere\n\nawareness of [the aggressor’s] generally problematic nature,” proclivity to\n\nviolence, or “propensity for being a problematic inmate.” 352 F.3d at 1349–50\n\n(emphasis added). The same holds true in the foster care context. The children\n\nwho have been removed from their homes, detained, adjudicated dependents, and\n\nthen placed into foster care are, almost by definition, “at risk” or “troubled.”66\n\nOfficials must have specific notice of something “much more” than that they are\n\nworking with inherently “at risk” children before they are considered to be\n\nsubjectively aware of a substantial risk of serious harm.\n\n       Indeed, a rule that specific knowledge of a child’s prior history of sexual\n\naggression is alone sufficient to constitute actual notice that the child poses a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm would be particularly ill-advised in the foster care\n\ncontext. It would effectively substitute our own judgment for the professional\n\n66\n   See supra note 2. According to plaintiffs’ complaint, “approximately 80% of the children\ncoming into foster care had significant emotional and/or behavioral problems with 27% having a\nhistory of sexual abuse.” Compl. ¶ 56.\n\n\n\n\n                                              55\n\fjudgment of DCF officials. For example, when approving an overcapacity waiver,\n\nthe Licensing Manual requires five specific officials to consider a multitude of\n\nfactors, including the suitability of the home for the particular needs of the child,\n\nthe effect on the quality of care, and the needs of the other children already in the\n\nhome.67 Such a rule would unduly constrict the latitude an official would otherwise\n\nhave to determine that, upon consideration of the factors and the specific history of\n\nthe child, a therapeutic setting such as the Calhoun home – where there had been\n\nno reported incidents of child-on-child sexual abuse for the six years before the\n\nNovember 23, 1998 report – is an appropriate placement that would not pose a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.68\n\n\n67\n     See supra text accompanying note 35.\n68\n   Risk is not a fixed quantity; context modulates the magnitude of the risk. See Gish v.\nThomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77945\"><a href=\"/opinion/77945/gish-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954–55 (11th Cir. 2008) (“To be deliberately indifferent to a strong\nlikelihood that the prisoner will commit suicide, the official must be subjectively aware that the\ncombination of the prisoner’s suicidal tendencies and the feasibility of suicide in the context of\nthe prisoner’s surroundings creates a strong likelihood that the prisoner will commit suicide.”).\nTrained professionals such as DCF officials are better equipped to navigate the complex inquiry\nof which home, with which foster parents, and with which other foster children will best mediate\nthe risk posed by a particular child with a so-called “history of sexual perpetration.” As the\ncomplaint itself evidences, the classification of a particular child as a “sexual abuse perpetrator”\nas opposed to a “sexual abuse victim” is not always clear-cut. One could also believe that a\nchild who has committed an isolated incident of sexual assault might not always be regarded by\na trained professional as a sexual abuse perpetrator or a child posing a substantial risk of sexual\nabuse to any other child he or she might encounter. Group dynamics, the experience and training\nof foster parents, the age and characteristics of the sexual abuse perpetrators, and the age and\ncharacteristics of the other children in the home are also significant considerations; certainly a\nchild might pose a risk to one child in a given context and yet not another.\n\n\n\n\n                                                56\n\f      The deliberate indifference standard is compatible with a degree of\n\ndeference to such good-faith professional determinations. Because the deliberate\n\nindifference analysis involves a subjective test, it does not matter if other judges,\n\nsocial workers, therapists, etc. believe that the plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm if the defendants themselves do not share that belief – that is, they\n\n“must also draw the inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S. Ct. at 1979; cf. id.\n\nat 844, 114 S. Ct. at 1983 (“Prison officials charged with deliberate indifference\n\nmight show . . . that they knew the underlying facts but believed (albeit unsoundly)\n\nthat the risk to which the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.”).\n\nReceiving an isolated warning is not the same as believing the contents of that\n\nwarning. For example, the weatherman may advise us that there is a high\n\nprobability of precipitation, but we may look outside, make our own observations,\n\nand draw our own conclusions that the weatherman – though an “expert” – is\n\nwrong; we believe that rain is very unlikely. While we may or may not be\n\nnegligent, we would certainly not be deliberately indifferent to the risk that it will\n\nrain. The same principle applies a fortiori in this context: we are dealing not with\n\nlay persons receiving advice from experts, but with trained experts in child welfare,\n\nDCF officials, receiving and evaluating advice from persons of varying degrees of\n\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\fexperience.\n\n      In addition to these observations, it is important to bear in mind the potential\n\nsources of notice in our case. In other words, an official’s subjective belief about\n\nthe safety of the children in the Calhoun home would have been formed on the\n\nbasis of numerous sources of information: Mr. Calhoun and Joann Calhoun; G.\n\nBrock, the Calhouns’ son; GALs; family members (or those entitled to visit the\n\nfoster child); people in the community (e.g., teachers, doctors, dentists, therapists,\n\ncoaches, friends from school, parents of friends); the circuit judges presiding over\n\ndependency proceedings; other Department employees, especially the caseworkers\n\nassigned to the foster children; and the foster children themselves.\n\n                                           V.\n\n      Although the complaint alleges that M.M. and D.L. began to engage in\n\nsexual activities with other children soon after their placement, there is no\n\nallegation that any of the defendants, the Department, or even the Calhouns ever\n\nhad actual knowledge that these acts were occurring at any time before November\n\n23, 1998, the day that sexual abuse of A.P. was reported to the hotline. Therefore,\n\nthe question is whether the complaint sufficiently alleges that each defendant knew\n\nthat plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of such abuse in the home prior to\n\n\n\n\n                                           58\n\fNovember 23. I conclude that it does not.\n\n                                                A.\n\n         Before embarking on a defendant-by-defendant review of the allegations, I\n\npause to survey plaintiffs’ 265-page complaint against the backdrop of the legal\n\nlandscape. I discern several key features common to all of the defendants. First,\n\nthere is no allegation that any of the defendants turned renegade and acted\n\nunilaterally in licensing the Calhoun home or approving any of the overcapacity\n\nwaivers. The officials worked together – not in ad hoc teams, but in designated\n\nteams composed of five specific members of the Department so as to ensure that\n\nthe outcome would be the product of a collective decision-making process\n\naccording to Department protocol, with inherent checks and balances. Nor is there\n\nany allegation that the defendants who were involved in the waiver process failed\n\nto consider the requisite criteria set forth in the Licensing Manual. In the absence\n\nof a specific allegation to the contrary, therefore, I presume that the defendant-\n\nofficials acted in accordance with the law and that each overcapacity waiver was\n\napproved after each official had mentally performed the multifactor analysis\n\ndescribed above.69 Cf. Cont’l Bank & Trust Co. v. Brandon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"255933\"><a href=\"/opinion/255933/continental-bank-trust-company-as-receiver-for-inland-empire-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 932\n\n\n\n69\n     See supra text accompanying notes 35–37.\n\n\n\n\n                                                59\n\f(5th Cir. 1962) (“[I]t is a presumption of law that a public officer will faithfully\n\nperform his duty.”); Tecom, Inc. v.

Cl.\n\n2005) (noting that although the presumption of regularity does not entail clear and\n\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, “the burden of proving the non-occurrence of\n\npredicate acts required (by law or regulation) of public officials (such as the\n\nconsidering of certain facts, the review of applications, the receipt of\n\nauthorizations, etc.) falls on the party asserting their absence”).\n\n      Additionally, plaintiffs do not allege that any of the caseworkers\n\ncommunicated falsehoods, failed to report important information, or otherwise\n\nconcealed information from their supervisors or other units. This fact is\n\nparticularly significant, as there is no allegation that D.L. was not visited regularly\n\nin the Calhoun home by either Desmangles or by Wilburn – indeed, Wilburn also\n\nmade contemporaneous visits to R.M. and N.M., and there is no allegation that\n\nWilburn was aware of any child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. Nor\n\nis there any allegation that Pollack failed to visit M.M. regularly from the time of\n\nhis placement in March through August 1997. While plaintiffs allege that Pollack\n\nonly visited D.L. once from February 27 to May 5, 1998, and only visited M.M.\n\nonce from May 5 to September 1998, there is no allegation that her report of\n\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\finformation gathered from those visits was deficient in any way. Every official\n\ninvolved in the licensing or waiver approval process was therefore privy to what\n\nthe caseworkers knew and reported about the Calhoun home and the foster children\n\nliving there.\n\n       Finally, in reviewing the complaint, I remain cognizant of the factual\n\nimplications of plaintiffs’ allegations – that is, what plaintiffs do not allege is\n\nalmost as important as what they do allege. By the time the Home by Home\n\nReview report was issued on September 8, 1998, M.M. and D.L. had been living in\n\nthe Calhoun home for approximately 19 and 17 months, respectively. Presumably,\n\nthe last reported incidents of sexual assault involving M.M. and D.L. were even\n\nmore distant – occurring some time before January 1997 and April 1997,\n\nrespectively. Consistent with the Calhoun home’s track record, no one had ever\n\nreported that sexual abuse was occurring in the home – not any of the Calhouns;\n\nnot any of the caseworkers assigned to the children; not any of the children’s\n\nGALs; not any doctors or therapists or other community members such as teachers,\n\nfriends, or coaches; not any of the circuit judges handling dependency proceedings;\n\nand not any of the children themselves. Significantly, N.M. was one of the foster\n\nchildren who was interviewed in the Home by Home Review; he gave no\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\findication that he was being sexually abused in any fashion, only that everyone\n\nwas “mean to him.” Nothing in the review of the Calhoun home – none of the\n\ninterviews of the children that were conducted, none of the records that were\n\ninspected – indicated that anything sexually untoward was occurring in the home.\n\nThis same configuration of facts was in place for all of the defendants until the\n\nreport of A.P.’s abuse was made to the hotline on November 23, 1998.\n\n      What this survey reveals is that plaintiffs’ allegations boil down to\n\naccusations of negligent wrongdoing on the part of the defendants: that the\n\ndefendants failed to perform the requisite visits to foster children; that they failed\n\nto process overcapacity waivers on time; that they failed to investigate the home\n\nfurther; that they failed to take adequate measures to reduce overcrowding and\n\nimprove supervision; or that reasonable officials would have reviewed the\n\navailable information and come to a different conclusion about the strength of the\n\nrisk of sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. A number of plaintiffs’ allegations\n\nappear to disregard the reality of collective decision-making within the\n\norganizational hierarchy of the Department – the reality of officials assigned to\n\nspecific units and making joint decisions according to specific protocol – and fault\n\n\n\n\n                                           62\n\fthe defendants for failing to act unilaterally.70 Nevertheless, because even gross\n\nnegligence does not satisfy the standard of deliberate indifference, such allegations\n\nare insufficient as a matter of law to support claims for damages against the\n\ndefendants.\n\n                                                B.\n\n       I begin with the claims against the two defendants who occupied supervisory\n\npositions, Edward Feaver, Secretary of the Department, and Johnny Brown,\n\nDistrict Administrator of District 10, and recite the presumed facts and reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom on which those claims are based. I then proceed to the\n\nremaining defendants who occupied positions at varying levels in the Department.\n\n                                               1.\n\n\n\n70\n   For example, plaintiffs make conclusory allegations that defendants at all levels in the\nDepartment’s chain of command had “the ability, authority and the means” to remove or to\ndirect the removal of children from the Calhoun home: Feaver (Secretary of the Department),\nBrown (District Administrator), Kaufman (as Acting Child Welfare Director), Chang (as POA of\nLicensing and Placement), Kanaskie (as POA of Protective Investigations), Woodroof (as POA\nof “re-licensing and foster care”), Worsley (both as a Protective Investigator and as a Foster Care\nSupervisor), Andrews (as a Licensing Supervisor), Desmangles (Family Services Counselor),\nPollack (Family Services Counselor), and Wilburn (Family Services Counselor). The complaint\nimplicitly alleges, therefore, that each of the defendants had the ability to act out of the\nDepartment’s chain of command. Or put another way, the complaint alleges that there was no\neffective chain of command when it came to the removal of children from foster homes, as\nanyone – from the Secretary of the Department to the caseworker in the home – had “the ability,\nauthority and the means” to do so independently. Even assuming each of the defendants had\nsuch authority, however, plaintiffs’ allegations fall short of demonstrating deliberate\nindifference.\n\n\n\n\n                                                63\n\f      As Secretary of the Department, Feaver supervised all fifteen service\n\ndistricts. He was privy to numerous internal studies and reviews, media reports,\n\nand warnings from advocacy groups and the circuit judges who presided over\n\ndependency proceedings, stating that District 10’s foster homes were seriously\n\novercrowded and that children with histories of sexual abuse, both as victims and\n\nas perpetrators, were being placed in these overcrowded homes, increasing the risk\n\nof child-on-child sexual abuse. Among these reports was the September 8, 1998\n\nreport of the Home by Home Review.\n\n      Feaver first learned of the child-on-child sexual abuse at the Calhoun home\n\non November 23, 1998, after someone called the Department’s abuse prevention\n\nhotline to report that A.P. had been sexually abused by other children living in the\n\nhome. A.P., N.M., and R.M. were removed from the Calhoun home within a day.\n\nAn investigation of the Calhoun home followed immediately, resulting in the\n\nformulation and implementation of a plan to curtail further child-on-child sexual\n\nabuse at the home. The plan prescribed the steps that needed to be taken to\n\neliminate the problem, and Feaver relied on the District 10 administrators to ensure\n\nthat those steps were taken.\n\n      These facts fall short of establishing that Feaver was deliberately indifferent\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\fto a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse facing the children living in the\n\nCalhoun home. While Feaver certainly was aware of a heightened system-wide\n\nrisk of child-on-child sexual abuse due to overcrowding and improper placement,\n\nthere are no allegations that he possessed specific knowledge about a substantial\n\nrisk of sexual abuse in the Calhoun home prior to A.P.’s report of abuse on\n\nNovember 23, 1998. Feaver’s receipt of the Home by Home Review report\n\nestablishes, at most, that the Calhoun home was overcrowded during this time – the\n\nreport contained no allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse. The facts alleged in\n\nthe complaint simply do not permit the inference that Feaver actually knew of a\n\nsubstantial risk to the plaintiffs and yet did nothing.71 The district court therefore\n\ndid not err in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims against him.\n\n                                                2.\n\n       Johnny Brown served as Administrator of District 10 from August 1997 to\n\nDecember 1998.

As the court\nobserved in Foltz, such institutional failures can serve to negate an inference that specific\nindividuals supervising or employed in the system are deliberately indifferent – the failures\nbeing attributed to the system as a whole. Ray v. Foltz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76580\"><a href=\"/opinion/76580/grace-ray-v-e-j-foltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1085 n.9 (11th Cir.\n2004). It was the failure of the system as a whole that enabled the plaintiffs in Ward to obtain\nthe injunctive relief the district court ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                                65\n\fon-child sexual abuse in the District’s foster homes, Brown developed a “Draft\n\nDistrict 10 Family Support and Preservation Child Welfare Improvement Plan.”\n\nThe plan proposed sweeping reforms, including “(1) a thorough case review for\n\neach child reported to have been abused or neglected, (2) a revised incident\n\nreporting system tracked by a Department Specialist with mandatory reporting to\n\nlicensing, foster care, and circuit judges . . . and (6) a plan to significantly increase\n\nfoster homes and decrease the number of children in each home.” Omnibus Order\n\nat 16. The plan was implemented, but not adequately. Some incidents of child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse went unreported,72 and the District’s response to those that were\n\nreported was frequently inadequate. Brown did not cause the under-reporting,\n\nhowever; nor did he have knowledge of any failures by his subordinates adequately\n\nto respond to the incidents of abuse that were reported.\n\n       On September 8, 1998, Brown, like Feaver, received the findings of the\n\nHome by Home Review which included descriptions of overcrowding in the\n\nCalhoun home and the sexual perpetration histories of D.L. and M.M., but did not\n\ncontain any allegations of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. And\n\nhe, like Feaver, first learned of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home on\n\n72\n   I infer from this fact that, whether through negligence or through deliberate disregard, some\nincidents of child-on-child sexual abuse went either unperceived or unreported by foster parents,\ncaseworkers, GALs, circuit judges, community members, etc.\n\n\n\n\n                                               66\n\fNovember 23, 1998. As District 10 Administrator, Brown was ultimately\n\nresponsible for the subsequent investigation and the plan that was devised to\n\nremedy the sexual abuse problem in the Calhoun home. However, he had no\n\ninvolvement in implementing the plan, for he left his employment with the\n\nDepartment in early December 1998. As the facts do not permit an inference that\n\nBrown was aware of and disregarded a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual\n\nabuse in the Calhoun home, the court committed no error in absolving Brown of\n\nliability by dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims against him.\n\n                                            3.\n\n         Katherine Kaufman was POA of Protective Investigations and later served as\n\nthe Acting Child Welfare Director in District 10.73 Plaintiffs allege that Kaufman\n\nfailed to direct the removal of M.M. and D.L. from the Calhoun home. Plaintiffs\n\nalso allege that in October 1998, Kaufman was one of the Department officials\n\nwho participated in the approval of overcapacity waivers that permitted two\n\nsiblings, N.O. and J.O., to be placed in the Calhoun home, bringing to ten the total\n\nnumber of foster children living in the Calhoun home.\n\n         Plaintiffs indicate two sources of notice as demonstrative of subjective\n\n\n\n73\n     The complaint does not allege when Kaufman became Acting Child Welfare Director.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 67\n\fknowledge on Kaufman’s part. First, in January 1997, M.M. had been removed\n\nfrom his natural mother’s home and involuntarily committed to a psychiatric\n\nfacility after having threatened his mother and sister. While he was still in the\n\nhospital, the Department received a report that M.M. had sexually assaulted his\n\nsister repeatedly. It was at this time that Kaufman – as POA of Protective\n\nInvestigations – allegedly learned of M.M.’s case, as she sought unsuccessfully to\n\nplace M.M. in a residential psychiatric facility.74 Upon release from the hospital,\n\nM.M. was returned to his mother’s home and was offered in-home therapeutic\n\nservices.\n\n       Second, in September 1998, Kaufman – now the Acting Child Welfare\n\nDirector – allegedly received a copy of the report of the Home by Home Review.\n\nIn response, she established a Special Review Team to address any concerns\n\nhighlighted in the report through the creation of Corrective Action Plans for each\n\nfoster home.\n\n       Such facts as these cannot establish subjective knowledge of a substantial\n\n\n\n74\n   The district court read ¶¶ 165–66 of the complaint to allege that Kaufman received this report\nwhile M.M. “was living in the Calhoun home,” and that she “did not remove M.M. from the\nCalhoun Home” at that time. Omnibus Order at 39. Upon perusal of the complaint, however, it\nis clear that the plaintiffs allege that M.M. was still in the psychiatric facility at the time\nKaufman was informed of his behavior, and that he was returned to his natural mother’s home\nupon release.\n\n\n\n\n                                               68\n\frisk of sexual abuse to the children in the Calhoun home. Kaufman first learned of\n\nM.M.’s sexual history while he was residing in a psychiatric facility, not in the\n\nCalhoun home. As with Feaver and Brown, the report of the Home by Home\n\nReview informed Kaufman of a generalized risk of harm due to overcrowding in\n\nthe Calhoun home, and indicated that D.L. and M.M. had a history of sexual and\n\nphysical aggression – the kind of notice of a general propensity-to-harm that fails\n\nto establish subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm even in the\n\nprison context, because it is devoid of “specific facts” relating to a “particularized\n\nthreat” to the plaintiffs and establishes, at best, a “generalized awareness of risk.”\n\nSee Carter v. Galloway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76411\"><a href=\"/opinion/76411/john-carter-v-james-galloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1349–50 (11th Cir. 2003 (noting that such\n\ninformation “does not provide a sufficient basis to make the inferential leap that a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm” existed”); see also Nichols v. Maynard, 204 Fed.\n\nAppx. 826, 828–29 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished). In other words, this kind of\n\ninformation might give rise to awareness of a possibility of sexual abuse in the\n\nCalhoun home, but it falls short of permitting the inference that Kaufman was\n\nactually aware of a strong likelihood of sexual abuse. These basic facts remained\n\nunchanged by the time Kaufman participated in the approval of the overcapacity\n\nwaiver for siblings N.O. and J.O. a month later, in October 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                           69\n\f       Kaufman’s first actual notice of an incident of child-on-child sexual abuse\n\ncame on November 23, 1998. On that day, she was the “On Call Administrator”\n\nfielding calls on the abuse prevention hotline, and she received the call regarding\n\nA.P. The caller described A.P.’s allegations – that he was being raped twice a day\n\nand that M.M. was the main perpetrator. Kaufman attended the hearing held in\n\ncircuit court the next day and represented to the court that A.P.’s allegations were\n\nbeing investigated.\n\n       The district court dismissed the claims of A.P., N.M., and R.M. against\n\nKaufman, noting that they were removed from the Calhoun home “just one day\n\nafter Kaufman learned of A.P.’s sexual abuse allegations,” and that “she could not\n\nhave [had] subjective knowledge of sexual abuse allegations at the time they\n\nsuffered their injuries.” Omnibus Order at 42. I would affirm the dismissal.\n\n                                                4.\n\n       Corinne Millikan was a Family Services Specialist and Operations\n\nManagement Consultant75 in District 10 at some point during the time relevant to\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations. As such, she had the authority to review and monitor the\n\nquality and safety of placements. Plaintiffs fault Millikan for her involvement in\n\n75\n  I remain largely in the dark as to the role of an Operations Management Consultant. The\ncomplaint provides no separate description of Millikan’s responsibilities in this role. Compl. ¶\n18. Nor do plaintiffs allege when Millikan served in each position.\n\n\n\n\n                                                70\n\fthe approval of overcapacity waivers that permitted certain children to live in the\n\nCalhoun home, specifically A.P., R.M., and children with mental health problems. 67\n\n       Like the other defendants in this case, Millikan was aware that many of the\n\nDistrict’s foster homes were overcrowded and that the presence of children with\n\nhistories of sexual abuse, both as perpetrators and victims, created a generalized\n\nrisk of child-on-child sexual abuse. Her duties, which did not bring her into day-\n\nto-day contact with the children in foster care, included participating in the\n\napproval of overcapacity waivers and creating Corrective Action Plans following\n\nthe Home by Home Review.\n\n       Millikan was aware of overcrowding in the Calhoun home as early as\n\nJanuary 31, 1995, when she attended a licensing meeting where the home’s\n\nconsistent overcrowding was discussed. In June 1996, she attended a District 10\n\n76\n   It is unclear from the complaint who else was involved in the approval of overcapacity\nwaivers for A.P. and R.M. In the absence of specific allegations to the contrary, I presume that\nthe other participants included a Licensing Supervisor, Placement Supervisor, POA of Licensing\nand Placement, and the Child Welfare Director, and that they followed the decision-making\nprotocol set out in the Licensing Manual.\n         The complaint also alleges that on December 10, 1998, Millikan participated in the\napproval of a waiver placing another child, B.J., in the Calhoun home. It is clear from the\ncomplaint, however, that this particular B.J. is not the same B.J. who is earlier described in the\ncomplaint as having been identified as“a danger to himself and others”; that particular B.J.\nresided in the Calhoun home “until April, 1998 when he turned eighteen.” Compl. ¶ 102. The\nallegation that Millikan approved the placement of another child with the same initials on\nDecember 10, 1998 – over two weeks after all of the plaintiffs had been removed from the\nCalhoun home – cannot support a finding of subjective knowledge and deliberate disregard of a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiffs prior to November 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                                71\n\fmeeting discussing a report of domestic violence in the Calhoun home, wherein\n\nMr. Calhoun had chased Joann Calhoun while brandishing a steak knife. Nearly\n\ntwo years later, in September 1998, Millikan received the report of the Home by\n\nHome Review, which described the Calhoun home as “cramped” and noted that\n\ntwo children with histories of sexual perpetration, D.L. and M.M., had been placed\n\nin that home. At no time during this period was there ever any report of sexual\n\nabuse in the Calhoun home. As part of the Special Review Team, Millikan assisted\n\nin drafting specifically tailored Corrective Action Plans for each of the 50 homes\n\nsurveyed by the Review. Shortly thereafter, Millikan was one of the officials who\n\nparticipated in the approval of belated overcapacity waivers permitting the\n\nplacement of A.P. and R.M. in the Calhoun home.\n\n      Though Millikan might have interpreted the information she had to mean\n\nthat the children in the Calhoun home faced a generalized risk of sexual assault,\n\nthere are no allegations that, prior to the November 23, 1998 report of A.P.’s\n\nabuse, Millikan was aware of specific facts or a “particularized threat” of sexual\n\nabuse from which she could have inferred that the children faced a strong\n\nlikelihood of sexual abuse. See Carter, 352 F.3d at 1350. Indeed, by the time the\n\nreport of the Home by Home Review was issued, M.M. and D.L. had lived in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\foften overcrowded Calhoun home for 19 and 17 months with no reports of sexual\n\nabuse; and by the time that Millikan participated in the waiver approvals, A.P. and\n\nR.M. had resided in the Calhoun home for nearly two weeks and five months,\n\nrespectively, without any reported incident. As it turned out, the conclusion that\n\nA.P. and R.M. did not face a substantial risk of sexual abuse may have been\n\nwrong; but Monday morning quarterbacking alone is insufficient to support a\n\ndamages claim against Millikan.\n\n         The report of A.P.’s abuse in November 1998 was the first specific notice\n\nMillikan received that a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse existed in\n\nthe Calhoun home. For this reason, the district court concluded that with respect to\n\nthe claims of A.P., N.M., and R.M., the facts failed to establish a case of deliberate\n\nindifference. I find no error in the court’s ruling.\n\n                                                 5.\n\n         Sharon Woodroof was a District 10 Family Services Specialist who worked\n\nwith the Licensing Unit and Placement Unit.77 Plaintiffs also allege that at some\n\n77\n     As a Family Services Specialist, Woodroof had the authority to\n\n         1) assist district staff with program planning and development; 2) provide\n         ongoing technical assistance in her area(s) of expertise; 3) monitor the provision\n         of services to children in her area(s) of expertise; 4) perform quality assurance\n         reviews; 5) ensure that policy guidance was available and understandable to direct\n         services and support staff; 6) review and approve allowable exceptions to policy,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 73\n\flater point – I presume in the latter half of 1997 or 1998 – Woodroof became a\n\nPOA supervising “re-licensing and foster care,” 78 in which capacity they allege she\n\nhad the ability “to direct the removal of a child from any foster home placement in\n\nwhich there was a substantial risk of serious harm to the child.” Compl. ¶ 16.\n\n       A.P., R.M., and N.M. allege that Woodroof acted in a deliberately\n\nindifferent manner through the following actions she undertook as a Family\n\nServices Specialist in collaboration with Licensing and Placement: (1) on May 19,\n\n1995, participating in the increase of the Calhoun home’s licensed capacity to five\n\nchildren; (2) in February 1997, participating in the approval of an overcapacity\n\nwaiver that allowed certain children, including M.M., to be placed in the Calhoun\n\nhome; (3) on February 21, 1997, participating in the approval of an overcapacity\n\nwaiver allowing R.B. (described by plaintiffs as a “fire setter and sexual abuser”)\n\nto be placed in the Calhoun home; (4) in April 1997, participating in the approval\n\n\n       including waivers of maximum licensed foster home capacity; 7) deny exceptions\n       to policy and/or waivers of capacity which placed children at substantial risk of\n       serious harm; and 8) ensure that children who posed a known substantial risk of\n       harming other children were not placed in situations where they were in a position\n       to harm other children.\n\nCompl. ¶ 15.\n78\n   The allegation that Woodroof was a POA supervising both the Foster Care Unit and the\nLicensing Unit is contrary to my understanding of the organizational structure of DCF as\ndescribed in the complaint. Nonetheless, I assume for purposes of the defendants’ motions to\ndismiss that such was the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                              74\n\fof an overcapacity waiver that allowed D.L. to be placed in the Calhoun home; and\n\n(5) on May 19, 1997, approving the re-licensing of the Calhoun home for seven\n\nfoster children. Plaintiffs also allege that in Woodroof’s capacity as a POA\n\nsupervising “re-licensing and foster care,” she failed to direct D.L.’s removal from\n\nthe Calhoun home and place him in a residential facility.\n\n      As sources of notice, plaintiffs allege that: (1) on February 14, 1997 and\n\nApril 8, 1997, when M.M. and D.L. were placed in the Calhoun home, Woodroof\n\nwas aware of their behavioral histories and the histories of the children already\n\nliving in the home; (2) on May 17, 1998, Woodroof received a letter from a GAL\n\ndescribing the overcrowded conditions in the Calhoun home, which Woodroof\n\nproceeded to forward to the Licensing Unit; (3) in September 1998, Woodroof\n\nreceived a copy of the report of the Home by Home Review; and (4) in October\n\n1998, Woodroof received a letter from Joann Calhoun stating that D.L.’s case file\n\nreflected “sexual issues” and problems with “lying [and] being physically\n\naggressive,” and that she did not know who D.L.’s caseworker was.\n\n      Because plaintiffs point to specific actions spanning three years and specific\n\nsources of notice that Woodroof allegedly received over the course of those three\n\nyears, it is necessary to parse each allegation with an eye toward what Woodroof\n\n\n\n\n                                          75\n\factually knew at each point in time. To begin with, the allegation that Woodroof’s\n\napproval of a waiver for R.B. demonstrated deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\n\nis groundless. It is perhaps unsurprising that there is no allegation that R.B. abused\n\nthe plaintiffs, because a year had already elapsed between the time that R.B. left\n\nthe Calhoun home (April 1997) and the time that the first of the plaintiffs had\n\nentered it (April 1998). Compl. ¶¶ 120, 228. R.B.’s presence in the Calhoun home\n\ncould not even have contributed to overcrowding in any way that would have\n\naffected the plaintiffs.\n\n       As for the remaining four actions that plaintiffs allege Woodroof committed\n\nas a Family Services Specialist – actions taken in May 1995, February 1997, April\n\n1997, and May 1997 – letters and other materials received by Woodroof at later\n\ndates could not have formed the basis of her subjective knowledge at the time she\n\nmade those decisions. The only relevant allegation is that Woodroof was aware of\n\nthe behavioral histories of M.M., D.L., and the other children in the Calhoun\n\nhome.79 These facts do not permit the inference that Woodroof actually knew of\n\nand deliberately disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe general risk posed by M.M., D.L., and the thousands of other “at risk” children\n\n79\n   Of course, Woodroof could not have been aware of the behavioral histories of M.M. and D.L.\nas of the May 19, 1995 licensing of the Calhoun home for five children, since they did not enter\nthe home until February 14 and April 8, 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                               76\n\fserved by the Department is not enough to make out a case of deliberate\n\nindifference to a particular child’s safety. Nowhere is it alleged that Woodroof\n\nbelieved – actually drew the inference from the surrounding circumstances – that\n\nM.M. or D.L. posed a substantial threat to the children in the Calhoun home either\n\nbefore their initial placement or prior to the home’s re-licensing. In fact, the\n\ncomplaint suggests otherwise: Woodroof, along with a Placement Supervisor, a\n\nLicensing Supervisor, the POA of Licensing and Placement, and the Child Welfare\n\nDirector, considered the available placements for M.M. and D.L. and decided that\n\nthe Calhoun home, known for its ability to handle troubled boys successfully, was\n\nthe most appropriate setting for these children.80 Thereafter, based on her\n\nknowledge of the children in the Calhoun home and the fact that they had\n\npeaceably existed as a group for over a month, Woodroof concurred in the\n\nrecommendation from the Licensing Unit that the home be re-licensed.\n\n       Plaintiffs also allege that in her later capacity as POA of “re-licensing and\n\nfoster care,” Woodroof should have removed or directed the removal of D.L. from\n\nthe Calhoun home and ordered his placement in a residential treatment facility. As\n\nbefore, allegations that Woodroof was aware of a general background risk do not\n\n80\n   I note once more that at the time of M.M. and D.L.’s respective placements, at least three\nother children in the Calhoun home were older than M.M. and D.L., who were both twelve years\nold: 17-year-old R.D., 17-year-old B.J., and 13-year-old R.T.\n\n\n\n\n                                             77\n\freasonably support the inference that Woodroof actually knew of a strong\n\nlikelihood of sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. Although Joann Calhoun’s letter\n\nspecifically related her concern for D.L., the letter does no more than point to\n\nD.L.’s history as described in his case file, which was already known to Woodroof\n\nand the other Department officials who had collectively decided that the Calhoun\n\nhome was an appropriate placement for D.L. Joann Calhoun’s letter does not\n\ncontain a warning that D.L. created such a risk to the other children that he ought\n\nto be removed from the home; rather, Joann Calhoun expresses frustration with the\n\nDepartment and requests that D.L. be provided with another caseworker, whose\n\nservices she regarded as “imperative to being able to maintain D.[L].” Compl. ¶\n\n206. The letter is insufficient to establish that Woodroof thereafter believed that,\n\ncontrary to the conclusion she and other Department officials had earlier drawn,\n\nD.L.’s placement in the Calhoun home created a strong likelihood of sexual abuse\n\nto the other children.\n\n      Woodroof had no knowledge of a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual\n\nabuse in the Calhoun home until after the Department received the November 23\n\ncall to the abuse prevention hotline about A.P. I therefore find no error in the\n\ndismissal of the claims against her.\n\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\f                                             6.\n\n       At the time relevant to plaintiffs’ allegations, Susan Kanaskie was a\n\nProtective Investigations Supervisor for District 10. Plaintiffs contend that\n\nKanaskie approved the placement of M.M. in the Calhoun home despite being\n\naware of the substantial risk of serious harm that decision would create. This claim\n\nis unsupported by specific allegations regarding Kanaskie’s subjective\n\nknowledge.81\n\n       Kanaskie did not learn of the child-on-child sexual abuse at the Calhoun\n\nhome until December 11, 1998, when Susan Worsley, then a Foster Care\n\nSupervisor, and Elaine Corsino, the Acting Protective Investigations Supervisor,\n\ninformed her about the November 23 telephone call to the abuse prevention hotline\n\nregarding A.P. Because Kanaskie was unaware, prior to December 11, of the risk\n\nto the children in the Calhoun home, the district court properly held that she was\n\n81\n   Additionally, my understanding of District 10 operating procedures (based upon plaintiffs’\nown allegations, Compl. ¶ 41) does not permit the inference that Kanaskie was even actively\ninvolved in the decision to place or maintain M.M. in the Calhoun home in February 1997. As\nthe supervisor of Susan Worsley, M.M.’s Protective Investigator, Kanaskie would have reviewed\nM.M.’s background, risk assessments, and placement history and then would have assisted in\nproviding this information to the Placement Unit. Since the Calhoun home was operating at\ncapacity, the decision to place M.M. in the home was thereafter made by the Placement Unit in\ncoordination with the Department officials involved in authorizing overcapacity waivers – the\nPlacement Supervisor, Licensing Supervisor, POA of Licensing and Placement, a Family\nServices Specialist, and the Child Welfare Director. Once M.M. was placed in the Calhoun\nhome and declared a dependent, his case would have been transferred from the Protective\nInvestigations Unit to the Foster Care Unit – ending Kanaskie’s involvement.\n\n\n\n\n                                             79\n\fnot deliberately indifferent to the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to a safe\n\nenvironment.\n\n                                              7.\n\n       Susan Worsley served as a Protective Investigator and subsequently as a\n\nFoster Care Supervisor in District 10.82 She was initially assigned to M.M.’s case\n\non February 3, 1997, while he resided at the Lippman Shelter. As his Protective\n\nInvestigator, Worsley was informed of M.M.’s history of sexual abuse and his\n\npsychological and behavioral problems. As a Foster Care Supervisor, Worsley\n\noversaw M.M.’s caseworker. Plaintiffs allege that Worsley was deliberately\n\nindifferent to their safety by placing M.M. in the Calhoun home, failing to create a\n\nplan of care to ensure the safety of the other children in the Calhoun home, and\n\nfailing to visit M.M.\n\n       On February 12, 1997, Worsley was advised that M.M. could no longer\n\nremain at the Lippman Shelter because of his history and his need for 24-hour one-\n\non-one supervision. Worsley then contacted the Department’s Placement Unit to\n\ninquire about a new placement for M.M. Worsley suggested the Calhoun home (I\n\ninfer that her recommendation was due to the Calhoun home’s reputation for\n\n82\n  The complaint does not allege precisely when Worsley became a Foster Care Supervisor;\nhowever, it alleges that she was a Protective Investigator at least through March 1997 and\nsuggests that she was a Foster Care Supervisor as of November 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                              80\n\fmanaging troubled and unruly boys similar to M.M.) but was advised by an\n\nunspecified employee in the Placement Unit that M.M. was “too dangerous” to be\n\nplaced there. Despite this initial recommendation, the Placement Supervisor\n\nconsidered an overcapacity waiver that would allow M.M. to be placed with the\n\nCalhouns. After examining M.M.’s background, the children already in the\n\nCalhoun home, and the availability of other suitable placements, various officials\n\nin the Department concurred in the approval of an overcapacity waiver: the\n\nPlacement Supervisor, Licensing Supervisor, Family Services Specialist, POA of\n\nLicensing and Placement, and the Child Welfare Director.\n\n       M.M. was placed in the Calhoun home on February 14, 1997, and Worsley\n\ncontinued to serve as his Protective Investigator until his case was transferred to\n\nthe Foster Care Unit on March 27, 1997, following his adjudication as a dependent.\n\nDuring this time period, Worsley visited the Calhoun home on one occasion –\n\nFebruary 19, 1997 – and was informed by Joann Calhoun’s son that M.M. had a\n\n“violent explosion” the previous day. Worsley failed to perform any further home\n\nvisits, though allegedly she was required to visit weekly from February 14 to\n\nMarch 27, 1997. 38\n\n\n83\n  N.M., R.M., and A.P. were not placed in the Calhoun home until over a year later– April 24,\n1998, May 6, 1998, and September 17, 1998, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n                                              81\n\f       On December 9, Worsley learned about the November 23, 1998 call to the\n\nDepartment’s abuse prevention hotline alleging that A.P. had suffered sexual abuse\n\nin the Calhoun home. The facts establish that this was the first notice to Worsley\n\nof a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse in the Calhoun home. Prior to\n\nthis time, Worsley was only aware of M.M.’s troubled background and that he had\n\none violent outburst during his placement in the Calhoun home. One cannot\n\nreasonably infer from these facts that Worsley believed that the children in the\n\nCalhoun home faced a substantial risk of child-on-child sexual abuse. While her\n\nfailure to perform the necessary visitation is deplorable, it does not constitute\n\ndeliberately indifferent behavior. I therefore find no error in the court’s decision to\n\ndismiss the plaintiffs’ claims against Worsley.\n\n                                                8.\n\n       Jennifer Chang was initially POA of Licensing and Placement and later\n\nbecame a Family Services Specialist in March 1998. The main allegation against\n\nChang stems from her involvement as POA in approving overcapacity waivers that\n\nallowed children with sexual perpetration histories and mental health problems to\n\nbe placed in the Calhoun home, including M.M. and D.L.84 In February 1997 and\n\n84\n  Although plaintiffs allege that Chang also improperly approved overcapacity waivers\npermitting B.J. (described by plaintiffs as “a danger to himself and others”) and R.B. (described\nby plaintiffs as a “fire setter and sexual abuser”) to live in the Calhoun home, these allegations\n\n\n\n\n                                                82\n\fApril 1997, when M.M. and D.L. were placed in the Calhoun home, Chang was\n\naware of their behavioral histories and of the general overcrowding of foster homes\n\nin District 10. With respect to M.M., Chang had also attended a court hearing in\n\nM.M.’s dependency case in which the circuit judge “expressed fear that M.M.\n\nwould hurt someone at the Calhoun home due to his history of physical and sexual\n\naggression.” Compl. ¶ 116. Chang was one of the persons who subsequently\n\nparticipated in the approval of overcapacity waivers with respect to M.M. and\n\nD.L.; in accordance with Department policy, the other officials involved in the\n\nwaiver approval process included a Placement Supervisor, a Licensing Supervisor,\n\na Family Services Specialist, and the Child Welfare Director.\n\n       These facts do not make out a claim of deliberate indifference with respect\n\nto Chang. As with Woodroof, the complaint does not indicate that Chang believed\n\nM.M. or D.L. to pose a substantial threat of sexual abuse to the children in the\n\nCalhoun home. The most reasonable inference from these facts is that Chang\n\nevaluated the case files of the children, and in M.M.’s case, the judge’s “fear that\n\nM.M. would hurt someone at the Calhoun home due to his history of physical and\n\nare irrelevant to the plaintiffs’ claims as there is no allegation that B.J. or R.B. abused the\nplaintiffs – logically enough, as B.J. left the Calhoun home when he turned 18 in April 1998\n(Compl. ¶ 102), and R.B. left the Calhoun home a year earlier, in April 1997 (Compl. ¶ 120).\nThey could not have even contributed to overcrowding in the Calhoun home in any way that\nwould have affected the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                83\n\fsexual aggression.” (Recall that M.M. had sexually abused his sister and had\n\nthreatened his family members with a knife.) Then, based on her professional\n\njudgment and experience in the foster care system, she and her colleagues\n\nconcluded that M.M. and D.L. would not in fact pose a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm to the other children then living in the Calhoun home – a home with “the\n\nreputation of taking in troubled and/or difficult to control young males,” Compl. ¶\n\n90 – and approved the overcapacity waivers.85\n\n       Additionally, the plaintiffs allege deliberate indifference in regard to\n\nChang’s actions as a Family Services Specialist following the Department’s\n\nissuance of the report of the Home by Home Review on September 8, 1998.\n\nChang was a member of the Special Review Team that drafted a Corrective Action\n\nPlan for each of the 50 homes examined during the Review. While the complaint\n\ndoes not allege what the Corrective Action Plan for the Calhoun home contained, it\n\ndoes allege that the plan failed to address D.L.’s and M.M.’s histories of sexual\n\nperpetration and failed to reduce the Calhoun home’s capacity. The plaintiffs\n\n85\n   One must remember that neither the size nor the composition of the Calhoun home remained\nthe same from the times that M.M. and D.L. were placed there on February 14, 1997 and April 8,\n1997, and the times that N.M., R.M., and A.P. entered the home on April 24, 1998, May 6, 1998,\nand September 15, 1998. M.M. and D.L. brought the population of the home to six and seven\nchildren, respectively, and were among the younger children in the home. Chang, of course, had\nno knowledge of the individual characteristics of N.M., R.M., and A.P. at the time she\nparticipated in the waiver process for M.M. and D.L.\n\n\n\n\n                                              84\n\fwould have Chang held liable for the sexual abuse A.P., N.M., and R.M. may have\n\nsustained at the hands of D.L. and M.M. based on the inadequacy of the Special\n\nReview Team’s Corrective Action Plan. Because, at best, such liability sounds in\n\nnegligence, not deliberate indifference to the infringement of a constitutional right,\n\nthe district court committed no error in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims against\n\nChang.\n\n                                              9.\n\n         As a Licensing Counselor and later as a Licensing Supervisor,86 Margaret\n\nAndrews was responsible for the annual licensing review of several foster homes in\n\nDistrict 10 and participated in the overcapacity waiver process. The plaintiffs\n\nwould hold Andrews liable for the following alleged actions: (1) in July 1996,\n\nrecommending re-licensing the Calhoun home despite the fact that an investigation\n\ninto neglect and domestic violence allegations had not been finalized, in\n\ncontravention of Department policy; (2) in July 1996, failing to properly\n\ninvestigate another allegation of physical abuse and domestic violence in the\n\nCalhoun home, in contravention of state law and Department policy; (3) in\n\nFebruary 1997, participating with a Placement Supervisor, Woodroof (Family\n\n\n\n86\n     The complaint does not allege when Andrews became a Licensing Supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n                                              85\n\fServices Specialist), Chang (POA of Licensing and Placement), and the Child\n\nWelfare Director in the approval of the overcapacity waiver that allowed M.M.’s\n\nplacement in the Calhoun home; and (4) on May 16, 1997, recommending to her\n\nsupervisor, Woodroof, that the Calhoun home be re-licensed for a capacity of\n\nseven foster children.\n\n      The complaint does not permit the inference that Andrews at any time was\n\nsubjectively aware that the plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of child-on-child\n\nsexual abuse in the Calhoun home. First, even if her conduct in 1996 were\n\ncausally related to the injuries the plaintiffs suffered – which is uncertain because\n\nneither the alleged abusers nor the plaintiffs came to the home until 1997 and 1998,\n\nrespectively – violating state procedural laws or departmental procedures does not\n\nconstitute deliberate indifference. See Ray v. Foltz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76580\"><a href=\"/opinion/76580/grace-ray-v-e-j-foltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1085 (11th\n\nCir. 2004) (“Allegations of failure to follow state policies and procedures . . . do\n\nnot support a claim for damages, such as the [plaintiffs’]. Where damages are\n\nsought, more must be shown that negligent failure to follow Department guidelines\n\nand procedures.”). As to her actions in 1997, all I can glean from the complaint is\n\nthat Andrews knew that seven foster children were residing in the Calhoun home\n\nwith mental health issues, including several children with sexual abuse and\n\n\n\n\n                                           86\n\fperpetration histories – a profile that fit the majority of homes in District 10. It\n\ncannot be inferred from these facts that Andrews actually drew the inference that\n\nthe children in the Calhoun home faced a substantial risk of harm, especially in\n\nlight of the fact that child-on-child sexual abuse was never known to have occurred\n\nduring the six years that the Calhouns housed troubled children. The court\n\nproperly found that the allegations against Andrews failed to state a claim for\n\nrelief.\n\n                                           10.\n\n          The district court dismissed the claims against Loubert Desmangles, Susan\n\nWilburn, and Sharon Pollack, District 10 caseworkers who held the title “Family\n\nServices Counselor.” The court did so because the facts failed to show that these\n\ncaseworkers were deliberately indifferent to the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to a\n\nsafe foster home environment. I agree. Plaintiffs’ allegations establish, at best,\n\nthat the defendants were aware of circumstances that may have permitted the\n\ninference that a substantial risk of sexual assault existed in the Calhoun home. But\n\nnone of the allegations, viewed in terms of what each defendant individually knew,\n\npermit the inference that the defendant actually drew such an inference.\n\n          Loubert Desmangles was present when D.L. admitted in April 1997 that he\n\n\n\n\n                                           87\n\fhad sexually assaulted three or four boys who lived near his old foster home. After\n\nan overcapacity waiver permitting D.L.’s placement in the Calhoun home was\n\nrequested and approved by the necessary Department officials, Desmangles placed\n\nD.L. in the Calhoun home. At some point after D.L.’s placement, the Sexual\n\nAssault Treatment Center informed Desmangles that it had terminated D.L.’s\n\nsexual abuse therapy “due to the most recent child-on-child incident involving\n\nD.L.,” and that D.L. would require intensive therapeutic services in a residential\n\nfacility for sexual offenders. Compl. ¶ 192. In June 1997, Joann Calhoun\n\ninformed Desmangles that D.L. was having “behavioral problems,” Compl. ¶ 194 –\n\nof what nature we do not know. Finally, plaintiffs allege that on July 1, 1997,\n\nDesmangles “was ordered” – the complaint does not say by whom – “to place D.L.\n\nin a residential treatment facility specializing in sexual offender treatment,” Compl.\n\n¶ 195, but did not do so.\n\n      In sum, plaintiffs allege that Desmangles knew that D.L. had a history of\n\nsexual perpetration, that at least two other persons believed that D.L. should be\n\nplaced in a residential treatment facility, and that he had unspecified “behavioral\n\nproblems.” But he also knew that at least five Department officials had considered\n\nD.L.’s file and had approved an overcapacity waiver to place D.L. in the Calhoun\n\n\n\n\n                                          88\n\fhome (known for its ability to handle troubled children) with six other boys – at\n\nleast five of whom were at least as old or older than D.L. Desmangles also had his\n\nown first-hand observations. As alleged in the complaint, Desmangles was\n\nrequired to visit D.L. in the home at least monthly; the purpose of these visits was\n\nto assess the safety of the placement and to report any concerns about the condition\n\nof the foster home to the Licensing Unit or any suspected abuse or neglect to the\n\nDistrict’s abuse prevention hotline. There is no allegation that Desmangles failed\n\nto make regular visits to D.L. in the Calhoun home, with concurrent information-\n\ngathering that yielded nothing more. While plaintiffs’ allegations might satisfy an\n\nobjective standard of negligence, therefore, they are insufficient to establish that\n\nDesmangles himself believed that D.L.’s presence in the Calhoun home created a\n\nstrong likelihood of sexual abuse to the other children.\n\n      Susan Wilburn was assigned to D.L. on May 12, 1998. At that time, she was\n\ninformed by D.L.’s GAL that he “was inappropriately placed in the Calhoun foster\n\nhome and needed intensive, in-patient treatment at a facility for sexual offenders.”\n\nCompl. ¶ 203. Later that month, Joann Calhoun informed Wilburn that D.L. was\n\nin “desperate need of help” and had physically assaulted one of the other children.\n\nCompl. ¶ 204. The details of the assault are nowhere alleged; nor is the identity of\n\n\n\n\n                                           89\n\fthe child who was assaulted. On May 21, 1998, Wilburn was assigned to N.M. and\n\nR.M. She continued to serve as counselor to D.L., N.M., and R.M. for a little\n\nunder four months, until she left the Department on September 11, 1998. There is\n\nno allegation that Wilburn failed to make regular visits to all three of these children\n\nin the Calhoun home. Nor is there any allegation that Wilburn learned of child-on-\n\nchild sexual abuse in the Calhoun home during her visits to these three children.\n\nRather, plaintiffs allege that Wilburn failed to take adequate steps to ensure that\n\nD.L. did not abuse the other children in the Calhoun home, or to protect N.M. and\n\nR.M.\n\n       Like Desmangles, Wilburn knew that D.L. had a history of sexual\n\nperpetration and that at least one person believed he should be placed in a\n\nresidential treatment facility. She also knew, however, that there had been no\n\nreports of D.L. acting out sexually in the Calhoun home in the thirteen months he\n\nhad lived there. And perhaps most significantly, Wilburn had her own first-hand\n\nobservations from visiting three children – D.L., N.M., and R.M. – in the Calhoun\n\nhome, with the concomitant opportunity to monitor their specific interactions.\n\nPlaintiffs’ additional allegation that Wilburn knew of one occasion where D.L. had\n\nphysically assaulted one of the children in some fashion is insufficient to establish\n\n\n\n\n                                          90\n\fthat Wilburn believed that D.L. created a strong likelihood of sexual abuse to the\n\nchildren in the Calhoun home.\n\n      Sharon Pollack was assigned to M.M. upon his placement in the Calhoun\n\nhome in March 1997, and continued until August 1997. There is no allegation that\n\nshe failed to visit M.M. regularly during this time. A little over ten months after\n\nD.L.’s placement in the Calhoun home, on February 27, 1998, Pollack was\n\ntemporarily assigned to be D.L.’s counselor. She visited him once on March 5,\n\n1998; her assignment ended on May 5, 1998, when she was re-assigned to M.M.\n\nand continued in that capacity until September 1998. During that time, plaintiffs\n\nallege that Pollack visited M.M. only once, on June 25, 1998.\n\n      The sum total of plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Pollack’s state of\n\nknowledge is that she was aware of M.M. and D.L.’s sexual perpetration histories\n\nand knew that they were living in a crowded home with troubled children.\n\nPlaintiffs’ case against Pollack is a classic example of plain vanilla negligence –\n\nthat she should have recognized the risk of sexual abuse to the other children; that\n\nshe should have made regular visits to M.M. and D.L.; and that she should have\n\nremoved M.M. and D.L. or developed a plan to ensure that the children did not\n\nbecome the perpetrators or victims of sexual abuse. While these facts were\n\n\n\n\n                                          91\n\fprobative of the class action claim for injunctive relief in Ward, they do not\n\nestablish the deliberate indifference to a constitutional right necessary to recover\n\nmoney damages against the caseworkers individually.\n\n                                              VI.\n\n       The complaint in this case alleges many facts from which the defendants\n\ncould, or perhaps should, have inferred that a substantial risk of serious harm\n\nexisted in the Calhoun home; however, there are no specific allegations that they\n\nactually drew such an inference and then chose to disregard it.87 I would hold that\n\nthe district court did not err in dismissing the claims before us.\n\n\n\n                                         APPENDIX\n\n                  Florida Department of Children and Family Services\n\n\n\n87\n   Determining which of the facts alleged in the complaint’s 265 pages is relevant to the\nquestion of whether a particular defendant engaged in deliberately indifferent conduct is not an\ninsubstantial task. The difficulty of this case was further compounded by the “shotgun” style of\npleading that we have vehemently criticized time and time again. See, e.g., Davis v. Coca-Cola\nBottling Co.
