For\n\nthe reasons set forth below, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n                                             1\n\f1915(e)(2)(B)(I).\n\n              Keller is, and at all relevant times was, incarcerated at the State\n\nCorrectional Institution at Dallas, Pennsylvania (“SCI-Dallas”). In October 2002, Keller\n\ncommenced a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the\n\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania seeking damages, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive\n\nrelief against the following defendants: the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole\n\n(“the Parole Board”); Parole Board Secretary Kathleen Zwierzyna; Parole Board member\n\nSean Ryan; Hearing Examiner Donald Jones; and Correctional Officer W. Higgins. In the\n\ncomplaint, Keller alleged that: (1) he was denied due process and equal protection when\n\nthe Parole Board, Zwierzyna, and Ryan improperly denied him re-parole on three\n\noccasions in retaliation for his refusal to pay a certain fee, and in retaliation for his having\n\nthreatened litigation against the Parole Board; (2) Zwierzyna refused to consider his\n\nallegation that his sentence had been miscalculated; (3) on September 6, 2001,\n\nCorrectional Officer Higgins issued a false misconduct charge against him; and (4) during\n\ninstitutional disciplinary proceedings on the misconduct charge, Hearing Examiner\n\nDonald Jones denied Keller his right to present witnesses and excluded other evidence.\n\nKeller also alleged that he was subject to cruel and unusual punishment when, as a result\n\nof the misconduct charge, he was placed in the prison’s Restricted Housing Unit (“RHU”)\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\ffor 90 days.1\n\n                Keller subsequently filed an amended complaint in which he named as\n\ndefendants Chief Hearing Examiner Robert Bitner and SCI-Dallas Superintendent\n\nThomas Lavan, whom he alleged improperly denied his appeals from the misconduct\n\ncharge. Keller sought damages and a declaratory judgment against these defendants.\n\n                On September 9, 2004, the District Court entered an order granting partial\n\nsummary judgment to the defendants, and dismissed Keller’s claims against the Parole\n\nBoard, Hearing Examiners Robert Bitner and Donald Jones, and Superintendent Thomas\n\nLavan. The District Court initially permitted Keller to proceed on his claims against\n\nParole Board members Kathleen Zwierzyna and Sean Ryan, and Correctional Officer\n\nHiggins, but, by order dated March 29, 2006, granted summary judgment in favor of these\n\ndefendants as well. Keller submitted a timely motion for reconsideration, which the\n\nDistrict Court denied on October 10, 2006. The present appeal followed.2\n\n                We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. See\n\nTourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). Because Keller is\n\n\n\n   1\n    Keller’s claims are appropriately brought in a § 1983 action. See, e.g., Wilkinson v.\nDotson, 544 U.S. 74, 81-82 (2005).\n   2\n     Keller states that he is appealing from the District Court’s March 29, 2006 order\ngranting summary judgment, and does not reference the Court’s earlier summary\njudgment order. Nonetheless, since “the appeal of a final judgment draws into question\nall prior non-final orders and rulings,” Drinkwater v. Union Carbide Corp., 904 F.2d 853,\n858 (3d Cir. 1990), we will review the Court’s September 9, 2004 summary judgment\norder as well.\n\n                                              3\n\fproceeding in forma pauperis, we must review this appeal to determine whether it should\n\nbe dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). We dismiss an appeal if it “lacks an\n\narguable basis in law or in fact.” Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989).\n\n              We review a District Court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n\nPennsylvania Coal Ass'n v. Babbitt, 63 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir. 1995). Summary judgment\n\nis proper only if it appears “that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\n\nCarrasca v. Pomeroy, 313 F.3d 828, 832-33 (3d Cir. 2002). If a motion for summary\n\njudgment demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the nonmoving party\n\nmust set forth specific facts showing a genuine material issue for trial and may not rest\n\nupon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings. Connors v. Fawn Mining Corp., 30\n\nF.3d 483, 489 (3d Cir. 1994). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the\n\nDistrict Court correctly entered summary judgment against Keller on all of his claims.\n\n              First, the District Court properly dismissed Keller’s claim for damages\n\nagainst the defendants in their official capacities, as it is well established that § 1983\n\nclaims against state officials acting in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989). The\n\nDistrict Court also properly dismissed Keller’s claims against the Parole Board, as those\n\nclaims were likewise barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See id.; Independent\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fEnterprises, Inc. v. Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Auth., 103 F.3d 1165, 1172 (3d Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n              We also agree with the District Court that Hearing Examiners Donald Jones\n\nand Robert Bitner and Superintendent Thomas Lavan were entitled to summary judgment\n\non Keller’s claim that he was denied due process during the institutional disciplinary\n\nproceedings following his September 6, 2001 misconduct charge. As the District Court\n\nexplained, an inmate's due process rights are not triggered unless the prison “imposes\n\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). Here, Keller was placed in\n\nRHU for 90 days. We have made clear that this type of confinement does not constitute\n\nan “atypical and significant hardship” so as to trigger due process rights. See Griffin v.\n\nVaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding that 15 months in segregation was not\n\nan “atypical and significant hardship”).3\n\n              The District Court was also correct in granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof Correctional Officer Higgins on Keller’s claim that the misconduct charge was\n\nfalsified. As discussed above, Keller was not subjected to “atypical and significant\n\nhardship” when he was placed in RHU following his misconduct charge. See Sandin, 515\n\n\n\n   3\n     The District Court did not address Keller’s related claim that his placement in RHU\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment. We conclude, however, that confinement in a\nrestricted housing unit does not in itself constitute cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. See Griffin, 112 F.3d at 708.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fU.S. at 484; Griffin, 112 F.3d at 706. Therefore, because Keller was not deprived of a\n\nprotected liberty interest, his challenge to the misconduct charge is actionable only under\n\nsection 1983 if Officer Higgins issued the misconduct in retaliation for Keller having\n\nexercised a constitutional right. See Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333 (2001). Here,\n\nKeller did not present any facts that would establish a retaliatory motive behind the\n\nmisconduct charge. Rather, the record reflects that Officer Higgins issued the charge\n\nfollowing an altercation at the food window during which Keller “aggressively” yelled,\n\nused an obscenity, and threatened to hit Officer Higgins over the head with a food tray.\n\nIn any event, Officer Higgins could not have been motivated by Keller’s threat of\n\nlitigation against the Parole Board because Keller did not threaten the Parole Board until\n\nafter Officer Higgins issued the misconduct. Therefore, we conclude that the District\n\nCourt properly granted summary judgment in favor of Officer Higgins on this claim.\n\n              We also agree with the District Court that Parole Board Secretary\n\nZwierznya was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that she was not personally\n\ninvolved in any aspect of Keller’s sentencing or parole hearings. See Rode v.\n\nDellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). Here, Keller failed to show that\n\nSecretary Zwierznya participated in any way in the 1997, 2001, or 2002 parole hearings or\n\nthe subsequent review process. Rather, Keller claimed only that Zwierznya acted as\n\nSecretary of the Parole Board, and that her signature appeared at the bottom of the Parole\n\nBoard’s decisions. These allegations are insufficient to establish that Secretary\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fZwierznya was somehow personally involved in Keller’s case. Therefore, the District\n\nCourt correctly found that Secretary Zwierznya was entitled to summary judgment.\n\n              We further agree with the District Court’s disposition of Keller’s claim\n\nagainst Parole Board member Sean Ryan. In the complaint, Keller alleged that Ryan\n\nimproperly denied him re-parole in 2001 and 2002 in retaliation for his refusal to pay a\n\ncertain fee, and in retaliation for his having threatened litigation against the Parole Board.\n\nIn Wilson v. Rackmill, we recognized that parole officers are entitled to absolute\n\nimmunity when the challenged act arises from their “adjudicatory duties” as distinguished\n\nfrom their executive, administrative, or investigative duties. 878 F.2d 772, 775 (3d Cir.\n\n1989). In the present matter, the record indicates that Ryan interviewed Keller for re-\n\nparole and took part in deciding whether Keller should be granted re-parole in 2001 and\n\n2002. These actions were adjudicatory in nature. See id. (finding that defendants were\n\nperforming adjudicatory duties when they were serving as parole hearing examiners).\n\nAccordingly, the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Parole\n\nBoard member Ryan on the grounds that he was immune.\n\n              Finally, we note that in his notice of appeal, Keller does not appear to seek\n\nreview of the District Court’s October 10, 2006 order denying his motion for\n\nreconsideration. Nonetheless, in deference to Keller being a pro se litigant, we have\n\nreviewed Keller’s motion and the District Court’s order and conclude that the District\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion on the grounds that Keller failed\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fto present any newly discovered evidence or legal precedent. See Hudson United Bank v.\n\nLitenda Mortgage Corp., 142 F.3d 151, 159 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court properly\n\nentered summary judgment against Keller on all of his claims. Accordingly, because this\n\nappeal lacks an arguable basis, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f",

In the\n\ncomplaint, Keller alleged that: (1) he was denied due process and equal protection when\n\nthe Parole Board, Zwierzyna, and Ryan improperly denied him re-parole on three\n\noccasions in retaliation for his refusal to pay a certain fee, and in retaliation for his having\n\nthreatened litigation against the Parole Board; (2) Zwierzyna refused to consider his\n\nallegation that his sentence had been miscalculated; (3) on September 6, 2001,\n\nCorrectional Officer Higgins issued a false misconduct charge against him; and (4) during\n\ninstitutional disciplinary proceedings on the misconduct charge, Hearing Examiner\n\nDonald Jones denied Keller his right to present witnesses and excluded other evidence.\n\nKeller also alleged that he was subject to cruel and unusual punishment when, as a result\n\nof the misconduct charge, he was placed in the prison’s Restricted Housing Unit (“RHU”)\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\ffor 90 days.1\n\n                Keller subsequently filed an amended complaint in which he named as\n\ndefendants Chief Hearing Examiner Robert Bitner and SCI-Dallas Superintendent\n\nThomas Lavan, whom he alleged improperly denied his appeals from the misconduct\n\ncharge. Keller sought damages and a declaratory judgment against these defendants.\n\n                On September 9, 2004, the District Court entered an order granting partial\n\nsummary judgment to the defendants, and dismissed Keller’s claims against the Parole\n\nBoard, Hearing Examiners Robert Bitner and Donald Jones, and Superintendent Thomas\n\nLavan. The District Court initially permitted Keller to proceed on his claims against\n\nParole Board members Kathleen Zwierzyna and Sean Ryan, and Correctional Officer\n\nHiggins, but, by order dated March 29, 2006, granted summary judgment in favor of these\n\ndefendants as well. Keller submitted a timely motion for reconsideration, which the\n\nDistrict Court denied on October 10, 2006. The present appeal followed.2\n\n                We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. See\n\nTourscher v. McCullough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765240\"><a href=\"/opinion/765240/mark-d-tourscher-v-martin-horn-secretary-of-the-pa-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). Because Keller is\n\n\n\n   1\n    Keller’s claims are appropriately brought in a § 1983 action. See, e.g., Wilkinson v.\nDotson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142877\"><a href=\"/opinion/142877/wilkinson-v-dotson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81-82 (2005).\n   2\n     Keller states that he is appealing from the District Court’s March 29, 2006 order\ngranting summary judgment, and does not reference the Court’s earlier summary\njudgment order. Nonetheless, since “the appeal of a final judgment draws into question\nall prior non-final orders and rulings,” Drinkwater v. Union Carbide Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542863\"><a href=\"/opinion/542863/56-fair-emplpraccas-483-53-empl-prac-dec-p-40002-dorothy-drinkwater/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n858 (3d Cir. 1990), we will review the Court’s September 9, 2004 summary judgment\norder as well.\n\n                                              3\n\fproceeding in forma pauperis, we must review this appeal to determine whether it should\n\nbe dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). We dismiss an appeal if it “lacks an\n\narguable basis in law or in fact.” Neitzke v.

Connors v. Fawn Mining Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675115\"><a href=\"/opinion/675115/no-93-3301/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 (3d Cir. 1994). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the\n\nDistrict Court correctly entered summary judgment against Keller on all of his claims.\n\n              First, the District Court properly dismissed Keller’s claim for damages\n\nagainst the defendants in their official capacities, as it is well established that § 1983\n\nclaims against state officials acting in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112293\"><a href=\"/opinion/112293/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1989). The\n\nDistrict Court also properly dismissed Keller’s claims against the Parole Board, as those\n\nclaims were likewise barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See id.; Independent\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fEnterprises, Inc. v. Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732431\"><a href=\"/opinion/732431/independent-enterprises-inc-thomas-lozecki-v-pittsburgh-water-and-sewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172 (3d Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n              We also agree with the District Court that Hearing Examiners Donald Jones\n\nand Robert Bitner and Superintendent Thomas Lavan were entitled to summary judgment\n\non Keller’s claim that he was denied due process during the institutional disciplinary\n\nproceedings following his September 6, 2001 misconduct charge. As the District Court\n\nexplained, an inmate's due process rights are not triggered unless the prison “imposes\n\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life.” Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995). Here, Keller was placed in\n\nRHU for 90 days. We have made clear that this type of confinement does not constitute\n\nan “atypical and significant hardship” so as to trigger due process rights. See Griffin v.\n\nVaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740238\"><a href=\"/opinion/740238/jerome-griffin-v-don-vaughn-hugh-owens-bk-smith-r-johnson-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding that 15 months in segregation was not\n\nan “atypical and significant hardship”).3\n\n              The District Court was also correct in granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof Correctional Officer Higgins on Keller’s claim that the misconduct charge was\n\nfalsified. As discussed above, Keller was not subjected to “atypical and significant\n\nhardship” when he was placed in RHU following his misconduct charge. See Sandin, 515\n\n\n\n   3\n     The District Court did not address Keller’s related claim that his placement in RHU\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment. We conclude, however, that confinement in a\nrestricted housing unit does not in itself constitute cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. See Griffin, 112 F.3d at 708.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fU.S. at 484; Griffin, 112 F.3d at 706. Therefore, because Keller was not deprived of a\n\nprotected liberty interest, his challenge to the misconduct charge is actionable only under\n\nsection 1983 if Officer Higgins issued the misconduct in retaliation for Keller having\n\nexercised a constitutional right. See Rauser v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (2001). Here,\n\nKeller did not present any facts that would establish a retaliatory motive behind the\n\nmisconduct charge. Rather, the record reflects that Officer Higgins issued the charge\n\nfollowing an altercation at the food window during which Keller “aggressively” yelled,\n\nused an obscenity, and threatened to hit Officer Higgins over the head with a food tray.\n\nIn any event, Officer Higgins could not have been motivated by Keller’s threat of\n\nlitigation against the Parole Board because Keller did not threaten the Parole Board until\n\nafter Officer Higgins issued the misconduct. Therefore, we conclude that the District\n\nCourt properly granted summary judgment in favor of Officer Higgins on this claim.\n\n              We also agree with the District Court that Parole Board Secretary\n\nZwierznya was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that she was not personally\n\ninvolved in any aspect of Keller’s sentencing or parole hearings. See Rode v.\n\nDellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). Here, Keller failed to show that\n\nSecretary Zwierznya participated in any way in the 1997, 2001, or 2002 parole hearings or\n\nthe subsequent review process. Rather, Keller claimed only that Zwierznya acted as\n\nSecretary of the Parole Board, and that her signature appeared at the bottom of the Parole\n\nBoard’s decisions. These allegations are insufficient to establish that Secretary\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fZwierznya was somehow personally involved in Keller’s case. Therefore, the District\n\nCourt correctly found that Secretary Zwierznya was entitled to summary judgment.\n\n              We further agree with the District Court’s disposition of Keller’s claim\n\nagainst Parole Board member Sean Ryan. In the complaint, Keller alleged that Ryan\n\nimproperly denied him re-parole in 2001 and 2002 in retaliation for his refusal to pay a\n\ncertain fee, and in retaliation for his having threatened litigation against the Parole Board.\n\nIn Wilson v. Rackmill, we recognized that parole officers are entitled to absolute\n\nimmunity when the challenged act arises from their “adjudicatory duties” as distinguished\n\nfrom their executive, administrative, or investigative duties. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525586\"><a href=\"/opinion/525586/lawrence-d-wilson-aka-amin-a-rashid-v-stephen-j-rackmill/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775 (3d Cir.\n\n1989). In the present matter, the record indicates that Ryan interviewed Keller for re-\n\nparole and took part in deciding whether Keller should be granted re-parole in 2001 and\n\n2002. These actions were adjudicatory in nature. See id. (finding that defendants were\n\nperforming adjudicatory duties when they were serving as parole hearing examiners).\n\nAccordingly, the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Parole\n\nBoard member Ryan on the grounds that he was immune.\n\n              Finally, we note that in his notice of appeal, Keller does not appear to seek\n\nreview of the District Court’s October 10, 2006 order denying his motion for\n\nreconsideration. Nonetheless, in deference to Keller being a pro se litigant, we have\n\nreviewed Keller’s motion and the District Court’s order and conclude that the District\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion on the grounds that Keller failed\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fto present any newly discovered evidence or legal precedent. See Hudson United Bank v.\n\nLitenda Mortgage Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753722\"><a href=\"/opinion/753722/hudson-united-bank-banking-corporation-of-the-state-of-new-jersey-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court properly\n\nentered summary judgment against Keller on all of his claims. Accordingly, because this\n\nappeal lacks an arguable basis, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f</pre>",
