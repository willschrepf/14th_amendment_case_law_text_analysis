These consolidated appeals challenge\nthe federal government’s “contraception mandate,” a regula-\ntory requirement imposed by the Department of Health and\nHuman Services (“HHS”) to implement the terms of the 2010\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                       3\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The mandate\nrequires employers to provide coverage for contraception and\nsterilization procedures in their employee health-care plans on\na no-cost-sharing basis. Noncompliance carries heavy financial\npenalties and the risk of enforcement actions.\n    The plaintiffs are two Catholic families and their closely\nheld corporations—one a construction company in Illinois and\nthe other a manufacturing firm in Indiana. The businesses are\nsecular and for profit, but they operate in conformity with the\nfaith commitments of the families that own and manage them.\nThe plaintiffs object for religious reasons to providing the\nmandated coverage. They sued for an exemption on constitu-\ntional and statutory grounds.\n    Center stage at this juncture is the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb et seq.,\nwhich prohibits the federal government from placing substan-\ntial burdens on “a person’s exercise of religion,” id.\n§ 2000bb-1(a), unless it can demonstrate that applying the\nburden is the “least restrictive means of furthering … [a]\ncompelling governmental interest,” id. § 2000bb-1(b). Focusing\nprimarily on their RFRA claims, the plaintiffs in each case\nmoved for a preliminary injunction. The district judges denied\nrelief, holding that the claims were not likely to succeed. We\nprovisionally disagreed and enjoined enforcement of the\nmandate pending appeal.\n    The appeals have now been briefed and argued and are\nready for decision. Plenary review has confirmed our earlier\njudgment. These cases—two among many currently pending\nin courts around the country—raise important questions about\n\f4                                              Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nwhether business owners and their closely held corporations\nmay assert a religious objection to the contraception mandate\nand whether forcing them to provide this coverage substan-\ntially burdens their religious-exercise rights. We hold that the\nplaintiffs—the business owners and their companies—may\nchallenge the mandate. We further hold that compelling them\nto cover these services substantially burdens their religious-\nexercise rights. Under RFRA the government must justify the\nburden under the standard of strict scrutiny. So far it has not\ndone so, and we doubt that it can. Because the RFRA claims are\nvery likely to succeed and the balance of harms favors protect-\ning the religious-liberty rights of the plaintiffs, we reverse and\nremand with instructions to enter preliminary injunctions\nbarring enforcement of the mandate against them.\n\n\n                              I. Background\nA. The Contraception Mandate\n   On March 23, 2010, Congress adopted the Affordable Care\nAct, a sweeping legislative and regulatory overhaul of the\nnation’s health-care system. The Act “aims to increase the\nnumber of Americans covered by health insurance and\ndecrease the cost of health care.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v.\nSebelius (“NFIB”), 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2580 (2012). One feature of\nthe Act is a requirement that employee health-care plans\ngoverned by ERISA1 provide certain minimum levels of\ncoverage to plan participants and beneficiaries. See 29 U.S.C.\n\n\n1\n    The Employment Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001 et seq.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                      5\n\n§ 1185d (applying the requirements of part A of Title XXVII of\nthe Public Health Services Act as amended by the Affordable\nCare Act to ERISA-governed group health plans). More\nspecifically, the Affordable Care Act establishes a general\nrequirement that employer-sponsored group health-care plans\ncover “preventive care and screenings” for women on a\nno-cost-sharing basis; Congress instructed HHS to fill in the\ndetails:\n       A group health plan and a health insurance\n       issuer offering group or individual health insur-\n       ance coverage shall, at a minimum provide\n       coverage for and shall not impose any cost\n       sharing requirements for—\n          …\n          (4) with respect to women, such addi-\n          tional preventive care and screenings not\n          described in paragraph (1) as provided\n          for in comprehensive guidelines sup-\n          ported by the Health Resources and Ser-\n          vices Administration [“HRSA,” an agency\n          within HHS] for purposes of this para-\n          graph.\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a); see also 29 U.S.C. § 1185d.\n   Before promulgating regulations pursuant to this statutory\ndirective, the HRSA sought advice from the Institute of\nMedicine at the National Academy of Science about what\nservices to include in the preventive-care mandate. Based on\nthe Institute’s recommendations, the HRSA issued\n\f6                                                 Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ncomprehensive guidelines requiring coverage of (among other\nthings) “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration [“FDA”] ap-\nproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and\npatient education and counseling for all women with reproduc-\ntive capacity.” Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women’s Preven-\ntive Services Guidelines: Affordable Care Act Expands Prevention\nCoverage for Women’s Health and Well-Being, http://www.hrsa.\ngov/womensguidelines/ (last visited Nov. 7, 2013). These\ninclude oral contraceptives (“the pill”), barrier methods,\nimplants and injections, emergency oral contraceptives\n(“Plan B” and “Ella”), and intrauterine devices.2 On\nFebruary 15, 2012, HHS published final regulations incorporat-\ning the HRSA guidelines. See Group Health Plans and Health\nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services,\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012). The agency made the\nmandate effective in the first plan year on or after August 1,\n2012.3 See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(b)(1).\n\n\n\n2\n  See FDA, B IR TH C O N TRO L : M ED IC IN ES TO H ELP Y O U , http://www.fda.gov/\nForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/ucm313215.htm\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n\n3\n  In July the Treasury Department announced a one-year delay in the\nimplementation of the so-called employer mandate. See M ark J. M azur,\nContinuing to Implement the ACA in a Careful, Thoughtful Manner, T REA SU RY\nN O TES (July 2, 2013), http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/pages/\ncontinuing-to-implement-the-aca-in-a-careful-thoughtful-manner-.aspx. The\nannouncement did not mention the contraception mandate, which was\nalready in effect. We assume that the postponement of the employer\nmandate has no effect on the contraception mandate; the government has\nnot advised otherwise.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        7\n\n    Noncompliance with the contraception mandate is pun-\nished by steep financial penalties and other civil remedies. For\nexample, failure to provide the mandated coverage brings a tax\npenalty of $100 per day per employee—$36,500 per year per\nemployee. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(a), (b)(1). If an employer\ndiscontinues offering a health plan altogether, the penalty is\n$2,000 per year per employee. See id. § 4980H(a), (c). In addi-\ntion, noncomplying employers face potential enforcement\nactions by the Secretary of Labor and plan participants and\nbeneficiaries under ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d.\n    Like many of the other employer mandates in the Afford-\nable Care Act, the contraception mandate applies to employers\nwith 50 or more full-time employees. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H.\nSmaller employers—those with fewer than 50 full-time\nemployees—are not required to provide a health plan for their\nemployees and apparently are not subject to the coverage\nminimums, including the contraception mandate. See id. We\nsay “apparently” because it’s not entirely clear that the man-\ndate is categorically inapplicable to small employers; the\ngovernment takes the position that if a small employer not\notherwise required to provide an employee health-care plan\nnonetheless chooses to do so, the regulatory scheme requires\ninclusion of the mandated contraception coverage.\n    Health plans in existence when the Act was adopted are\n“grandfathered” and do not need to comply with the coverage\nminimums—including the contraception mandate—unless the\nplan sponsor makes certain changes to the terms of the plan.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 18011. Grandfathering is a transitional measure;\nthis category will shrink as employer-based plans existing\n\f8                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nprior to March 23, 2010, undergo changes. The government\nestimates that the number of plans in grandfathered status will\ndwindle fairly rapidly as older health-care plans are updated\nand renewed. See Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans\nand Health Insurance Coverage Relating to Status as a\nGrandfathered Health Plan, 75 Fed. Reg. 34,538, 34,552\n(June 17, 2010).\n   Finally, some religious employers are exempt from the\ncontraception mandate, see 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A), but\n“religious employer” was initially defined quite narrowly:\n       [A] “religious employer” [for purposes of an\n       exemption from the contraception mandate] is an\n       organization that meets all of the following\n       criteria:\n          (1) The inculcation of religious values is\n          the purpose of the organization.\n          (2) The organization primarily employs\n          persons who share the religious tenets of\n          the organization.\n          (3) The organization serves primarily\n          persons who share the religious tenets of\n          the organization.\n          (4) The organization is a nonprofit organi-\n          zation as described in section 6033(a)(1)\n          and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the\n          Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amend-\n          ed [covering the tax status of churches\n          and their integrated auxiliaries,\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                         9\n\n             conventions or associations of churches,\n             and the exclusively religious activities of\n             religious orders].\nId. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B).\n\n\nB. The Religious-Employer Controversy\n    The contraception mandate was instantly controversial.4\nThe religious-employer exemption did not leave room for\nconscientious religious objectors other than houses of worship,\ntheir integrated affiliate organizations, and religious orders\nacting as such. In other words, the definition of “religious\nemployer” was so circumscribed that it left out religious\ncolleges and universities; religious hospitals and clinics; reli-\ngious charities and social-service organizations; other faith-\nbased nonprofits; and for-profit, closely held businesses\nmanaged in accordance with a religious mission or creed.\n    HHS responded to the outcry from these left-out employers\nby establishing a temporary “safe harbor” for certain nonprofit\nreligious organizations not covered by the exemption. See\nGroup Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\nCoverage of Preventive Services, 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728. Eventu-\nally the agency proposed a revised definition of “religious\nemployer” and an “accommodation” of a broader class of\n\n4\n The mandate prompted a proliferation of lawsuits by employers seeking\nexemptions on religious-liberty grounds. By one count more than 70 suits\nchallenging the mandate are currently pending. See The Becket Fund for\nReligious Liberty, HHS Mandate Information Central, T H E B EC KET F UN D .O RG ,\nhttp://www.becketfund.org/hhsinformationcentral.\n\f10                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nnonprofit religious organizations with objections to the\nmandated coverage. The new rules were proposed in final\nform on February 6, 2013, see Coverage of Certain Preventive\nServices, 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, published in final form on July 2,\n2013, see 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, and became effective August 1,\n2013, see id.\n    As revised, the exemption drops the first three require-\nments of the earlier definition of “religious employer,” but the\nchange is not intended to alter the exemption’s scope. “Reli-\ngious employer” is now defined as “an organization that is\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to\nin section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The cross-\nreference is the tax exemption for churches and their integrated\nauxiliaries, conventions or associations of churches, and the\nexclusively religious activities of religious orders. See 26 U.S.C.\n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). HHS has explained that “the simplified\nand clarified definition of religious employer does not expand\nthe universe of religious employers that qualify for the\nexemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 final\nregulations.” Coverage of Certain Preventive Services, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 39,874. In other words, the exemption remains limited\nto “[h]ouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.” Id.\n    Under the revised rule, certain nonprofit religiously\naffiliated employers may receive an “accommoda-\ntion”—essentially, an attempted workaround whereby the\nobjecting employer gives notice to its insurance carrier and the\ninsurer issues a separate policy with the mandated coverage.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                       11\n\nThe accommodation is limited to organizations that meet the\nfollowing requirements:\n      (1) The organization opposes providing coverage\n      for some or all of any contraceptive services\n      required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n      on account of religious objections.\n      (2) The organization operates as a nonprofit\n      entity.\n      (3) The organization holds itself out as a religious\n      organization.\n      (4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and\n      manner specified by the Secretary, that it satisfies\n      the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of\n      this section … .\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). Notably for our purposes, neither the\nfinal religious-employer exemption nor the accommodation\napplies to for-profit employers with conscientious religious\nobjections to providing the mandated coverage.\n\n\nC. The Plaintiffs\n   1. The Kortes and K & L Contractors\n   Cyril and Jane Korte own and operate Korte & Luitjohan\nContractors, Inc. (“K & L Contractors”), a construction com-\npany located in Highland, Illinois. K & L Contractors has\napproximately 90 full-time employees, 70 of whom belong to\na union that sponsors their health-insurance plan. The com-\npany provides a health-care plan for the remaining 20 or so\n\f12                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nnonunion employees. Together, Cyril and Jane own about 87%\nof the stock of the corporation and are its only directors. Cyril\nis the president and Jane is the secretary of the company. As\nofficers and directors, they set all company policy.\n    The Kortes are Catholic and follow the teachings of the\nCatholic Church regarding the sanctity of human life from\nconception to natural death and the moral wrongfulness of\nabortion, sterilization, and the use of abortifacient drugs and\nartificial means of contraception. They seek to manage their\ncompany in accordance with their faith commitments. In\nAugust 2012 when the contraception mandate was finalized,\nthe Kortes discovered that their then-existing health plan\ncovered sterilization and contraception—coverage that they\ndid not realize they were carrying. Because providing this\ncoverage conflicts with their religious convictions, they began\nto investigate alternative health-care plans with the intention\nof terminating their existing plan and substituting one that\nconforms to the requirements of their faith.\n    The contraception mandate stood in their way. The com-\npany’s existing health-care plan was set to renew on January 1,\n2013, triggering the requirements of the mandate and the large\nfinancial penalties and possible enforcement actions if they did\nnot comply. As the Kortes understand their religious obliga-\ntions, providing the mandated coverage would facilitate a\ngrave moral wrong. On the other hand, following the teachings\nof their faith and refusing to comply would financially devas-\ntate K & L Contractors and the Kortes as its owners; at $100 per\nday per employee, the monetary penalties would total $730,000\nper year.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                 13\n\n    The Kortes responded to the conflict between their legal\nand religious duties in two ways. First, they promulgated\nethical guidelines for K & L Contractors memorializing the\nfaith-informed moral limitations on the company’s provision\nof health-care benefits, including its inability to provide\ninsurance coverage for abortion, abortifacient drugs, artificial\ncontraception, and sterilization.5 Second, the Kortes and K & L\n\n\n\n5\n    The company’s ethical guidelines are as follows:\n\n              1. As adherents of the Catholic faith, we hold to the\n          teachings of the Catholic Church regarding the sanctity of\n          human life from conception to natural death. We believe\n          that actions intended to terminate an innocent human life\n          by abortion, including abortion-inducing drugs, are\n          gravely sinful. We also adhere to the Catholic Church’s\n          teaching regarding the immorality of artificial means of\n          contraception and sterilization.\n\n              2. As equal shareholders who together own a control-\n          ling interest in Korte & Luitjohan Contractors, Inc., we\n          wish to conduct the business … in a manner that does not\n          violate our religious faith and values.\n\n               3. Accordingly, we and Korte & Luitjohan Contractors,\n          Inc. cannot arrange for, pay for, provide, facilitate, or\n          otherwise support employee health plan coverage for\n          contraceptives, sterilization, abortion, abortion-inducing\n          drugs, or related education and counseling, except in the\n          limited circum stances where a physician certifies that\n          certain sterilization procedures or drugs commonly used\n          as contraceptives are being prescribed with the intent to\n          treat certain medical conditions, not with the intent to\n          prevent or terminate pregnancy, without violating our\n          religious beliefs.\n\f14                                             Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nContractors filed suit in the Southern District of Illinois for a\nreligious exemption from the mandate.\n\n\n     2. The Grotes and Grote Industries\n   The Grote Family owns and manages Grote Industries, Inc.,\na manufacturer of vehicle safety systems headquartered in\nMadison, Indiana.6 Like the Kortes, the members of the Grote\nFamily are Catholic and they manage Grote Industries in\naccordance with their religious commitments, including\nCatholic moral teaching regarding the sanctity of human life\nand the wrongfulness of abortion, abortifacient drugs, artificial\ncontraception, and sterilization.\n   Grote Industries has 1,148 full-time employees at various\nlocations, including 464 in the United States. The company\nprovides a health-care plan that is self-insured and renews\nannually on the first of every year. Consistent with the Grote\nFamily’s Catholic faith, prior to January 1, 2013, the employee\nhealth-care plan did not cover contraception and sterilization\n\n\n6\n  The Grote Family includes individual plaintiffs William D. Grote, III;\nWilliam Dominic Grote, IV; Walter F. Grote, Jr.; M ichael R. Grote;\nW. Frederick Grote, III; and John R. Grote. Together with other family\nmembers not named as plaintiffs, they fully own Grote Industries, Inc.,\nwhich in turn is the managing mem ber of Grote Industries, LLC, the\nmanufacturing firm. For ease of reference, we refer to the two companies\nas “Grote Industries.” William D. Grote, III is Chairman and CEO; William\nDominic Grote, IV is President and Chief Operating Officer; Walter F.\nGrote, Jr. is a board member; M ichael R. Grote is the A ssistant Treasurer;\nW. Frederick Grote, III is the Secretary; and John R. Grote is the A ssistant\nSecretary.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        15\n\nprocedures. Starting on that date, however, the requirements\nof the contraception mandate kicked in.\n    Like the Kortes and K & L Contractors, the Grote Family\nand Grote Industries object on religious grounds to providing\ncoverage for contraception, abortion-inducing drugs, and\nsterilization procedures. But with its large full-time workforce,\nthe company faced an annual penalty of almost $17 million if\nit did not comply with the mandate. The Grotes and Grote\nIndustries filed suit in the Southern District of Indiana for a\nreligious exemption from the mandate.\n\n\nD. The Litigation\n    Both complaints name the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and\nthe Treasury as defendants and seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief against the contraception mandate. Both sets of plaintiffs\nallege that the mandate violates their rights under RFRA; the\nFree Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the Free\nSpeech Clause of the First Amendment; and the Administrative\nProcedure Act. The Grote complaint adds a due-process claim.\nIn both cases the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction\nthe day after filing suit, focusing primarily though not exclu-\nsively on their RFRA claims.\n    In Korte the district court in Southern Illinois denied the\nmotion, concluding that the Kortes and K & L Contractors had\nnot demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.\nRegarding the RFRA claim in particular, the judge held that\nalthough the Kortes and K & L Contractors are “persons”\nwithin the meaning of RFRA and may invoke the statute’s\n\f16                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nprotection, the contraception mandate does not substantially\nburden their religious-exercise rights. This is so, the judge held,\nbecause the link between the mandated coverage and the acts\ncondemned by the Kortes’ religion is too attenuated. In other\nwords, the burden on religious exercise is insubstantial because\nthe compelled provision of contraception coverage is too far\nremoved from the independent decisions by plan participants\nand beneficiaries to use contraception. The court also found the\nfree-exercise claim unlikely to succeed.\n    In Grote the district court in Southern Indiana likewise\ndenied the motion, also concluding that the plaintiffs were not\nlikely to succeed on their RFRA claim. Unlike her colleague in\nSouthern Illinois, however, the Indiana judge doubted that a\nsecular, for-profit corporation like Grote Industries has\nreligious-exercise rights under RFRA. The judge did not decide\nthe question, however, concluding instead that any burden on\nthe Grotes or Grote Industries is insignificant because too many\nindependent decisions separate the provision of the mandated\ncoverage and the practices deemed immoral by the Catholic\nChurch. The court also found the constitutional and Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act claims unlikely to succeed.\n    The case from Southern Illinois reached us first, just before\nthe January 1, 2013 deadline for compliance with the mandate.\nThe plaintiffs sought an injunction pending appeal. In a brief\norder and based on our early review of the merits, we provi-\nsionally held that the RFRA claim is likely to succeed and the\nbalance of harms weighs in favor of the religious-liberty rights\nof the plaintiffs. See Korte v. Sebelius, No. 12-3841, 2012 WL\n6757353, *4–5 (7th Cir. Dec. 28, 2012). We enjoined enforcement\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         17\n\nof the mandate pending appeal. Id. at *5. Our colleague\ndissented. Id. at *5–6 (Rovner, J., dissenting).\n    On the strength of our provisional decision in Korte, the\nGrotes and Grote Industries returned to the district court in\nSouthern Indiana and asked for reconsideration. The judge\nacknowledged the similarity between the two cases but\ndeclined to reconsider because our order in Korte had no\nprecedential effect. The plaintiffs appealed and asked for an\ninjunction pending appeal. Tracing our analysis in Korte, we\ngranted the request and enjoined enforcement of the mandate\npending appeal. Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F.3d 850, 853–55 (7th Cir.\n2013). Again, our colleague disagreed, filing a thoughtful\ndissent explaining her contrary position. Id. at 855–67\n(Rovner, J., dissenting).\n    The appeals proceeded to full briefing, and we heard\nargument at the end of May. Since then, four circuits have\nreached decision in similar cases. The Tenth Circuit held that\ntwo closely held, for-profit businesses and their owners are\nlikely to succeed on a claim for an exemption from the\nmandate under RFRA. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius,\n723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. 2013). The Sixth and Third Circuits\ndisagree. Autocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 730 F.3d 618 (6th Cir. 2013);\nConestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sec’y of the U.S. Dep’t of\nHealth & Human Servs., 724 F.3d 377 (3d Cir. 2013). The D.C.\nCircuit recently held that the owners of two closely held, for-\nprofit businesses are likely to succeed on a RFRA challenge to\nthe mandate, although their companies are not. Gilardi v. U.S.\nDep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 13-5069, 2013 WL 5854246\n(D.C. Cir. Nov. 1, 2013).\n\f18                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n                          II. Analysis\n    These cases come to us on appeals from orders denying\npreliminary injunctive relief. See 28 U.S.C. § 1291. To win a\npreliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate\nthat (1) it has no adequate remedy at law and will suffer\nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied; and\n(2) there is some likelihood of success on the merits of the\nclaim. See Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 694 (7th Cir.\n2011). If the moving party meets this threshold burden, the\ncourt weighs the competing harms to the parties if an injunc-\ntion is granted or denied and also considers the public interest.\nSee Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of the Ind. State\nDep’t of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 972 (7th Cir. 2012); Ezell, 651 F.3d\nat 694. This equitable balancing proceeds on a sliding-scale\nanalysis; the greater the likelihood of success on the merits, the\nless heavily the balance of harms must tip in the moving\nparty’s favor. See Planned Parenthood, 699 F.3d at 972. The aim\nis to minimize the costs of a wrong decision. See Stuller, Inc. v.\nSteak N Shake Enters., Inc., 695 F.3d 676, 678 (7th Cir. 2012). Our\nreview proceeds on a split standard of review: We review legal\nconclusions de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and\nequitable balancing for abuse of discretion. Ezell, 651 F.3d at\n694.\n    Here, the analysis begins and ends with the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of the RFRA claim. On the strength of\nthat claim alone, preliminary injunctive relief is warranted;\nthere is no need to remand for the district courts to weigh the\ninjunction equities. Although the claim is statutory, RFRA\nprotects First Amendment free-exercise rights, and “in First\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          19\n\nAmendment cases, ‘the likelihood of success on the merits will\noften be the determinative factor.’ ” ACLU of Ill. v. Alvarez,\n679 F.3d 583, 589 (7th Cir. 2012) (quoting Joelner v. Village of\nWashington Park, Ill., 378 F.3d 613, 620 (7th Cir. 2004)). “This is\nbecause the ‘loss of First Amendment freedoms … unquestion-\nably constitutes irreparable injury … .’ ” Id. (quoting Elrod v.\nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)). Moreover,\nonce the moving party establishes a likelihood of success on\nthe merits, the balance of harms “normally favors granting\npreliminary injunctive relief” because “ ‘injunctions protecting\nFirst Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest.’ ”\nId. at 590 (quoting Christian Legal Soc’y v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853,\n859 (7th Cir. 2006)). The government hasn’t addressed equita-\nble balancing, conceding the point to the plaintiffs. So the\nappeals turn entirely on whether the plaintiffs’ RFRA claims\nare likely to succeed.\n    Two legal questions are contested: (1) is a secular, for-profit\ncorporation a “person” under RFRA; and (2) does the contra-\nception mandate substantially burden the religious-exercise\nrights of any of the plaintiffs, individual or corporate? If the\nanswer to these questions is “yes,” the government must\ndischarge its burden of justifying the mandate under strict\nscrutiny. We conclude as follows: The corporate plaintiffs are\n“persons” under RFRA and may invoke the statute’s protec-\ntion; the contraception mandate substantially burdens the\nreligious-exercise rights of all of the plaintiffs; and the govern-\nment has not carried its burden under strict scrutiny.\n   First, however, we clear away some possible jurisdictional\nobjections.\n\f20                                               Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n    Although the government never challenged jurisdiction,\neither in the district court or here, we have an independent\nobligation to satisfy ourselves that jurisdiction is secure before\nproceeding to the merits. See Minn-Chem, Inc. v. Agrium Inc.,\n683 F.3d 845, 853 (7th Cir. 2012) (en banc); Carroll v. Stryker\nCorp., 658 F.3d 675, 680 (7th Cir. 2011). There are two arguable\njurisdictional issues lurking here: standing and the\nAnti-Injunction Act.7\n\n\n\n\n7\n Just before oral argument, the government filed a “Notice of Supplemental\nBriefing on Jurisdictional Issues,” drawing our attention to a brief it filed\nin response to a jurisdictional order from the Tenth Circuit in Hobby Lobby.\nThe plaintiffs moved to strike this “notice.” Although the government’s\napproach is unorthodox, we have reviewed its supplemental brief in the\nTenth Circuit case. In it the government argued that the corporate plaintiffs\nin Hobby Lobby have standing but the owners of the corporations do not.\nSupplemental Brief for Appellees at 3–9, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius,\n723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. 2013), 2013 W L 1790515 at *3–9. The government\nalso took the position that the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply. Id. at\n12–15, 2013 W L 1790515 at *12–15. The Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc,\nunanimously held that the corporations have standing and that the\nAnti-Injunction Act does not apply; four members of the court also\nconcluded that the individual plaintiffs have standing. See Hobby Lobby,\n723 F.3d at 1121, 1126 (Tymkovich, J.); id. at 1154–56 (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring); id. at 1184–89 (M atheson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nWe have conducted our own jurisdictional analysis and find no jurisdic-\ntional impediments to reaching the merits. Accordingly, the government’s\n“Notice of Supplemental Briefing” is inconsequential, and we deny the\nplaintiffs’ motion to strike.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                        21\n\n    1. Standing\n    Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power to\n“Cases” and “Controversies,” U.S. CONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 1;\nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1146 (2013), a\nlimitation understood to confine the federal courts to “the\ntraditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress\nor prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to persons\ncaused by private or official violation of law,” Summers v. Earth\nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009). The doctrine of standing\nenforces this limitation. Id.; Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). To invoke the authority of a federal\ncourt, a litigant must have “an injury that is concrete, particu-\nlarized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defen-\ndant’s challenged action; and redressable by a favorable\nruling.” Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 445 (2009).\n    The contraception mandate inflicts a concrete and particu-\nlarized injury on all of the plaintiffs.8 The mandate operates\ndirectly on K & L Contractors and Grote Industries, forcing\nthem to provide contraception coverage in their employee\nhealth-care plans on pain of onerous financial penalties and the\npossibility of enforcement actions by federal regulators\n\n\n\n\n8\n  We note that “[w]here at least one plaintiff has standing, jurisdiction is\nsecure and the court will adjudicate the case whether the additional\nplaintiffs have standing or not.” Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 696 n.7\n(7th Cir. 2011) (citing Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n429 U.S. 252, 264 (1977)).\n\f22                                                Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ncharged with implementing the Affordable Care Act.9 The\nthreat of financial penalty and other enforcement action is\neasily sufficient to establish standing to challenge the mandate\nprior to its enforcement. The companies need not violate the\nmandate and risk enforcement of the regulatory scheme before\nbringing suit. See Wis. Right to Life State Political Action Comm.\nv. Barland, 664 F.3d 139, 147 (7th Cir. 2011). The “existence of a\nstatute implies a threat to prosecute, so pre-enforcement\nchallenges are proper [under Article III] because a probability\nof future injury counts as ‘injury’ for purposes of standing.”\nBauer v. Shepard, 620 F.3d 704, 708 (7th Cir. 2010).\n    The Kortes and Grotes also have Article III standing,\nalthough this conclusion requires a bit more elaboration. The\ncontraception mandate injures the individual plaintiffs in two\nconcrete ways. First, because corporate ownership is closely\nheld, the mandate’s indirect effect on the financial interests of\nthe Kortes and Grotes as controlling shareholders is a concrete\ninjury sufficient to support Article III standing under Supreme\nCourt and circuit precedent. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Calif. v.\nAlcan Aluminum Ltd., 493 U.S. 331, 336 (1990) (indirect sole\nshareholders have Article III standing to challenge taxes\nassessed against their wholly owned subsidiaries); Rawoof v.\nTexor Petroleum Co., 521 F.3d 750, 756 (7th Cir. 2008) (sole share-\nholder of a corporation operating a branded petroleum\n\n\n9\n  W hether the corporate plaintiffs are “persons” with religious-exercise\nrights within the meaning of RFRA is a merits question, not a jurisdictional\nquestion. See Chafin v. Chafin, 133 S. Ct. 1017, 1024 (2013); Steel Co. v. Citizens\nfor a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102–03 (1998); Minn-Chem, Inc. v. Agrium Inc.,\n683 F.3d 845, 852–53 (7th Cir. 2012) (en banc).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           23\n\nfranchise has Article III standing to challenge franchisor’s\ntermination of the franchise under the Petroleum Marketing\nPractices Act).\n    Second, the Kortes and the Grotes face an intangible but no\nless concrete injury to their religious-exercise rights. It is\naxiomatic that organizational associations, including corpora-\ntions, act only through human agency. See Reich v. Sea Sprite\nBoat Co., 50 F.3d 413, 417 (7th Cir. 1995) (“incorporeal abstrac-\ntions act through agents”). As owners, officers, and directors\nof their closely held corporations, the Kortes and Grotes set all\ncompany policy and manage the day-to-day operations of their\nbusinesses. Complying with the mandate requires them to\npurchase the required contraception coverage (or self-insure\nfor these services), albeit as agents of their companies and\nusing corporate funds. But this conflicts with their religious\ncommitments; as they understand the requirements of their\nfaith, they must refrain from putting this coverage in place\nbecause doing so would make them complicit in the morally\nwrongful act of another.\n    Compelling a person to do an act his religion forbids, or\npunishing him for an act his religion requires, are paradigmatic\nreligious-liberty injuries sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of\nthe federal courts. See, e.g., Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita\nBeneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 428 (2006); Church of\nthe Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993);\nUnited States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982); Thomas v. Review Bd. of\nthe Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707 (1981); Wisconsin v. Yoder,\n406 U.S. 205 (1972); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963).\n\f24                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    Finally, we note that the shareholder-standing rule does not\nblock the Kortes and Grotes from challenging the mandate.\nThe rule is an aspect of third-party standing doctrine, which\nimplements the general principle that litigants may not sue in\nfederal court to enforce the rights of others. See Franchise Tax\nBd., 493 U.S. at 336; Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975);\nRawoof, 521 F.3d at 757; MainStreet Org. of Realtors v. Calumet\nCity, 505 F.3d 742, 745 (7th Cir. 2007). Subject to certain\nexceptions, the rule “holds that a shareholder generally cannot\nsue for indirect harm he suffers as a result of an injury to the\ncorporation.” Rawoof, 521 F.3d at 757 (citing Franchise Tax Bd.,\n493 U.S. at 336).\n    Like other rules of third-party standing, however, the\nshareholder-standing rule is a prudential limitation and does\nnot affect the court’s authority to hear the case. “Prudential-\nstanding doctrine ‘is not jurisdictional in the sense that\nArticle III standing is.’ ” Id. at 756 (quoting MainStreet Realtors,\n505 F.3d at 747). Unlike true jurisdictional rules, prudential\nlimitations on standing can be waived. See G & S Holdings LLC\nv. Cont’l Cas. Co., 697 F.3d 535, 540 (7th Cir. 2012); MainStreet\nRealtors, 505 F.3d at 747. By failing to raise the shareholder-\nstanding rule in the district court or here, the government\nwaived it. Although we have the discretion to overlook the\nwaiver, see Rawoof, 521 F.3d at 756–57; MainStreet Realtors,\n505 F.3d at 747, doing so here would be pointless. A well-\nestablished exception allows “a shareholder with a direct,\npersonal interest in a cause of action to bring suit even if the\ncorporation’s rights are also implicated.” Franchise Tax Bd.,\n493 U.S. at 336. The Kortes and the Grotes fall comfortably\nwithin the exception; they have a direct and personal interest\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                    25\n\nin vindicating their individual religious-liberty rights, even\nthough the rights of their closely held corporations are also at\nstake.\n\n\n     2. The Anti-Injunction Act\n    The Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the\npurpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax\nshall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not\nsuch person is the person against whom such tax was\nassessed.” 26 U.S.C. § 7421(a). The Act “protects the Govern-\nment’s ability to collect a consistent stream of revenue[] by\nbarring litigation to enjoin or otherwise obstruct the collection\nof taxes.” NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2582; see also Hibbs v. Winn,\n542 U.S. 88, 103 (2004); Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S. 725,\n736 (1974); Enochs v. Williams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S.\n1, 7 (1962). By operation of the Act, a tax ordinarily may be\nchallenged only in a suit for a refund after it is paid. NFIB,\n132 S. Ct. at 2582; Bob Jones Univ., 416 U.S. at 736–37.\n    The Anti-Injunction Act does not apply here.10 These are\nnot suits “for the purpose of” restraining the assessment or\ncollection of a tax. The suits seek relief from a regulatory\nmandate that exists separate and apart from the assessment or\ncollection of taxes. The contraception mandate is not itself a tax\n\n\n\n10\n  The A nti-Injunction Act is generally assumed to be a jurisdictional bar.\nSee Enochs v. Williams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 6–8 (1962). That\nm ay be incorrect. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1157–59 (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring).\n\f26                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nprovision; its location within the United States Code and\ncorresponding HHS regulations underscores as much.\n    The mandate was promulgated by HHS pursuant to\nauthority delegated to it by a section of the Affordable Care\nAct that amends the Public Health Services Act. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4). The statutory component of the mandate\nimposes a general preventive-care requirement on all group\nhealth-care plans (including employer-sponsored plans) and\nissuers of individual and group health-insurance policies. See\nid. The mandate is situated in the public-welfare title of the\nCode of Federal Regulations—more specifically, in the part\ncontaining regulations governing the group and individual\nhealth-insurance markets. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130. The mandate\nis backed by stiff tax penalties against employers that fail to\ncomply, see 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D, 4980H, but there are additional\nconsequences for noncompliance, including ERISA enforce-\nment actions by the Secretary of Labor and plan participants\nand beneficiaries, see 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d. Noncompliant\nhealth insurers are subject to the enforcement authority of the\nSecretary of HHS as well as the states in which they operate.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22.\n    It should be clear from this description that the contracep-\ntion mandate is not structured as a predicate to the imposition\nof a tax but is instead an independent regulatory mandate.\nThese lawsuits target the mandate itself.\n    It is true that the complaints name the Treasury Secretary\nas a defendant in addition to the Secretaries of HHS and Labor,\nand the plaintiffs have asked the court to enjoin the enforce-\nment of the mandate by any of them. If the plaintiffs win an\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                             27\n\nexemption from the mandate, they will not be liable for the tax\npenalty under § 4980D and will be insulated from other means\nof enforcement as well. In that sense these lawsuits, if success-\nful, will incidentally affect the corporate plaintiffs’ tax liability.\nBut the Anti-Injunction Act does not reach “all disputes\ntangentially related to taxes.” Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d\n717, 727 (D.C. Cir. 2011); see also Pendleton v. Heard, 824 F.2d\n448, 451–52 (5th Cir. 1987) (restraining the assessment or\ncollection of a tax must be the primary purpose of the lawsuit,\nnot an incidental effect of it, for the Anti-Injunction Act to\napply); Linn v. Chivatero, 714 F.2d 1278, 1282 (5th Cir. 1983)\n(same).\n    Still, there is no doubt that § 4980D, a provision in the\nInternal Revenue Code, is implicated in the remedial sweep of\nthese cases, so we think it best to address whether it is properly\nclassified as a “tax” within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction\nAct. It is not.\n   We acknowledge that Congress used the term “tax” in the\ntext of § 4980D (and also in § 4980H, the alternative “shared\nresponsibility payment” for employers that drop or otherwise\ngo without an employee health-care plan). The language\nCongress uses to describe an exaction is ordinarily the best\nevidence of whether it meant the Anti-Injunction Act to apply.\nSee NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2582–83. But Congress also called the\npayment specified in § 4980D a “penalty.” The statute was\noriginally adopted as part of the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat.\n1936, and was titled “Penalty on Failure to Meet Certain Group\nHealth Plan Requirements,” see id. § 402, 110 Stat. 1936, 2084\n\f28                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n(emphasis added). The language Congress used is contradic-\ntory and thus inconclusive.\n    Other features of § 4980D confirm that the provision is\nmeant to penalize employers for noncompliance with the\nvarious mandates in the Affordable Care Act and its imple-\nmenting regulations. The sheer size of the required payment\nfairly screams “penalty.” Any failure to provide the mandated\nminimum coverage—no matter how significant the deviation—\ncosts the employer a whopping $100 per day per employee. See\n26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b). Exacting such a high price for noncompli-\nance suggests that the congressional objective is punitive. See\nEmpress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 651 F.3d\n722, 729 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[A] tax might be so totally punitive in\npurpose and effect that, since nomenclature is unimportant, it\nshould be classified as a fine rather than a tax.”) (applying the\nparallel Tax Injunction Act, which protects the collection of\nstate taxes).\n   When Congress regulates private conduct and makes\nnoncompliance painful by exacting severe and disproportion-\nate monetary consequences, the primary purpose of the\nscheme must be understood as regulatory and punitive rather\nthan revenue raising. See Robertson v. United States, 582 F.2d\n1126, 1128 (7th Cir. 1978) (the Anti-Injunction Act does not\napply to “the exaction of a purely regulatory tax”). The\nobvious aim of § 4980D is not to raise revenue but to achieve\nbroad compliance with the regulatory regime through deter-\nrence and punishment. This is so even though the exaction\ngenerates some revenue because “deterrence is never perfect.”\nEmpress Casino, 651 F.3d at 728–29; see also Retail Indus. Leaders\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        29\n\nAss’n v. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180, 189 (4th Cir. 2007) (the Tax\nInjunction Act does not apply to a challenge to Maryland’s\n“Fair Share Act” requiring a minimum level of spending on\nemployee health-care benefits).\n    The statute also contains several exceptions based on the\nemployer’s scienter, see 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(c), a key indication\nthat the payment is a penalty, not a tax. See NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at\n2595 (“[S]cienter requirements are typical of punitive statutes,\nbecause Congress often wishes to punish only those who\nintentionally break the law.”); Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.\n(Child Labor Tax Case), 259 U.S. 20, 37 (1922) (“Scienter[] [is]\nassociated with penalties, not with taxes.”). Finally, the\n$100-per-day-per-employee formula is repeated verbatim in\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(ii), which authorizes the Secretary\nof HHS to impose the same sort of penalty on noncompliant\ninsurers that § 4980D(b)(1) imposes on noncompliant employ-\ners.\n    Together, these aspects of the regulatory scheme all point\nin the same direction: Section 4980D is a penalty for noncom-\npliance with the regulatory mandates on employer-based\nhealth-care plans. It is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-\nInjunction Act. By parallel reasoning the same is true of the\nalternative payment in § 4980H. This conclusion comports with\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in NFIB, which held that the\nAffordable Care Act’s “shared responsibility payment” for\nnoncompliance with the individual insurance mandate is not\na tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. 132 S. Ct. at\n2582–84. Here, as in NFIB, the Anti-Injunction Act does not\nblock a decision on the merits.\n\f30                                         Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nB. The RFRA Claim\n    In Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of\nOregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 883–90 (1990), the Supreme Court\nheld that the religious freedom guaranteed by the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment does not require religious\nexemptions from facially neutral laws of general applicability.11\nSmith altered the then-prevailing standard of Sherbert v. Verner,\n374 U.S. at 406–07, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 220–21,\nwhich applied strict scrutiny to laws that had the effect of\nburdening religious practices. Under Sherbert and Yoder, a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise—even one arising\nfrom the application of a religion-neutral, generally applicable\nlaw—was unconstitutional unless the government could show\nthat the burden was the least restrictive means of furthering a\ncompelling public interest. Smith changed that understanding\nof the free-exercise right. The Court held that neutral laws of\ngeneral applicability need only satisfy the basic test for\nrationality that applies to all laws; if a law incidentally burdens\nthe exercise of religion, the Constitution does not require an\nexemption. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878–79, 888–90.\n    Congress responded to this shift in free-exercise doctrine by\nenacting RFRA, “a statutory rule comparable to the constitu-\ntional rule rejected in Smith.” O Centro Espirita, 546 U.S. at 424;\nsee also Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 714–15 (2005); City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 512 (1997).

Prospective applica-\ntion is qualified by the rule that “statutes enacted by one\nCongress cannot bind a later Congress, which remains free to\nrepeal the earlier statute, to exempt the current statute from the\nearlier statute, to modify the earlier statute, or to apply the\nearlier statute as modified.” Dorsey v. United States, 132 S. Ct.\n2321, 2331 (2012). RFRA accounts for this principle too; the\nstatute does not apply to a subsequently enacted law if it\n\n\n13\n  In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 532–36 (1997), the Supreme Court\nheld that as applied to the States, RFRA exceeded Congress’s legislative\nauthority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This did not call into\nquestion Congress’s authority to “determine how the national government\nwill conduct its own affairs,” O’Bryan v. Bureau of Prisons, 349 F.3d 399, 401\n(7th Cir. 2003), so RFRA remains in full force against the federal govern-\nment, see Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, 546 U.S.\n418 (2006); see also O’Bryan, 349 F.3d at 401.\n\f34                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n“explicitly excludes such application by reference to this\nchapter.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(b). We note the qualifier only to\nexplain how RFRA works; it has no bearing here. The Afford-\nable Care Act does not explicitly exclude application of RFRA.\n\n\n                               * * *\n    Congress’s protective stance in favor of religious accommo-\ndation could not be clearer. RFRA’s statement of purpose\nexplicitly reaffirms our national commitment to the “free\nexercise of religion as an unalienable right,” id. § 2000bb(a)(1),\nexisting prior to and above ordinary law. RFRA is structured\nas a “sweeping ‘super-statute,’ cutting across all other federal\nstatutes (now and future, unless specifically exempted) and\nmodifying their reach.” Michael Stokes Paulsen, A RFRA Runs\nThrough It: Religious Freedom and the U.S. Code, 56 MONT. L. REV .\n249, 253 (1995). It is “both a rule of interpretation” and “an\nexercise of general legislative supervision over federal agen-\ncies, enacted pursuant to each of the federal powers that gives\nrise to legislation or agencies in the first place.” Douglas\nLaycock & Oliver S. Thomas, Interpreting the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, 73 TEX. L. REV . 209, 211 (1994); see also Nicholas\nQuinn Rosenkranz, Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation,\n115 HARV . L. REV . 2085, 2110 (2002) (explaining the function of\ngenerally applicable statutory rules of interpretation).\n    In short, RFRA operates as a kind of utility remedy for the\ninevitable clashes between religious freedom and the realities\nof the modern welfare state, which regulates pervasively and\ntouches nearly every aspect of social and economic life. See\nThomas C. Berg, What Hath Congress Wrought? An Interpretative\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           35\n\nGuide to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 39 VILL. L. REV . 1,\n25–26 (1994). Judges are assigned the task of mediating these\nconflicts. RFRA makes that role clear, “mandating consider-\nation, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to rules\nof general applicability.” O Centro Espirita, 546 U.S. at 436\n(internal quotation marks and alteration marks omitted).\nCongress has instructed the judiciary to hold the entire federal\nregulatory apparatus to the standard of Sherbert, unless a\nstatute specifically says otherwise.\n\n\n                                * * *\n    Once a RFRA claimant makes a prima facie case that the\napplication of a law or regulation substantially burdens his\nreligious practice, the burden shifts to the government to\njustify the burden under strict scrutiny. O Centro Espirita,\n546 U.S. at 428. “Congress’s express decision to legislate the\ncompelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should\nbe adjudicated in the same manner as constitutionally man-\ndated applications of the test … .” Id. at 430. Thus, in RFRA liti-\ngation, as in First Amendment litigation, “the burdens at the\npreliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.” Id. at\n429.\n\n\n   1. For-Profit Corporations as RFRA “Persons”\n   RFRA’s general rule prohibits the federal government from\nplacing substantial burdens on “a person’s exercise of religion”\nabsent compelling justification, and only then if the burden is\nthe least restrictive means of furthering the compelling\n\f36                                                Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ngovernmental objective. As originally enacted, RFRA defined\n“exercise of religion” as “the exercise of religion under the First\nAmendment to the Constitution.” Pub. L. No. 103-141, § 5,\n107 Stat. 1488, 1489 (1993). Congress amended the definition in\n2000 with the enactment of the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc\net seq., making the definitions in the two statutes uniform. The\nterm “exercise of religion” in RFRA is now defined by cross-\nreference to the definition of “religious exercise” in RLUIPA:\n“The term ‘religious exercise’ includes any exercise of religion,\nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of\nreligious belief.” Id. §§ 2000cc-5(7)(A), 2000bb-2(4). This defini-\ntion is undeniably very broad, so the term “exercise of reli-\ngion” should be understood in a generous sense.\n    RFRA does not define “person.” This brings the Dictionary\nAct into play.14 The definition there expressly includes corpora-\ntions: “In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nunless the context indicates otherwise[,] … the word[]\n‘person’ … include[s] corporations, companies, associations,\nfirms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as\nwell as individuals … .” 1 U.S.C. § 1 (emphasis added). By\noperation of this omnibus definition, the term “person” in\nRFRA includes corporations, unless the context indicates\notherwise.\n\n\n14\n  The Dictionary Act is notable for its breadth. It contains general defini-\ntions and rules of construction that apply across the United States Code,\nprospectively and retrospectively unless otherwise indicated. See Nicholas\nQuinn Rosenkranz, Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation, 115 H A RV . L. R EV .\n2085, 2110 (2002).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          37\n\n   To determine whether the context “indicates otherwise,”\nthe Supreme Court has instructed us not to stray too far from\nthe statutory text. See Rowland v. Calif. Men’s Colony, Unit II\nMen’s Advisory Council, 506 U.S. 194, 199–200 (1993). “ ‘Context’\nhere means the text of the Act of Congress surrounding the\nword at issue, or the texts of other related congressional\nActs … .” Id. at 199. The inquiry basically asks whether the\ndefinition in the Dictionary Act is a “poor fit” with the text of\nthe statute:\n       Where a court needs help is in the awkward case\n       where Congress provides no particular defini-\n       tion, but the definition in 1 U.S.C. § 1 seems not\n       to fit. There it is that the qualification “unless the\n       context indicates otherwise” has a real job to do,\n       in excusing the court from forcing a square peg\n       into a round hole.\n           The point at which the indication of particu-\n       lar meaning becomes insistent enough to excuse\n       the poor fit is of course a matter of judgment … .\nId. at 200.\n    Nothing in RFRA suggests that the Dictionary Act’s\ndefinition of “person” is a “poor fit” with the statutory scheme.\nTo use the Supreme Court’s colloquialism, including corpora-\ntions in the universe of “persons” with rights under RFRA is\nnot like “forcing a square peg into a round hole.” Id. A corpo-\nration is just a special form of organizational association. No\none doubts that organizational associations can engage in\nreligious practice. The government accepts that some corpora-\ntions—religious nonprofits—have religious-exercise rights\n\f38                                            Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nunder both RFRA and the Free-Exercise Clause. As evidence of\nthis, the contraception mandate exempts a class of religious\norganizations—i.e., churches and their integrated auxiliaries,\nsee 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a)—whether or not they conduct their\nactivities in the corporate form (as many of them do). HHS also\nextends its “accommodation” to a broader set of religiously\naffiliated nonprofit corporations. See id. § 147.131(b).\n    Indeed, the Supreme Court has enforced the RFRA rights\nof an incorporated religious sect, see O Centro Espirita, 546 U.S.\nat 439, aff’g 389 F.3d 973, 973 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (identi-\nfying the plaintiff church as “a New Mexico corporation”), and\nthe free-exercise rights of an incorporated church, see Lukumi,\n508 U.S. at 525, 547. The church corporations in these cases\nwere not in court solely asserting the rights of their members\nbased on associational standing; they were asserting their own\nrights, too.15 Accordingly, we take it as both conceded and\nnoncontroversial that the use of the corporate form and the\nassociated legal attributes of that status—think separate legal\npersonhood, limitations on owners’ liability, special tax\ntreatment—do not disable an organization from engaging in\nthe exercise of religion within the meaning of RFRA (or the\nFree Exercise Clause, for that matter).\n   The government draws the line at religiously affiliated\nnonprofit corporations. That line is nowhere to be found in the\n\n\n\n15\n   For the rules of associational standing, see United Food & Commercial\nWorkers Union Local 751 v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 553 (1996); Hunt\nv. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977);\nand Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 696 (7th Cir. 2011).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        39\n\ntext of RFRA or any related act of Congress. Nor can it be\nfound in the statute’s broader contextual purpose, assuming\nwe were to venture beyond the textual inquiry envisioned by\nthe Supreme Court for resolving Dictionary Act questions. The\ngovernment argues that a religious/nonprofit limitation can be\nfound by implication from judicial interpretations of two\nunrelated employment-discrimination statutes—namely,\nTitle VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)—\nboth of which contain targeted exemptions for religious\nemployers. We are not convinced.\n    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits\nemployment discrimination on the basis of religion. See\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. Certain religious employers are exempt\nfrom this part of Title VII and may take religion into account in\nmaking employment decisions: “This subchapter shall not\napply … to a religious corporation, association, educational\ninstitution, or society with respect to the employment of\nindividuals of a particular religion … .” Id. § 2000e-1(a). The\nADA, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis\nof disability, contains a similar exemption for religious employ-\ners. See id. § 12113(d)(1)–(2). Some lower courts have developed\nmultifactor tests to determine when Title VII’s religious-\nemployer exemption applies; the nonprofit status of the\nemployer is considered a relevant factor. See, e.g., Spencer v.\nWorld Vision, Inc., 633 F.3d 723, 727 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc)\n(per curiam); LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass’n,\n503 F.3d 217, 226 (3d Cir. 2007); Univ. of Great Falls v. NLRB,\n278 F.3d 1335, 1343–44 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (applying a religious-\nemployer exemption implied by the Supreme Court as a matter\nof constitutional avoidance to limit the reach of the National\n\f40                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nLabor Relations Act); Killinger v. Samford Univ., 113 F.3d 196,\n198–99 (11th Cir. 1997); EEOC v. Townley Eng’g & Mfg. Co.,\n859 F.2d 610, 618–19 (9th Cir. 1988). Relying on this line of\ncases, the government argues that Congress “carried forward”\na nonprofit limitation when it enacted RFRA.\n    Never mind that much of this caselaw postdates the\nenactment of RFRA. The more important point is that a\nhandful of lower-court decisions applying an interpretive gloss\nto Title VII’s religious-employer exemption hardly implies that\nCongress meant to limit RFRA in the same way. As the Tenth\nCircuit noted in Hobby Lobby, the government asks us to infer\nfrom congressional silence that a “similar narrowing construc-\ntion[] should be imported into” RFRA. 723 F.3d at 1130. The\nTenth Circuit found this argument “strained,” id., and so do\nwe. If Congress intended a nonprofit limitation in RFRA,\nsurely there would be some hint of it in the statutory text.\n    The government also relies on the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987). We\ndo not understand why. Amos rejected an Establishment\nClause challenge to Title VII’s religious-employer exemption.\nId. at 335–39. The case does not advance the government’s\nposition here.\n    To the contrary, the church labor-relations cases illuminate\na fundamental flaw in the government’s argument—its failure\nto recognize that RFRA protects religious liberty more broadly\nthan the religious-employer exemptions in Title VII and the\nADA. To see how, it’s helpful to return to some first principles\nof free-exercise doctrine.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                            41\n\n    It’s well understood that the Free Exercise Clause protects\n“first and foremost, the right to believe and profess,” but also\nthe right to engage in religiously motivated conduct. Smith,\n494 U.S. at 877. (“The ‘exercise of religion’ often involves not\nonly belief and profession but the performance of (or absten-\ntion from) physical acts … .”); see also Bob Jones Univ. v. United\nStates, 461 U.S. 574, 603 (1983) (“[T]he Free Exercise Clause\nprovides substantial protection for lawful conduct grounded\nin religious belief … .”); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296,\n303 (1940) (The “[First] Amendment embraces two con-\ncepts[]—[the] freedom to believe and freedom to act.”). This\ndoctrine reflects the original understanding of the right. See\nMichael W. McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding\nof Free Exercise of Religion, 103 HARV . L. REV . 1409, 1488 (1990)\n(“[T]he term ‘free exercise’ makes clear that the clause protects\nreligiously motivated conduct as well as belief.”).\n    The right to believe and profess is absolute. See Bob Jones\nUniv. v. United States, 461 U.S. at 603 (the Free Exercise Clause\nis “an absolute prohibition against governmental regulation of\nreligious beliefs”); Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 402 (“The door of the\nFree Exercise Clause stands tightly closed against any govern-\nmental regulation of religious beliefs as such … .” (emphasis\nadded)); W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642\n(1943) (“If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constella-\ntion, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall\nbe orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters\nof opinion or force citizens to confess by work or act their faith\ntherein.”). Religiously motivated conduct is necessarily subject\nto some regulation for the essential public good. Sherbert,\n374 U.S. at 403 (religiously motivated conduct may be\n\f42                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nregulated to prevent “substantial threat[s] to public safety,\npeace or order”).\n    Free-exercise problems usually arise when a law, regula-\ntion, or some action of a public official interferes with a\nreligiously motivated practice, forbearance, or other conduct.\nThese claims present in distinct ways, reflecting different\ndimensions of the right. See generally Douglas Laycock, Towards\na General Theory of the Religion Clauses: The Case of Church Labor\nRelations and the Right to Church Autonomy, 81 COLUM . L. REV .\n1373, 1388–89 (1981); Eugene Volokh, A Common-Law Model for\nReligious Exemptions, 46 UCLA L. REV . 1465, 1505–08 (1999).\n     One obvious and intuitive aspect of religious liberty is the\nright of conscientious objection to laws and regulations that\nconflict with conduct prescribed or proscribed by an adherent’s\nfaith. Sherbert, Yoder, and Thomas are the paradigm cases in this\ncategory. In Sherbert a Seventh-day Adventist was denied\nunemployment compensation benefits after she lost her job for\nrefusing to work on her Sabbath day. 374 U.S. at 399–400. In\nYoder Amish families challenged the application of a state\ncompulsory-education law requiring their children to attend\npublic school through age 16. 406 U.S. at 207–09. In Thomas a\nJehovah’s Witness was denied unemployment compensation\nbenefits after he was fired for declining a job transfer to a\ndepartment that produced war materials. 450 U.S. at 709–12. In\nall three cases, the claimants asserted a conscientious objection\nto legal burdens placed on their religiously motivated conduct.\nIn all three the Supreme Court held that the Free Exercise\nClause required an exemption. See id. at 718–19; Yoder, 406 U.S.\nat 234–36; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 398–99.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         43\n\n    A different aspect of religious liberty protects, broadly\nspeaking, the autonomy of the church. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &\nSchool v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 694, 706 (2012), this strand of\nreligious-liberty doctrine “gives special solicitude to the rights\nof religious organizations” as religious organizations, respect-\ning their autonomy to shape their own missions, conduct their\nown ministries, and generally govern themselves in accordance\nwith their own doctrines as religious institutions. Id. at 704–06.\nThe paradigm cases in this category are Hosanna-Tabor itself,\nwhich recognized the right of churches to choose their own\nministers (broadly understood) and adopted a constitutional\nministerial exception to laws regulating employment discrimi-\nnation, see id. at 705–06, and the church-property cases, see\nSerbian E. Orthodox Diocese for the U.S. & Can. v. Milivojevich,\n426 U.S. 696 (1976); Presbyterian Church in the U.S. v. Mary\nElizabeth Blue Hull Mem’l Presbyterian Church, 393 U.S. 440\n(1969); Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox\nChurch in N. Am., 344 U.S. 94 (1952).\n    The church-autonomy doctrine respects the authority of\nchurches to “select their own leaders, define their own doc-\ntrines, resolve their own disputes, and run their own institu-\ntions” free from governmental interference. Laycock, Towards\na General Theory of the Religion Clauses, supra, at 1389. This\ndimension of religious liberty has a foothold in both Religion\nClauses, see Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 702, and is perhaps best\nunderstood as marking a boundary between two separate\npolities, the secular and the religious, and acknowledging the\nprerogatives of each in its own sphere. For example, in\nMilivojevich, a church-property case, the Court explained that\n\f44                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nthe First Amendment “permit[s] hierarchical religious organi-\nzations to establish their own rules and regulations for internal\ndiscipline and government, and to create tribunals for adjudi-\ncating disputes over these matters.” 426 U.S. at 724. When a\nchurch tribunal or other religious authority decides an internal\ndispute, “the Constitution requires … civil courts [to] accept\nth[at] decision[] as binding.” Id. at 725; see also Richard W.\nGarnett, A Hands-Off Approach to Religious Doctrine: What Are\nWe Talking About?, 84 NOTRE DAME L. REV . 837, 861 (2009)\n(explaining that the church-autonomy doctrine recognizes that\nsecular tribunals “lack the power to answer some ques-\ntions—religious questions—whose resolution is, under an\nappropriately pluralistic political theory, left to other institu-\ntions”).\n    Two related principles are at work in these cases. First, civil\nauthorities have no say over matters of religious governance;\nand second, secular judges must defer to ecclesiastical authori-\nties on questions properly within their domain. These limita-\ntions arise from the justification for the different aspects of\nreligious liberty secured by the Religion Clauses. See Douglas\nLaycock, Church Autonomy Revisited, 7 GEO . J.L. & PUB . POL ’Y\n253, 260–65 (2009). As the Supreme Court explained in\nHosanna-Tabor:\n       Requiring a church to accept or retain an un-\n       wanted minister, or punishing a church for\n       failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere\n       employment decision. Such action interferes with\n       the internal governance of the church, depriving\n       the church of control over the selection of those\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                         45\n\n         who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an\n         unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free\n         Exercise Clause, which protects a religious\n         group’s right to shape its own faith and mission\n         through its appointments. According the state\n         the power to determine which individuals will\n         minister to the faithful also violates the Establish-\n         ment Clause, which prohibits governmental\n         involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\n132 S. Ct. at 706.\n    In this way the Religion Clauses work together to protect\nthe institutional freedom of the church “for itself, and not\nsimply as a proxy for the religious-liberty rights of individu-\nals,” in light of the Constitution’s ordering of the relationship\nbetween religion and government.

By their terms the exemptions are limited to reli-\ngiously affiliated employers, a limitation that makes sense in\nlight of the rationale for the rule. The exemption is categorical,\nnot contingent; there is no balancing of competing interests,\npublic or private. In other words, where it applies, the church-\nautonomy principle operates as a complete immunity, or very\nnearly so. Such a strong hands-off principle isn’t justified for\norganizational associations that are not religiously affiliated.\n    In contrast, the judicial remedy in RFRA is both broader\nand more flexible. It covers religious organizations as such, but\nit does not stop there. The remedy is available to any sincere\nreligious objector—individuals and organizations alike—and\nits organizational applications are not limited to religiously\naffiliated organizations. The exemption is comprehensive in\nthat it applies across the United States Code and Code of\nFederal Regulations and restrains the conduct of all federal\nofficials. But it can be overridden by a sufficiently strong\ngovernmental interest.\n    For these reasons, the cases interpreting the Title VII and\nADA exemptions do not shed light on the scope of the RFRA\nexemption. The government’s proposed exclusion of secular,\nfor-profit corporations finds no support in the text or relevant\ncontext of RFRA or any related statute.\n\n\n\n\n16\n  (...continued)\nthe Ministerial Exemption, 160 U. P A . L. R EV . PENN U M BRA 289 (2012).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          47\n\n                              * * *\n     That’s enough to resolve the matter, but it’s worth briefly\nexploring whether RFRA’s animating purpose provides a clue\nthat it is not meant to apply to secular, for-profit corporations.\nCongress was clear that RFRA codifies pre-Smith free-exercise\njurisprudence—in particular, the rule of Sherbert and Yoder—so\nif the Supreme Court’s pre-Smith free-exercise cases categori-\ncally excluded secular, for-profit corporations, then perhaps\nRFRA should be understood that way, too.\n    We begin by reiterating two doctrinal points we made a\nmoment ago: (1) the Free Exercise Clause protects not just\nbelief and profession but also religiously motivated conduct;\nand (2) individuals and organizations—whether incorporated\nor not—can exercise religion. It’s common ground that\nnonprofit religious corporations exercise religion in the sense\nthat their activities are religiously motivated. So unless there is\nsomething disabling about mixing profit-seeking and religious\npractice, it follows that a faith-based, for-profit corporation can\nclaim free-exercise protection to the extent that an aspect of its\nconduct is religiously motivated.\n    We acknowledge the novelty of the question; the Supreme\nCourt has never considered whether a for-profit corporation\nmay assert a free-exercise claim. See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.\nSebelius, 133 S. Ct. 641, 643 (Sotomayor, Circuit Justice 2012)\n(“This Court has not previously addressed similar RFRA or\nfree exercise claims brought by closely held for-profit corpora-\ntions and their controlling shareholders … .”). But the Court\nhas on several occasions addressed the free-exercise rights of\nindividuals engaged in commercial or profit-making activity.\n\f48                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    We have already mentioned Thomas and Sherbert, both of\nwhich involved claimants who lost their jobs for refusing to\nwork on days or in ways that would violate their faith. See\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 709–11; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 399–400. The\ncases challenged the denial of unemployment compensation\nbenefits, but the background facts involved the loss of remu-\nnerative employment at a foundry and a mill. In other words,\nEddie Thomas and Adell Sherbert were working for money yet\nthey retained their free-exercise rights and were permitted to\nassert them against the denial of unemployment benefits. The\nCourt held that Thomas and Sherbert could not be compelled\nto choose between their livelihoods and their faith. See Thomas,\n450 U.S. at 717 (“Here, as in Sherbert, the employee was put to\na choice between fidelity to religious belief or cessation of\nwork; the coercive impact on Thomas is indistinguishable from\nSherbert … .”); Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404 (“The [unemployment\ncompensation] ruling forces [Adell Sherbert] to choose\nbetween following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting\nbenefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts\nof her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand.”). If\nthe government is correct that entering the marketplace and\nearning money forfeits free-exercise rights, then Thomas and\nSherbert would have been decided differently.\n    In Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 600–02 (1961), Jewish\nmerchants brought a free-exercise challenge against Pennsylva-\nnia’s Sunday-closing law, which put them at a competitive\ndisadvantage based on their Sabbath. Again, if profit-making\nalone was enough to disqualify the merchants from bringing\nthe claim, the Court surely would have said so. It did not.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        49\n\nInstead, the Court addressed and rejected their free-exercise\nclaim on the merits. Id. at 608–09.\n    In United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982), an Amish farmer\nsought a religious exemption from the obligation to withhold\nand pay Social Security taxes for his employees, coreligionists\nwho worked on his farm and in his carpentry shop. Id. at\n254–55. The Amish religion holds that members of the religious\ncommunity must provide for their own needy and elderly. Id.\nThe Social Security system exempts self-employed religious\nobjectors but not employers, so the farmer asserted a constitu-\ntional right to an exemption. Id. at 255–56. The Court held that\n“compulsory participation in the social security system\ninterferes with the[] free exercise rights” of the Amish. Id. at\n257. But the Court concluded that the strong public interest in\nthe financial soundness of the Social Security system was\nenough to defeat the farmer’s claim for an exemption:\n       The tax system could not function if denomina-\n       tions were allowed to challenge the … system\n       because tax payments were spent in a manner\n       that violates their religious belief[s]. … Because\n       the broad public interest in maintaining a sound\n       tax system is of such a high order, religious belief\n       in conflict with the payment of taxes affords no\n       basis for resisting the tax.\nId. at 260.\n   Like the merchants in Braunfeld, the Amish farmer in Lee\nwas engaged in farming and furniture-making not for subsis-\ntence but for profit. If moneymaking were enough to foreclose\n\f50                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nthe claim, the Court would not have addressed the burden on\nhis free-exercise rights or the public interest in the sound\nadministration of the Social Security system. Instead, the Court\ngave the claim plenary review and found a compelling reason\nto deny an exemption.\n   These cases show that far from categorically excluding\nprofit-seekers from the scope of the free-exercise right, the\nSupreme Court has considered their claims on the merits,\ngranting exemptions in some and not others based on the\ncompelling-interest test.\n    The government relies on a concluding statement in Lee as\nsupport for its position that profit-making is incompatible with\nfree-exercise rights:\n           Congress and the courts have been sensitive\n       to the needs flowing from the Free Exercise\n       Clause, but every person cannot be shielded\n       from all the burdens incident to exercising every\n       aspect of the right to practice religious beliefs.\n       When followers of a particular sect enter into com-\n       mercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they\n       accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience\n       and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory\n       schemes which are binding on others in that activity.\nId. at 261 (emphasis added).\n   The government apparently reads this passage as foreclos-\ning all religious-exercise claims arising in the course of\ncommercial activity merely because the context is commercial.\nThat reading is both unsound and extraordinary. Unsound\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        51\n\nbecause it would nullify the rest of the Court’s opinion, which\nconsidered the Amish farmer’s claim on the merits even\nthough his activities were for profit; the commercial context\ndid not defeat the claim. And extraordinary because it would\nleave religious exercise wholly unprotected in the commercial\nsphere. At bottom, the government’s argument is premised on\na far-too-narrow view of religious freedom: Religious exercise\nis protected in the home and the house of worship but not\nbeyond. Religious people do not practice their faith in that\ncompartmentalized way; free-exercise rights are not so\ncircumscribed.\n    If the government’s view is correct, commonplace religious\npractices normally thought protected would fall outside the\nscope of the free-exercise right. The Jewish deli is the usual\nexample. On the government’s understanding of religious\nliberty, a Jewish restaurant operating for profit could be denied\nthe right to observe Kosher dietary restrictions. That cannot be\nright. There is nothing inherently incompatible between reli-\ngious exercise and profit-seeking. The better reading of the\nconcluding dictum in Lee is that it foreshadowed the coming\nholding in Smith eight years later. The references to “incidental\nburdens” and “statutory schemes binding on others” suggest\nas much.\n    In short, nothing in the Supreme Court’s free-exercise\njurisprudence prior to Smith categorically forecloses RFRA\nclaims by profit-seeking entities.\n\n\n                             * * *\n\f52                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    For the sake of completeness, we note as well that nothing\nin the Court’s general jurisprudence of corporate constitutional\nrights suggests a nonprofit limitation on organizational free-\nexercise rights. Prior to Smith, and continuing to the present\nday, the Court has held that corporations may claim some but\nnot all constitutional rights. See Darrell A. H. Miller, Guns, Inc.:\nCitizens United, McDonald, and the Future of Corporate Constitu-\ntional Rights, 86 N.Y.U. L. REV . 887, 908–11 (2011) (collecting\ncases).\n    For example, long before Citizens United reinvigorated the\npolitical-speech rights of corporations, see Citizens United v.\nFEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), the Court confirmed that corporations\nhave free-speech rights, see, e.g., Bd. of Trs. of the State Univ. of\nN.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469 (1989); Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Pub. Utils.\nComm’n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 8 (1986) (plurality opinion); Central\nHudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y., 447 U.S.\n557 (1980); First Nat’l Bank of Bos. v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 776\n(1978); N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). Prior to\nSmith the Court held that the Fourth Amendment protected\ncorporations from unreasonable searches and seizures. See\nSilverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385, 392 (1920);\nHale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76 (1906), overruled on other grounds\nby Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of N.Y. Harbor, 378 U.S. 52\n(1964). Corporations qualify as persons for at least some\npurposes under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See Grosjean v. Am. Press Co.,\n297 U.S. 233, 244 (1936); Covington & Lexington Tpk. Rd. Co. v.\nSandford, 164 U.S. 578, 592 (1896). But see Nw. Nat’l Life Ins. Co.\nv. Riggs, 203 U.S. 243, 255 (1906) (“The liberty referred to in\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         53\n\nth[e] [Fourteenth] Amendment is the liberty of natural, not\nartificial, persons.”). On the other hand, prior to Smith the\nCourt excluded corporations from the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege against self-incrimination, see Wilson v. United States,\n221 U.S. 361, 383–84 (1911), and the emerging right of privacy,\nsee United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 652 (1950).\n    These cases do not yield a unifying theory of corporate\nconstitutional rights, but Bellotti contains some language that\nmight be read to suggest a general decisional approach:\n“Certain ‘purely personal’ guarantees, such as the privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination, are unavailable to\ncorporations and other organizations because the ‘historic\nfunction’ of the particular guarantee has been limited to the\nprotection of individuals.” 435 U.S. at 778 n.14 (quoting United\nStates v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 698–701 (1944)). And this: “Wheth-\ner or not a particular guarantee is ‘purely personal’ or is\nunavailable to corporations for some other reason depends\nupon the nature, history, and purpose of the particular\nconstitutional provision.” Id. But the Court has never elabo-\nrated.\n    Ultimately, we don’t need to parse the cases on corporate\nconstitutional rights too finely. We are confronted here with a\nquestion of statutory interpretation. Our task is to determine\nwhether prior to Smith it was established that a closely held,\nfor-profit corporation could not assert a free-exercise claim. It\nwas not so established. We conclude that K & L Contractors\n\f54                                                 Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nand Grote Industries are “persons” within the meaning of\nRFRA.17\n\n\n     2. Substantial Burden\n    Our next question is whether the contraception mandate\nsubstantially burdens the plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. Recall\nthat “exercise of religion” means “any exercise of religion,\nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious\nbelief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A) (emphases added). At a\nminimum, a substantial burden exists when the government\ncompels a religious person to “perform acts undeniably at\nodds with fundamental tenets of [his] religious beliefs.” Yoder,\n406 U.S. at 218. But a burden on religious exercise also arises\nwhen the government “put[s] substantial pressure on an\nadherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.”\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 718; see also Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868,\n878 (7th Cir. 2009); Koger v. Bryan, 523 F.3d 789, 799 (7th Cir.\n2008). Construing the parallel provision in RLUIPA, we have\nheld that a law, regulation, or other governmental command\n\n\n17\n   We deal here with two corporations that are both closely held and\nmanaged by the families that own them. As we have explained, the Kortes\nand Grotes as controlling shareholders and directors set all company policy\nand personally direct the activities of their corporations; as such, they are\nin a position to operate their businesses in a manner that conforms to their\nreligious commitments. The same normally will not be the case when it\ncomes to large publicly traded corporations, two hallmarks of which are the\nseparation of ownership from control and multimember boards of directors.\nSee 1A W ILLIA M M EA D E F LETC H ER , F LETC H ER C YC LO PED IA O F TH E L AW O F\nC O RPO RATIO N S § 70.10 (2006 rev.).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           55\n\nsubstantially burdens religious exercise if it “bears direct,\nprimary, and fundamental responsibility for rendering [a]\nreligious exercise … effectively impracticable.” Civil Liberties for\nUrban Believers v. City of Chicago, 342 F.3d 752, 761 (7th Cir.\n2003). The same understanding applies to RFRA claims.\n    Importantly, the substantial-burden inquiry does not invite\nthe court to determine the centrality of the religious practice to\nthe adherent’s faith; RFRA is explicit about that. And free-\nexercise doctrine makes it clear that the test for substantial\nburden does not ask whether the claimant has correctly\ninterpreted his religious obligations. See Lee, 455 U.S. at 257;\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 715–16. Indeed, that inquiry is prohibited.\n“[I]n this sensitive area, it is not within the judicial function\nand judicial competence to inquire whether the [adherent\nhas] … correctly perceived the commands of [his] … faith.\nCourts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.” Thomas,\n450 U.S. at 716. It is enough that the claimant has an “honest\nconviction” that what the government is requiring, prohibiting,\nor pressuring him to do conflicts with his religion. Id.; see also\nid. at 715 (“Thomas drew a [religious] line, and it is not for us\nto say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.”).\n    Checking for sincerity and religiosity is important to weed\nout sham claims. The religious objection must be both sincere\nand religious in nature. Cf. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163,\n184–86 (1965) (military-conscription exemption applies only to\nobjections based on sincerely held religious beliefs as opposed\nto philosophical views or a personal moral code). These are\nfactual inquiries within the court’s authority and competence.\nBut we agree with our colleagues in the Tenth Circuit that the\n\f56                                              Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsubstantial-burden test under RFRA focuses primarily on the\n“intensity of the coercion applied by the government to act\ncontrary to [religious] beliefs.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1137.\nPut another way, the substantial-burden inquiry evaluates the\ncoercive effect of the governmental pressure on the adherent’s\nreligious practice and steers well clear of deciding religious\nquestions.\n     On this understanding of substantial burden, there can be\nlittle doubt that the contraception mandate imposes a substan-\ntial burden on the plaintiffs’ religious exercise. K & L Contrac-\ntors and Grote Industries must pay $100 per day per employee\nif they do not include coverage for contraception and steriliza-\ntion in their employee health-care plans. The Kortes and the\nGrotes as corporate owners and managers must arrange for\ntheir companies to provide the mandated coverage. They\nobject on religious grounds to doing so, explaining that\nproviding this coverage would make them complicit in a grave\nmoral wrong and would undermine their ability to give\nwitness to the moral teachings of their church. No one ques-\ntions their sincerity or the religiosity of their objection.18\n\n\n18\n  The Catholic Church’s teaching on the sanctity of human life and the\nmoral wrongfulness of contraception, abortion-inducing drugs, and sterili-\nzation is well docum ented, as is its doctrine of moral complicity and the\nrequirements of Christian witness. See Pope John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae\n[The Gospel of Life] ¶¶ 58–62 (1995), available at http://www.vatican.va/\nholy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_\nevangeliumvitae_en.html; C ATEC H ISM O F TH E C ATH O LIC C H U RC H ¶¶ 2258,\n2270–75, 2284–87, 2366, 2370, 2399 (2d ed. 1997); Pontifical Council for\nJustice and Peace, Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church ¶¶ 62–64,\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                57\n\n    In short, the federal government has placed enormous\npressure on the plaintiffs to violate their religious beliefs and\nconform to its regulatory mandate. Refusing to comply means\nruinous fines, essentially forcing the Kortes and Grotes to\nchoose between saving their companies and following the\nmoral teachings of their faith. This is at least as direct and\nsubstantial a burden as the denial of unemployment compensa-\ntion benefits in Sherbert and Thomas, and the obligation to\nwithhold and pay Social Security taxes in Lee.\n    The government takes a different tack on this question,\narguing that the mandate’s burden on religious exercise is\ninsubstantial because an employee’s decision to use her\ninsurance coverage to purchase contraception or sterilization\nservices “cannot be attributed to” the Kortes or Grotes. In a\ndifferent twist on the same argument, the government also\ninsists that any burden on the plaintiffs’ religious exercise is\ntoo “attenuated” to count as “substantial” because the provi-\nsion of contraception coverage is several steps removed from\nan employee’s independent decision to use contraception. For\nsupport the government relies on Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,\n536 U.S. 639 (2002), and Board of Regents of the University of\nWisconsin System v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217 (2000). Neither\ncase is relevant here.\n\n\n\n\n18\n  (...continued)\n66–68, 230–33 (2005), available at www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_\ncouncils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-\ndott-soc_en.html.\n\f58                                              Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    Zelman upheld Ohio’s school-voucher program against an\nEstablishment Clause challenge because the public funds\nflowed to religious schools only through the private choice of\nthe students’ parents. 536 U.S. at 651–52. Southworth rejected a\nfree-speech challenge to a public university’s student-activity\nfee because the funds collected were allocated to student\ngroups on a viewpoint-neutral basis, removing “ ‘any mistaken\nimpression that the [student groups] speak for the\n[u]niversity’ ” or the objecting student. 529 U.S. at 233 (quoting\nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 841\n(1993)). These cases raised questions about governmental\nendorsement of religion (Zelman) and unwanted speech\n(Southworth). The degree of separation between the govern-\nment and the use of the funds was important to the constitu-\ntional analysis in each case, but it’s not a relevant consideration\nhere.19\n    Aside from its misplaced reliance on Zelman and\nSouthworth, the government’s insistence that the burden is\ntrivial or nonexistent simply misses the point of this religious-\n\n\n19\n  At oral argument the government suggested for the first time that grant-\ning a preliminary injunction against the contraception mandate might create\nEstablishment Clause concerns. That was far too late in the litigation to raise\nthe argument. The Supreme Court has rejected a facial Establishment\nClause challenge to RLUIPA, the parallel—albeit narrower— statutory\nreligious exemption applicable to the States. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.\n709, 720 (2005) (“[W ]e hold that § 3 of RLUIPA fits within the corridor\nbetween the Religion Clauses: On its face, the Act qualifies as a permissible\nlegislative accommodation of religion that is not barred by the Establish-\nm ent Clause.”). The government has not advanced an argument that\napplying RFRA in this context violates the Establishment Clause.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          59\n\nliberty claim. The government focuses on the wrong thing—the\nemployee’s use of contraception—and addresses the wrong\nquestion—how many steps separate the employer’s act of\npaying for contraception coverage and an employee’s decision\nto use it.\n    To the first point: Although the plaintiffs object on religious\ngrounds to the use of contraception, abortifacient drugs, and\nsterilization, it goes without saying that they may neither\ninquire about nor interfere with the private choices of their\nemployees on these subjects. They can and do, however, object\nto being forced to provide insurance coverage for these drugs\nand services in violation of their faith. As we explained in our\norder granting an injunction pending appeal, “[t]he religious-\nliberty violation at issue here inheres in the coerced coverage of\ncontraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services,\nnot—or perhaps more precisely, not only—in the later purchase\nor use of contraception or related services.” Korte, 2012 WL\n6757353, at *3.\n    The government’s “attenuation” argument posits that the\nmandate is too loosely connected to the use of contraception to\nbe a substantial burden on religious exercise. Because several\nindependent decisions separate the employer’s act of providing\nthe mandated coverage from an employee’s eventual use of\ncontraception, any complicity problem is insignificant or\nnonexistent. This argument purports to resolve the religious\nquestion underlying these cases: Does providing this coverage\nimpermissibly assist the commission of a wrongful act in\nviolation of the moral doctrines of the Catholic Church? No\ncivil authority can decide that question.\n\f60                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    To repeat, the judicial duty to decide substantial-burden\nquestions under RFRA does not permit the court to resolve\nreligious questions or decide whether the claimant’s under-\nstanding of his faith is mistaken. Lee, 455 U.S. at 257; Thomas,\n450 U.S. at 715–16. The question for us is not whether compli-\nance with the contraception mandate can be reconciled with\nthe teachings of the Catholic Church. That’s a question of\nreligious conscience for the Kortes and the Grotes to decide.\nThey have concluded that their legal and religious obligations\nare incompatible: The contraception mandate forces them to do\nwhat their religion tells them they must not do. That qualifies\nas a substantial burden on religious exercise, properly under-\nstood.\n   The plaintiffs have established a prima facie case under\nRFRA. The government must justify the mandate under the\ncompelling-interest test.\n\n\n     3. Compelling-Interest Test\n    RFRA requires the government to shoulder the burden of\ndemonstrating that applying the contraception mandate “is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmen-\ntal interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). The Supreme Court has\ninstructed us to look beyond “broadly formulated interests\njustifying the general applicability of government mandates”\nand “scrutinize[] the asserted harm of granting specific\nexemptions to particular religious claimants.” O Centro Espirita,\n546 U.S. at 431. In other words, under RFRA’s version of strict\nscrutiny, the government must establish a compelling and\nspecific justification for burdening these claimants.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           61\n\n    The compelling-interest test generally requires a “high\ndegree of necessity.” Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n, 131 S. Ct.\n2729, 2741 (2011). The government must “identify an ‘actual\nproblem’ in need of solving, and the curtailment of [the right]\nmust be actually necessary to the solution.” Id. at 2738 (cita-\ntions omitted). In the free-exercise context, “only those inter-\nests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can\noverbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.”\nYoder, 406 U.S. at 215. “[I]n this highly sensitive constitutional\narea, only the gravest abuses, endangering paramount inter-\nests, give occasion for permissible limitation … .” Sherbert,\n374 U.S. at 406 (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted). The regulated conduct must “pose[] some substantial\nthreat to public safety, peace[,] or order.” Id. at 403. Finally, “a\nlaw cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest\norder … when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly\nvital interest unprohibited.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 547 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n    The government identifies two public interests—“public\nhealth” and “gender equality”—and argues that the contracep-\ntion mandate furthers these interests by reducing unintended\npregnancies, achieving greater parity in health-care costs, and\npromoting the autonomy of women both economically and in\ntheir reproductive capacities. This argument seriously misun-\nderstands strict scrutiny. By stating the public interests so\ngenerally, the government guarantees that the mandate will\nflunk the test. Strict scrutiny requires a substantial congru-\nity—a close “fit”—between the governmental interest and the\nmeans chosen to further that interest. Stating the governmental\ninterests at such a high level of generality makes it impossible\n\f62                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nto show that the mandate is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering them. There are many ways to promote public\nhealth and gender equality, almost all of them less burdensome\non religious liberty.\n    We will translate a bit. The apparent aim of the mandate is\nto broaden access to free contraception and sterilization so that\nwomen might achieve greater control over their reproductive\nhealth. We accept this as a legitimate governmental interest.\nWhether it qualifies as an interest of surpassing importance is\nboth contestable and contested.\n    In Lee the Supreme Court held that the sound financial\nadministration of the Social Security system was a sufficiently\ncompelling interest to override a religious objection to with-\nholding Social Security taxes. 455 U.S. at 260. The government\nhas not explained why free contraception deserves to be\nranked as a governmental interest akin to the Social Security\nsystem in order of importance to the public good. Let’s assume\nfor the sake of argument that it is. Even with that generous\nassist, the government has not come close to carrying its\nburden of demonstrating that it cannot achieve its policy goals\nin ways less damaging to religious-exercise rights.\n    Indeed, the government has not even tried to satisfy the\nleast-restrictive-means component of strict scrutiny, perhaps\nbecause it is nearly impossible to do so here. The regulatory\nscheme grandfathers, exempts, or “accommodates” several\ncategories of employers from the contraception mandate and\ndoes not apply to others (those with fewer than 50 employees).\nSince the government grants so many exceptions already, it can\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                  63\n\nhardly argue against exempting these plaintiffs.20 Moreover,\nthere are many ways to increase access to free contraception\nwithout doing damage to the religious-liberty rights of\nconscientious objectors. The plaintiffs have identified a few:\nThe government can provide a “public option” for contracep-\ntion insurance; it can give tax incentives to contraception\nsuppliers to provide these medications and services at no cost\nto consumers; it can give tax incentives to consumers of\ncontraception and sterilization services. No doubt there are\nother options.\n   The government has no real response to this argument. It\nhas not made any effort to explain how the contraception\nmandate is the least restrictive means of furthering its stated\ngoals of promoting public health and gender equality. We\nnoted this shortcoming in our orders granting injunctions\npending appeal. See Grote, 708 F.3d at 855; Korte, 2012 WL\n6757353, at *4. In light of this observation, we might have\nexpected a better effort in the government’s merits briefing. We\ndid not get it. The best the government could do was to insist\nthat the least-restrictive-means test “has never been interpreted\nto require the government to subsidize private religious\npractices.”\n    That’s just an evasion of RFRA. Lifting a regulatory burden\nis not necessarily a subsidy, and it’s not a subsidy here. The\nplaintiffs are not asking the government to pay for anything.\n\n\n20\n  In contrast, in Lee the Social Security exemption for self-employed reli-\ngious persons was extremely narrow. See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252,\n255–56 (1982).\n\f64                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nThey are asking for relief from a regulatory mandate that\ncoerces them to pay for something—insurance coverage for\ncontraception—on the sincere conviction that doing so violates\ntheir religion. They have made a strong case that RFRA entitles\nthem to that relief.\n    Our conclusion aligns us with the Tenth Circuit majority\nand Judge Jordan in dissent in the Third Circuit, Hobby Lobby,\n723 F.3d at 1137–44; Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724 F.3d at\n407–15 (Jordan, J., dissenting), and in some respects with the\nmajority opinion in the D.C. Circuit, Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246,\nat *7–15. The Third Circuit analyzed the identical issues very\ndifferently, concluding that “a for-profit, secular corporation\ncannot engage in the exercise of religion,” and its owners “do\nnot have viable claims” against the contraception mandate\nbecause the mandate “does not actually require [them] to do\nanything.” Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724 F.3d at 388–89. The\nSixth Circuit reached a similar conclusion. Autocam, 730 F.3d at\n624 (“The decision to comply with the mandate falls on\nAutocam, not the Kennedys.”); id. at 627 (“Congress did not\nintend the term ‘person’ to cover entities like Autocam when\nit enacted RFRA.”). For reasons that should be obvious by\nnow, we respectfully disagree.\n\n\n                       III. Conclusion\n    For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE and REMAND with\ninstructions to enter preliminary injunctions barring enforce-\nment of the contraception mandate against the plaintiffs.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          65\n\n    ROVNER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. The court’s holding in\nthese cases is as remarkable for its reasoning as for its result.\nThe Kortes and the Grotes are business owners: Korte &\nLuitjohan Contractors is a construction firm, and Grote\nIndustries manufactures motor vehicle turn signals, reflectors,\nemergency lighting, and other safety systems. Neither com-\npany has a declared religious purpose or mission. Both are\nsubject to the full range of regulatory demands and constraints\nthat government imposes on all such businesses. These include\nthe Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) requirement that employers\nprovide comprehensive health insurance to their employees\nthat includes fully subsidized access to contraceptive care for\nwomen who choose to use it. The Kortes and the Grotes are\nCatholic and, consistent with the teachings of their religion,\nview the use of contraceptives as immoral. Invoking the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-\n1 (“RFRA”), they object to the contraception mandate of the\nACA as a substantial burden on their right to the free exercise\nof religion.\n    In exempting (preliminarily) the two corporations from the\ncontraception mandate, the court equates the business activi-\nties of these secular, for-profit firms with the religious exercise\nof its owners. Because the Kortes and the Grotes declare that\nthey run the corporations in a manner consistent with their\nreligious beliefs, the court views the burdens that government\nimposes on the corporations and the company health plans as\nburdens on the religious consciences and exercise of the\nindividual owners. Not only that: the court attributes to the\ncorporations religious exercise rights of their own, rights that\nthe companies themselves can assert, as informed by the\n\f66                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nreligious beliefs of their owners. Because the Kortes and the\nGrotes oppose the use of contraception, the companies’\nobligation to include contraceptive coverage in their workplace\nhealth insurance plans is understood as a burden on the\nowners’ free exercise rights and in turn on the companies’ free\nexercise rights. The court declares off-limits any inquiry into\nthe nature and degree of the burden imposed on these rights;\ninstead, rewriting both the terms of RFRA and free exercise\nclause jurisprudence, the court declares it sufficient that the\nACA compels the two corporations to comply with a require-\nment to which its owners object on religious grounds. Thus\nreasoning that the contraceptive mandate substantially\nburdens the free exercise rights of the individuals and their\ncompanies, the court then subjects the mandate to strict\nscrutiny and concludes that it fails that demanding standard.\n    So it is that, in the name of free exercise of religion, the\ncourt has relieved two secular corporations from a statutory\nobligation to provide health insurance to their employees that\nincludes coverage of contraceptive care for the companies’\nfemale employees. Realistically, the only religious interests at\nstake are those of the corporations’ owners—their faith is the\nsource of the objection to contraception. Yet the Affordable\nCare Act in no way imposes on their beliefs, their worship\nactivities, or the conduct of their personal lives. They need not\nuse, endorse, or dispense contraception; they remain free to\nspeak out against the use of contraception whenever and\nwherever they wish. In short, their own exercise of religion is\nwholly undisturbed. It is the corporations, as employers, which\nshoulder the obligations imposed by the ACA; and they need\nnot say or do anything with respect to contraception beyond\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         67\n\nincluding it among the countless other medical goods and\nservices covered by their employee health plans. The plaintiffs\nnonetheless object to this as facilitating the use of contracep-\ntion. I would characterize it as facilitating an employee’s choice\nto use contraception. An employee’s choice may be inconsis-\ntent with the owners’ religious beliefs, but it is not the owners’\nchoice, and it does not substantially burden the exercise of\ntheir religious freedoms.\n    My esteemed colleagues have made the best case possible\nfor the notion that the contraception mandate interferes with\nthe plaintiffs’ free exercise rights; but I believe the court’s\nholding and rationale represent an unprecedented and\nunwarranted re-conception of both what the free exercise of\nreligion entails and what constitutes a substantial burden on\nthat exercise. The court extends a highly personal right to a\nsecular corporation, a man-made legal fiction that has no\nconscience enabling belief or worship. It then deems a corpora-\ntion’s duty to cover contraceptive care as an impermissible\nburden on the religious rights of both the corporation and its\nowners. It does so without considering the directness and\ndegree of the burden on the plaintiffs’ right to the free exercise\nof their religion, in contravention of the plain terms of RFRA,\nwhich proscribes only substantial burdens on that right. And\nit permits the plaintiffs to invoke their free exercise rights\noffensively rather than defensively, in a way that circumscribes\nthe rights Congress has given to employees, by permitting the\ncorporate employers to rewrite the terms of the statutorily-\nmandated health plans they provide to their employees. As a\nresult, employees are left without a highly important form of\ninsurance coverage that Congress intended them to have.\n\f68                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n                               1.\n    In order to place today’s decision and its import in a\nbroader perspective, I want to begin my analysis by posing\nseveral hypotheticals illustrating how the court’s ruling in this\ncase might play out in other factual scenarios. Part of our\nresponsibility as an appellate court is to consider the ramifica-\ntions our precedents will have for other cases and litigants.\nContraception is the current focus of nationwide litigation\nchallenging the ACA’s employer mandate; and because the\nduty to include coverage for contraceptives in employee health\nplans implicates women, sexuality, and reproduction as well\nas religion, one might be tempted to assume that the issues\nraised in this case and the court’s holding are confined, if not\nto the facts in this case, then to a narrow range of circum-\nstances. But, as the court points out, RFRA applies to “all\nFederal law, and the implementation of that law, whether\nstatutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after”\nRFRA’s effective date. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(a); ante at 33. The\ncourt’s holding today has the potential to reach far beyond\ncontraception and to invite employers to seek exemptions from\nany number of federally-mandated employee benefits to which\nan employer might object on religious grounds. The following\nthree hypotheticals are intended to show why I think this\nmight be so. The names and facts in these hypotheticals are of\nmy own invention; the legal provisions are not.\n    1. Tom Smith is the sole owner and chief executive officer\nof TS-Co, a software company that employs more than 50\npeople and is therefore subject to the ACA. TS-Co sponsors a\nself-insured health care plan for its employees. Joe Wilson is an\nemployee of TS-Co who suffers from Amyotrophic Lateral\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        69\n\nSclerosis, or ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease.\nALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects\nnerve cells in the brain and spinal cord; the disease destroys\nmotor neurons and with them the ability of the brain to initiate\nand control muscle function. Eventually, the disease leads to\ntotal paralysis. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure\nor pneumonia, typically within three to five years of the onset\nof symptoms.\n    From another TS-Co employee, Smith learns that Wilson\nhas been accepted into a clinical trial testing the effectiveness\nof an embryonic stem-cell therapy on ALS. Smith is a devout\nMethodist who shares the United Methodist Church’s disap-\nproval of research and therapies based on stem cells derived\nfrom human embryos. Smith does not wish to manage his\ncompany’s benefit plan in a way that conflicts with his reli-\ngious beliefs; although he is concerned for Wilson’s health, he\nis adamantly opposed to facilitating the use of embryonic stem\ncells in any way. He thinks it unlikely that the company health\nplan will pay for the care Wilson will receive during his\nparticipation in the clinical trial, but when he raises the issue\nwith the plan administrator, he learns that under section 1201\nof the ACA (which in turn created a new section 2709 of the\nPublic Health Service Act (“PHA”)), the health plan must cover\nthe costs of routine patient care associated with clinical trials\ninvolving treatments for cancer and other life-threatening\nconditions. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-8. In this way, the ACA was\nmeant to expand patient access to and participation in such\n\f70                                                Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nclinical trials.1 Although the plan would cover only the costs of\nWilson’s routine care associated with the stem cell therapy,\nand not the costs of the stem cell therapy itself, Smith believes\nthat by covering Wilson’s routine care, the company plan\nwould be facilitating his participation in a practice to which he\nobjects on religious grounds.\n    Smith brings suit under RFRA a seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relief relieving the company of the obligation to\ncomply with section 2709 of the PHA, insofar as it requires the\ncoverage of costs associated with clinical trials employing\nembryonic stem cell therapies. Smith argues that requiring his\ncompany’s health plan to cover the costs of any medical care\nassociated with a treatment to which he objects on religious\ngrounds interferes with his wish to run the company in a\nmanner consistent with his religious convictions. Based on the\ncourt’s decision today, Smith and TS-Co would have a color-\nable argument that the coverage required by section 2709\nimposes a substantial burden on their free exercise rights.\nAlthough the government might have an argument that section\n2709 is supported by a compelling interest in the development\nof effective therapies for life-threatening conditions such as\nALS, based on this court’s least-restrictive means analysis, a\ncourt might conclude that the government itself, in lieu of\nobjecting employers, could pay for all costs associated with an\n\n1\n   See American Cancer Society, Cancer Action Network, Fact Sheet:\nAffordable Care Act: Clinical Trials (“Nearly 20% of cancer patients are eligible\nfor participation in cancer clinical trials, but enrollment among adults\nconsistently ranges between 3-5%.”), available at http://http://\nacscan.org/pdf/healthcare/implementation/factsheets/hcr-clinical-trials.pdf\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         71\n\nindividual’s participation in a clinical trial. In the meantime,\ngranting TS-Co an exemption from the PHA would mean that\nWilson’s workplace insurance would not cover any costs\nassociated with his participation in the clinical trial; and that,\nas a practical matter, might render Wilson unable to participate\nin the trial.\n    2. Bill Blasdell is the sole owner and chief executive officer\nof Get Out!, a corporation which operates a small chain of three\noutdoor-gear stores. Prior to enactment of the ACA, the\ncompany did not provide health insurance to its employees;\nbut with 75 employees, Get Out! is now subject to the ACA’s\nemployer mandate. Blasdell has been a life-long member of the\nChurch of Christ, Scientist. Christian Science dogma postulates\nthat illness is an illusion or false belief that can only be ad-\ndressed through prayer which realigns one’s soul with God.\nConsistent with that view, Christian Science historically has\ndisapproved of most forms of conventional medicine. None-\ntheless, in practice, many Christian Scientists have availed\nthemselves of conventional medical treatments, and in recent\nyears, the church itself has become more tolerant of conven-\ntional medicine. See, e.g., Paul Vitello, Christian Science Church\nSeeks Truce With Modern Medicine, New York Times A20 (Mar.\n24, 2010).\n    Earlier in his life, Blasdell was among those Christian\nScientists who embraced traditional medicine. But after\nwitnessing his wife suffer through a brutal treatment regimen\nfor breast cancer at a premier medical center, only to die as a\nresult of complications from the treatment and missteps by the\nmedical staff, Blasdell came to believe, consistent with the\nteachings of his church, that conventional medicine does far\n\f72                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nmore harm than good. His belief was reinforced in the year\nfollowing his wife’s death, when his ulcerative colitis went into\nremission during prayer-centered treatment at a Christian\nScience nursing center.\n   As a result of his religious convictions, Blasdell is ada-\nmantly opposed to facilitating the use of conventional medical\ncare by his employees. He is willing for Get Out! to sponsor an\nemployee health plan that pays for care at Christian Science\nnursing centers, but he believes that his company’s compliance\nwith the ACA’s mandate to cover traditional medical care\nwould be a violation of his religious principles.\n    After Get Out!’s request for an exemption from the em-\nployer mandate is denied, Blasdell and the company bring suit\nunder RFRA contending that the employer mandate is a\nsubstantial burden on the free exercise of their religious beliefs.\nPursuant to the court’s decision today, both Blasdell and Get\nOut! would have a colorable argument that compliance with\nthe employer mandate, by facilitating company employees’ use\nof conventional medical treatments to which Blasdell is\nopposed on religious grounds, represents a substantial burden\non his religious freedom and that of the corporation. And\nalthough the government, again, would no doubt urge that it\nhas a compelling interest in pursuing universal access to\nhealthcare, Blasdell and his firm could invoke this court’s\ndecision for the argument that the ACA’s exemptions belie that\ninterest, and that, in any event, the government could pursue\nits goal through publicly-funded healthcare, individual tax\ncredits, or other means that do not require employers to\nsubsidize employee healthcare that is inconsistent with their\nown religious beliefs.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         73\n\n   3. Red Pie, Inc., sells and ships to consumers nationwide a\nvariety of frozen, specialty pizzas. Bill and Betty Ann Bowers\nand their three children own and operate the firm, which has\nover 100 full-time employees. The Bowers belong to a church\nwhich is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. The\nConvention’s position on marriage and sexuality may be\nsummarized as follows:\n     We affirm God’s plan for marriage and sexual\n     intimacy—one man, and one woman, for life. Ho-\n     mosexuality is not a “valid alternative lifestyle.” The\n     Bible condemns it as sin. It is not, however, unfor-\n     givable sin. The same redemption available to all\n     sinners is available to homosexuals. They, too, may\n     become new creations in Christ.\nSouthern Baptist Convention, Position Statement on Sexuality,\navailable at http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pssexuality.asp (last\nvisited Nov. 7, 2013). The Bowers’ local congregation endorses\nand promotes the same view; in the past several years, the\npastor of their church has given several sermons condemning\nsame-sex marriage, adoption by gay and lesbian parents, and\nthe repeal of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. The\nBowers accept and follow their church’s teaching on homosex-\nuality. When same-sex marriage was recently legalized in their\nstate as a result of a court decision, the Bowers, knowing that\nthey had a number of gay and lesbian individuals in their\nemploy and in keeping with their religious beliefs, amended\nthe Red Pie employee benefits plan to make clear that spousal\ninsurance benefits are not available to the same-sex spouses of\nRed Pie employees; as their state does not prohibit employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and\n\f74                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nbecause the ACA does not require employers to provide\ninsurance coverage to employee spouses, this change was\nlegally permitted.\n    Mr. and Mrs. Bowers become alarmed when they learn that\none of their employees, Stan Jones, has submitted a request to\ntake three weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and\nMedical Leave Act (FMLA) so that he and his husband may\nattend the expected birth of their child via surrogacy in\nCalifornia, bring the baby home, and bond with the child. See\n29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). The Bowers view the idea of two gay\nmen conceiving a child by surrogacy and bringing that child\ninto their home as an abomination to the Lord. They instruct\ntheir office manager to deny Jones’ leave request and inform\nhim that neither they nor their company can in any way\nrecognize or facilitate such an immoral arrangement; Jones in\nturn protests the denial, citing his FMLA rights. After thinking\nabout the matter further, they decide the Bowers are so\ntroubled that they can no longer keep Jones in their employ.\nThe next day, they fire him.\n    After Jones contacts the Wages and Hours Division of the\nDepartment of Labor, the Department files suit against Red Pie\nunder the FMLA contending that Jones was both wrongfully\ndenied his right to parental leave under the statute and fired in\nretaliation for having requested FMLA leave. See 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 2615(a)(1), 2617(b)(2). Red Pie invokes RFRA as a defense to\nthe Department’s suit, contending that the FMLA as applied to\nRed Pie in this instance would constitute a substantial burden\non the free exercise rights of the corporation and its owners, as\nit would force them either to recognize and facilitate a parental\narrangement they view as sinful or suffer substantial penalties\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                      75\n\nunder the FMLA for refusing to do so.2 The leave mandated by\nthe FMLA is, of course, unpaid, and to that extent it would\narguably constitute no more than a minimal burden on Red\nPie’s asserted free exercise rights;3 but Red Pie could readily\ninvoke this court’s decision for the proposition that the\nsubstantiality of the burden turns not on the degree of interfer-\nence imposed on the company’s religious exercise but rather\n\n\n2\n   Whether RFRA may be invoked as a defense in a suit between private\nindividuals is a developing issue which has produced a split among the\ncircuits. Compare Hankins v. Lyght, 441 F.3d 96, 103–04 (2d Cir. 2006) (2–1\ndecision) (holding that RFRA may be invoked in such a suit), with id. at\n114–15 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); Gen. Conference Corp. of Seventh-Day\nAdventists v. McGill, 617 F.3d 402, 410–12 (6th Cir. 2010); Tomic v. Catholic\nDiocese of Peoria, 442 F.3d 1036, 1042 (7th Cir. 2006), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. E.E.O.C., 132\nS. Ct. 694, 709 n.4 (2012); and Sutton v. Providence St. Joseph Med. Ctr., 192\nF.3d 826, 834, 837–43 (9th Cir. 1999) (all holding that RFRA may not be\ninvoked in such a suit). There is no doubt, however, that RFRA may be\ninvoked as a defense in litigation with the government. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(c) (“A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in\nviolation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a\njudicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.”);\nTomic, 442 F.3d at 1042.\n\n3\n  This is not to say that an employer incurs no costs as a result of the leave.\nAlthough FMLA leave is unpaid, an employer is required to continue\nproviding health coverage to the absent employee on the same terms and\nconditions that would apply if he were still working, 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(2),\nand of course, the employer must bear the cost of having someone else fill\nin for the employee on leave even as he holds a position open for the\nemployee in anticipation of his return from leave, § 2614(a)(1). In both\nrespects, the employer lends considerable assistance to the employee taking\nleave.\n\f76                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsolely on the coercive nature of the FMLA—compliance with\nwhich is mandatory on pain of litigation and significant\npenalties for the failure to do so. Ante at 56–57; see 26 U.S.C.\n§§ 4980D(a) & (b)(1), 4980H(a) & (c).\n    The Department of Labor potentially might fair better at the\nnext, strict-scrutiny phase of the analysis. Certainly, in terms of\nthe least restrictive means of supporting and promoting\nfamilies, the Department would have a strong argument that\nthere is no substitute for granting leave time to parents at\ncritical times when their presence is most needed by their\nchildren. But that point aside, would a court deem the interests\nunderlying the FMLA sufficiently compelling to constitute\n“interests of the highest order,” Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S.\n205, 215 , 92 S. Ct. 1526, 1533 (1972), or “paramount interest[s]”\njeopardized by “the gravest abuses,” Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S.\n398, 406, 83 S. Ct. 1790, 1795 (1963), such that Jones’ rights\nunder the FMLA would trump the asserted religious interests\nof the corporation? And, in considering whether the govern-\nment has “establish[ed] a compelling and specific justification\nfor burdening these claimants,” ante at 60 (emphasis in origi-\nnal), would a court assess the strength of the government’s\ninterest in promoting familial relationships generally, or its\ninterest in promoting the bonds between same-sex parents and\ntheir children, as that is the interest which Red Pie contends is\nirreconcilable with its religious interests? And if the latter,\nwould that more specific interest qualify as a compelling\ninterest? The outcome of that analysis is far from clear to me\nunder today’s precedent.\n   These hypotheticals illustrate the uncertainty that the\ncourt’s expansive interpretation and application of RFRA\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           77\n\nbrings to a number of statutory schemes in which Congress has\naccorded specific rights to employees (not to mention other\nparties), the recognition and accommodation of which a\ncorporation, in addition to its owners, can now say burden\ntheir religious interests. By casting the mandatory provision of\nbenefits to an employee as a substantial burden on the free\nexercise rights of a closely-held corporation and its owners,\nwithout considering whether compliance with the mandate\ndirectly interferes with the free exercise of religion or is at most\na modest burden on a plaintiff’s free exercise rights, the court’s\nrationale subjects a potentially wide range of statutory pro-\ntections to strict scrutiny, one of the most demanding stan-\ndards known in our legal system. In some ways, this is\nreminiscent of the Lochner era, when an employer could claim\nthat the extension of statutory protections to its workers\nconstituted an undue infringement on the freedom of contract\nand the right to operate a private, lawful business as the owner\nwished. And by exempting employers from extending to\nemployees the rights specified by statute, the government is\nforced to pick up the slack and take compensatory action to\nprotect the rights of those employees; short of that, the em-\nployee of the religiously-motivated employer is left with no\nright at all. I doubt that this is what Congress intended when\nit enacted RFRA.\n                                 2.\n    I begin my discussion of the specific legal points presented\nby this appeal with where my colleagues and I agree. First, I\nagree that the Anti-Injunction Act poses no bar to this action.\nThis is not a suit aimed at restraining the collection of a tax—in\nthis case, the penalties for non-compliance with the ACA.\n\f78                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nRather, it is a direct challenge to a substantive provision of the\nACA: the contraception mandate.\n    I am also in accord with my colleagues on standing. The\ngovernment has not contested the standing of any of the\nplaintiffs in these cases, and I agree with my colleagues that\nboth the corporations and their owners indeed do have\nstanding. Because the burden of the contraception mandate\nfalls directly on the two corporations as employers, and\nbecause the corporations contend that they have their own\nright to free exercise of religion which is burdened by the\nmandate, they have standing to challenge the mandate. See\ngenerally Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l U.S.A., 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147\n(2013). And the Kortes and the Grotes, who as the owners of\nthese closely-held corporations assert that they express their\nreligious beliefs in the way in which they run these corpora-\ntions, have standing to assert that their own free exercise rights\nare burdened by the contraception mandate notwithstanding\nthe general rule against shareholder standing. See Franchise Tax\nBd. v. Alcan Aluminium Ltd., 493 U.S. 331, 336, 110 S. Ct. 661,\n665 (1990) (exception to shareholder standing rule “allow[s] a\nshareholder with a direct, personal interest in a cause of action\nto bring suit even if the corporation’s rights are also impli-\ncated”); see also Gilardi v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs.,\n2013 WL 5854246, at *6–*7 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 1, 2013) (op of\nBrown, J.); id. at *19–*22 (Edwards, J., concurring in part &\ndissenting in part).\n    This is not to say that I believe that the respective interests\nof the corporations and their owners are congruent. The fact\nthat the obligations imposed by the mandate fall upon the\ncorporation, whereas it is the individual owners—and only the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           79\n\nindividuals, in my view—who hold free exercise rights,\nmatters a great deal to whether those rights are substantially\nburdened. But that is a point that goes to the merits of this\nlawsuit rather than the standing of either set of plaintiffs, as the\ncourt points out. Ante at 22 n.9; see also Gilardi, 2013 WL\n5854246, at *19 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissenting in\npart). And that is why, as I proceed to explain, the plain-\ntiffs—both corporate and individual—are unlikely to prevail\non the merits of their RFRA claim.\n                                 3.\n    I turn first to the free exercise rights of the corporations.\nOne premise underlying the RFRA claims advanced in these\ncases is that the interests, rights, and obligations of a closely-\nheld corporation are identical to those of their owners. In fact,\nas I have argued previously, they are distinct. In electing to do\nbusiness through the corporate form, the Kortes and the Grotes\nhave separated themselves from their companies: the corpora-\ntions are independent legal entities with legal rights and\nobligations independent of their individual owners. Grote v.\nSebelius, 708 F.3d 850, 857 (7th Cir. 2013) (dissent). That is the\npoint of incorporation: to create a separate legal person to\nshoulder some of the burdens of the business. See Cedric\nKushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 163, 121 S. Ct.\n2087, 2091 (2001) (“[I]ncorporation’s basic purpose is to create\na distinct legal entity, with legal rights, obligations, powers,\nand privileges different from those of the natural individuals\nwho created it, who own it, or whom it employs.”); see also\nAutocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 730 F.3d 618, 623–24 (6th Cir. 2013),\npet’n for cert. filed (U.S. Oct. 15, 2013) (No. 13-482); Conestoga\nWood Specialties Corp. v. Sec’y U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\f80                                         Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nServs., 724 F.3d 377, 387–88 (3d Cir. 2013), pet’n for cert. filed, 82\nU.S.L.W. 3139 (U.S. Sep. 19, 1993) (No. 13-356). What that\nmeans here is that it is the two corporations which, as employ-\ners covered by the ACA, must provide health insurance to\ntheir employees that covers contraceptives. That, in turn, puts\nmeaningful distance between the Kortes and the Grotes and\nthe company health plans and undercuts the notion that the\nACA forces the Kortes and the Grotes to facilitate a prac-\ntice—the use of contraception—to which they object on\nreligious grounds.\n    The distinction between a corporation and its owners\nexplains why the plaintiffs have argued, and today the court\nholds, that a secular, for-profit corporation possesses its own\nright to the free exercise of religion. That novel idea is a way to\nget past the problem that the people whose faith leads them to\nobject to the contraception mandate are not legally responsible\nfor complying with the mandate: endow the corporate\n“persons” with their own right to exercise religion which they\nmay invoke in conscientious objection to the mandate. It is an\nunprecedented holding, and one I believe is without legal or\nlogical support.\n    I concede, as I must, that the Supreme Court has not\nrestricted the invocation of free exercise rights solely to\nindividuals, but has allowed—albeit with very little discus-\nsion—houses of worship, including those which have incorpo-\nrated, to assert such rights. See ante at 38, citing Gonzales v. O\nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 126 S.\nCt. 1211 (2006), and Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City\nof Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993); see also Gilardi,\n2013 WL 5854246, at *4 (op. of Brown, J.) (coll. cases); cf. Harris\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                     81\n\nv. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 321, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 2690 (1980) (noting\nthat a free exercise claim is “one that ordinarily requires\nindividual participation”).4 Permitting a religious organization,\nincorporated or not, to invoke the Free Exercise Clause makes\nsense as a matter of pragmatism if not legal theory. A religious\nassociation is often as well if not better situated as the individ-\nuals who make up the association to assert the relevant\nreligious interests: the association can speak on behalf of all of\nits members; it likely has resources to pursue legal relief that\nindividual members do not; it can speak authoritatively on\nmatters of religious dogma; it may be the association that owns\nproperty and other assets affected by the challenged govern-\nment action; and in many instances, the law or other govern-\nment action being challenged intrudes directly on the collective\nworship activities of the association itself. E.g., Church of the\nLukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 534–35, 113 S. Ct. at 2227–28\n(challenged ordinances restricted practices which were central\nto worship service); see also Primera Iglesia Bautista Hispana of\nBoca Raton, Inc. v. Broward Cnty., 450 F.3d 1295, 1304 (11th Cir.\n2006) (incorporated church had standing to assert, inter alia,\n\n\n4\n   Of the cases cited by this court and by the District of Columbia Circuit in\nGilardi, only Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec’y of Labor, 471 U.S. 290, 105\nS. Ct. 1953 (1985), actually says anything about standing. In a footnote, the\nCourt in Alamo Found. said simply, “The Foundation also has standing to\nraise the free exercise claims of the associates, who are members of the\nreligious organization as well as employees under the Act.” Id. at 303 n.26,\n105 S. Ct. 1962 n. 26. The Court was thus plainly relying on the doctrine of\nassociational standing rather than on any notion that the Foundation\npossessed independent free exercise rights.

Brown\nGroup, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 551–53, 116 S. Ct. 1529, 1534 (1996);\nHunt v. Washington State Apple Adver.

Ct. 2197, 2211 (1975), I question whether it has\nfree exercise rights of its own. Would a defunct church that no\nlonger has any members but still owns property and other\nassets be able to claim free exercise rights in its own right, for\nexample? The Supreme Court, while allowing incorporated\nreligious bodies to assert free exercise rights, has yet to fully\nexplain why, let alone delineate what types of corporations, if\nany, can independently assert free exercise rights. There are\nreasons to doubt that a corporation, whatever its nature, has\nsuch rights.\n    Not all rights that the Constitution accords to a person are\nextended to corporations. The Supreme Court has recognized\nthat “[c]orporate identity has been determinative in several\ndecisions denying corporations certain constitutional rights,\nsuch as the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.”\nFirst Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 778 n.14, 98 S.\nCt. 1407, 1416–17 n.14 (1978). Bellotti went on to explain:\n     [C]ertain “purely personal” guarantees … are\n     unavailable to corporations and other organizations\n     because the “historic function” of the particular\n     guarantee has been limited to the protection of\n     individuals. United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694,\n     698–701, 64 S. Ct. 1248, 1251–52 (1944). Whether or\n     not a particular guarantee is “purely personal” or is\n     unavailable to corporations for some other reason\n     depends on the nature, history, and purpose of the\n     particular constitutional provision.\n\f84                                         Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nIbid; see also Browning-Ferris. Indus. of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,\nInc., 492 U.S. 257, 284–85, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 2925–26 (1989).\n    I have been struck in reviewing the handful of decisions\ngranting corporations free exercise rights (and for that matter,\nthe plaintiffs’ briefs in this case) by how wanting they are in\narticulating a substantive, affirmative explanation for why any\ntype of corporation, let alone a secular, for-profit corporation,\nshould be accorded religious rights. E.g., Hobby Lobby Stores,\nInc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1135 (10th Cir. 2013) (“[W]e\ncannot see why an individual operating for-profit retains Free\nExercise protections but an individual who incorporates—even\nas the sole shareholder—does not, even though he engages in\nthe exact same activities as before.”), pet’n for cert. filed, 82\nU.S.L.W. 3139 (U.S. Sep. 19, 2013) (No. 13-354). My colleagues\nsee no reason to think that Congress meant to preclude such\ncorporations from asserting rights under RFRA, ante at 53–54,\nbut I think this gets things backward. Given that the Supreme\nCourt has never recognized that secular corporations have free\nexercise rights, I think it is more accurate to say that there is no\nreason to think Congress meant to take the novel step of\nextending free exercise rights to such corporations when it\nenacted RFRA.\n    Perhaps the best argument in favor of according free\nexercise rights to corporations is that the right to free speech\nalready has been recognized as among those rights that\ncorporations enjoy. Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558\nU.S. 310, 342, 130 S. Ct. 876, 899–900 (2010) (coll. cases); Bellotti,\n435 U.S. at 780–81, 98 S. Ct. at 1417–18 (coll. cases). But beyond\nthe fact that the free exercise clause, like the free speech clause,\nresides in the First Amendment, I find little, if anything, in the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          85\n\nspeech cases that speaks to the nature of religion and why\ncorporations, as a matter of history and logic, should be able to\nassert free exercise rights. See Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724\nF.3d at 386 (noting distinct treatment of free speech and free\nexercise clauses in Supreme Court jurisprudence); Gilardi, 2013\nWL 5854246, at *5 (op. of Brown, J.); Autocam, 730 F.3d at\n627–28. Corporations, because they have property, financial,\nand political interests, of course have a free speech interest in\nprotecting and promoting those interests and in pursuing their\nagendas, be their stated goals charitable, religious, political, or\nprofit-making. See Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv.\nComm’n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 561–62, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 2349\n(1980) (commercial speech); Riley v. Nat’l Fed. of the Blind of\nN.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 787–89, 108 S. Ct. 2667, 2672–73 (1988)\n(charitable solicitation); Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y of N.Y.,\nInc. v. Vill. of Straton, 536 U.S. 150, 160–61, 122 S. Ct. 2080,\n2086–87 (2002) (religious speech); Citizens United, 558 U.S. at\n342–43, 130 S. Ct. at 900 (political speech). Beyond those\nparochial interests, Bellotti (which struck down a law prohibit-\ning a corporation from making expenditures to influence the\noutcome of any public referendum other than one which\ndirectly affected the property, business, or activities of the\ncorporation), stressed the core First Amendment interest in a\nrobust dialogue on issues of public concern, an interest which\nextends beyond a particular speaker’s wish to express his\nviews to include the public’s right to hear his views and those\nof others. 435 U.S. at 776–77, 98 S. Ct. at 1415–16. The Court\nadded that “[t]he inherent worth of the speech in terms of its\ncapacity for informing the public does not depend upon the\nidentity of its sources, whether corporation, association, union,\n\f86                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nor individual.” Id. at 777, 98 S. Ct. at 1416. Decisions recogniz-\ning the speech rights of corporations thus rest “not only on the\nrole of the First Amendment in fostering individual self-\nexpression but also on its role in affording the public access to\ndiscussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and\nideas.” Id. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419.\n    Religion, by contrast, is a personal undertaking. Conestoga\nWood Specialties, 724 F.3d at 385, 388. Certainly there is a\ncollective societal interest in protecting religious liberty, and\nreligion can and has influenced the public sphere in positive\nways. See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 674–78, 104 S. Ct.\n1355, 1360–61 (1984) (recognizing longstanding role of religion\nin American life). But religious faith is, by its nature, an\nintensely individual experience, and for the reasons that\nfollow, I believe it likely is one of those “purely personal”\nconstitutional rights that the Supreme Court will not extend to\ncorporations—certainly not to secular, for-profit corporations.\n   The fact that a corporation qualifies as a person under the\nDictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. § 1, see ante at 36; Hobby Lobby Stores,\n723 F.3d at 1129, 1132, is by no means dispositive. RFRA\nbestows its protection upon “[a] person whose religious exercise\nhas been burdened.” § 2000bb-1(c) (emphasis mine). Thus, “the\nfocus on personhood is too narrow; instead, we must construe\nthe term ‘person’ together with the phrase ‘exercise of reli-\ngion.’” Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at *2 (op. of Brown, J.); see also\nAutocam, 730 F.3d at 626. In other words, we must consider\nwhether it is possible for a corporation to exercise religion.\n  The First Amendment, of course, does not define “religion.”\nMore than a century ago, the Supreme Court said that “[t]he\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           87\n\nterm ‘religion’ has reference to one's views of his relations to\nhis Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence for\nhis being and character, and of obedience to his will.” Davis v.\nBeason, 133 U.S. 333, 342, 10 S. Ct. 299, 300 (1890), abrogated on\nother grounds by Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634, 116 S. Ct.\n1620, 1628 (1996); see also Cnty. of Allegheny v. A.C.L.U. Greater\nPittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 109 S. Ct. 3086 (1989) (Stevens,\nJ., concurring in part & dissenting in part) (noting that\n“religion” as used in establishment clause was “understood\nprimarily to mean ‘[v]irtue, as founded upon reverence of God,\nand expectation of future rewards and punishments,’ and only\nsecondarily ‘[a] system of divine faith and worship as opposite\nto others.’” (quoting S. Johnson, A DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH\nLANGUAGE (7th ed. 1785)). In Fleischfresser v. Dirs. of Sch. Dist.\n200, 15 F.3d 680, 688 n.5 (7th Cir. 1994), we set forth a “general\nworking definition of religion” for purposes of the free exercise\nclause that includes “any set of beliefs addressing matters of\nultimate concern occupying a place parallel to that filled by\nGod in traditionally religious persons.” (quoting Welsh v.\nUnited States, 398 U.S. 333, 340, 90 S. Ct. 1792, 1796 (1970))\n(internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). I note that the\nSecond Circuit, in attempting to define the same term, invoked\nthe renowned philosopher, psychologist, and professor\nWilliam James, who described religion as “the feelings, acts,\nand experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as\nthey apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever\nthey may consider the divine.” United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d\n1210, 1227 (2d Cir. 1983) (quoting Wm. James, THE VARIETIES OF\nRELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE: A STUDY IN HUMAN NATURE 31 (1910));\nsee also Patrick v. LeFevour, 745 F.2d 153, 158 (2d Cir. 1984). Each\n\f88                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nof these definitions references an individual’s understanding\nof his relationship to a divine being, a necessarily personal and\nsubjective viewpoint. In that regard, they are consistent with\nthe views of both James Madison, a drafter of the First Amend-\nment, and Thomas Jefferson, who drafted its predecessor,\nVirginia’s Bill for Religious Freedom, in 1779 (the bill was\neventually adopted by the Virginia Assembly in 1786). Madi-\nson, in his 1785 Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious\nAssessments, wrote that he opposed Patrick Henry’s proposed\nVirginia bill to levy a tax for the support of religion on fifteen\ngrounds, the first of which being:\n     1. Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeni-\n     able truth, “that religion or the duty which we owe\n     to our Creator and the Manner of discharging it, can\n     be directed only by reason and conviction, not by\n     force or violence. The Religion then of every man\n     must be left to the conviction and conscience of\n     every man; and it is the right of every man to exer-\n     cise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature\n     an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the\n     opinions of men, depending only on the evidence\n     contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the\n     dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because\n     what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards\n     the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to\n     the Creator such homage, and such only, as he\n     believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is prece-\n     dent, both in order of time and in degree of obliga-\n     tion, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man\n     can be considered as a member of Civil Society, he\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           89\n\n     must be considered as a subject of the Governour of\n     the Universe: And if a member of Civil Society, who\n     enters into any subordinate Association, must\n     always do it with a reservation of his duty to the\n     general authority; much more must every man who\n     becomes a member of a particular Civil Society do it\n     with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal\n     Sovereign … .\nSee Everson v. Bd. of Educ. of Ewing Twp., 330 U.S. 1, 64, 67 S. Ct.\n504, 535 (1947) (App. to dissent of Rutledge, J.)

Bergh eds. 1905)), also available at http://press-\npubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_\nreligions58.html (last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n    Such remarks are consistent with the historical underpin-\nnings of the free exercise clause. Neither the congressional\nrecord underlying the enactment of the First Amendment nor\nthe records of the state legislatures which subsequently ratified\nthe amendment provide any help in ascertaining what legisla-\ntors meant by “religion” and the free exercise thereof. See\nMichael W. McConnell, The Origins & Historical Understanding\nof Free Exercise of Religion, 103 HARV. L. REV. 1409, 1481, 1483,\n1485 (1990); Vincent Phillip Muñoz, The Original Meaning of the\nFree Exercise Clause: The Evidence from the First Congress, 31\nHARV. J. L. & PUB. POL. 1083 (2008). But there are two reference\npoints that reinforce the notion that religion was understood to\nbe a matter of personal conscience.\n    First, by 1789, the constitutions of all thirteen states, save\nConnecticut, included religious liberty provisions, and many\nreferenced the right as the freedom to worship one’s God\naccording to the dictate’s of one’s conscience. See McConnell,\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at 1457 n.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         91\n\n242 (reproducing text of state provisions); City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 553–54, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 2180 (1997)\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting) (discussing examples of such\nprovisions). New Hampshire’s 1784 constitution, for example,\nprovided that “[e]very individual has a natural and unalien-\nable right to worship GOD according to the dictates of his own\nconscience, and reason”; and the constitutions of Delaware,\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and\nVirginia all contained very similar language. See McConnell,\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at 1456,\n1457 n. 242. Other constitutions—those of New York and South\nCarolina—separately described the protected freedom of\nreligion and then referred to the “liberty of conscience” thereby\nguaranteed. See id. “Conscience” was used in still other ways\nby the provisions of other state constitutions. See id.\n    These state provisions set the stage for the drafting, debate,\nand adoption of the First Amendment’s free exercise clause.\nThe clause as proposed and adopted by the House of Repre-\nsentatives incorporated language recognizing “freedom of\nconscience”; but the version adopted by the Senate, by the\nensuing conference committee, and which was submitted to\nand ratified by the States, omitted that language. See\nMcConnell, Origins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. R.\nat 1481–84. It is not clear why “conscience” was omitted from\nthe adopted version of the free exercise clause, but it is doubt-\nful that the elimination was meant to signify a different\nunderstanding of what the clause protected. As Professor\nMcConnell and others observe, “freedom of religion” and\n“freedom of conscience” were terms that were used inter-\nchangeably in discussions of religious liberty. E.g., McConnell,\n\f92                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at 1488,\n1493–94; Philip A. Hamburger, A Constitutional Right of\nReligious Exemption: An Historical Perspective, 60 GEO. WASH. L.\nREV. 915, 933–34 & n.80 (1992). McConnell suggests that “rights\nof conscience” was dropped either to eliminate a redundancy,\nto the extent it signified the same thing as the free exercise of\nreligion, or to emphasize that it was only the freedom of\nreligious conscience, as opposed to the freedom of non-\nreligious belief, that was meant to be protected. McConnell,\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at\n1488–96. Either way, it is clear that the clause was intended to\nprotect the exercise of religious conscience. Id. at 1495–96. And\nas shown by both the state provisions addressing the freedom\nof religion and the other contemporaneous writings I have\ncited, the exercise of religious conscience was understood to be\na matter between the individual and his God—not, perhaps, in\nthe more modern sense of believing whatever one wants, but\nrather as a reflection that the individual owed his or her\nobedience on moral matters directly to God. Id. at 1498–99;\nHamburger, A Constitutional Right of Religious Exemption, 60\nGEO. WASH. L. REV. at 933, 938. The understanding that the\nexercise of religion was a matter of the individual’s relation-\nship with and obedience to God was also consistent with the\nmultiplicity of minority religions practiced in the United States\nby the second half of the 18th century, and a consensus that the\ncountry should move away from a Colonial history of officially\nestablished religions (and officially disfavored religions)\ntoward religious pluralism. Id. at 946.\n    All of this reinforces what one would otherwise intuit about\nreligion: that it is inextricably intertwined with characteristics\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          93\n\nthat are uniquely human: conscience, belief, faith, and devo-\ntion. Religious beliefs have to do with such fundamental\nquestions as the nature of mankind, where we came from, our\nplace in the world, what happens when we die, and our\nrelationships with and obligations to other people. Only the\nhuman mind can entertain such questions.\n    A corporation is a legal construct which does not have the\nsentience and conscience to entertain such ultimate questions.\n“In the words of Chief Justice Marshall, a corporation is ‘an\nartificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in\ncontemplation of law.’” Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vt. v. Kelco\nDisposal, Inc., supra, 492 U.S. at 284, 109 S. Ct. at 2925 (quoting\nTrustees of Dartmouth Coll. v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518,\n636 (1819)). It is a creature of man, not of God. It “believes,” if\nit can be said to believe anything, only what the people who\nfound, own, and/or manage the corporation believe. See Ira C.\nLupu, Keeping the Faith: Religion, Equality & Speech in the U.S.\nConstitution, 18 Conn. L. Rev. 739, 766 (1986) (“By their nature,\ninstitutions cannot have a conscience or faith.”); Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 466, 130 S. Ct. at 972 (Stevens, J., concurring\nin part & dissenting in part) (“It might also be added that\ncorporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no\nthoughts, no desires.”); Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724 F.3d at\n385; Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at* 18 (Edwards, J., concurring\nin part & dissenting in part); cf. Fleck & Assocs., Inc. v. City of\nPhoenix, an Ariz. Muni. Corp., 471 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(holding corporation does not possess right recognized in\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472 (2003), to make\nautonomous choices in intimate relations free of government\ninterference: “Corporations are not self-defining autonomous\n\f94                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ncreatures worthy of respect and dignity in the relevant\nsense.”).\n    Indeed, it strikes me as potentially demeaning to religious\nfaith to say that a corporation should be said to possess the\nsame right to free exercise of religion that a human being\nenjoys in this country. Inextricably bound as it is with a\nperson’s sense of himself, his origins, the world, and what life\nis, religious belief (including the lack of such belief) is a\ndefining trait of humankind; and this is one reason why we\nview it as a core component of individual freedom: “At the\nheart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of\nexistence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of\nhuman life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the\nattributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion\nof the State.” Planned Parenthood of Se. Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505\nU.S. 833, 851, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2807 (1992); see also Conestoga\nWood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius, 917 F. Supp. 2d 394, 407–08\n(E.D. Pa. 2013); Korte v.

To say, as the court does today, that the\nright to exercise one’s religious faith may be asserted on the\nsame terms by a legal construct—an incorporated currency\nexchange, accounting firm, or automobile repair shop, for\nexample—as by a human being, is, to my mind at least,\nirreconcilable with the very essence of religious faith and, for\nthat matter, humankind.\n   Perhaps there are good reasons to extend the right of free\nexercise to religious organizations, including not-for-profit\ncorporations organized to pursue religious ends. See Conestoga\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                            95\n\nWood Specialties, 724 F.3d at 386 (noting that churches are the\n“means by which individuals practice religion”); see also Corp.\nof Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.\nAmos, 483 U.S. 327, 344–45, 107 S. Ct. 2862, 2872–73 (1987)\n(Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment) (recognizing that\npotential for government to chill religious exercise is greatest\nwith respect to not-for-profit activities). As I have said, it is not\nentirely clear to me why even this step is necessary given the\nassociational standing of such entities to assert the free exercise\nrights of their members. But, at the least, those entities are\ndefined by a religious purpose, and so extending to them the\nprotections of the free exercise clause could be seen as consis-\ntent with the purpose of that clause. But let us be clear: we are\nin this case being asked to extend the right beyond not-for-\nprofit religious corporations to corporations not organized for\nany purpose connected with religion. See Conestoga Wood\nSpecialties, 724 F.3d at 385 (“We will not draw the conclusion\nthat, just because courts have recognized the free exercise\nrights of churches and other religious entities, it necessarily\nfollows that for-profit, secular corporations can exercise\nreligion.’”); accord Autocam, 730 F.3d at 627; see also Gilardi, 2013\nWL 5854246, at *5 (opinion of Brown, J.) (“No such corpus juris\nexists to suggest a free-exercise right for secular corpora-\ntions.”); Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1168, 1169 (Briscoe, C.J.,\nconcurring in part & dissenting in part) (“during the 200-year\nspan between the adoption of the First Amendment and\nRFRA's passage, the Supreme Court consistently treated free\nexercise rights as confined to individuals and non-profit\nreligious organizations”; and “not a single case, until now, has\nextended RFRA’s protections to for-profit corporations”).\n\f96                                               Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    Certainly I agree that the wish to profit does not automati-\ncally disqualify an individual from asserting religious interests.\nSee ante at 47–51; Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495,\n501–02, 72 S. Ct. 777, 780 (1952); Beckwith Elec. Co. v. Sebelius,\n2013 WL 3297498, at *11 (M.D. Fla. June 25, 2013)\n(Kovachevich, J.). Individuals often have multiple reasons for\nacting, and simply because they have reasons in addition to a\nreligious motive does not disqualify them from asserting free\nexercise rights. But that does not answer the question whether\na corporation —again, an invention of the law—should be\naccorded religious rights, particularly when it is not organized\nfor religious ends.5\n\n\n5\n   The majority postulates that if a for-profit business cannot assert free\nexercise rights, then theoretically a Jewish restaurant could be denied the\nright to observe dietary restrictions. Ante at 51. Three responses come to\nmind. First, the owner and operator of the restaurant, assuming that he is\nan observant Jew, might well have a meritorious contention that his own\nreligious exercise is directly and substantially burdened by having to\nhandle and serve non-kosher food; as I have said, I do not believe that the\nprofit-motive disqualifies the owner from asserting his religious interests.\nSecond, to the extent the restaurant’s target clientele is Jewish, the business\nmight have third-party standing to assert the free exercise rights of its\ncustomers. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 194–97, 97 S. Ct. 451, 455–57\n(1976) (vendor of “non-intoxicating” 3.2% beer had third-party standing to\nassert the equal protection rights of 18-20 year-old male customers, who\nwere proscribed by state law from being sold beer whereas females of same\nage were not); see also, e.g., Carey v. Population Servs., Int’l, 431 U.S. 678,\n683–84, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 2015 (1977) (distributor of contraceptive devices); Doe\nv. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188, 93 S. Ct. 739, 745 (1973) (physicians providing\nabortion services). Third, to bring that hypothetical into line with facts of\nthis case, the relevant question would be whether the free exercise rights of\n                                                                  (continued...)\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                   97\n\n     On this point, I would also note the significance of the\nprocedural posture this case is in. The plaintiffs are seeking\npreliminary injunctive relief. “A preliminary injunction is an\nextraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.” Winter v.\nNatural Resources Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24, 129 S. Ct. 365, 376\n(2008) (citing Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689–90, 128 S. Ct.\n2207, 2219 (2008)); see also Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968,\n972, 117 S. Ct. 1865, 1867 (1997) (describing preliminary\ninjunction as “extraordinary and drastic remedy”) (quoting\n11A C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 2948\nat 129–30 (2d ed. 1995)). The burden, of course, is on the\nplaintiffs as the movants to make a clear showing demonstrat-\ning their entitlement to such relief. See id.; Christian Legal Soc’y\nv. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 870 (7th Cir. 2006) (quoting Goodman v.\nIll. Dep’t of Fin. & Prof’l Regulation, 430 F.3d 432, 437 (7th Cir.\n2005)); Chicago Dist. Council of Carpenters Pension Fund v. K&I\nConstr., Inc., 270 F.3d 1060, 1064 (7th Cir. 2001). The record at\nthis stage of the litigation is, to put it generously, slender in\nterms of evidence illuminating the asserted religious interests\nof the two corporate plaintiffs and how those interests would\nbe burdened by including coverage for contraceptives in their\n\n5\n  (...continued)\nthe kosher restaurant or its owners might somehow be substantially\nburdened by the private choice that a restaurant employee makes to\nconsume non-kosher food. See Jonathan D. Sarna, Constitutional Dilemma on\nBirth Control, FORWARD.COM (March 16, 2012) (“We all might agree that\nkosher delis should not be coerced into selling ham, but hopefully we\nwould also all agree that a deli’s employees and customers should not be\npenalized for choosing to consume it.”), http://foward.com/articles/\n152606/constitutional-dilemma-on-birth-control/ (last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\nFor the reasons I set forth below, I do not believe they would be.\n\f98                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nemployee health care plans. I am thus far short of convinced\nthat Grote Industries and Korte & Luitjohan Contractors have\ndemonstrated a clear entitlement to preliminary injunctive\nrelief protecting whatever free exercise rights they might have.\nHobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1164–65 (Briscoe, C.J., concurring in\npart & dissenting in part); id. at 1183–84 (Matheson, J., concur-\nring in part & dissenting in part). The notion that any type of\ncorporation may possess its own free exercise rights is itself far\nfrom a settled proposition; and the plaintiffs’ claim calls for a\nwholly unprecedented extension of such rights to secular, for-\nprofit corporations.\n    There are, finally, significant logical difficulties posed by\nattributing religious rights to secular corporations. Whatever\nreligious rights a corporation might theoretically exercise can\nonly come from the people who establish, own, and manage a\ncorporation. See Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724 F.3d at 385\n(“General business corporations do not, separate and apart\nfrom the actions or belief systems of their individual owners or\nemployees, exercise religion.”) (quoting Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\nv. Sebelius, 870 F. Supp. 2d at 1291). And here, no one is saying\nthat Korte & Luitjohan Contractors and Grote Industries are\nCatholic corporations; instead, I understand the individual\nplaintiffs to be saying that they run the corporations in a way\nthat is consistent with, and expresses, the principles of their\nCatholic faith. But this poses some challenges in defining the\nreligious beliefs and rights of the corporation.\n   First, to the extent that a corporation’s religious principles\nand identity derive from its owners, what if the owners have\ndiverse beliefs, diverse degrees of devotion, and diverse\nnotions as to whether and how the corporation ought to reflect\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         99\n\ntheir religious beliefs? See Harris v. McRae, supra, 448 U.S. at\n320–21, 100 S. Ct. at 2690 (noting that where individual church\nmembers hold diversity of religious views as to challenged\nlaw, church itself lacks associational standing to claim infringe-\nment on their free exercise rights); cf. Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246,\nat *22 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissenting in part)\n(noting extent to which theory that religious rights of corporate\nowners are burdened by requirement imposed on corporation\nwith which they are inextricably bound tuns on unanimity of\nowners’ beliefs; “there are no minority shareholders with\ndifferent views”). What if, for example, one of a corporation’s\ntwo equal owners is Catholic and the other is Protestant,\nMuslim, Jewish, or an atheist—are the beliefs of one or both\nattributed to the corporation, and if the beliefs of only one\ncount, which does? Are the beliefs a conglomeration or\nneither? Or suppose that both owners are Catholic, but only\none of them claims that his beliefs are burdened by some legal\nrequirement (like the mandate at issue here) imposed on the\ncompany, whereas the other professes either indifference or\nsupport for that requirement. Are the beliefs of the one owner\nalone sufficient to define those of the corporation? See Eliza-\nbeth Sepper, Contraception and the Birth of Corporate Conscience,\n17–18 (Wash. Univ. St. Louis Sch. of Law Legal Studies\nResearch Paper Series, Paper No. 13-07-01) (July 2013), avail-\nable at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=\n2289383, 22 AM. J. GENDER SOC. POL’Y & L. (forthcoming 2014)\n(discussing practical and doctrinal difficulties posed by\ntreating corporation as alter ego of owners for purposes of free\nexercise claim).\n\f100                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n   Second, suppose that the company’s ownership changes.\nWhat happens then to the beliefs we have attributed to the\ncorporation based on its ownership? Are challenges such as the\none presented in this case subject to re-litigation every time\nthere is a change in corporation ownership?\n    Third, are the religious beliefs of corporate owners solely\ndeterminative of the corporation’s religious principles?\nSuppose, for example, that a corporation’s owners have\nentirely entrusted the management of the corporation to its\nlongtime CEO, who is the public face of the corporation and\nwho also happens to have strongly held religious beliefs about\nthe way in which the corporation should be run. Are her\nbeliefs attributable to the corporation? Or suppose that the\nowners of a corporation have no professed religious interest in\nthe way in which a corporation is run, but the focus of the\ncorporation is on serving members of a particular reli-\ngion—selling kosher or halal food products, for example. See\nante at 51. Can the corporation be said to hold the religious\nbeliefs of its target market, even if its owners and managers do\nnot?\n     At oral argument, Grote Industries’ counsel conceded that\nif ownership of the company changed, as by death and\ninheritance, then a court might have to revisit the nature of the\ncorporation’s asserted religious interests. But why is that true\nif the corporation has its own free exercise rights? By permit-\nting a corporation to assert its own religious rights, we are, I\nwould think, saying that the corporation may possess such\nrights independent of what its owners believe and assert; a\nchange in ownership by itself would theoretically portend\nnothing about the status of the corporation’s religious interests.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           101\n\n    The court has also limited its holding today to closely-held\ncorporations. The reasons for that limitation are both prag-\nmatic and obvious: When a company is owned and managed\nby a small number of people, it is easy to appreciate the\noverlap between the interests of owners and corporation. Thus,\na firm that is owned and operated by a family united in its\nreligious beliefs presents the strongest case for making the type\nof free exercise claim presented here. But if a corporation has\nfree exercise rights because the Dictionary Act suggests it is\namong the “persons” to which RFRA grants the right to make\nsuch a claim, ante at 54 n.17, and if any distinctions between\nreligious and secular corporations do not matter, ante at 47–54,\nthen why does a corporation of large, diverse, or even public\nownership not have free exercise rights also? And how would\nthe beliefs of a public corporation be determined—by a vote at\nthe annual shareholders’ meeting, for example?\n    Although the court has held that Korte & Luitjohan\nContractors and Grote Industries have free exercise rights,\nwhat it is saying, in the end, is that it is the religious beliefs of\nthe Kortes and Grotes that matter; the corporations, in effect,\nembody the expression of their beliefs. See ante at 3, 59–60; see\nalso Autocam, 730 F.3d at 620 (noting that plaintiffs characterize\ntheir corporation as “the business form through which [they]\nendeavor to live their vocation as Christians in the world”).\nHolding that the two corporations have their own religious\ninterests is, as I said at the start, merely a means of circumvent-\ning the problem that while it is the beliefs of the Kortes and the\nGrotes that are at issue here, the duties imposed by the ACA\nupon the corporations do not significantly burden the free\n\f102                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nexercise rights of the Kortes and Grotes themselves. I turn to\nthat point next.\n                                4.\n    RFRA provides that “Government shall not substantially\nburden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden\nresults from a rule of general applicability,” unless the burden\nis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is\nthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(a) & (b). By its reference to substantial burdens,\nRFRA expressly calls for a qualitative assessment of the burden\nthat a challenged statute or other government action imposes\non an individual’s exercise of religion. As I discuss below,\ncourts have long engaged in such assessments, distinguishing\nbetween direct and indirect, and between minor and meaning-\nful burdens on the exercise of religion. Yet the court today\nrejects any such inquiry, departing from both historical\npractice and the language of RFRA.\n    Following the Tenth Circuit’s lead in Hobby Lobby, the\nmajority rejects any assessment of how direct or attenuated the\nburden imposed on the plaintiff’s religious practices may be,\nante at 57–60, reasoning that it is the equivalent of asking\nwhether the burdened religious practice is central to the\nplaintiff’s faith or whether the plaintiff is interpreting his\nreligious beliefs correctly, ante at 55–56. Instead, the majority\nholds that the pertinent inquiry is whether the penalties for\nnoncompliance with the government’s mandate exert a\nsufficiently coercive influence on the plaintiffs. Ante at 56\n(citing Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1137). This single-minded focus\non the coercive aspect of the mandate is yet another means of\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          103\n\ngetting past the point that a number of courts have made\npreviously: that because the mandate is imposed on the\ncorporate employers rather than the owners themselves, and\nbecause it does not require the owners themselves to do\nanything in violation of their religious faith, it does not directly\nand substantially burden the owners’ religious practices. See\nGrote, 708 F.3d at 858–59 (dissent) (coll. cases); see also Gilardi,\n2013 WL 5854246, at *29–*31 (Edwards, J., concurring in part &\ndissenting in part). Per the majority’s view, the individual\nplaintiffs need only cite an obligation imposed on the corpora-\ntions that is inconsistent with their own religious beliefs and\npractices; so long as the corporations are coerced into compli-\nance (as by the prospect of substantial fines if they do not\ncomply) that is enough to establish a substantial burden on\ntheir free exercise rights, without further inquiry into whether\nthe mandate genuinely and meaningfully interferes with their\nreligious practices. Hobby Lobby reasons that it is not the court’s\nbusiness to assess whether the obligation imposed by the\ngovernment is substantial in the sense of whether it directly\nburdens the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs and practices or instead\nis attenuated, as the government claims it to be. That assess-\nment is equated with a forbidden inquiry into the theological\nmerit of the plaintiffs’ claim. 723 F.3d at 1137. “Our only task\nis to determine whether the claimant’s belief is sincere, and if\nso, whether the government has applied substantial pressure\non the claimant to violate that belief.” Id.\n    This coercion-only test is one of the Tenth Circuit’s inven-\ntion. It has the superficial support of language found in\nmultiple court decisions, see, e.g., Hobbie v. Unemployment\nAppeals Comm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 141, 107 S. Ct. 1046, 1049\n\f104                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n(1987) (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Indiana Employ. Sec.\nDiv., 450 U.S. 707, 717–18, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1431–32 (1981));\nVision Church v. Vill. of Long Grove, 468 F.3d 975, 997 (7th Cir.\n2006); Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008),\nbut it misapprehends both the context and relevance of\ncoercion in free exercise jurisprudence, and as a result it writes\nRFRA’s “substantial burden” provision out of the statute.\n    The coercion analysis addresses one way in which govern-\nment may potentially interfere with a plaintiff’s free exercise\nrights. Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d 1301, 1315 (10th Cir.\n2010), cited and relied upon by Hobby Lobby for the coercion\ntest, describes three ways in which a plaintiff’s religious rights\nmay be burdened: (1) the government compels the plaintiff to\ndo something that is inconsistent with his religious beliefs; (2)\nthe government forbids the plaintiff from doing something that\nhis religion motivates him to do; or (3) the government does\nnot directly compel the plaintiff to do something forbidden by\nhis religious beliefs or to refrain from doing something\ncommanded by those beliefs, but instead puts substantial\npressure on the plaintiff to do so. See also Sherbert v. Verner,\nsupra, 374 U.S. at 402, 83 S. Ct. at 1793) (describing in different\nterms the multiple ways in which the government might\nburden religious rights); Mack v. O’Leary, 80 F.3d 1175, 1179\n(7th Cir. 1996) (same), cert. granted & judgment vacated on other\ngrounds, 522 U.S. 801, 118 S. Ct. 36 (1997).\n   The third of the Abdulhaseeb categories is exemplified by\nThomas, 450 U.S. 707, 101 S. Ct. 1425. The petitioner in Thomas\nwas denied unemployment benefits because he had left his\nemployment voluntarily: he quit after his employer gave him\nan assignment (producing military armaments) that he\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                105\n\nbelieved he could not perform given his religious beliefs. In\ndenying benefits to Thomas, the state unemployment board\nwas not forcing him to act, or refrain from acting, contrary to\nhis religious faith. Nonetheless, by placing him between a rock\nand a hard place—either stay on the job, and violate his\nreligious beliefs, or quit, and surrender his right to unemploy-\nment compensation—the Supreme Court reasoned that the\nstate was effectively coercing him to act contrary to his\nreligious principles.\n      Where the state conditions receipt of an important\n      benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith,\n      or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct\n      mandated by religious belief, thereby putting\n      substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his\n      behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon\n      religion exists. While the compulsion may be indi-\n      rect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonethe-\n      less substantial.\n450 U.S. at 717–18, 101 S. Ct. at 1432. See also Hobbie, 480 U.S. at\n139–41, 107 S. Ct. at 1048–49 (refusal to award unemployment\nbenefits to plaintiff who refused for religious reasons to work\non Sabbath violated free exercise clause); Sherbert, 374 U.S. at\n403–04, 83 S. Ct. at 1793–94 (same). Likewise, in Abdulhaseeb,\nwhere a prisoner was complaining that the failure to provide\nhim with a halal diet which included meat interfered with his\nright to the free exercise of religion,6 the prison was not literally\n\n\n\n6\n The prisoner filed suit under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\n\f106                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ncompelling him to violate his religious beliefs; nonetheless, by\nputting him to an unacceptable choice—eat a non-compliant\ndiet or go hungry—he was being coerced into violating his\nreligious principles. 600 F.3d at 1316–17; see also Hunafa v.\nMurphy, 907 F.2d 46, 47–48 (7th Cir. 1990).\n    To my mind, this is not a substantial pressure case like\nThomas; rather, this is a more straightforward instance of the\ngovernment overtly requiring a plaintiff to do something that\nhe asserts is contrary to his religious beliefs. The ACA unam-\nbiguously requires the two corporate plaintiffs to include\ncontraceptive coverage in their employee health plans. Even\nabsent the substantial financial penalties for non-compliance,\nthe two companies presumably would be subject to suit by the\ngovernment or by an employee for injunctive relief ordering\nthem to comply if they did not otherwise do so, see ante at 7\n(citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d); and, in any event, most\nindividuals and corporations will not feel free to deliberately\nignore what the law plainly requires them to do. So the entire\ninquiry into whether the ACA places substantial pressure on\nthe plaintiffs to take action over their objections is unnecessary\nand beside the point. There is no dispute that it does.\n    What the coercion inquiry does not answer, and which the\ncourt must turn to next, is whether the government, by\nrequiring the two companies to take action to which the\ncompanies and their owners object on religious grounds, is\nimposing a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ free exercise of\nreligion. This is where the Tenth Circuit’s decision in Hobby\nLobby, now embraced by this court, goes awry. Hobby Lobby\npostulates that evaluating the nature and degree of the burden\nimposed by the mandate will require an impermissible inquiry\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          107\n\ninto whether the plaintiffs are correctly interpreting and\nfollowing religious dogma. 724 F.3d at 1137; see Thomas, 450\nU.S. at 715, 101 S. Ct. at 1430 (“We see … that Thomas drew a\nline, and it is not for us to say that the line he drew was an\nunreasonable one. Courts should not undertake to dissect\nreligious beliefs because the believer admits he is ‘struggling’\nwith his position or because his beliefs are not articulated with\nthe clarity and precision that a more sophisticated person\nmight employ.”); United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257, 102 S.\nCt. 1051, 1055 (1982); Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at *7. Hobby\nLobby thus concludes that once the plaintiff has shown the\ngovernment has put substantial pressure on him to do some-\nthing to which he sincerely objects on religious grounds, he has\nshown all that he needs to show to establish that his free\nexercise right is substantially burdened. 723 F.3d at 1137–38; see\nante at 56–57.\n   This holding effectively rewrites RFRA. The statute does\nnot prohibit the government from putting substantial pressure\non a plaintiff to do anything, or to be a party to anything, to\nwhich he has an honest religious objection; rather, it states that\nthe government “shall not substantially burden a person's\nexercise of religion … .” § 2000bb-1(a) (emphasis mine).\nCongress used the term “substantially” to modify “burden,”\nand the relevant inquiry considers how that burden affects the\nindividual’s ability to believe, profess, and practice his religion.\nAs Judge Edwards points out in Gilardi, RFRA was specifically\ndrafted in that way to make clear that not every burden\nimposed by government on religious exercise need be justified\nby a compelling governmental interest. 2013 WL 5854246, at\n*27–*28 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissenting in part);\n\f108                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsee also Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1316 (“we do not intend to\nimply that every infringement on a religious exercise will\nconstitute a substantial burden”). By its plain terms, then, the\nstatute calls for a threshold inquiry into the nature of the\nburden placed on the plaintiff’s free exercise of religion:\n“substantial” is a term of degree, which invites the court to\ndistinguish large or considerable burdens from minor or\nincidental ones. Cf. Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534\nU.S. 184, 196–97, 122 S. Ct. 681, 691 (2002); Sutton v. United Air\nLines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 2150–51 (1999)\n(both construing Americans With Disabilities Act’s use of term\n“substantially” vis-à-vis limitations on major life activities).\nOtherwise, any honestly-perceived burden on religion resulting\nfrom government action would suffice to make out a prima\nfacie free exercise claim under prong (a) of RFRA and trigger\nthe strict scrutiny called for by prong (b). § 2000bb-1(a), (b). See\nEmploy. Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S.\n872, 888–89, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 1605–06 (1990); Civil Liberties for\nUrban Believers v. City of Chicago, 342 F.3d 752, 761 (7th Cir.\n2003).\n    No doubt, assessing the substantiality of the claimed\nburden on one’s free exercise of religion will sometimes call for\ndifficult judgments, as the Supreme Court recognized in Smith,\n494 U.S. at 887 n.4, 110 S. Ct. at 1605–06 n.4. Indeed, the\ndifficulty of making such assessments is a key reason why the\nCourt in Smith ultimately abandoned its earlier free exercise\nclause jurisprudence in favor of a simpler test focusing on the\nfacial neutrality of the challenged law. Id. at 882–89, 110 S. Ct.\nat 1602–04. But prior to Smith, the Court often engaged in such\nqualitative assessments in evaluating the merits of free exercise\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          109\n\nclaims.

Ct. at 1217 (noting that\nfor purposes of plaintiff’s RFRA claim, government conceded\nlaw in question substantially burdened sincere free exercise of\nreligion). These cases are flatly inconsistent with the notion\nthat we cannot assess the nature or degree of any burden\nimposed on a plaintiff’s free exercise rights by government\naction.7\n    Evaluating the nature of the burden imposed is not a test of\nthe orthodoxy, consistency, or theological merit of a plaintiff’s\nstated religious beliefs. Provided the plaintiff is sincere, ante at\n55, we may accept that his objection is one grounded in his\nreligious beliefs. But simply because someone has a good-faith\nobjection, based in religion, to a particular government action\ndoes not mean that his right to the free exercise of religion is\n\n\n7\n  Some of the RLUIPA cases may be distinguished superficially, in that the\nplaintiffs were prisoners who sought damages for occasional denials of\nkosher or halal meals or other accommodations to their religious needs.\nE.g., Rapier, 172 F.3d at 1006 n.4 (unavailability of non-pork food trays to\nprisoner at three of 810 meals). This suit, by contrast, involves a challenge\nto a statutory mandate that the plaintiffs contend is inconsistent with their\nreligious beliefs. Nonetheless the cases remain relevant for the proposition\nthat not all burdens on the free exercise of religion qualify as substantial.\nThe nature of the claim (impingement on the free exercise of religion) is the\nsame; the only difference is the context in which the claim is asserted.\n\f112                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nactually and substantially burdened by that action. Courts\nroutinely undertake examinations of the degree to which a\ngiven law, regulation, or other government action does or does\nnot intrude upon an individual’s constitutionally protected\ninterests. See Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. at 706–07, 106 S. Ct. at\n2155–56 (burdens on religious liberty); see also, e.g., Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U.S. 372, 383–84, 127 S.

Without\nventuring into the content and merit of the plaintiffs’ religious\nbeliefs, we may still consider the nature of the act that the\nplaintiffs are called upon to perform, the connection between\ntheir beliefs and the compelled action, and the extent to which\ntheir ability to practice their religion is interfered with by that\naction.\n   Thus, for example, in assessing the substantiality of the\nburden imposed on a plaintiff’s free exercise rights, we may\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        113\n\nconsider whether the burden is direct or indirect. Braunfeld v.\nBrown, supra, 366 U.S. 599, 81 S. Ct. 1144, makes this clear.\nBraunfeld sustained Pennsylvania’s Sunday-closing law against\na free exercise challenge notwithstanding the economic burden\nthat the law imposed on Jewish merchants: because their\nreligion proscribed them from doing business on Saturdays,\nrequiring them to also close their doors on Sundays imposed\nan extra cost on them that it did not impose on other business-\npeople. The court emphasized that the law imposed “only an\nindirect burden on the exercise of religion … .” Id. at 606, 81 S.\nCt. at 1147.\n     [I]t cannot be expected, much less required, that\n     legislators enact no law regulating conduct that may\n     in some way result in an economic disadvantage to\n     some religious sects and not to others because of the\n     special practices of the various religions. We do not\n     believe that such an effect is an absolute test for\n     determining whether the legislation violated the\n     freedom of religion protected by the First Amend-\n     ment.\nId. at 606–07, 81 S. Ct. at 1147–48. Hobby Lobby suggests that the\nCourt in Lee subsequently abandoned consideration of whether\nthe burden imposed by a statute on free exercise rights is direct\nor indirect. 723 F.3d at 1139–40. Yet, the government’s argu-\nment in Lee—that an Amish businessman could contribute to\nthe Social Security system without violating his religious belief\nthat it is sinful for a family not to care for its own elderly—was\nnot an argument about the direct or indirect effect of the law,\nbut rather a quarrel with Lee’s understanding of the Amish\nfaith; and the Court’s unwillingness to mediate a theological\n\f114                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ndispute was what led it to reject the argument. 455 U.S. at 257,\n102 S. Ct. at 1055. What is true is that the Court, subsequent to\nBraunfeld, rejected the directness or indirectness of the burden\nas a controlling factor in free exercise cases. See Sherbert v.\nVerner, supra, 374 U.S. at 403–04, 83 S. Ct. at 1794 (“[I]t is true\nthat no criminal sanctions directly compel appellant to work a\nsix-day week. But this is only the beginning, not the end, of our\ninquiry.”); see also Thomas, 450 U.S. at 714, 101 S. Ct. at 1432\n(“While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement\nupon free exercise rights is nonetheless substantial.”). But the\nCourt’s decision in Bowen v. Roy, supra, 476 U.S. at 706–07, 106\nS. Ct. at 2156, decided four years after Lee and which I discuss\nbelow, makes clear that the Court still regards it as a relevant\nconsideration. Lower court cases likewise confirm that the\ndirectness or indirectness of the burden imposed on the\nexercise of one’s religious exercise right remains a material\nconsideration. Compare, e.g., D.L. ex rel. K.L. v. Baltimore Bd. of\nSch. Com’rs, 706 F.3d 256, 263–64 (4th Cir. 2013) (school dis-\ntrict’s policy requiring student to be enrolled in public school\nin order to receive services under section 504 of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, did not unduly burden parents’ free\nexercise rights, although they wished to send him to private\nschool and would have to bear full costs of the rehabilitation\nservices for their son if they did so), and Messiah Baptist Church\nv. Cnty. of Jefferson, Colo., 859 F.2d 820, 825–26 (10th Cir. 1988)\n(zoning ordinance which prohibited schools, community\nbuildings, and churches from agricultural zone did not\nimpermissibly burden free exercise rights of church and its\nmembers even if it made their exercise of religion more\nexpensive, where, inter alia, any burden imposed by neutral\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        115\n\nlaw was an indirect burden), with Paul v. Watchtower Bible &\nTract Soc’y of N.Y., Inc., 819 F.2d 875, 880–81 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(subjecting Jehovah’s Witness church to tort damages for\nreligious practice of “shunning” would violate free exercise\nclause, as imposition of damages could constitute a direct\nburden on religion).\n    Free exercise cases have also drawn a distinction between\nwhat a challenged law or practice requires the plaintiff himself\nto do, and what it permits another party—specifically, the\ngovernment—to do to which plaintiff objects on religious\ngrounds. For example, in Bowen v. Roy, a Native American man\nwith a young daughter objected to a statutory requirement that\nhe provide a Social Security number for each member of his\nhousehold in order to obtain benefits from the Aid to Families\nwith Dependent Children program (“AFDC”) and to a com-\npanion requirement that state AFDC plans use such numbers\nin administering their plans. With respect to the latter require-\nment, he believed that if state agencies used an identifying\nnumber for his daughter, they would “rob” her spirit and\n“prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power,” 476 U.S.\nat 696, 106 S. Ct. at 2150; he therefore contended that the\nrequirement that state agencies use their daughter’s Social\nSecurity number violated his right to the free exercise of his\nreligion. The Supreme Court disagreed. It noted that the\nplaintiff was not complaining of an intrusion on his freedom of\nreligious belief, which was absolute, or of an intrusion upon\nthe liberty of his own conduct, which was less than absolute;\ninstead, the plaintiff was invoking the free exercise clause in an\neffort to dictate how the government should transact its\n\f116                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nbusiness. Id. at 699, 106 S. Ct. at 2152. The Court rejected the\nnotion that the reach of free exercise clause extended this far:\n      Never to our knowledge has the Court interpreted\n      the First Amendment to require the Government\n      itself to behave in ways that the individual believes\n      will further his or her spiritual development or that\n      of his or her family. The Free Exercise Clause simply\n      cannot be understood to require the Government to\n      conduct its own internal affairs in ways that com-\n      port with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.\n      Just as the Government may not insist that appellees\n      engage in any set form of religious observance, so\n      appellees may not demand that the Government join\n      in their chosen religious practices by refraining from\n      using a number to identify their daughter. “[T]he\n      Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the\n      government cannot do to the individual, not in\n      terms of what the individual can extract from the\n      government.” Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 412, 83\n      S. Ct. 1790, 1798 (1963) (Douglas, J., concurring).\n      As a result, Roy may no more prevail on his reli-\n      gious objection to the Government’s use of a Social\n      Security number for his daughter than he could on\n      a sincere religious objection to the size or color of the\n      Government’s filing cabinets. The Free Exercise\n      Clause affords an individual protection from certain\n      forms of governmental compulsion; it does not\n      afford an individual right to dictate the conduct of\n      the government’s internal procedures.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          117\n\nId. at 699–700, 106 S. Ct. at 2152. (emphasis in original). See also\nLyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, supra, 485 U.S. at\n451–53, 108 S. Ct. at 1326–28 (government’s decision to allow\ntimber harvesting and road construction in area of national\nforest used for religious purposes by Native American tribes\ndid not interfere with free exercise rights of tribes, notwith-\nstanding potentially devastating impact government’s decision\nmight have on tribes’ religious activities: “Whatever rights the\nIndians may have to the use of the area, … those rights do not\ndivest the Government of its right to use what is, after all, its\nland.”) (emphasis in original).\n    Building upon the Supreme Court’s holding in Roy, the\nD.C. Circuit in Kaemmerling v. Lappin, supra, 553 F.3d 669,\nsustained the dismissal of a prisoner’s claim under RFRA that\nthe statutorily mandated collection and use of his DNA for\npurposes of a national law enforcement database substantially\nburdened his free exercise rights. Kaemmerling alleged that as\nan Evangelical Christian, he viewed DNA as the building block\nof God’s creative work, and he believed that the collection,\nstorage, and use of one’s DNA was tantamount to laying the\nfoundation for the rise of an anti-Christ. In rejecting the\nviability of Kaemmerling’s claim, the court emphasized that\nthe government was not forcing him to modify his own\nbehavior:\n     … Kaemmerling does not allege facts sufficient to\n     state a substantial burden on his religious exercise\n     because he cannot identify any “exercise” which is\n     the subject of the burden to which he objects. The\n     extraction and storage of DNA information are\n     entirely activities of the FBI, in which Kaemmerling\n\f118                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n      plays no role and which occur after the [Bureau of\n      Prisons] has taken his fluid or tissue sample (to\n      which he does not object). The government’s extrac-\n      tion, analysis, and storage of Kaemmerling’s DNA\n      information does not call for Kaemmerling to mod-\n      ify his religious behavior in any way—it involves no\n      action or forbearance on his part, nor does it other-\n      wise interfere with any religious act in which he\n      engages. Although the government’s activities with\n      his fluid or tissue sample after the BOP takes it may\n      offend Kaemmerling’s religious beliefs, they cannot\n      be said to hamper his religious exercise because they\n      do not “pressure [him] to modify his behavior and\n      to violate his beliefs.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718, 101 S.\n      Ct. 1425.\n      Kaemmerling alleges no religious observance that\n      the DNA Act impedes, or acts in violation of his\n      religious beliefs that it pressures him to perform.\n      Religious exercise necessarily involves an action or\n      practice, as in Sherbert, where the denial of unem-\n      ployment benefits “impede[d] the observance” of\n      the plaintiff’s religion by pressuring her to work on\n      Saturday in violation of the tenets of her religion,\n      374 U.S. at 404, 83 S. Ct. 1790, or in Yoder, where the\n      compulsory education law compelled the Amish to\n      “perform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental\n      tenets of their religious beliefs,” 406 U.S. at 218, 92 S.\n      Ct. 1526. Kaemmerling, in contrast, alleges that the\n      DNA Act’s requirement that the federal government\n      collect and store his DNA information requires the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           119\n\n     government to act in ways that violate his religious\n     beliefs, but he suggests no way in which these\n     governmental acts pressure him to modify his own\n     behavior in any way that would violate his beliefs.\n     See Appellant’s Br. at 21 (describing alleged substan-\n     tial burden as “knowing [his] strongly held beliefs\n     had been violated by a[n] unholy act of an oppres-\n     sive regime”).\n553 F.3d at 679. (The court went on to hold, alternatively, that\neven if the DNA mandate did impose a substantial burden on\nKaemmerling’s free exercise rights, it would nonetheless\nsurvive RFRA’s step-two strict scrutiny analysis. Id. at 680–85.)\n    These lines of cases thus supply two criteria that can help\nus to determine whether the burden imposed by government\naction upon a plaintiff’s free exercise rights is substantial. First,\nthe Braunfeld line of cases instructs us to look at the burden\nresulting from government action and consider the way in\nwhich it purportedly interferes with an individual’s exercise of\nreligion: is the burden direct, such that it actually prevents a\nperson from behaving in accordance with his religion, or does\nit impose only an indirect, incidental burden that, for example,\nmakes the observance of his religion more costly but does not\nactually preclude his religious exercise? Second, the Roy line of\ncases draws a distinction between what the law requires a\nplaintiff himself to do, and what it permits or requires a third\nparty to do. These cases recognize that although the plaintiff\nmay have a religiously-based objection to what the govern-\nment or another third party does with something that the law\nrequires the plaintiff to provide (in Roy, a Social Security\nnumber, in Kaemmerling, his DNA), the free exercise clause\n\f120                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ndoes not necessarily permit him to impose a restraint upon\nanother’s action.\n    Admittedly, neither line speaks directly to the issues before\nus now: the Supreme Court has never before considered\nwhether and under what circumstances the statutorily-man-\ndated provision of a particular benefit to an employee will\nsubstantially burden the employer’s free exercise rights. (The\nprecedent that is closest to that scenario is United States v. Lee,\nin which the Court held that the objecting Amish employer\nwas obliged to pay Social Security taxes notwithstanding his\nreligious objection to doing so, given the government’s\ncompelling interest in a uniform national system of retirement\npay.) The cases I have just discussed are nonetheless relevant\nin two senses. First, like the various circuit cases finding certain\nburdens on free exercise rights to be insubstantial, supra at 110-\n111, they confirm that we can and in fact must examine the\nnature and degree of the burden resulting from government\naction to decide whether it constitutes a substantial burden for\npurpose of RFRA. Second, they demonstrate that in making\nthat assessment, we must consider precisely how the objected-\nto action relates to the individual’s exercise of his religious\nrights.\n   Taking my cue from these cases, I move on to consider\nprecisely how the ACA’s requirement that a corporate em-\nployer provide health insurance to its employees that includes\ncontraceptive coverage does or does not burden the free\nexercise rights of its owners. Because the ACA does not\nactually require the individual plaintiffs themselves to do\nanything contrary to their religious beliefs, and because their\ndesire not to have their companies facilitate the use of contra-\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         121\n\nception necessarily implicates the private choices of employees\nas to how they will use the insurance coverage they have\nearned as a benefit of their work, I am convinced that any\nburden imposed on the free exercise rights of the individual\nplaintiffs is too attenuated to qualify as a substantial burden.\n                                5.\n    A substantial burden is one that bears direct, primary, and\nfundamental responsibility for making the plaintiff’s religious\nexercise impracticable. Ante at 54–55; Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d\n868, 878 (7th Cir. 2009); Koger v. Bryan, 523 F.3d 789, 799 (7th\nCir. 2008); Civil Liberties for Urban Believers v. City of Chicago,\nsupra, 342 F.3d at 761. Here, the contention is not that the ACA\nproscribes any belief or interferes with any form of worship\nactivity, but that the statute nonetheless requires the plaintiffs\nto lend material support to an activity (the use of contracep-\ntion) that is inconsistent with the individual plaintiffs’ Catholic\nfaith. Specifically, the company health plans must provide\ninsurance coverage which, by fully underwriting the cost of\ncontraceptive care, facilitates what the Kortes and the Grotes\nview as a moral wrong (the use of contraception).\n    For two key reasons, the mandate poses no direct burden\non the Kortes’ and Grotes’ exercise of religion. First, the\nmandate does not require them to alter their own practices in\nany way. As the court’s articulation of the asserted burden\nmakes clear, what they are objecting to is the use of contracep-\ntion by third parties, which the plaintiffs do not wish to\nfacilitate. Second, to the extent the Kortes’ and the Grotes’\nconcern has to do with facilitating what they believe to be\nimmoral conduct by third parties, it is the corporate health\n\f122                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nplans, not they, who fund the insurance which employees may\nuse to procure contraception.\n    The first point is obvious, and I have made it before, but it\ncannot be repeated often enough. Nothing in the ACA requires\nthe Kortes or the Grotes themselves to do anything that\nviolates the Catholic Church’s disapproval of contraception.\nThey need not purchase, use, or dispense contraceptives; they\nneed not promote or endorse the use of contraceptives; nor\nneed they remain silent as to what their faith teaches them\nabout the immorality of contraceptive use. See Gilardi, 2013 WL\n5854246, at *29–*31 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissent-\ning in part); Goehring v. Brophy, 94 F.3d 1294, 1300 (9th Cir.\n1996) (use of university registration fee to fund student health\ninsurance plan that included abortion coverage did not\nsubstantially burden free exercise rights of students who\nobjected to abortion on religious grounds because, in part,\n“plaintiffs are not required to accept, participate in, or advo-\ncate in any manner for the provision of abortion services”),\noverruled on other grounds by City of Boerne v. Flores, supra, 521\nU.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157; cf. Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d\n1109, 1121 (9th Cir. 2009) (objection by pharmacy to dispensing\nemergency contraception); Menges v. Blagojevich, 451 F. Supp.\n2d 992, 1000–02 (C.D. Ill. 2006) (same). Their only connection\nto the objected-to use of contraception is indirect: (a) the Grotes\nand the Kortes are both the owners of closely-held corpora-\ntions; (b) which are now required by the ACA to provide\nstandardized health-care coverage to employees; (c) which\nemployees may elect, inter alia, to use to obtain contraception.\nEach step in this chain separates them by an additional degree\nfrom the objected-to practice of contraception.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                   123\n\n    It is the corporations, not the individual plaintiffs, which as\nthe employers are obligated to provide the requisite coverage\nto employees of the firms. The Kortes and the Grotes incorpo-\nrated their businesses for a reason. Business owners form\ncorporations precisely to insulate themselves from the obliga-\ntions of the corporation and to create a separate entity to carry\non the business. The corporations and only the corporations\nbear the obligation to provide the insurance coverage to\nemployees; the Kortes and the Grotes bear no personal\nobligation to pay for the coverage. Thus the money—the\n“material support,” as the court describes it—comes from\nKorte & Luitjohan Contractors and Grote Industries, not from\nthe pockets of the individual plaintiffs.8\n    Moreover, what the companies are providing is a form of\nemployee compensation, like wages. Handing over a paycheck\nto an employee may materially facilitate the purchase of any\nnumber of (perfectly legal) goods and services—alcohol,\nlottery tickets, cigarettes, adult pornography, contraception,\n\n\n8\n  The sparse record before us does not reveal whether and to what degree\nthe contraceptive mandate may increase the cost of health insurance to\nemployers. Full coverage of contraception may (like the mandated coverage\nof other preventive services) save insurers and employers money in the\nlong run by reducing the multiple costs associated with unplanned\npregnancies. See infra at 144-145; Institute of Medicine, Committee on\nPreventive Services for Women, Clinical Preventive Services for Women:\nClosing the Gaps, 107 (2011) (costs of unintended pregnancies in United\nStates in 2002 estimated to be $5 billion, while costs saved due to contracep-\ntion estimated to be $19.3 billion), available at http://www.nap.edu/\ncatalog.php?record_id=13181. In any case, the plaintiffs’ argument here\nturns not on the additional cost of providing contraceptive coverage but to\nfacilitating the use of contraceptives by providing that coverage, period.\n\f124                                            Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nabortion, and Harry Potter books, to name a few—that are\ncontrary to an employer’s religious beliefs. Of course, an\nemployer typically does not know how an employee will\nspend his wages. (Neither does he typically know what\nhealthcare decisions his employee is making.) But what if he\ndoes know? Suppose an employee announces, “As soon as I\nget my paycheck, I am going to have an abortion.” Or suppose\nit is well known at the workplace that a particular employee\ndrinks himself blind at a local tavern every Friday night after\nhe gets paid. Can the employer withhold the paycheck on the\ngrounds that turning it over will materially assist an act that he\nfinds morally intolerable? Without explaining why, the\nplaintiffs concede that an employer cannot do this. They do not\ncontend that the possibility, or even the foreknowledge, that an\nemployee can and will use her wages to engage in an activity\nproscribed by the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs substantially\nburdens their free exercise rights, notwithstanding that the\npayment of wages to the employees will facilitate the objected-\nto activity.9 How is the provision of health insurance different?\nOne difference is that the employer plays some role in estab-\nlishing and administering the health care plan, as opposed to\nsupplying the employee with a voucher that the employee can\nuse to purchase his own insurance elsewhere. But the insur-\n\n\n9\n   As Judge Edwards put it in Gilardi, “the Gilardis are no more of an\n‘essential cause’ of increasing the use of contraception when they authorize\nFreshway [their company] to pay for a benefits plan that employees might\nuse to get contraception than when they authorize wages that an employee\nmight use to purchase contraception she would not otherwise be able to\nafford.” 2013 WL 5854246, at *29 (Edwards, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (emphasis in original).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                       125\n\nance is nonetheless a component of compensation that the\nemployee has earned—an employee accepts less in salary or\nhourly pay in exchange for benefits like health insurance, and,\nin most cases, contributions have been withheld from the\nemployee’s paycheck to further defray the costs of that\ninsurance. See Sepper, Contraception and the Birth of Corporate\nConscience, supra, at 22.10 The fact that the employer in adminis-\ntering the plan is treated as a fiduciary, with a corresponding\nobligation to act in the employee’s interest is consistent with the\nnotion that the insurance, while provided by the employer,\nbelongs to the employee. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1002(21)(A)(I)\n(defining ERISA fiduciaries to include person with authority or\ncontrol over plan assets); 1104(a)(1)(A) (ERISA fiduciaries must\ndischarge duties to plan solely in interests of plan participants\nand beneficiaries, for exclusive purpose of providing benefits\nthereto).11\n\n10\n   The record does not disclose what the plaintiffs’ employees contribute\ntoward the cost of their health insurance. The average employee currently\ncontributes $999 toward the $5,884 cost of an employer-sponsored, single-\ncoverage plan (roughly a 17-percent share), and $4,565 toward the $16,351\ncost of an employer-sponsored, family-coverage plan (roughly a 28-percent\nshare).

That the coverage is provided\ndoes not mean that it will necessarily be used, or used in a way\nthat the plaintiffs find objectionable. This much is made clear\nby the Korte firm’s ethics policy, which itself recognizes that\nthe use of some contraceptive medications, for non-contracep-\ntive purposes, is consistent with the Kortes’ Catholic faith. Ante\nat 12–13 & n.5. The court too recognizes this when it describes\nthe plaintiffs’ objection as one to providing material assistance\nto immoral conduct—i.e., the use of contraceptives. Ante at 13,\n60. And this is the point—that the objection turns not on the\ncoverage in isolation but the decision to use covered contracep-\ntives for a particular purpose, i.e. to prevent procreation. See\nSepper, Contraception and the Birth of Corporate Conscience, at 18,\n19 (noting that burden is non-existent if employees share\ncompany’s asserted religious values and therefore do not use\ncontraceptive coverage). That decision is merely one of many\nthat plaintiffs might find objectionable. For what the ACA\nrequires the plaintiffs to provide to their employees is not a\ncontraceptive insurance policy but a health care plan that\ncovers literally thousands of services.

See Grote, 708\nF.3d at 866 (dissent).\n    This is the sense in which Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536\nU.S. 639, 652–654, 122 S. Ct. 2460, 2467–68 (2002), and Bd. of\nRegents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 233–35\n120 S. Ct. 1346, 1356–57 (2000), are relevant: both emphasize\nthe critical role that the independent decisions of third parties\nplay in walling off an unwilling financier from activities or\nspeech that he objects to subsidizing on constitutional grounds.\nIn Zelman, the objectors were taxpayers who contended that\nthe state’s issuance of vouchers that parents could (and in\noverwhelming numbers did) use to send their children to\nparochial schools violated the First Amendment’s establish-\nment clause, in that public funds were being used for religious\npurposes. In Southworth, the objectors were public university\nstudents who argued that the use of their mandatory activity\nfees to support student groups whose missions and speech\nthey opposed violated their own First Amendment right to free\nspeech. The Supreme Court rejected the First Amendment\nclaims in both cases. In Zelman, the Court emphasized that\nbecause the voucher program was neutral with respect to\nreligion, and public money reached religious schools solely by\nway of “genuine and independent private choice,” the protest-\ning taxpayers did not have a valid Establishment Clause claim.\n536 U.S. at 652, 122 S. Ct. at 2467. And in Southworth, the Court\nlikewise stressed that because student activity funds were\nallocated on a viewpoint-neutral basis, ensuring that both\nminority and majority views would be heard, there was no\n\f128                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ngenuine risk that any student group would be perceived as\nspeaking for the university and its students, and thus no\nmeritorious claim that the objecting students were being\ncompelled to “speak” in violation of their own beliefs and\nviews. 529 U.S. at 233–35, 120 S. Ct. at 1356–57.\n    Yes, Zelman and Southworth can be distinguished from this\ncase: Zelman involved an establishment clause claim, and\nSouthworth involved a free speech claim, whereas this case\npresents a free exercise clause claim. But at the bottom of all\nthree cases is the claim that forcing the plaintiff to give his\nfinancial aid to activity or speech that he finds objectionable\ncannot be reconciled with his First Amendment freedoms.\nCentral to the rejection of this claim in Zelman and Southworth\nwas official agnosticism, which permitted the funds to be used\nas third parties (in Zelman, the parents, and in Southworth, the\nstudent council) chose, with no reasonable perception that\nthose choices were attributable to either the government or the\nobjecting plaintiff. The same reasoning explains why manda-\ntory, employer-sponsored insurance coverage which includes\ncontraception as a covered service does not meaningfully\nburden the plaintiffs’ free exercise rights. By including contra-\nception in the required coverage, the government is in no way\nrequiring any company owner to use, endorse, or dispense\ncontraception in violation of his own religious beliefs; the\nchoice whether and under what circumstances to use that\ncoverage is left to the individual employee and her physician,\nto be made in private, with no participation by the employer.\nAlthough funds from the company health plan are being used\nto facilitate that choice, no objective observer would attribute\nthat choice to the company, let alone its owner. See Gilardi, 2013\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                  129\n\nWL 5854246, at *30 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissent-\ning in part).\n    Finally, it is worth considering the ramifications of deeming\none choice that may be made by an employee using her\nworkplace healthcare plan to be a burden on her employer’s\nfree exercise rights. Again, what the ACA compels a covered\nemployer to provide is not a contraceptive care plan but a\ncomprehensive health care plan that includes thousands of\nmedical services, including contraceptive care. It may seem\nboth possible and reasonable to carve out the coverage of\ncontraceptives from the rest of the ACA-mandated insurance\nplan, in that the plaintiffs have a categorical objection to the\nuse of contraceptives (insofar as they are used to prevent\ncontraception) and the contraception mandate itself stands out\nin that it requires coverage of contraceptives without copay-\nment by the employee.12 (I suspect that as a matter of public\ndiscourse, if not judicial treatment, the fact that contraceptive\ncare implicates both sex and women, also has something to do\nwith the reason why the contraception mandate seems differ-\nent from other provisions of the ACA.) However, as I have\npointed out previously, a given employer might find any\n\n\n12\n   It is misleading, however, to say, as many reports do, that the mandate\nrequires the coverage of contraceptives at no cost to the employee, given\nthat most employees pay some portion of the cost of their workplace health\ninsurance. See supra n.10. Many other preventive and screening healthcare\nservices are likewise to be provided to the employee without a copayment\nunder the ACA. See http://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-\ncare-benefits (listing 15 categories of preventive care to be covered with no\ncopayments for all insureds, 22 categories of such care for women, and 25\ncategories for children) (last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n\f130                                               Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nnumber of those services, either categorically or situationally,\ninconsistent with his or her religious beliefs. If, as the court\ntoday holds, it is a substantial burden on an employer’s free\nexercise rights to compel him to insure a form of medical care\nto which he objects on religious grounds, then all manner of\ninsured medical services are subject to challenge under RFRA.\nSee Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at *32 (Edwards, J., concurring in\npart & dissenting in part).\n   Nor, logically, would the potential objections that employ-\ners could raise be limited to health insurance. Federal law\ngrants any number of rights to employees, the recognition and\naccommodation of which an employer might find to be\ninconsistent with his religious beliefs. My hypothetical about\nextending FMLA leave to a gay parent is but one example.\nLikewise, beyond the employer-employee relationship, there\nmay be any number of federal rights bestowed on third\nparties—customers, vendors, creditors, debtors—to which the\nowner of a business theoretically might pose a religious\nobjection. Today’s decision certainly opens the door to chal-\nlenging the enforcement of those rights against a business as a\nburden on the free exercise rights of its owner.13\n\n\n13\n  The variety of government requirements that individuals, businesses, and\nreligious organizations have challenged on free exercise grounds makes this\nclear. See, e.g., Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec’y of Labor, supra, 471 U.S. at\n303–06, 105 S. Ct. at 1962–64 (minimum wage, overtime, and recordkeeping\nrequirements of Fair Labor Standards Act); Bob Jones Univ. v. United States,\n461 U.S. 574, 603–04, 103 S.

Ct. at 1055–57\n(Social Security taxes); In re Young, supra, 82 F.3d at 1418–20 (recovery of\n                                                                  (continued...)\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                     131\n\n    What also should not be overlooked is that by exempting a\ncorporation from a statute that grants a particular right to the\ncorporation’s employee or to another third party on the ground\nthat the mandate impinges on the religious rights of the\ncorporate owners, the court is depriving the third party of a\nright that Congress meant to give him. The Supreme Court has\nhinted at a reluctance to recognize a plaintiff’s request for a\nreligious exemption from a legal requirement when granting\nthe exemption would burden the rights of others.

Superior Court, 85 P.3d 67,\n93 (Cal. 2004) (“Strongly enhancing the state’s interest is the\ncircumstance that any exemption from the [state statute\nrequiring employers to include contraceptive coverage in\nworkplace health insurance plans] sacrifices the affected\nwomen’s interest in receiving equitable treatment with respect\nto health benefits.

J.\n350, 368 (1980) (injury to third parties may counsel against\nreligious exemption). Whatever work-around might be\npossible to bestow that right through alternate means, there is\nno certainty that the government can or will implement the\nwork-around or that it will do so on any given timeline, and in\nthe meantime the corporate owner has vindicated its asserted\nrights at the expense of others. The statutory mandate at issue\nin this case implicates not only a constitutionally protected\nfreedom to use contraception, but a range of other interests\nrelated to the health of women and their children and the\nability of women to enter and remain in the workplace. It is not\njust the women who work for Korte & Luitjohan Contractors\nand Grote Industries who have those interests; the wives and\ndaughters of employees who have family health insurance\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         133\n\ncoverage through those firms are also implicated. Whether the\nemployees and family members who are affected by this\ncourt’s ruling will be able to access contraception in the\nabsence of a government work-around cannot be known; what\nis virtually certain is that they will have to pay 100 percent of\nthe cost of contraception absent access to alternative coverage\nthrough a spouse’s insurance plan, for example. To the extent\nthat some employees will be unable to pay the out-of-pocket\ncosts of contraception, the plaintiffs, based on their own\nreligious beliefs, will have effectively narrowed the scope of\nhealthcare that is available to those employees. This is the very\nscenario about which the Supreme Court has signaled concern;\nand given that the plaintiffs’ own free exercise rights are at\nmost modestly burdened by the contraceptive mandate, we\ntread on dangerous territory by exempting the plaintiffs from\nthe statutory mandate.\n    I mentioned at the outset that the court’s decision struck me\nas reminiscent of the Lochner era; let me explain why I think\nthis is so. Lochner and its progeny struck down a host of wage,\nhour, and other workplace regulations on the theory that they\nimpermissibility intruded on the rights of contract, property,\nand to engage in a lawful, private business as protected by the\ndue process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nSee, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 57, 25 S. Ct. 539, 543\n(1905) (state statute specifying that bakery employees could\nwork no more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week\nimpermissibly intruded on employer’s and employee’s\nfreedom of contract: “There is no reasonable ground for\ninterfering with the liberty of person or the right of free\ncontract, by determining the hours of labor, in the occupation\n\f134                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nof a baker.”); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 11–14, 35 S. Ct. 240,\n242–43 (1915) (state statute proscribing “yellow dog” contracts\nthat forbade employees from joining a union interfered with\nrights of contract and private property); Adkins v. Children’s\nHosp. of D.C., 261 U.S. 525, 557–59, 43 S. Ct. 394, 401–02 (1923)\n(federal statute establishing minimum wage standards for\nwomen and children working in District of Columbia inter-\nfered with freedom of contract by artificially restricting\nemployer’s side of wage negotiation); New State Ice Co. v.\nLiebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 278, 52 S. Ct. 371, 374 (1932) (state\nstatute requiring a license to engage in manufacture, distribu-\ntion, or sale of ice interfered with common right to engage in\nlawful private business).\n    One flaw of the Lochner jurisprudence is that while the\nCourt purported to protect the constitutional rights of workers\nas well as employers, it blinded itself to the reality that\nemployees frequently did not possess bargaining power\nenabling them to pursue and protect their own liberty interests,\nso that by invalidating regulations meant to protect workers,\nthe Court was in fact depriving them of their contractual and\nother rights; substantive due process was being wielded as a\nclub to defeat important workplace protections. When the\nCourt signaled an end to the Lochner era with its decision in\nWest Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S. Ct. 578 (1937),\nto uphold a state statute establishing a minimum wage for\nwomen and minors—and thus to overrule its decision in\nAdkins—it stressed that the concept of liberty enshrined in the\ndue process clause also includes the right of government to\nenact legislation aimed at promoting the health and welfare of\nthe public, including protection for the rights of employees:\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         135\n\n     The principle which must control our decision is not\n     in doubt. The constitutional provision invoked is the\n     due process clause of the Fourteen Amendment\n     governing the states, as the due process clause\n     invoked in the Adkins Case governed Congress. In\n     each case the violation alleged by those attacking\n     minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation\n     of freedom of contract. What is this freedom? The\n     Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.\n     It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of\n     liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting\n     that deprivation, the Constitution does not recognize\n     an absolute and uncontrollable liberty. Liberty in\n     each of its phases has a history and connotation. But\n     the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organi-\n     zation which requires the protection of law against\n     the evils which menace the health, safety, morals,\n     and welfare of the people. Liberty under the Consti-\n     tution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of\n     due process, and regulation which is reasonable in\n     relation to its subject and is adopted in the interest\n     of the community is due process.\nId. at 391, 57 S.Ct. at 581–82. In concluding that the minimum-\nwage law fell within this broad police power, and did not\nimpermissibly intrude upon the rights of employers, the Court\nquoted approvingly from Justice Holmes’ dissent in Adkins:\n     This statute does not compel anybody to pay any-\n     thing. It simply forbids employment at rates below\n     those fixed as the minimum requirement of health\n     and right living. It is safe to assume that women will\n\f136                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n      not be employed at even the lowest wages allowed\n      unless they earn them, or unless the employer’s\n      business can sustain the burden. In short the law in\n      its character and operation is like hundreds of so-\n      called police laws that have been up-held.\nId. at 396–97, 57 S. Ct. at 584 (quoting Adkins, 261 U.S. at 570, 43\nS. Ct. at 406 (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n    What the plaintiffs’ claim has in common with the Lochner\njurisprudence is that it elevates the daily affairs of a secular,\nfor-profit corporation to constitutional status, treating the\nbusiness as the embodiment of its owners’ religious principles,\nsuch that a burden on the corporation is conceived of as a\nburden on the religious rights of the corporate owners. In this\nway, a statutory mandate that is amply justified by the govern-\nment’s police power, which falls solely on the corporation, and\nwhich requires the owners to do absolutely nothing in their\npersonal lives that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs, is\nnonetheless deemed to be an impermissible intrusion upon the\nexercise of their constitutionally protected religious beliefs. The\nburden, so conceived, is then used as the springboard for\noverruling a neutral, generally-applicable statutory provision\nthat Congress has deemed necessary to protect the rights of\nothers.\n    When the Kortes and the Grotes chose to enter the business\nworld, they did not surrender their free exercise rights, but\nthey did assume responsibility for the regulatory obligations\nimposed on all like businesses, including statutory obligations\nto their employees.

Like any secular\nemployer in a religiously pluralistic nation, the Kortes and the\nGrotes must realize that their companies employ individuals\nwho do not share their own religious beliefs and who may\nchoose to use their wages and benefits in ways that are\noffensive to those beliefs. As a matter of both common sense\nand legal reasoning, no one would plausibly treat those choices\nas the Kortes’ and Grotes’ own decisions, or as a meaningful\nburden on the exercise of their religious rights. What the ACA\nimposes on employers is an obligation to provide employee\nhealth insurance that covers a standard, comprehensive set of\nbenefits. How an individual employee uses those benefits is up\nto her; she not only earns the insurance through her labor but\ntypically contributes a significant portion of her wages to pay\nfor it. Her choices will be guided by, among other things, her\nown religious principles. Although an employer, in conveying\nthe benefits she has earned, no doubt facilitates those choices,\nher freedom to make choices that are inconsistent with the\nemployer’s own religious beliefs imposes nothing like a\n\f138                                            Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsubstantial burden on the employer’s practice of religion.14\nOnly by extending the scope of an employer’s exercise of\nreligion far beyond his own belief, worship, and conduct to the\nconduct of his employees, can we conceive of the insurance\nbenefits provided to employees as an undue burden on the free\nexercise rights of the company owners. This is, in my view, far\nbeyond what Congress had in mind when it enacted RFRA.\n                                     6.\n    If it were necessary to reach the second prong of the RFRA\ninquiry, I would find that the contraception mandate is\nsupported by a compelling governmental interest. The court\nchides the government for not making more of a case in this\nrespect. But, to my mind, the nature and the weight of the\ninterests supporting the mandate are obvious. In this regard,\nI view this case as materially no different from Lee, in which\nthe court found the government’s interest in a national social\nsecurity system sufficiently compelling to warrant infringe-\nment on an Amish employer’s religious interests by requiring\nhim to pay into the system.\n\n\n\n\n14\n     As Judge Edwards has pointed out:\n     No Free Exercise decision issued by the Supreme Court has\n     recognized a substantial burden on a plaintiff’s religious exercise\n     where the plaintiff is not himself required to take or forgo action\n     that violates his religious beliefs, but is merely required to take\n     action that might enable other people to do things that are at odds\n     with the plaintiff’s religious beliefs.\n2013 WL 5854246, at *29 (emphasis in original).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        139\n\n    The government has an obvious and compelling interest in\nbroadening Americans’ access to health insurance. That all\nAmericans have a keen interest in access to medical goods and\nservices is beyond question. As the costs of both health care\nand health insurance have risen substantially in recent decades\nand the number of workplace insurance plans has declined, the\nneed for health insurance reform has become more urgent. In\n2010, the year that the ACA was enacted, some 50 million\nAmericans lacked health insurance—roughly 18 percent of the\nnon-elderly population.

Obtaining insurance in the individual\nmarket was expensive: In 2010, average monthly per-person\npremiums in the individual market for health insurance ranged\nfrom a low of $136 in Alabama to $437 in Massachusetts, for a\nnationwide average of $215 (more than $2,500 per year).

At the same time, medical\ndebtors—whether uninsured or underinsured—were becom-\ning a much larger share of those filing for bankruptcy. See\nDavid U.

It builds upon the American tradition of employer-\nsponsored health insurance that began in the early 20th\ncentury. See, e.g., David Blumenthal, Employer-Sponsored Health\nIns. in the U.S.—Origins and Implications, 355 NEW ENGLAND J.\nMED. No. 1, 82 (July 6, 2006). It takes advantage of risk-spread-\ning, economies of scale, quality control, and other features of\nemployer-procured insurance. And, although this was the\nwork of a Democratic President and Congress, it had the\nadvantage of having been first proposed by a Republican\nPresident—Nixon—nearly 40 years ago. See Special Message\nfrom President Richard M. Nixon to the Congress Proposing a\nComprehensive Health Insurance Plan (Feb. 6, 1974), available\nat http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4337\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013). My intention here is neither to\nvalidate nor endorse the ACA as policy—that is not within my\npurview—but merely to recognize that it embodies rational\nchoices and that the road leading to those choices has been a\nlong and difficult one.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         141\n\n    Compelling government interests in both preventive health\ncare and gender equality support the inclusion of contracep-\ntives within the mandated coverage that insurance\nplans—including employer-sponsored plans—must provide\nwithout copayment by the insured. As the court has noted,\nincluded with the standard coverage required of all non-\ngrandfathered health plans are a series of preventive services\nthat must be provided to all adults without copayment,\nincluding immunizations for tetatanus, meningitis, measles,\ninfluenza, hepatitis B, and other communicable diseases;\nscreening for high cholesterol, diabetes, HIV infection, high\nblood pressure, colorectal cancer, and other potentially life-\nthreatening conditions; and both screening and counseling for\nalcohol abuse, tobacco use, and obesity. See\nhttp://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-\nbenefits (last visited Nov. 7, 2013). The rationale behind\nrequiring coverage of such services without copayment is\nobvious: these are services which either prevent illness\naltogether or facilitate detection at an earlier stage when it is\nmore amenable to treatment, thereby reducing the direct and\nindirect costs of illness otherwise borne by the insured, his\nfamily, his employer, his insurer, medical providers, and the\ngovernment. The Women’s Health Amendment to the ACA,\nspearheaded by U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski, expanded the\nrange of requisite preventive care to include a separate set of\npreventive services for women. In proposing the amendment,\nSenator Mikulski noted that many women forego preventive\nscreenings for the conditions that statistically are most likely to\nresult in their death—breast, cervical, colorectal, ovarian and\nlung cancer, and heart and vascular disease—either because\n\f142                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nthey lack insurance, the services are not covered by their\ninsurance plans, or because the large copayments required by\ntheir insurance companies for these screenings are beyond\ntheir financial means. “Women of childbearing age incur 68\npercent more out of pocket health care costs than men,” she\npointed out. “My amendment guarantees access to critical\npreventive screening and care for women to combat their\nnumber one killers and provides it at no cost. This amendment\neliminates a big barrier of high copayments.” Press release:\nMikulski Puts Women First in Health Care Debate (November 30,\n2009), available at http://www.mikulski.senate.gov/media/\npressrelease/11-30-2009-2.cfm (last visited Nov. 7, 2013); see also\nJessica Arons & Lindsay Rosenthal, Center for American\nProgress, Facts About the Health Insurance Compensation Gap\n(June 2012) (“Even with employer-based coverage, women\nhave higher out-of-pocket medical costs than men.

Abortions themselves have economic costs\n(roughly 20 percent are paid for by Medicaid, for example, see\nid.), and, as important, because many Americans oppose\nabortions on moral grounds, the government has a legitimate\ninterest in reducing the abortion rate.

At\nthe very least, it is unlikely that any such plan will be estab-\nlished in the near future. Putting that aside, we must consider\nthat the entire point of the Women’s Health Amendment to the\nACA was to redress a history of gender-based inequalities in\nhealthcare and health insurance. Carving out from the stan-\ndard insurance coverage mandated by the ACA a type of\nhealthcare that a panel of experts has determined to be vital to\nthe health needs of women, and saying that it must be pro-\nvided for separately, reinforces the very disparities that\nmotivated the Amendment. Additional transaction costs surely\nwill attend the creation of a separate plan devoted to contra-\nception, be it a public option or a set of tax incentives, and the\nsegregation of this form of healthcare from standard insurance\ncoverage will stigmatize both these services and the employees\nwho wish to access them.15 This could hardly be more inconsis-\ntent with the intent underlying the Women’s Health Amend-\nment. Cf. Romer v. Evans, supra, 517 U.S. at 630–31, 116 S. Ct. at\n\n\n15\n    A woman would either have to enroll in a government program\ndedicated to providing contraceptive insurance coverage, establish a\nrelationship with a government-subsidized contraceptive manufacturer, or\nclaim credits for the purchase of contraception on her income tax return.\nEach alternative, aside from imposing extra burdens on her to obtain\ncontraceptive coverage, singles her out as a sexually-active woman who\nwishes to use contraception.\n\f148                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n1626–27 (observing that state constitutional provision foreclos-\ning to gays and lesbians the protections of nondiscrimination\nlaws imposes a unique disability on that class of individuals);\nUnited States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2693 (2013) (reasoning\nthat denying federal recognition to same-sex marriages\nauthorized by state law “impose[s] a disadvantage, a separate\nstatus, and so a stigma on all who enter same-sex marriages\nmade lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States”).\n    Nor can we view the contraception provisions of the ACA\nin isolation. As I have now pointed out several times, the\ncontraception mandate is merely one requirement in a compre-\nhensive set of requirements that the statute imposes on all\nhealth plans, and as I have discussed, there are any number of\nmedical services that health plans cover and medical choices\nthat an insured might make to which a particular employer\nmight object on religious grounds. Logically, the court’s\ndecision to relieve Korte & Luitjohan Contractors and Grote\nIndustries of the contraception mandate cannot be limited to\ncontraception alone. The relevant question, then, is not\nwhether the government feasibly may ensure access to\ncontraceptive care through other means, but whether it may\nfeasibly ensure access to all types of care to which employers\nmight object on religious grounds. The answer to that is\nobvious: it is not feasible to expect the government to establish\na public insurance option that picks up responsibility for the\ncrazy-quilt of individual services that any individual employer\nmight find incompatible with his individual religious beliefs.\n   The Supreme Court remarked in Lee that “[r]eligious beliefs\ncan be accommodated, but there is a point at which accommo-\ndation would ‘radically restrict the operational latitude of the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          149\n\nlegislature.’” 455 U.S. at 259, 102 S. Ct. at 1056 (quoting\nBraunfeld, 366 U.S. at 606, 81 S. Ct. at 1147) (additional citations\nomitted). In a pluralistic society with many religions and even\nmore variants of religious beliefs, it would be impossible to\nmove toward a system of universal healthcare that relies\nsubstantially on employer-sponsored health insurance while\npermitting corporate owners with objections to particular types\nof health services or specific decisions about how to use those\nservices to exclude them from workplace health plans. Even if\nthe government chose instead to pursue universal healthcare\nthrough the means of an entirely publicly-funded, single-payer\nsystem of health insurance, corporate owners as taxpayers\nwould still be facilitating contraception and other healthcare\nservices to which they object. The decision in Lee makes clear\nthat the government would not be required to accommodate\nreligious-based objections where the program in question is\nfunded through general revenues. Indeed, the Kortes’ counsel\nconceded at oral argument that even an employer tax dedi-\ncated to a public program underwriting contraception might\nbe upheld under Lee’s analysis. Taxpayer funding facilitates\ncontraception just as much as any other means of financing.\nGranted, by making the government the middleman, taxpayer\nfinancing separates a corporate owner from his employee’s use\nof contraception. But as I have already pointed out, in the\ncontext of employer-financing of insurance, the corporate form,\nthe health plan’s separate identity, third-party administration\nof the health plan, and the private choices of employees and\ntheir physicians, similarly place corporate owners at a remove\nfrom an employee’s decision to use contraception. Insisting on\nan exception in one setting but not the other makes no sense,\n\f150                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nwhen in both cases corporate owners are lending support to a\ntype of healthcare they find objectionable, but in neither case\nare they in any meaningful sense a party to an individual’s\ndecision to use that service.\n    The exemptions already provided for in the ACA neither\nundermine the compelling nature of the government’s interests\nin broadening Americans’ access to healthcare and ensuring\nthat women have comprehensive healthcare nor do they make\nreligious-based exemptions any more reasonable or feasible.\nFirst, given the financial burdens associated with workplace\nhealth plans, exempting employers with fewer than 50 full-\ntime employees from the obligation to provide insurance is an\nentirely practical, logical, and justifiable accommodation to the\nfinancial needs of small employers, particularly in the first\nphase of a national effort to expand access to healthcare.\nIndividuals who work for those employers, like part-time\nemployees, self-employed individuals, and unemployed\nindividuals are steered to the insurance exchanges established\nunder the ACA, where the government offers subsidies to\nthose who cannot shoulder the full cost of insurance on their\nown. Likewise, grandfathering existing workplace health plans\nfollows a time-honored and common-sensical path in expedit-\ning the implementation of a new, complex, and potentially\nburdensome regulation. Employees participating in those\nplans by definition already have health insurance, so the\naccommodation to employers represented by this exemption\ndoes not unduly burden employees nor undermine the central\ngoal of the legislation. Existing plans will lose the benefit of\nthis exemption as they make major changes to their health\nplans that, inter alia, reduce benefits or increase costs to\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                151\n\nemployees. 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g). There is no reason to think\nthis will take long for most employers,16 given the cost and\ncomplexity of insuring a broad range of healthcare and the\nmarket forces which prompt employers to make such revisions\non a regular basis; and, again, in the absence of such changes,\nemployees remain covered by the grandfathered plans, so the\ngoal of access to health insurance is served. Odds are, many of\nthese grandfathered plans already cover contraceptive care to\nsome degree. See Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive\nServices for Women, 49, 108–09 (as of 2010, 85% of large and 62%\nof small health plans covered contraception) (citing Gary\nClaxton, et al., Kaiser Family Found., ANNUAL SURVEY OF\nEMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS, 186 (2010), available at http://\nkaiser familyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8085.pdf\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013)); see also Guttmacher Institute, STATE\nPOLICIES IN BRIEF, Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives (survey-\ning state laws which require insurers to cover contraceptives),\navailable at http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/\nspib_ICC.pdf (last visited Nov. 7, 2013). Finally, the fact that\nthe ACA contains an exemption for religious\nemployers—which is the sole permanent exemption from the\ncontraception mandate, see Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at *33\n(Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissenting in part)—by no\nmeans demonstrates that an exemption is required for any\n\n\n16\n   The government’s mid-range estimate is that “66 percent of small\nemployer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their\ngrandfather status by the end of 2013.” Interim Final Rules for Group\nHealth Plans and Health Insurance Coverage Relating to Status as a\nGrandfathered Health Plan Under the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act, 75 Fed.

That type of exemption is a\nfeature common to any number of federal statutes, including\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1(a),\nand the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12113(d), 12187; see Gilardi, 2013 WL 5854246, at *33–*34\n(Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissenting in part). And\nthere is a demonstrable difference between a not-for-profit\nemployer whose mission is expressly defined by religious\ngoals and a secular corporation whose business is commerce\nfor profit.\n                                 7.\n   Speaking for the Court in Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery\nProtective Ass’n, Justice O’Connor had this to say about the\nlimited reach of the free exercise clause:\n      However much we might wish that it were other-\n      wise, government simply could not operate if it\n      were required to satisfy every citizen’s religious\n      needs and desires. A broad range of government\n      activities—from social welfare programs to foreign\n      aid to conservation projects—will always be consid-\n      ered essential to the spiritual well-being of some\n      citizens, often on the basis of sincerely held religious\n      beliefs. Others will find the same activities deeply\n      offensive, and perhaps incompatible with their own\n      search for spiritual fulfillment and with the tenets of\n      their religion. The First Amendment must apply to\n      all citizens alike, and it can give to none of them a\n      veto over public programs that do not prohibit the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           153\n\n     free exercise of religion. The Constitution does not,\n     and courts cannot, offer to reconcile the various\n     competing demands on government, many of them\n     rooted in sincere religious belief, that inevitably\n     arise in so diverse a society as ours. That task, to the\n     extent it is feasible, is for the legislatures and other\n     institutions.\n485 U.S. at 452, 108 S. Ct. at 1327 (citation omitted).\n    What the plaintiffs seek accommodation for here is a\ndemand on their conduct, rather than their religious beliefs;\nand the Court has always recognized that “the freedom to act,\neven where the action is in accord with one’s religious convic-\ntions, is not totally free from legislative restrictions.” Braunfeld,\n366 U.S. at 603, 81 S.

Furthermore,\nthe conduct for which the Kortes and the Grotes seek an\nexemption is their conduct as corporate owners in the commer-\ncial world; moreover, it is also conduct that implicates the\nrights of third parties—their employees. The reach of the free\nexercise clause in this setting is quite limited, whereas the\ngovernment’s interests in pursuing the uniform application of\n\f154                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\na religiously-neutral statute promoting the rights of employees\nis quite strong.\n    The court’s holding granting the Kortes and the Grotes,\nalong with their two secular corporations, a religiously-based\nexemption from an insurance mandate represents a dramatic\nturn in free exercise jurisprudence for all of the reasons I have\ndiscussed. It bestows a highly personal right to religious\nexercise on two secular, for-profit corporations that have no\nfacility of thought, conscience, or belief. It deems the religious\nrights of the plaintiffs burdened by the contraceptive mandate\nwithout consideration of the indirect and minimal intrusion on\ntheir exercise of religion. And it disregards the extent to which\nthe exemption from the mandate burdens the rights of the\nplaintiffs’ employees. Finally, it establishes a precedent which\ninvites free-exercise challenges to a host of federal laws by\nsecular corporations which, in reality, have no religious beliefs\nof their own and cannot exercise religion.\n    For all of these reasons I have set forth here, in my prior\ndissents, Korte v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6757353, at *5–*6 (7th Cir.\nDec. 28, 2012), Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F.3d at 855–867, and in the\nwell-reasoned opinions of Judge Reagan, Korte v.

Supp. 2d 943 (S.D.\nInd. 2012), below, I would affirm the district courts’ decisions\nto deny the plaintiffs’ requests for preliminary injunctive relief.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

These consolidated appeals challenge\nthe federal government’s “contraception mandate,” a regula-\ntory requirement imposed by the Department of Health and\nHuman Services (“HHS”) to implement the terms of the 2010\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                       3\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The mandate\nrequires employers to provide coverage for contraception and\nsterilization procedures in their employee health-care plans on\na no-cost-sharing basis. Noncompliance carries heavy financial\npenalties and the risk of enforcement actions.\n    The plaintiffs are two Catholic families and their closely\nheld corporations—one a construction company in Illinois and\nthe other a manufacturing firm in Indiana. The businesses are\nsecular and for profit, but they operate in conformity with the\nfaith commitments of the families that own and manage them.\nThe plaintiffs object for religious reasons to providing the\nmandated coverage. They sued for an exemption on constitu-\ntional and statutory grounds.\n    Center stage at this juncture is the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb et seq.,\nwhich prohibits the federal government from placing substan-\ntial burdens on “a person’s exercise of religion,” id.\n§ 2000bb-1(a), unless it can demonstrate that applying the\nburden is the “least restrictive means of furthering … [a]\ncompelling governmental interest,” id. § 2000bb-1(b). Focusing\nprimarily on their RFRA claims, the plaintiffs in each case\nmoved for a preliminary injunction. The district judges denied\nrelief, holding that the claims were not likely to succeed. We\nprovisionally disagreed and enjoined enforcement of the\nmandate pending appeal.\n    The appeals have now been briefed and argued and are\nready for decision. Plenary review has confirmed our earlier\njudgment. These cases—two among many currently pending\nin courts around the country—raise important questions about\n\f4                                              Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nwhether business owners and their closely held corporations\nmay assert a religious objection to the contraception mandate\nand whether forcing them to provide this coverage substan-\ntially burdens their religious-exercise rights. We hold that the\nplaintiffs—the business owners and their companies—may\nchallenge the mandate. We further hold that compelling them\nto cover these services substantially burdens their religious-\nexercise rights. Under RFRA the government must justify the\nburden under the standard of strict scrutiny. So far it has not\ndone so, and we doubt that it can. Because the RFRA claims are\nvery likely to succeed and the balance of harms favors protect-\ning the religious-liberty rights of the plaintiffs, we reverse and\nremand with instructions to enter preliminary injunctions\nbarring enforcement of the mandate against them.\n\n\n                              I. Background\nA. The Contraception Mandate\n   On March 23, 2010, Congress adopted the Affordable Care\nAct, a sweeping legislative and regulatory overhaul of the\nnation’s health-care system. The Act “aims to increase the\nnumber of Americans covered by health insurance and\ndecrease the cost of health care.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v.\nSebelius (“NFIB”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"809122\"><a href=\"/opinion/809122/national-federation-of-independent-business-v-sebelius/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2580 (2012). One feature of\nthe Act is a requirement that employee health-care plans\ngoverned by ERISA1 provide certain minimum levels of\ncoverage to plan participants and beneficiaries. See 29 U.S.C.\n\n\n1\n    The Employment Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001 et seq.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                      5\n\n§ 1185d (applying the requirements of part A of Title XXVII of\nthe Public Health Services Act as amended by the Affordable\nCare Act to ERISA-governed group health plans). More\nspecifically, the Affordable Care Act establishes a general\nrequirement that employer-sponsored group health-care plans\ncover “preventive care and screenings” for women on a\nno-cost-sharing basis; Congress instructed HHS to fill in the\ndetails:\n       A group health plan and a health insurance\n       issuer offering group or individual health insur-\n       ance coverage shall, at a minimum provide\n       coverage for and shall not impose any cost\n       sharing requirements for—\n          …\n          (4) with respect to women, such addi-\n          tional preventive care and screenings not\n          described in paragraph (1) as provided\n          for in comprehensive guidelines sup-\n          ported by the Health Resources and Ser-\n          vices Administration [“HRSA,” an agency\n          within HHS] for purposes of this para-\n          graph.\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a); see also 29 U.S.C. § 1185d.\n   Before promulgating regulations pursuant to this statutory\ndirective, the HRSA sought advice from the Institute of\nMedicine at the National Academy of Science about what\nservices to include in the preventive-care mandate. Based on\nthe Institute’s recommendations, the HRSA issued\n\f6                                                 Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ncomprehensive guidelines requiring coverage of (among other\nthings) “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration [“FDA”] ap-\nproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and\npatient education and counseling for all women with reproduc-\ntive capacity.” Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women’s Preven-\ntive Services Guidelines: Affordable Care Act Expands Prevention\nCoverage for Women’s Health and Well-Being, http://www.hrsa.\ngov/womensguidelines/ (last visited Nov. 7, 2013). These\ninclude oral contraceptives (“the pill”), barrier methods,\nimplants and injections, emergency oral contraceptives\n(“Plan B” and “Ella”), and intrauterine devices.2 On\nFebruary 15, 2012, HHS published final regulations incorporat-\ning the HRSA guidelines. See Group Health Plans and Health\nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services,\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012). The agency made the\nmandate effective in the first plan year on or after August 1,\n2012.3 See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(b)(1).\n\n\n\n2\n  See FDA, B IR TH C O N TRO L : M ED IC IN ES TO H ELP Y O U , http://www.fda.gov/\nForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/ucm313215.htm\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n\n3\n  In July the Treasury Department announced a one-year delay in the\nimplementation of the so-called employer mandate. See M ark J. M azur,\nContinuing to Implement the ACA in a Careful, Thoughtful Manner, T REA SU RY\nN O TES (July 2, 2013), http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/pages/\ncontinuing-to-implement-the-aca-in-a-careful-thoughtful-manner-.aspx. The\nannouncement did not mention the contraception mandate, which was\nalready in effect. We assume that the postponement of the employer\nmandate has no effect on the contraception mandate; the government has\nnot advised otherwise.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        7\n\n    Noncompliance with the contraception mandate is pun-\nished by steep financial penalties and other civil remedies. For\nexample, failure to provide the mandated coverage brings a tax\npenalty of $100 per day per employee—$36,500 per year per\nemployee. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(a), (b)(1). If an employer\ndiscontinues offering a health plan altogether, the penalty is\n$2,000 per year per employee. See id. § 4980H(a), (c). In addi-\ntion, noncomplying employers face potential enforcement\nactions by the Secretary of Labor and plan participants and\nbeneficiaries under ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d.\n    Like many of the other employer mandates in the Afford-\nable Care Act, the contraception mandate applies to employers\nwith 50 or more full-time employees. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H.\nSmaller employers—those with fewer than 50 full-time\nemployees—are not required to provide a health plan for their\nemployees and apparently are not subject to the coverage\nminimums, including the contraception mandate. See id. We\nsay “apparently” because it’s not entirely clear that the man-\ndate is categorically inapplicable to small employers; the\ngovernment takes the position that if a small employer not\notherwise required to provide an employee health-care plan\nnonetheless chooses to do so, the regulatory scheme requires\ninclusion of the mandated contraception coverage.\n    Health plans in existence when the Act was adopted are\n“grandfathered” and do not need to comply with the coverage\nminimums—including the contraception mandate—unless the\nplan sponsor makes certain changes to the terms of the plan.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 18011. Grandfathering is a transitional measure;\nthis category will shrink as employer-based plans existing\n\f8                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nprior to March 23, 2010, undergo changes. The government\nestimates that the number of plans in grandfathered status will\ndwindle fairly rapidly as older health-care plans are updated\nand renewed. See Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans\nand Health Insurance Coverage Relating to Status as a\nGrandfathered Health Plan, 75 Fed. Reg. 34,538, 34,552\n(June 17, 2010).\n   Finally, some religious employers are exempt from the\ncontraception mandate, see 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A), but\n“religious employer” was initially defined quite narrowly:\n       [A] “religious employer” [for purposes of an\n       exemption from the contraception mandate] is an\n       organization that meets all of the following\n       criteria:\n          (1) The inculcation of religious values is\n          the purpose of the organization.\n          (2) The organization primarily employs\n          persons who share the religious tenets of\n          the organization.\n          (3) The organization serves primarily\n          persons who share the religious tenets of\n          the organization.\n          (4) The organization is a nonprofit organi-\n          zation as described in section 6033(a)(1)\n          and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the\n          Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amend-\n          ed [covering the tax status of churches\n          and their integrated auxiliaries,\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                         9\n\n             conventions or associations of churches,\n             and the exclusively religious activities of\n             religious orders].\nId. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B).\n\n\nB. The Religious-Employer Controversy\n    The contraception mandate was instantly controversial.4\nThe religious-employer exemption did not leave room for\nconscientious religious objectors other than houses of worship,\ntheir integrated affiliate organizations, and religious orders\nacting as such. In other words, the definition of “religious\nemployer” was so circumscribed that it left out religious\ncolleges and universities; religious hospitals and clinics; reli-\ngious charities and social-service organizations; other faith-\nbased nonprofits; and for-profit, closely held businesses\nmanaged in accordance with a religious mission or creed.\n    HHS responded to the outcry from these left-out employers\nby establishing a temporary “safe harbor” for certain nonprofit\nreligious organizations not covered by the exemption. See\nGroup Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\nCoverage of Preventive Services, 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728. Eventu-\nally the agency proposed a revised definition of “religious\nemployer” and an “accommodation” of a broader class of\n\n4\n The mandate prompted a proliferation of lawsuits by employers seeking\nexemptions on religious-liberty grounds. By one count more than 70 suits\nchallenging the mandate are currently pending. See The Becket Fund for\nReligious Liberty, HHS Mandate Information Central, T H E B EC KET F UN D .O RG ,\nhttp://www.becketfund.org/hhsinformationcentral.\n\f10                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nnonprofit religious organizations with objections to the\nmandated coverage. The new rules were proposed in final\nform on February 6, 2013, see Coverage of Certain Preventive\nServices, 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, published in final form on July 2,\n2013, see 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, and became effective August 1,\n2013, see id.\n    As revised, the exemption drops the first three require-\nments of the earlier definition of “religious employer,” but the\nchange is not intended to alter the exemption’s scope. “Reli-\ngious employer” is now defined as “an organization that is\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to\nin section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The cross-\nreference is the tax exemption for churches and their integrated\nauxiliaries, conventions or associations of churches, and the\nexclusively religious activities of religious orders. See 26 U.S.C.\n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). HHS has explained that “the simplified\nand clarified definition of religious employer does not expand\nthe universe of religious employers that qualify for the\nexemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 final\nregulations.” Coverage of Certain Preventive Services, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 39,874. In other words, the exemption remains limited\nto “[h]ouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.” Id.\n    Under the revised rule, certain nonprofit religiously\naffiliated employers may receive an “accommoda-\ntion”—essentially, an attempted workaround whereby the\nobjecting employer gives notice to its insurance carrier and the\ninsurer issues a separate policy with the mandated coverage.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                       11\n\nThe accommodation is limited to organizations that meet the\nfollowing requirements:\n      (1) The organization opposes providing coverage\n      for some or all of any contraceptive services\n      required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n      on account of religious objections.\n      (2) The organization operates as a nonprofit\n      entity.\n      (3) The organization holds itself out as a religious\n      organization.\n      (4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and\n      manner specified by the Secretary, that it satisfies\n      the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of\n      this section … .\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). Notably for our purposes, neither the\nfinal religious-employer exemption nor the accommodation\napplies to for-profit employers with conscientious religious\nobjections to providing the mandated coverage.\n\n\nC.

The com-\npany provides a health-care plan for the remaining 20 or so\n\f12                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nnonunion employees. Together, Cyril and Jane own about 87%\nof the stock of the corporation and are its only directors. Cyril\nis the president and Jane is the secretary of the company. As\nofficers and directors, they set all company policy.\n    The Kortes are Catholic and follow the teachings of the\nCatholic Church regarding the sanctity of human life from\nconception to natural death and the moral wrongfulness of\nabortion, sterilization, and the use of abortifacient drugs and\nartificial means of contraception. They seek to manage their\ncompany in accordance with their faith commitments. In\nAugust 2012 when the contraception mandate was finalized,\nthe Kortes discovered that their then-existing health plan\ncovered sterilization and contraception—coverage that they\ndid not realize they were carrying. Because providing this\ncoverage conflicts with their religious convictions, they began\nto investigate alternative health-care plans with the intention\nof terminating their existing plan and substituting one that\nconforms to the requirements of their faith.\n    The contraception mandate stood in their way. The com-\npany’s existing health-care plan was set to renew on January 1,\n2013, triggering the requirements of the mandate and the large\nfinancial penalties and possible enforcement actions if they did\nnot comply. As the Kortes understand their religious obliga-\ntions, providing the mandated coverage would facilitate a\ngrave moral wrong. On the other hand, following the teachings\nof their faith and refusing to comply would financially devas-\ntate K & L Contractors and the Kortes as its owners; at $100 per\nday per employee, the monetary penalties would total $730,000\nper year.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                 13\n\n    The Kortes responded to the conflict between their legal\nand religious duties in two ways. First, they promulgated\nethical guidelines for K & L Contractors memorializing the\nfaith-informed moral limitations on the company’s provision\nof health-care benefits, including its inability to provide\ninsurance coverage for abortion, abortifacient drugs, artificial\ncontraception, and sterilization.5 Second, the Kortes and K & L\n\n\n\n5\n    The company’s ethical guidelines are as follows:\n\n              1. As adherents of the Catholic faith, we hold to the\n          teachings of the Catholic Church regarding the sanctity of\n          human life from conception to natural death. We believe\n          that actions intended to terminate an innocent human life\n          by abortion, including abortion-inducing drugs, are\n          gravely sinful. We also adhere to the Catholic Church’s\n          teaching regarding the immorality of artificial means of\n          contraception and sterilization.\n\n              2. As equal shareholders who together own a control-\n          ling interest in Korte & Luitjohan Contractors, Inc., we\n          wish to conduct the business … in a manner that does not\n          violate our religious faith and values.\n\n               3. Accordingly, we and Korte & Luitjohan Contractors,\n          Inc. cannot arrange for, pay for, provide, facilitate, or\n          otherwise support employee health plan coverage for\n          contraceptives, sterilization, abortion, abortion-inducing\n          drugs, or related education and counseling, except in the\n          limited circum stances where a physician certifies that\n          certain sterilization procedures or drugs commonly used\n          as contraceptives are being prescribed with the intent to\n          treat certain medical conditions, not with the intent to\n          prevent or terminate pregnancy, without violating our\n          religious beliefs.\n\f14                                             Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nContractors filed suit in the Southern District of Illinois for a\nreligious exemption from the mandate.\n\n\n     2. The Grotes and Grote Industries\n   The Grote Family owns and manages Grote Industries, Inc.,\na manufacturer of vehicle safety systems headquartered in\nMadison, Indiana.6 Like the Kortes, the members of the Grote\nFamily are Catholic and they manage Grote Industries in\naccordance with their religious commitments, including\nCatholic moral teaching regarding the sanctity of human life\nand the wrongfulness of abortion, abortifacient drugs, artificial\ncontraception, and sterilization.\n   Grote Industries has 1,148 full-time employees at various\nlocations, including 464 in the United States. The company\nprovides a health-care plan that is self-insured and renews\nannually on the first of every year. Consistent with the Grote\nFamily’s Catholic faith, prior to January 1, 2013, the employee\nhealth-care plan did not cover contraception and sterilization\n\n\n6\n  The Grote Family includes individual plaintiffs William D. Grote, III;\nWilliam Dominic Grote, IV; Walter F. Grote, Jr.; M ichael R. Grote;\nW. Frederick Grote, III; and John R. Grote. Together with other family\nmembers not named as plaintiffs, they fully own Grote Industries, Inc.,\nwhich in turn is the managing mem ber of Grote Industries, LLC, the\nmanufacturing firm. For ease of reference, we refer to the two companies\nas “Grote Industries.” William D. Grote, III is Chairman and CEO; William\nDominic Grote, IV is President and Chief Operating Officer; Walter F.\nGrote, Jr. is a board member; M ichael R. Grote is the A ssistant Treasurer;\nW. Frederick Grote, III is the Secretary; and John R. Grote is the A ssistant\nSecretary.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        15\n\nprocedures. Starting on that date, however, the requirements\nof the contraception mandate kicked in.\n    Like the Kortes and K & L Contractors, the Grote Family\nand Grote Industries object on religious grounds to providing\ncoverage for contraception, abortion-inducing drugs, and\nsterilization procedures. But with its large full-time workforce,\nthe company faced an annual penalty of almost $17 million if\nit did not comply with the mandate. The Grotes and Grote\nIndustries filed suit in the Southern District of Indiana for a\nreligious exemption from the mandate.\n\n\nD. The Litigation\n    Both complaints name the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and\nthe Treasury as defendants and seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief against the contraception mandate. Both sets of plaintiffs\nallege that the mandate violates their rights under RFRA; the\nFree Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the Free\nSpeech Clause of the First Amendment; and the Administrative\nProcedure Act. The Grote complaint adds a due-process claim.\nIn both cases the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction\nthe day after filing suit, focusing primarily though not exclu-\nsively on their RFRA claims.\n    In Korte the district court in Southern Illinois denied the\nmotion, concluding that the Kortes and K & L Contractors had\nnot demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.\nRegarding the RFRA claim in particular, the judge held that\nalthough the Kortes and K & L Contractors are “persons”\nwithin the meaning of RFRA and may invoke the statute’s\n\f16                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nprotection, the contraception mandate does not substantially\nburden their religious-exercise rights. This is so, the judge held,\nbecause the link between the mandated coverage and the acts\ncondemned by the Kortes’ religion is too attenuated. In other\nwords, the burden on religious exercise is insubstantial because\nthe compelled provision of contraception coverage is too far\nremoved from the independent decisions by plan participants\nand beneficiaries to use contraception. The court also found the\nfree-exercise claim unlikely to succeed.\n    In Grote the district court in Southern Indiana likewise\ndenied the motion, also concluding that the plaintiffs were not\nlikely to succeed on their RFRA claim. Unlike her colleague in\nSouthern Illinois, however, the Indiana judge doubted that a\nsecular, for-profit corporation like Grote Industries has\nreligious-exercise rights under RFRA. The judge did not decide\nthe question, however, concluding instead that any burden on\nthe Grotes or Grote Industries is insignificant because too many\nindependent decisions separate the provision of the mandated\ncoverage and the practices deemed immoral by the Catholic\nChurch. The court also found the constitutional and Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act claims unlikely to succeed.\n    The case from Southern Illinois reached us first, just before\nthe January 1, 2013 deadline for compliance with the mandate.\nThe plaintiffs sought an injunction pending appeal. In a brief\norder and based on our early review of the merits, we provi-\nsionally held that the RFRA claim is likely to succeed and the\nbalance of harms weighs in favor of the religious-liberty rights\nof the plaintiffs.

Id. at *5–6 (Rovner, J., dissenting).\n    On the strength of our provisional decision in Korte, the\nGrotes and Grote Industries returned to the district court in\nSouthern Indiana and asked for reconsideration. The judge\nacknowledged the similarity between the two cases but\ndeclined to reconsider because our order in Korte had no\nprecedential effect.

Analysis\n    These cases come to us on appeals from orders denying\npreliminary injunctive relief. See 28 U.S.C. § 1291. To win a\npreliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate\nthat (1) it has no adequate remedy at law and will suffer\nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied; and\n(2) there is some likelihood of success on the merits of the\nclaim. See Ezell v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (7th Cir.\n2011). If the moving party meets this threshold burden, the\ncourt weighs the competing harms to the parties if an injunc-\ntion is granted or denied and also considers the public interest.\nSee Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v.

State\nDep’t of Health, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972 (7th Cir. 2012); Ezell, 651 F.3d\nat 694. This equitable balancing proceeds on a sliding-scale\nanalysis; the greater the likelihood of success on the merits, the\nless heavily the balance of harms must tip in the moving\nparty’s favor. See Planned Parenthood, 699 F.3d at 972. The aim\nis to minimize the costs of a wrong decision. See Stuller, Inc. v.\nSteak N Shake Enters., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (7th Cir. 2012). Our\nreview proceeds on a split standard of review: We review legal\nconclusions de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and\nequitable balancing for abuse of discretion. Ezell, 651 F.3d at\n694.\n    Here, the analysis begins and ends with the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of the RFRA claim. On the strength of\nthat claim alone, preliminary injunctive relief is warranted;\nthere is no need to remand for the district courts to weigh the\ninjunction equities. Although the claim is statutory, RFRA\nprotects First Amendment free-exercise rights, and “in First\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          19\n\nAmendment cases, ‘the likelihood of success on the merits will\noften be the determinative factor.’ ” ACLU of Ill. v.

The government hasn’t addressed equita-\nble balancing, conceding the point to the plaintiffs. So the\nappeals turn entirely on whether the plaintiffs’ RFRA claims\nare likely to succeed.\n    Two legal questions are contested: (1) is a secular, for-profit\ncorporation a “person” under RFRA; and (2) does the contra-\nception mandate substantially burden the religious-exercise\nrights of any of the plaintiffs, individual or corporate? If the\nanswer to these questions is “yes,” the government must\ndischarge its burden of justifying the mandate under strict\nscrutiny. We conclude as follows: The corporate plaintiffs are\n“persons” under RFRA and may invoke the statute’s protec-\ntion; the contraception mandate substantially burdens the\nreligious-exercise rights of all of the plaintiffs; and the govern-\nment has not carried its burden under strict scrutiny.\n   First, however, we clear away some possible jurisdictional\nobjections.\n\f20                                               Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n    Although the government never challenged jurisdiction,\neither in the district court or here, we have an independent\nobligation to satisfy ourselves that jurisdiction is secure before\nproceeding to the merits.

There are two arguable\njurisdictional issues lurking here: standing and the\nAnti-Injunction Act.7\n\n\n\n\n7\n Just before oral argument, the government filed a “Notice of Supplemental\nBriefing on Jurisdictional Issues,” drawing our attention to a brief it filed\nin response to a jurisdictional order from the Tenth Circuit in Hobby Lobby.\nThe plaintiffs moved to strike this “notice.” Although the government’s\napproach is unorthodox, we have reviewed its supplemental brief in the\nTenth Circuit case. In it the government argued that the corporate plaintiffs\nin Hobby Lobby have standing but the owners of the corporations do not.\nSupplemental Brief for Appellees at 3–9, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.

See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4). The statutory component of the mandate\nimposes a general preventive-care requirement on all group\nhealth-care plans (including employer-sponsored plans) and\nissuers of individual and group health-insurance policies. See\nid. The mandate is situated in the public-welfare title of the\nCode of Federal Regulations—more specifically, in the part\ncontaining regulations governing the group and individual\nhealth-insurance markets. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130. The mandate\nis backed by stiff tax penalties against employers that fail to\ncomply, see 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D, 4980H, but there are additional\nconsequences for noncompliance, including ERISA enforce-\nment actions by the Secretary of Labor and plan participants\nand beneficiaries, see 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d. Noncompliant\nhealth insurers are subject to the enforcement authority of the\nSecretary of HHS as well as the states in which they operate.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22.\n    It should be clear from this description that the contracep-\ntion mandate is not structured as a predicate to the imposition\nof a tax but is instead an independent regulatory mandate.\nThese lawsuits target the mandate itself.\n    It is true that the complaints name the Treasury Secretary\nas a defendant in addition to the Secretaries of HHS and Labor,\nand the plaintiffs have asked the court to enjoin the enforce-\nment of the mandate by any of them.

It is not.\n   We acknowledge that Congress used the term “tax” in the\ntext of § 4980D (and also in § 4980H, the alternative “shared\nresponsibility payment” for employers that drop or otherwise\ngo without an employee health-care plan). The language\nCongress uses to describe an exaction is ordinarily the best\nevidence of whether it meant the Anti-Injunction Act to apply.\nSee NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2582–83. But Congress also called the\npayment specified in § 4980D a “penalty.” The statute was\noriginally adopted as part of the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat.\n1936, and was titled “Penalty on Failure to Meet Certain Group\nHealth Plan Requirements,” see id. § 402, 110 Stat. 1936, 2084\n\f28                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n(emphasis added). The language Congress used is contradic-\ntory and thus inconclusive.\n    Other features of § 4980D confirm that the provision is\nmeant to penalize employers for noncompliance with the\nvarious mandates in the Affordable Care Act and its imple-\nmenting regulations. The sheer size of the required payment\nfairly screams “penalty.” Any failure to provide the mandated\nminimum coverage—no matter how significant the deviation—\ncosts the employer a whopping $100 per day per employee. See\n26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b). Exacting such a high price for noncompli-\nance suggests that the congressional objective is punitive. See\nEmpress Casino Joliet Corp. v.

See NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at\n2595 (“[S]cienter requirements are typical of punitive statutes,\nbecause Congress often wishes to punish only those who\nintentionally break the law.”); Bailey v.

Finally, the\n$100-per-day-per-employee formula is repeated verbatim in\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(ii), which authorizes the Secretary\nof HHS to impose the same sort of penalty on noncompliant\ninsurers that § 4980D(b)(1) imposes on noncompliant employ-\ners.\n    Together, these aspects of the regulatory scheme all point\nin the same direction: Section 4980D is a penalty for noncom-\npliance with the regulatory mandates on employer-based\nhealth-care plans. It is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-\nInjunction Act. By parallel reasoning the same is true of the\nalternative payment in § 4980H. This conclusion comports with\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in NFIB, which held that the\nAffordable Care Act’s “shared responsibility payment” for\nnoncompliance with the individual insurance mandate is not\na tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. 132 S.

Verner,\n374 U.S. at 406–07, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 220–21,\nwhich applied strict scrutiny to laws that had the effect of\nburdening religious practices. Under Sherbert and Yoder, a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise—even one arising\nfrom the application of a religion-neutral, generally applicable\nlaw—was unconstitutional unless the government could show\nthat the burden was the least restrictive means of furthering a\ncompelling public interest. Smith changed that understanding\nof the free-exercise right. The Court held that neutral laws of\ngeneral applicability need only satisfy the basic test for\nrationality that applies to all laws; if a law incidentally burdens\nthe exercise of religion, the Constitution does not require an\nexemption. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878–79, 888–90.\n    Congress responded to this shift in free-exercise doctrine by\nenacting RFRA, “a statutory rule comparable to the constitu-\ntional rule rejected in Smith.” O Centro Espirita, 546 U.S. at 424;\nsee also Cutter v.

RFRA’s statement of purpose\nexplicitly reaffirms our national commitment to the “free\nexercise of religion as an unalienable right,” id. § 2000bb(a)(1),\nexisting prior to and above ordinary law. RFRA is structured\nas a “sweeping ‘super-statute,’ cutting across all other federal\nstatutes (now and future, unless specifically exempted) and\nmodifying their reach.” Michael Stokes Paulsen, A RFRA Runs\nThrough It: Religious Freedom and the U.S. Code, 56 MONT. L. REV .\n249, 253 (1995). It is “both a rule of interpretation” and “an\nexercise of general legislative supervision over federal agen-\ncies, enacted pursuant to each of the federal powers that gives\nrise to legislation or agencies in the first place.” Douglas\nLaycock & Oliver S. Thomas, Interpreting the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, 73 TEX. L. REV . 209, 211 (1994); see also Nicholas\nQuinn Rosenkranz, Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation,\n115 HARV . L. REV . 2085, 2110 (2002) (explaining the function of\ngenerally applicable statutory rules of interpretation).\n    In short, RFRA operates as a kind of utility remedy for the\ninevitable clashes between religious freedom and the realities\nof the modern welfare state, which regulates pervasively and\ntouches nearly every aspect of social and economic life. See\nThomas C. Berg, What Hath Congress Wrought? An Interpretative\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           35\n\nGuide to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 39 VILL. L. REV . 1,\n25–26 (1994). Judges are assigned the task of mediating these\nconflicts. RFRA makes that role clear, “mandating consider-\nation, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to rules\nof general applicability.” O Centro Espirita, 546 U.S. at 436\n(internal quotation marks and alteration marks omitted).\nCongress has instructed the judiciary to hold the entire federal\nregulatory apparatus to the standard of Sherbert, unless a\nstatute specifically says otherwise.\n\n\n                                * * *\n    Once a RFRA claimant makes a prima facie case that the\napplication of a law or regulation substantially burdens his\nreligious practice, the burden shifts to the government to\njustify the burden under strict scrutiny. O Centro Espirita,\n546 U.S. at 428. “Congress’s express decision to legislate the\ncompelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should\nbe adjudicated in the same manner as constitutionally man-\ndated applications of the test … .” Id. at 430. Thus, in RFRA liti-\ngation, as in First Amendment litigation, “the burdens at the\npreliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.” Id. at\n429.\n\n\n   1. For-Profit Corporations as RFRA “Persons”\n   RFRA’s general rule prohibits the federal government from\nplacing substantial burdens on “a person’s exercise of religion”\nabsent compelling justification, and only then if the burden is\nthe least restrictive means of furthering the compelling\n\f36                                                Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ngovernmental objective. As originally enacted, RFRA defined\n“exercise of religion” as “the exercise of religion under the First\nAmendment to the Constitution.” Pub. L. No. 103-141, § 5,\n107 Stat. 1488, 1489 (1993). Congress amended the definition in\n2000 with the enactment of the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc\net seq., making the definitions in the two statutes uniform. The\nterm “exercise of religion” in RFRA is now defined by cross-\nreference to the definition of “religious exercise” in RLUIPA:\n“The term ‘religious exercise’ includes any exercise of religion,\nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of\nreligious belief.” Id. §§ 2000cc-5(7)(A), 2000bb-2(4). This defini-\ntion is undeniably very broad, so the term “exercise of reli-\ngion” should be understood in a generous sense.\n    RFRA does not define “person.” This brings the Dictionary\nAct into play.14 The definition there expressly includes corpora-\ntions: “In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nunless the context indicates otherwise[,] … the word[]\n‘person’ … include[s] corporations, companies, associations,\nfirms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as\nwell as individuals … .” 1 U.S.C. § 1 (emphasis added). By\noperation of this omnibus definition, the term “person” in\nRFRA includes corporations, unless the context indicates\notherwise.\n\n\n14\n  The Dictionary Act is notable for its breadth. It contains general defini-\ntions and rules of construction that apply across the United States Code,\nprospectively and retrospectively unless otherwise indicated.

The inquiry basically asks whether the\ndefinition in the Dictionary Act is a “poor fit” with the text of\nthe statute:\n       Where a court needs help is in the awkward case\n       where Congress provides no particular defini-\n       tion, but the definition in 1 U.S.C. § 1 seems not\n       to fit. There it is that the qualification “unless the\n       context indicates otherwise” has a real job to do,\n       in excusing the court from forcing a square peg\n       into a round hole.\n           The point at which the indication of particu-\n       lar meaning becomes insistent enough to excuse\n       the poor fit is of course a matter of judgment … .\nId. at 200.\n    Nothing in RFRA suggests that the Dictionary Act’s\ndefinition of “person” is a “poor fit” with the statutory scheme.\nTo use the Supreme Court’s colloquialism, including corpora-\ntions in the universe of “persons” with rights under RFRA is\nnot like “forcing a square peg into a round hole.” Id. A corpo-\nration is just a special form of organizational association. No\none doubts that organizational associations can engage in\nreligious practice.

Nor can it be\nfound in the statute’s broader contextual purpose, assuming\nwe were to venture beyond the textual inquiry envisioned by\nthe Supreme Court for resolving Dictionary Act questions. The\ngovernment argues that a religious/nonprofit limitation can be\nfound by implication from judicial interpretations of two\nunrelated employment-discrimination statutes—namely,\nTitle VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)—\nboth of which contain targeted exemptions for religious\nemployers. We are not convinced.\n    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits\nemployment discrimination on the basis of religion. See\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. Certain religious employers are exempt\nfrom this part of Title VII and may take religion into account in\nmaking employment decisions: “This subchapter shall not\napply … to a religious corporation, association, educational\ninstitution, or society with respect to the employment of\nindividuals of a particular religion … .” Id. § 2000e-1(a). The\nADA, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis\nof disability, contains a similar exemption for religious employ-\ners. See id. § 12113(d)(1)–(2). Some lower courts have developed\nmultifactor tests to determine when Title VII’s religious-\nemployer exemption applies; the nonprofit status of the\nemployer is considered a relevant factor.

Relying on this line of\ncases, the government argues that Congress “carried forward”\na nonprofit limitation when it enacted RFRA.\n    Never mind that much of this caselaw postdates the\nenactment of RFRA. The more important point is that a\nhandful of lower-court decisions applying an interpretive gloss\nto Title VII’s religious-employer exemption hardly implies that\nCongress meant to limit RFRA in the same way. As the Tenth\nCircuit noted in Hobby Lobby, the government asks us to infer\nfrom congressional silence that a “similar narrowing construc-\ntion[] should be imported into” RFRA. 723 F.3d at 1130. The\nTenth Circuit found this argument “strained,” id., and so do\nwe. If Congress intended a nonprofit limitation in RFRA,\nsurely there would be some hint of it in the statutory text.\n    The government also relies on the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).

The case does not advance the government’s\nposition here.\n    To the contrary, the church labor-relations cases illuminate\na fundamental flaw in the government’s argument—its failure\nto recognize that RFRA protects religious liberty more broadly\nthan the religious-employer exemptions in Title VII and the\nADA. To see how, it’s helpful to return to some first principles\nof free-exercise doctrine.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                            41\n\n    It’s well understood that the Free Exercise Clause protects\n“first and foremost, the right to believe and profess,” but also\nthe right to engage in religiously motivated conduct.

Laycock, Towards\na General Theory of the Religion Clauses, supra, at 1389. This\ndimension of religious liberty has a foothold in both Religion\nClauses, see Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 702, and is perhaps best\nunderstood as marking a boundary between two separate\npolities, the secular and the religious, and acknowledging the\nprerogatives of each in its own sphere. For example, in\nMilivojevich, a church-property case, the Court explained that\n\f44                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nthe First Amendment “permit[s] hierarchical religious organi-\nzations to establish their own rules and regulations for internal\ndiscipline and government, and to create tribunals for adjudi-\ncating disputes over these matters.” 426 U.S. at 724. When a\nchurch tribunal or other religious authority decides an internal\ndispute, “the Constitution requires … civil courts [to] accept\nth[at] decision[] as binding.” Id. at 725; see also Richard W.\nGarnett, A Hands-Off Approach to Religious Doctrine: What Are\nWe Talking About?, 84 NOTRE DAME L. REV . 837, 861 (2009)\n(explaining that the church-autonomy doctrine recognizes that\nsecular tribunals “lack the power to answer some ques-\ntions—religious questions—whose resolution is, under an\nappropriately pluralistic political theory, left to other institu-\ntions”).\n    Two related principles are at work in these cases. First, civil\nauthorities have no say over matters of religious governance;\nand second, secular judges must defer to ecclesiastical authori-\nties on questions properly within their domain. These limita-\ntions arise from the justification for the different aspects of\nreligious liberty secured by the Religion Clauses. See Douglas\nLaycock, Church Autonomy Revisited, 7 GEO . J.L. & PUB . POL ’Y\n253, 260–65 (2009). As the Supreme Court explained in\nHosanna-Tabor:\n       Requiring a church to accept or retain an un-\n       wanted minister, or punishing a church for\n       failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere\n       employment decision. Such action interferes with\n       the internal governance of the church, depriving\n       the church of control over the selection of those\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                         45\n\n         who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an\n         unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free\n         Exercise Clause, which protects a religious\n         group’s right to shape its own faith and mission\n         through its appointments. According the state\n         the power to determine which individuals will\n         minister to the faithful also violates the Establish-\n         ment Clause, which prohibits governmental\n         involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\n132 S. Ct. at 706.\n    In this way the Religion Clauses work together to protect\nthe institutional freedom of the church “for itself, and not\nsimply as a proxy for the religious-liberty rights of individu-\nals,” in light of the Constitution’s ordering of the relationship\nbetween religion and government.

By their terms the exemptions are limited to reli-\ngiously affiliated employers, a limitation that makes sense in\nlight of the rationale for the rule. The exemption is categorical,\nnot contingent; there is no balancing of competing interests,\npublic or private. In other words, where it applies, the church-\nautonomy principle operates as a complete immunity, or very\nnearly so. Such a strong hands-off principle isn’t justified for\norganizational associations that are not religiously affiliated.\n    In contrast, the judicial remedy in RFRA is both broader\nand more flexible. It covers religious organizations as such, but\nit does not stop there. The remedy is available to any sincere\nreligious objector—individuals and organizations alike—and\nits organizational applications are not limited to religiously\naffiliated organizations. The exemption is comprehensive in\nthat it applies across the United States Code and Code of\nFederal Regulations and restrains the conduct of all federal\nofficials. But it can be overridden by a sufficiently strong\ngovernmental interest.\n    For these reasons, the cases interpreting the Title VII and\nADA exemptions do not shed light on the scope of the RFRA\nexemption. The government’s proposed exclusion of secular,\nfor-profit corporations finds no support in the text or relevant\ncontext of RFRA or any related statute.\n\n\n\n\n16\n  (...continued)\nthe Ministerial Exemption, 160 U. P A . L. R EV . PENN U M BRA 289 (2012).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          47\n\n                              * * *\n     That’s enough to resolve the matter, but it’s worth briefly\nexploring whether RFRA’s animating purpose provides a clue\nthat it is not meant to apply to secular, for-profit corporations.\nCongress was clear that RFRA codifies pre-Smith free-exercise\njurisprudence—in particular, the rule of Sherbert and Yoder—so\nif the Supreme Court’s pre-Smith free-exercise cases categori-\ncally excluded secular, for-profit corporations, then perhaps\nRFRA should be understood that way, too.\n    We begin by reiterating two doctrinal points we made a\nmoment ago: (1) the Free Exercise Clause protects not just\nbelief and profession but also religiously motivated conduct;\nand (2) individuals and organizations—whether incorporated\nor not—can exercise religion. It’s common ground that\nnonprofit religious corporations exercise religion in the sense\nthat their activities are religiously motivated. So unless there is\nsomething disabling about mixing profit-seeking and religious\npractice, it follows that a faith-based, for-profit corporation can\nclaim free-exercise protection to the extent that an aspect of its\nconduct is religiously motivated.\n    We acknowledge the novelty of the question; the Supreme\nCourt has never considered whether a for-profit corporation\nmay assert a free-exercise claim. See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.\nSebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (Sotomayor, Circuit Justice 2012)\n(“This Court has not previously addressed similar RFRA or\nfree exercise claims brought by closely held for-profit corpora-\ntions and their controlling shareholders … .”). But the Court\nhas on several occasions addressed the free-exercise rights of\nindividuals engaged in commercial or profit-making activity.\n\f48                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    We have already mentioned Thomas and Sherbert, both of\nwhich involved claimants who lost their jobs for refusing to\nwork on days or in ways that would violate their faith. See\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 709–11; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 399–400. The\ncases challenged the denial of unemployment compensation\nbenefits, but the background facts involved the loss of remu-\nnerative employment at a foundry and a mill. In other words,\nEddie Thomas and Adell Sherbert were working for money yet\nthey retained their free-exercise rights and were permitted to\nassert them against the denial of unemployment benefits. The\nCourt held that Thomas and Sherbert could not be compelled\nto choose between their livelihoods and their faith. See Thomas,\n450 U.S. at 717 (“Here, as in Sherbert, the employee was put to\na choice between fidelity to religious belief or cessation of\nwork; the coercive impact on Thomas is indistinguishable from\nSherbert … .”); Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404 (“The [unemployment\ncompensation] ruling forces [Adell Sherbert] to choose\nbetween following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting\nbenefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts\nof her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand.”). If\nthe government is correct that entering the marketplace and\nearning money forfeits free-exercise rights, then Thomas and\nSherbert would have been decided differently.\n    In Braunfeld v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106251\"><a href=\"/opinion/106251/braunfeld-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600–02 (1961), Jewish\nmerchants brought a free-exercise challenge against Pennsylva-\nnia’s Sunday-closing law, which put them at a competitive\ndisadvantage based on their Sabbath. Again, if profit-making\nalone was enough to disqualify the merchants from bringing\nthe claim, the Court surely would have said so. It did not.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        49\n\nInstead, the Court addressed and rejected their free-exercise\nclaim on the merits. Id. at 608–09.\n    In United States v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110647\"><a href=\"/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), an Amish farmer\nsought a religious exemption from the obligation to withhold\nand pay Social Security taxes for his employees, coreligionists\nwho worked on his farm and in his carpentry shop. Id. at\n254–55. The Amish religion holds that members of the religious\ncommunity must provide for their own needy and elderly. Id.\nThe Social Security system exempts self-employed religious\nobjectors but not employers, so the farmer asserted a constitu-\ntional right to an exemption. Id. at 255–56. The Court held that\n“compulsory participation in the social security system\ninterferes with the[] free exercise rights” of the Amish. Id. at\n257. But the Court concluded that the strong public interest in\nthe financial soundness of the Social Security system was\nenough to defeat the farmer’s claim for an exemption:\n       The tax system could not function if denomina-\n       tions were allowed to challenge the … system\n       because tax payments were spent in a manner\n       that violates their religious belief[s]. … Because\n       the broad public interest in maintaining a sound\n       tax system is of such a high order, religious belief\n       in conflict with the payment of taxes affords no\n       basis for resisting the tax.\nId. at 260.\n   Like the merchants in Braunfeld, the Amish farmer in Lee\nwas engaged in farming and furniture-making not for subsis-\ntence but for profit. If moneymaking were enough to foreclose\n\f50                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nthe claim, the Court would not have addressed the burden on\nhis free-exercise rights or the public interest in the sound\nadministration of the Social Security system. Instead, the Court\ngave the claim plenary review and found a compelling reason\nto deny an exemption.\n   These cases show that far from categorically excluding\nprofit-seekers from the scope of the free-exercise right, the\nSupreme Court has considered their claims on the merits,\ngranting exemptions in some and not others based on the\ncompelling-interest test.\n    The government relies on a concluding statement in Lee as\nsupport for its position that profit-making is incompatible with\nfree-exercise rights:\n           Congress and the courts have been sensitive\n       to the needs flowing from the Free Exercise\n       Clause, but every person cannot be shielded\n       from all the burdens incident to exercising every\n       aspect of the right to practice religious beliefs.\n       When followers of a particular sect enter into com-\n       mercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they\n       accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience\n       and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory\n       schemes which are binding on others in that activity.\nId. at 261 (emphasis added).\n   The government apparently reads this passage as foreclos-\ning all religious-exercise claims arising in the course of\ncommercial activity merely because the context is commercial.\nThat reading is both unsound and extraordinary. Unsound\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        51\n\nbecause it would nullify the rest of the Court’s opinion, which\nconsidered the Amish farmer’s claim on the merits even\nthough his activities were for profit; the commercial context\ndid not defeat the claim. And extraordinary because it would\nleave religious exercise wholly unprotected in the commercial\nsphere. At bottom, the government’s argument is premised on\na far-too-narrow view of religious freedom: Religious exercise\nis protected in the home and the house of worship but not\nbeyond. Religious people do not practice their faith in that\ncompartmentalized way; free-exercise rights are not so\ncircumscribed.\n    If the government’s view is correct, commonplace religious\npractices normally thought protected would fall outside the\nscope of the free-exercise right. The Jewish deli is the usual\nexample. On the government’s understanding of religious\nliberty, a Jewish restaurant operating for profit could be denied\nthe right to observe Kosher dietary restrictions. That cannot be\nright. There is nothing inherently incompatible between reli-\ngious exercise and profit-seeking. The better reading of the\nconcluding dictum in Lee is that it foreshadowed the coming\nholding in Smith eight years later. The references to “incidental\nburdens” and “statutory schemes binding on others” suggest\nas much.\n    In short, nothing in the Supreme Court’s free-exercise\njurisprudence prior to Smith categorically forecloses RFRA\nclaims by profit-seeking entities.\n\n\n                             * * *\n\f52                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    For the sake of completeness, we note as well that nothing\nin the Court’s general jurisprudence of corporate constitutional\nrights suggests a nonprofit limitation on organizational free-\nexercise rights. Prior to Smith, and continuing to the present\nday, the Court has held that corporations may claim some but\nnot all constitutional rights. See Darrell A. H.

Substantial Burden\n    Our next question is whether the contraception mandate\nsubstantially burdens the plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. Recall\nthat “exercise of religion” means “any exercise of religion,\nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious\nbelief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A) (emphases added). At a\nminimum, a substantial burden exists when the government\ncompels a religious person to “perform acts undeniably at\nodds with fundamental tenets of [his] religious beliefs.” Yoder,\n406 U.S. at 218. But a burden on religious exercise also arises\nwhen the government “put[s] substantial pressure on an\nadherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.”\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 718; see also Nelson v.

Construing the parallel provision in RLUIPA, we have\nheld that a law, regulation, or other governmental command\n\n\n17\n   We deal here with two corporations that are both closely held and\nmanaged by the families that own them. As we have explained, the Kortes\nand Grotes as controlling shareholders and directors set all company policy\nand personally direct the activities of their corporations; as such, they are\nin a position to operate their businesses in a manner that conforms to their\nreligious commitments. The same normally will not be the case when it\ncomes to large publicly traded corporations, two hallmarks of which are the\nseparation of ownership from control and multimember boards of directors.\nSee 1A W ILLIA M M EA D E F LETC H ER , F LETC H ER C YC LO PED IA O F TH E L AW O F\nC O RPO RATIO N S § 70.10 (2006 rev.).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           55\n\nsubstantially burdens religious exercise if it “bears direct,\nprimary, and fundamental responsibility for rendering [a]\nreligious exercise … effectively impracticable.” Civil Liberties for\nUrban Believers v.

The same understanding applies to RFRA claims.\n    Importantly, the substantial-burden inquiry does not invite\nthe court to determine the centrality of the religious practice to\nthe adherent’s faith; RFRA is explicit about that. And free-\nexercise doctrine makes it clear that the test for substantial\nburden does not ask whether the claimant has correctly\ninterpreted his religious obligations. See Lee, 455 U.S. at 257;\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 715–16. Indeed, that inquiry is prohibited.\n“[I]n this sensitive area, it is not within the judicial function\nand judicial competence to inquire whether the [adherent\nhas] … correctly perceived the commands of [his] … faith.\nCourts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.” Thomas,\n450 U.S. at 716. It is enough that the claimant has an “honest\nconviction” that what the government is requiring, prohibiting,\nor pressuring him to do conflicts with his religion. Id.; see also\nid. at 715 (“Thomas drew a [religious] line, and it is not for us\nto say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.”).\n    Checking for sincerity and religiosity is important to weed\nout sham claims. The religious objection must be both sincere\nand religious in nature. Cf. United States v. Seeger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106995\"><a href=\"/opinion/106995/united-states-v-seeger/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n184–86 (1965) (military-conscription exemption applies only to\nobjections based on sincerely held religious beliefs as opposed\nto philosophical views or a personal moral code). These are\nfactual inquiries within the court’s authority and competence.\nBut we agree with our colleagues in the Tenth Circuit that the\n\f56                                              Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsubstantial-burden test under RFRA focuses primarily on the\n“intensity of the coercion applied by the government to act\ncontrary to [religious] beliefs.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1137.\nPut another way, the substantial-burden inquiry evaluates the\ncoercive effect of the governmental pressure on the adherent’s\nreligious practice and steers well clear of deciding religious\nquestions.\n     On this understanding of substantial burden, there can be\nlittle doubt that the contraception mandate imposes a substan-\ntial burden on the plaintiffs’ religious exercise. K & L Contrac-\ntors and Grote Industries must pay $100 per day per employee\nif they do not include coverage for contraception and steriliza-\ntion in their employee health-care plans. The Kortes and the\nGrotes as corporate owners and managers must arrange for\ntheir companies to provide the mandated coverage. They\nobject on religious grounds to doing so, explaining that\nproviding this coverage would make them complicit in a grave\nmoral wrong and would undermine their ability to give\nwitness to the moral teachings of their church. No one ques-\ntions their sincerity or the religiosity of their objection.18\n\n\n18\n  The Catholic Church’s teaching on the sanctity of human life and the\nmoral wrongfulness of contraception, abortion-inducing drugs, and sterili-\nzation is well docum ented, as is its doctrine of moral complicity and the\nrequirements of Christian witness. See Pope John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae\n[The Gospel of Life] ¶¶ 58–62 (1995), available at http://www.vatican.va/\nholy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_\nevangeliumvitae_en.html; C ATEC H ISM O F TH E C ATH O LIC C H U RC H ¶¶ 2258,\n2270–75, 2284–87, 2366, 2370, 2399 (2d ed. 1997); Pontifical Council for\nJustice and Peace, Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church ¶¶ 62–64,\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                57\n\n    In short, the federal government has placed enormous\npressure on the plaintiffs to violate their religious beliefs and\nconform to its regulatory mandate. Refusing to comply means\nruinous fines, essentially forcing the Kortes and Grotes to\nchoose between saving their companies and following the\nmoral teachings of their faith. This is at least as direct and\nsubstantial a burden as the denial of unemployment compensa-\ntion benefits in Sherbert and Thomas, and the obligation to\nwithhold and pay Social Security taxes in Lee.\n    The government takes a different tack on this question,\narguing that the mandate’s burden on religious exercise is\ninsubstantial because an employee’s decision to use her\ninsurance coverage to purchase contraception or sterilization\nservices “cannot be attributed to” the Kortes or Grotes. In a\ndifferent twist on the same argument, the government also\ninsists that any burden on the plaintiffs’ religious exercise is\ntoo “attenuated” to count as “substantial” because the provi-\nsion of contraception coverage is several steps removed from\nan employee’s independent decision to use contraception. For\nsupport the government relies on Zelman v.

Southworth rejected a\nfree-speech challenge to a public university’s student-activity\nfee because the funds collected were allocated to student\ngroups on a viewpoint-neutral basis, removing “ ‘any mistaken\nimpression that the [student groups] speak for the\n[u]niversity’ ” or the objecting student. 529 U.S. at 233 (quoting\nRosenberger v.

These cases raised questions about governmental\nendorsement of religion (Zelman) and unwanted speech\n(Southworth). The degree of separation between the govern-\nment and the use of the funds was important to the constitu-\ntional analysis in each case, but it’s not a relevant consideration\nhere.19\n    Aside from its misplaced reliance on Zelman and\nSouthworth, the government’s insistence that the burden is\ntrivial or nonexistent simply misses the point of this religious-\n\n\n19\n  At oral argument the government suggested for the first time that grant-\ning a preliminary injunction against the contraception mandate might create\nEstablishment Clause concerns. That was far too late in the litigation to raise\nthe argument. The Supreme Court has rejected a facial Establishment\nClause challenge to RLUIPA, the parallel—albeit narrower— statutory\nreligious exemption applicable to the States. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720 (2005) (“[W ]e hold that § 3 of RLUIPA fits within the corridor\nbetween the Religion Clauses: On its face, the Act qualifies as a permissible\nlegislative accommodation of religion that is not barred by the Establish-\nm ent Clause.”). The government has not advanced an argument that\napplying RFRA in this context violates the Establishment Clause.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          59\n\nliberty claim. The government focuses on the wrong thing—the\nemployee’s use of contraception—and addresses the wrong\nquestion—how many steps separate the employer’s act of\npaying for contraception coverage and an employee’s decision\nto use it.\n    To the first point: Although the plaintiffs object on religious\ngrounds to the use of contraception, abortifacient drugs, and\nsterilization, it goes without saying that they may neither\ninquire about nor interfere with the private choices of their\nemployees on these subjects. They can and do, however, object\nto being forced to provide insurance coverage for these drugs\nand services in violation of their faith. As we explained in our\norder granting an injunction pending appeal, “[t]he religious-\nliberty violation at issue here inheres in the coerced coverage of\ncontraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services,\nnot—or perhaps more precisely, not only—in the later purchase\nor use of contraception or related services.” Korte, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">6757353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\n    The government’s “attenuation” argument posits that the\nmandate is too loosely connected to the use of contraception to\nbe a substantial burden on religious exercise. Because several\nindependent decisions separate the employer’s act of providing\nthe mandated coverage from an employee’s eventual use of\ncontraception, any complicity problem is insignificant or\nnonexistent. This argument purports to resolve the religious\nquestion underlying these cases: Does providing this coverage\nimpermissibly assist the commission of a wrongful act in\nviolation of the moral doctrines of the Catholic Church? No\ncivil authority can decide that question.\n\f60                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n    To repeat, the judicial duty to decide substantial-burden\nquestions under RFRA does not permit the court to resolve\nreligious questions or decide whether the claimant’s under-\nstanding of his faith is mistaken. Lee, 455 U.S. at 257; Thomas,\n450 U.S. at 715–16. The question for us is not whether compli-\nance with the contraception mandate can be reconciled with\nthe teachings of the Catholic Church. That’s a question of\nreligious conscience for the Kortes and the Grotes to decide.\nThey have concluded that their legal and religious obligations\nare incompatible: The contraception mandate forces them to do\nwhat their religion tells them they must not do. That qualifies\nas a substantial burden on religious exercise, properly under-\nstood.\n   The plaintiffs have established a prima facie case under\nRFRA. The government must justify the mandate under the\ncompelling-interest test.\n\n\n     3. Compelling-Interest Test\n    RFRA requires the government to shoulder the burden of\ndemonstrating that applying the contraception mandate “is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmen-\ntal interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). The Supreme Court has\ninstructed us to look beyond “broadly formulated interests\njustifying the general applicability of government mandates”\nand “scrutinize[] the asserted harm of granting specific\nexemptions to particular religious claimants.” O Centro Espirita,\n546 U.S. at 431. In other words, under RFRA’s version of strict\nscrutiny, the government must establish a compelling and\nspecific justification for burdening these claimants.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           61\n\n    The compelling-interest test generally requires a “high\ndegree of necessity.” Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219734\"><a href=\"/opinion/219734/brown-v-entertainment-merchants-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government must “identify an ‘actual\nproblem’ in need of solving, and the curtailment of [the right]\nmust be actually necessary to the solution.” Id. at 2738 (cita-\ntions omitted). In the free-exercise context, “only those inter-\nests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can\noverbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.”\nYoder, 406 U.S. at 215. “[I]n this highly sensitive constitutional\narea, only the gravest abuses, endangering paramount inter-\nests, give occasion for permissible limitation … .” Sherbert,\n374 U.S. at 406 (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted). The regulated conduct must “pose[] some substantial\nthreat to public safety, peace[,] or order.” Id. at 403. Finally, “a\nlaw cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest\norder … when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly\nvital interest unprohibited.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 547 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n    The government identifies two public interests—“public\nhealth” and “gender equality”—and argues that the contracep-\ntion mandate furthers these interests by reducing unintended\npregnancies, achieving greater parity in health-care costs, and\npromoting the autonomy of women both economically and in\ntheir reproductive capacities. This argument seriously misun-\nderstands strict scrutiny. By stating the public interests so\ngenerally, the government guarantees that the mandate will\nflunk the test. Strict scrutiny requires a substantial congru-\nity—a close “fit”—between the governmental interest and the\nmeans chosen to further that interest. Stating the governmental\ninterests at such a high level of generality makes it impossible\n\f62                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nto show that the mandate is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering them. There are many ways to promote public\nhealth and gender equality, almost all of them less burdensome\non religious liberty.\n    We will translate a bit. The apparent aim of the mandate is\nto broaden access to free contraception and sterilization so that\nwomen might achieve greater control over their reproductive\nhealth. We accept this as a legitimate governmental interest.\nWhether it qualifies as an interest of surpassing importance is\nboth contestable and contested.\n    In Lee the Supreme Court held that the sound financial\nadministration of the Social Security system was a sufficiently\ncompelling interest to override a religious objection to with-\nholding Social Security taxes. 455 U.S. at 260. The government\nhas not explained why free contraception deserves to be\nranked as a governmental interest akin to the Social Security\nsystem in order of importance to the public good. Let’s assume\nfor the sake of argument that it is. Even with that generous\nassist, the government has not come close to carrying its\nburden of demonstrating that it cannot achieve its policy goals\nin ways less damaging to religious-exercise rights.\n    Indeed, the government has not even tried to satisfy the\nleast-restrictive-means component of strict scrutiny, perhaps\nbecause it is nearly impossible to do so here. The regulatory\nscheme grandfathers, exempts, or “accommodates” several\ncategories of employers from the contraception mandate and\ndoes not apply to others (those with fewer than 50 employees).\nSince the government grants so many exceptions already, it can\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                  63\n\nhardly argue against exempting these plaintiffs.20 Moreover,\nthere are many ways to increase access to free contraception\nwithout doing damage to the religious-liberty rights of\nconscientious objectors. The plaintiffs have identified a few:\nThe government can provide a “public option” for contracep-\ntion insurance; it can give tax incentives to contraception\nsuppliers to provide these medications and services at no cost\nto consumers; it can give tax incentives to consumers of\ncontraception and sterilization services. No doubt there are\nother options.\n   The government has no real response to this argument. It\nhas not made any effort to explain how the contraception\nmandate is the least restrictive means of furthering its stated\ngoals of promoting public health and gender equality. We\nnoted this shortcoming in our orders granting injunctions\npending appeal. See Grote, 708 F.3d at 855; Korte, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">6757353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. In light of this observation, we might have\nexpected a better effort in the government’s merits briefing. We\ndid not get it. The best the government could do was to insist\nthat the least-restrictive-means test “has never been interpreted\nto require the government to subsidize private religious\npractices.”\n    That’s just an evasion of RFRA. Lifting a regulatory burden\nis not necessarily a subsidy, and it’s not a subsidy here. The\nplaintiffs are not asking the government to pay for anything.\n\n\n20\n  In contrast, in Lee the Social Security exemption for self-employed reli-\ngious persons was extremely narrow. See United States v.

The Third Circuit analyzed the identical issues very\ndifferently, concluding that “a for-profit, secular corporation\ncannot engage in the exercise of religion,” and its owners “do\nnot have viable claims” against the contraception mandate\nbecause the mandate “does not actually require [them] to do\nanything.” Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724 F.3d at 388–89. The\nSixth Circuit reached a similar conclusion.

Neither com-\npany has a declared religious purpose or mission. Both are\nsubject to the full range of regulatory demands and constraints\nthat government imposes on all such businesses. These include\nthe Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) requirement that employers\nprovide comprehensive health insurance to their employees\nthat includes fully subsidized access to contraceptive care for\nwomen who choose to use it. The Kortes and the Grotes are\nCatholic and, consistent with the teachings of their religion,\nview the use of contraceptives as immoral. Invoking the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-\n1 (“RFRA”), they object to the contraception mandate of the\nACA as a substantial burden on their right to the free exercise\nof religion.\n    In exempting (preliminarily) the two corporations from the\ncontraception mandate, the court equates the business activi-\nties of these secular, for-profit firms with the religious exercise\nof its owners. Because the Kortes and the Grotes declare that\nthey run the corporations in a manner consistent with their\nreligious beliefs, the court views the burdens that government\nimposes on the corporations and the company health plans as\nburdens on the religious consciences and exercise of the\nindividual owners. Not only that: the court attributes to the\ncorporations religious exercise rights of their own, rights that\nthe companies themselves can assert, as informed by the\n\f66                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nreligious beliefs of their owners. Because the Kortes and the\nGrotes oppose the use of contraception, the companies’\nobligation to include contraceptive coverage in their workplace\nhealth insurance plans is understood as a burden on the\nowners’ free exercise rights and in turn on the companies’ free\nexercise rights. The court declares off-limits any inquiry into\nthe nature and degree of the burden imposed on these rights;\ninstead, rewriting both the terms of RFRA and free exercise\nclause jurisprudence, the court declares it sufficient that the\nACA compels the two corporations to comply with a require-\nment to which its owners object on religious grounds. Thus\nreasoning that the contraceptive mandate substantially\nburdens the free exercise rights of the individuals and their\ncompanies, the court then subjects the mandate to strict\nscrutiny and concludes that it fails that demanding standard.\n    So it is that, in the name of free exercise of religion, the\ncourt has relieved two secular corporations from a statutory\nobligation to provide health insurance to their employees that\nincludes coverage of contraceptive care for the companies’\nfemale employees. Realistically, the only religious interests at\nstake are those of the corporations’ owners—their faith is the\nsource of the objection to contraception. Yet the Affordable\nCare Act in no way imposes on their beliefs, their worship\nactivities, or the conduct of their personal lives. They need not\nuse, endorse, or dispense contraception; they remain free to\nspeak out against the use of contraception whenever and\nwherever they wish. In short, their own exercise of religion is\nwholly undisturbed. It is the corporations, as employers, which\nshoulder the obligations imposed by the ACA; and they need\nnot say or do anything with respect to contraception beyond\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         67\n\nincluding it among the countless other medical goods and\nservices covered by their employee health plans. The plaintiffs\nnonetheless object to this as facilitating the use of contracep-\ntion. I would characterize it as facilitating an employee’s choice\nto use contraception. An employee’s choice may be inconsis-\ntent with the owners’ religious beliefs, but it is not the owners’\nchoice, and it does not substantially burden the exercise of\ntheir religious freedoms.\n    My esteemed colleagues have made the best case possible\nfor the notion that the contraception mandate interferes with\nthe plaintiffs’ free exercise rights; but I believe the court’s\nholding and rationale represent an unprecedented and\nunwarranted re-conception of both what the free exercise of\nreligion entails and what constitutes a substantial burden on\nthat exercise. The court extends a highly personal right to a\nsecular corporation, a man-made legal fiction that has no\nconscience enabling belief or worship. It then deems a corpora-\ntion’s duty to cover contraceptive care as an impermissible\nburden on the religious rights of both the corporation and its\nowners. It does so without considering the directness and\ndegree of the burden on the plaintiffs’ right to the free exercise\nof their religion, in contravention of the plain terms of RFRA,\nwhich proscribes only substantial burdens on that right. And\nit permits the plaintiffs to invoke their free exercise rights\noffensively rather than defensively, in a way that circumscribes\nthe rights Congress has given to employees, by permitting the\ncorporate employers to rewrite the terms of the statutorily-\nmandated health plans they provide to their employees. As a\nresult, employees are left without a highly important form of\ninsurance coverage that Congress intended them to have.\n\f68                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n                               1.\n    In order to place today’s decision and its import in a\nbroader perspective, I want to begin my analysis by posing\nseveral hypotheticals illustrating how the court’s ruling in this\ncase might play out in other factual scenarios. Part of our\nresponsibility as an appellate court is to consider the ramifica-\ntions our precedents will have for other cases and litigants.\nContraception is the current focus of nationwide litigation\nchallenging the ACA’s employer mandate; and because the\nduty to include coverage for contraceptives in employee health\nplans implicates women, sexuality, and reproduction as well\nas religion, one might be tempted to assume that the issues\nraised in this case and the court’s holding are confined, if not\nto the facts in this case, then to a narrow range of circum-\nstances. But, as the court points out, RFRA applies to “all\nFederal law, and the implementation of that law, whether\nstatutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after”\nRFRA’s effective date. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(a); ante at 33. The\ncourt’s holding today has the potential to reach far beyond\ncontraception and to invite employers to seek exemptions from\nany number of federally-mandated employee benefits to which\nan employer might object on religious grounds. The following\nthree hypotheticals are intended to show why I think this\nmight be so. The names and facts in these hypotheticals are of\nmy own invention; the legal provisions are not.\n    1. Tom Smith is the sole owner and chief executive officer\nof TS-Co, a software company that employs more than 50\npeople and is therefore subject to the ACA. TS-Co sponsors a\nself-insured health care plan for its employees. Joe Wilson is an\nemployee of TS-Co who suffers from Amyotrophic Lateral\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        69\n\nSclerosis, or ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease.\nALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects\nnerve cells in the brain and spinal cord; the disease destroys\nmotor neurons and with them the ability of the brain to initiate\nand control muscle function. Eventually, the disease leads to\ntotal paralysis. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure\nor pneumonia, typically within three to five years of the onset\nof symptoms.\n    From another TS-Co employee, Smith learns that Wilson\nhas been accepted into a clinical trial testing the effectiveness\nof an embryonic stem-cell therapy on ALS. Smith is a devout\nMethodist who shares the United Methodist Church’s disap-\nproval of research and therapies based on stem cells derived\nfrom human embryos. Smith does not wish to manage his\ncompany’s benefit plan in a way that conflicts with his reli-\ngious beliefs; although he is concerned for Wilson’s health, he\nis adamantly opposed to facilitating the use of embryonic stem\ncells in any way. He thinks it unlikely that the company health\nplan will pay for the care Wilson will receive during his\nparticipation in the clinical trial, but when he raises the issue\nwith the plan administrator, he learns that under section 1201\nof the ACA (which in turn created a new section 2709 of the\nPublic Health Service Act (“PHA”)), the health plan must cover\nthe costs of routine patient care associated with clinical trials\ninvolving treatments for cancer and other life-threatening\nconditions. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-8. In this way, the ACA was\nmeant to expand patient access to and participation in such\n\f70                                                Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nclinical trials.1 Although the plan would cover only the costs of\nWilson’s routine care associated with the stem cell therapy,\nand not the costs of the stem cell therapy itself, Smith believes\nthat by covering Wilson’s routine care, the company plan\nwould be facilitating his participation in a practice to which he\nobjects on religious grounds.\n    Smith brings suit under RFRA a seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relief relieving the company of the obligation to\ncomply with section 2709 of the PHA, insofar as it requires the\ncoverage of costs associated with clinical trials employing\nembryonic stem cell therapies. Smith argues that requiring his\ncompany’s health plan to cover the costs of any medical care\nassociated with a treatment to which he objects on religious\ngrounds interferes with his wish to run the company in a\nmanner consistent with his religious convictions. Based on the\ncourt’s decision today, Smith and TS-Co would have a color-\nable argument that the coverage required by section 2709\nimposes a substantial burden on their free exercise rights.\nAlthough the government might have an argument that section\n2709 is supported by a compelling interest in the development\nof effective therapies for life-threatening conditions such as\nALS, based on this court’s least-restrictive means analysis, a\ncourt might conclude that the government itself, in lieu of\nobjecting employers, could pay for all costs associated with an\n\n1\n   See American Cancer Society, Cancer Action Network, Fact Sheet:\nAffordable Care Act: Clinical Trials (“Nearly 20% of cancer patients are eligible\nfor participation in cancer clinical trials, but enrollment among adults\nconsistently ranges between 3-5%.”), available at http://http://\nacscan.org/pdf/healthcare/implementation/factsheets/hcr-clinical-trials.pdf\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         71\n\nindividual’s participation in a clinical trial. In the meantime,\ngranting TS-Co an exemption from the PHA would mean that\nWilson’s workplace insurance would not cover any costs\nassociated with his participation in the clinical trial; and that,\nas a practical matter, might render Wilson unable to participate\nin the trial.\n    2. Bill Blasdell is the sole owner and chief executive officer\nof Get Out!, a corporation which operates a small chain of three\noutdoor-gear stores. Prior to enactment of the ACA, the\ncompany did not provide health insurance to its employees;\nbut with 75 employees, Get Out! is now subject to the ACA’s\nemployer mandate. Blasdell has been a life-long member of the\nChurch of Christ, Scientist. Christian Science dogma postulates\nthat illness is an illusion or false belief that can only be ad-\ndressed through prayer which realigns one’s soul with God.\nConsistent with that view, Christian Science historically has\ndisapproved of most forms of conventional medicine. None-\ntheless, in practice, many Christian Scientists have availed\nthemselves of conventional medical treatments, and in recent\nyears, the church itself has become more tolerant of conven-\ntional medicine. See, e.g., Paul Vitello, Christian Science Church\nSeeks Truce With Modern Medicine, New York Times A20 (Mar.\n24, 2010).\n    Earlier in his life, Blasdell was among those Christian\nScientists who embraced traditional medicine. But after\nwitnessing his wife suffer through a brutal treatment regimen\nfor breast cancer at a premier medical center, only to die as a\nresult of complications from the treatment and missteps by the\nmedical staff, Blasdell came to believe, consistent with the\nteachings of his church, that conventional medicine does far\n\f72                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nmore harm than good. His belief was reinforced in the year\nfollowing his wife’s death, when his ulcerative colitis went into\nremission during prayer-centered treatment at a Christian\nScience nursing center.\n   As a result of his religious convictions, Blasdell is ada-\nmantly opposed to facilitating the use of conventional medical\ncare by his employees. He is willing for Get Out! to sponsor an\nemployee health plan that pays for care at Christian Science\nnursing centers, but he believes that his company’s compliance\nwith the ACA’s mandate to cover traditional medical care\nwould be a violation of his religious principles.\n    After Get Out!’s request for an exemption from the em-\nployer mandate is denied, Blasdell and the company bring suit\nunder RFRA contending that the employer mandate is a\nsubstantial burden on the free exercise of their religious beliefs.\nPursuant to the court’s decision today, both Blasdell and Get\nOut! would have a colorable argument that compliance with\nthe employer mandate, by facilitating company employees’ use\nof conventional medical treatments to which Blasdell is\nopposed on religious grounds, represents a substantial burden\non his religious freedom and that of the corporation. And\nalthough the government, again, would no doubt urge that it\nhas a compelling interest in pursuing universal access to\nhealthcare, Blasdell and his firm could invoke this court’s\ndecision for the argument that the ACA’s exemptions belie that\ninterest, and that, in any event, the government could pursue\nits goal through publicly-funded healthcare, individual tax\ncredits, or other means that do not require employers to\nsubsidize employee healthcare that is inconsistent with their\nown religious beliefs.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         73\n\n   3. Red Pie, Inc., sells and ships to consumers nationwide a\nvariety of frozen, specialty pizzas. Bill and Betty Ann Bowers\nand their three children own and operate the firm, which has\nover 100 full-time employees. The Bowers belong to a church\nwhich is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. The\nConvention’s position on marriage and sexuality may be\nsummarized as follows:\n     We affirm God’s plan for marriage and sexual\n     intimacy—one man, and one woman, for life. Ho-\n     mosexuality is not a “valid alternative lifestyle.” The\n     Bible condemns it as sin. It is not, however, unfor-\n     givable sin. The same redemption available to all\n     sinners is available to homosexuals. They, too, may\n     become new creations in Christ.\nSouthern Baptist Convention, Position Statement on Sexuality,\navailable at http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pssexuality.asp (last\nvisited Nov. 7, 2013). The Bowers’ local congregation endorses\nand promotes the same view; in the past several years, the\npastor of their church has given several sermons condemning\nsame-sex marriage, adoption by gay and lesbian parents, and\nthe repeal of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. The\nBowers accept and follow their church’s teaching on homosex-\nuality. When same-sex marriage was recently legalized in their\nstate as a result of a court decision, the Bowers, knowing that\nthey had a number of gay and lesbian individuals in their\nemploy and in keeping with their religious beliefs, amended\nthe Red Pie employee benefits plan to make clear that spousal\ninsurance benefits are not available to the same-sex spouses of\nRed Pie employees; as their state does not prohibit employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and\n\f74                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nbecause the ACA does not require employers to provide\ninsurance coverage to employee spouses, this change was\nlegally permitted.\n    Mr. and Mrs. Bowers become alarmed when they learn that\none of their employees, Stan Jones, has submitted a request to\ntake three weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and\nMedical Leave Act (FMLA) so that he and his husband may\nattend the expected birth of their child via surrogacy in\nCalifornia, bring the baby home, and bond with the child. See\n29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). The Bowers view the idea of two gay\nmen conceiving a child by surrogacy and bringing that child\ninto their home as an abomination to the Lord. They instruct\ntheir office manager to deny Jones’ leave request and inform\nhim that neither they nor their company can in any way\nrecognize or facilitate such an immoral arrangement; Jones in\nturn protests the denial, citing his FMLA rights. After thinking\nabout the matter further, they decide the Bowers are so\ntroubled that they can no longer keep Jones in their employ.\nThe next day, they fire him.\n    After Jones contacts the Wages and Hours Division of the\nDepartment of Labor, the Department files suit against Red Pie\nunder the FMLA contending that Jones was both wrongfully\ndenied his right to parental leave under the statute and fired in\nretaliation for having requested FMLA leave. See 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 2615(a)(1), 2617(b)(2). Red Pie invokes RFRA as a defense to\nthe Department’s suit, contending that the FMLA as applied to\nRed Pie in this instance would constitute a substantial burden\non the free exercise rights of the corporation and its owners, as\nit would force them either to recognize and facilitate a parental\narrangement they view as sinful or suffer substantial penalties\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                      75\n\nunder the FMLA for refusing to do so.2 The leave mandated by\nthe FMLA is, of course, unpaid, and to that extent it would\narguably constitute no more than a minimal burden on Red\nPie’s asserted free exercise rights;3 but Red Pie could readily\ninvoke this court’s decision for the proposition that the\nsubstantiality of the burden turns not on the degree of interfer-\nence imposed on the company’s religious exercise but rather\n\n\n2\n   Whether RFRA may be invoked as a defense in a suit between private\nindividuals is a developing issue which has produced a split among the\ncircuits.

And if the latter,\nwould that more specific interest qualify as a compelling\ninterest? The outcome of that analysis is far from clear to me\nunder today’s precedent.\n   These hypotheticals illustrate the uncertainty that the\ncourt’s expansive interpretation and application of RFRA\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           77\n\nbrings to a number of statutory schemes in which Congress has\naccorded specific rights to employees (not to mention other\nparties), the recognition and accommodation of which a\ncorporation, in addition to its owners, can now say burden\ntheir religious interests. By casting the mandatory provision of\nbenefits to an employee as a substantial burden on the free\nexercise rights of a closely-held corporation and its owners,\nwithout considering whether compliance with the mandate\ndirectly interferes with the free exercise of religion or is at most\na modest burden on a plaintiff’s free exercise rights, the court’s\nrationale subjects a potentially wide range of statutory pro-\ntections to strict scrutiny, one of the most demanding stan-\ndards known in our legal system. In some ways, this is\nreminiscent of the Lochner era, when an employer could claim\nthat the extension of statutory protections to its workers\nconstituted an undue infringement on the freedom of contract\nand the right to operate a private, lawful business as the owner\nwished. And by exempting employers from extending to\nemployees the rights specified by statute, the government is\nforced to pick up the slack and take compensatory action to\nprotect the rights of those employees; short of that, the em-\nployee of the religiously-motivated employer is left with no\nright at all. I doubt that this is what Congress intended when\nit enacted RFRA.\n                                 2.\n    I begin my discussion of the specific legal points presented\nby this appeal with where my colleagues and I agree. First, I\nagree that the Anti-Injunction Act poses no bar to this action.\nThis is not a suit aimed at restraining the collection of a tax—in\nthis case, the penalties for non-compliance with the ACA.\n\f78                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nRather, it is a direct challenge to a substantive provision of the\nACA: the contraception mandate.\n    I am also in accord with my colleagues on standing. The\ngovernment has not contested the standing of any of the\nplaintiffs in these cases, and I agree with my colleagues that\nboth the corporations and their owners indeed do have\nstanding. Because the burden of the contraception mandate\nfalls directly on the two corporations as employers, and\nbecause the corporations contend that they have their own\nright to free exercise of religion which is burdened by the\nmandate, they have standing to challenge the mandate. See\ngenerally Clapper v.

The fact\nthat the obligations imposed by the mandate fall upon the\ncorporation, whereas it is the individual owners—and only the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           79\n\nindividuals, in my view—who hold free exercise rights,\nmatters a great deal to whether those rights are substantially\nburdened.

In fact,\nas I have argued previously, they are distinct. In electing to do\nbusiness through the corporate form, the Kortes and the Grotes\nhave separated themselves from their companies: the corpora-\ntions are independent legal entities with legal rights and\nobligations independent of their individual owners.

What that\nmeans here is that it is the two corporations which, as employ-\ners covered by the ACA, must provide health insurance to\ntheir employees that covers contraceptives. That, in turn, puts\nmeaningful distance between the Kortes and the Grotes and\nthe company health plans and undercuts the notion that the\nACA forces the Kortes and the Grotes to facilitate a prac-\ntice—the use of contraception—to which they object on\nreligious grounds.\n    The distinction between a corporation and its owners\nexplains why the plaintiffs have argued, and today the court\nholds, that a secular, for-profit corporation possesses its own\nright to the free exercise of religion. That novel idea is a way to\nget past the problem that the people whose faith leads them to\nobject to the contraception mandate are not legally responsible\nfor complying with the mandate: endow the corporate\n“persons” with their own right to exercise religion which they\nmay invoke in conscientious objection to the mandate. It is an\nunprecedented holding, and one I believe is without legal or\nlogical support.\n    I concede, as I must, that the Supreme Court has not\nrestricted the invocation of free exercise rights solely to\nindividuals, but has allowed—albeit with very little discus-\nsion—houses of worship, including those which have incorpo-\nrated, to assert such rights.

A religious\nassociation is often as well if not better situated as the individ-\nuals who make up the association to assert the relevant\nreligious interests: the association can speak on behalf of all of\nits members; it likely has resources to pursue legal relief that\nindividual members do not; it can speak authoritatively on\nmatters of religious dogma; it may be the association that owns\nproperty and other assets affected by the challenged govern-\nment action; and in many instances, the law or other govern-\nment action being challenged intrudes directly on the collective\nworship activities of the association itself.

Neither the congressional\nrecord underlying the enactment of the First Amendment nor\nthe records of the state legislatures which subsequently ratified\nthe amendment provide any help in ascertaining what legisla-\ntors meant by “religion” and the free exercise thereof.

But there are two reference\npoints that reinforce the notion that religion was understood to\nbe a matter of personal conscience.\n    First, by 1789, the constitutions of all thirteen states, save\nConnecticut, included religious liberty provisions, and many\nreferenced the right as the freedom to worship one’s God\naccording to the dictate’s of one’s conscience.

New Hampshire’s 1784 constitution, for example,\nprovided that “[e]very individual has a natural and unalien-\nable right to worship GOD according to the dictates of his own\nconscience, and reason”; and the constitutions of Delaware,\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and\nVirginia all contained very similar language. See McConnell,\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at 1456,\n1457 n. 242. Other constitutions—those of New York and South\nCarolina—separately described the protected freedom of\nreligion and then referred to the “liberty of conscience” thereby\nguaranteed. See id. “Conscience” was used in still other ways\nby the provisions of other state constitutions. See id.\n    These state provisions set the stage for the drafting, debate,\nand adoption of the First Amendment’s free exercise clause.\nThe clause as proposed and adopted by the House of Repre-\nsentatives incorporated language recognizing “freedom of\nconscience”; but the version adopted by the Senate, by the\nensuing conference committee, and which was submitted to\nand ratified by the States, omitted that language. See\nMcConnell, Origins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. R.\nat 1481–84. It is not clear why “conscience” was omitted from\nthe adopted version of the free exercise clause, but it is doubt-\nful that the elimination was meant to signify a different\nunderstanding of what the clause protected. As Professor\nMcConnell and others observe, “freedom of religion” and\n“freedom of conscience” were terms that were used inter-\nchangeably in discussions of religious liberty. E.g., McConnell,\n\f92                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at 1488,\n1493–94; Philip A. Hamburger, A Constitutional Right of\nReligious Exemption: An Historical Perspective, 60 GEO. WASH. L.\nREV. 915, 933–34 & n.80 (1992). McConnell suggests that “rights\nof conscience” was dropped either to eliminate a redundancy,\nto the extent it signified the same thing as the free exercise of\nreligion, or to emphasize that it was only the freedom of\nreligious conscience, as opposed to the freedom of non-\nreligious belief, that was meant to be protected. McConnell,\nOrigins & Historical Understanding, 103 HARV. L. REV. at\n1488–96. Either way, it is clear that the clause was intended to\nprotect the exercise of religious conscience. Id. at 1495–96. And\nas shown by both the state provisions addressing the freedom\nof religion and the other contemporaneous writings I have\ncited, the exercise of religious conscience was understood to be\na matter between the individual and his God—not, perhaps, in\nthe more modern sense of believing whatever one wants, but\nrather as a reflection that the individual owed his or her\nobedience on moral matters directly to God. Id. at 1498–99;\nHamburger, A Constitutional Right of Religious Exemption, 60\nGEO. WASH. L. REV. at 933, 938. The understanding that the\nexercise of religion was a matter of the individual’s relation-\nship with and obedience to God was also consistent with the\nmultiplicity of minority religions practiced in the United States\nby the second half of the 18th century, and a consensus that the\ncountry should move away from a Colonial history of officially\nestablished religions (and officially disfavored religions)\ntoward religious pluralism. Id. at 946.\n    All of this reinforces what one would otherwise intuit about\nreligion: that it is inextricably intertwined with characteristics\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          93\n\nthat are uniquely human: conscience, belief, faith, and devo-\ntion. Religious beliefs have to do with such fundamental\nquestions as the nature of mankind, where we came from, our\nplace in the world, what happens when we die, and our\nrelationships with and obligations to other people. Only the\nhuman mind can entertain such questions.\n    A corporation is a legal construct which does not have the\nsentience and conscience to entertain such ultimate questions.\n“In the words of Chief Justice Marshall, a corporation is ‘an\nartificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in\ncontemplation of law.’” Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vt. v. Kelco\nDisposal, Inc., supra, 492 U.S. at 284, 109 S. Ct. at 2925 (quoting\nTrustees of Dartmouth Coll. v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518,\n636 (1819)). It is a creature of man, not of God.

To say, as the court does today, that the\nright to exercise one’s religious faith may be asserted on the\nsame terms by a legal construct—an incorporated currency\nexchange, accounting firm, or automobile repair shop, for\nexample—as by a human being, is, to my mind at least,\nirreconcilable with the very essence of religious faith and, for\nthat matter, humankind.\n   Perhaps there are good reasons to extend the right of free\nexercise to religious organizations, including not-for-profit\ncorporations organized to pursue religious ends.

Individuals often have multiple reasons for\nacting, and simply because they have reasons in addition to a\nreligious motive does not disqualify them from asserting free\nexercise rights. But that does not answer the question whether\na corporation —again, an invention of the law—should be\naccorded religious rights, particularly when it is not organized\nfor religious ends.5\n\n\n5\n   The majority postulates that if a for-profit business cannot assert free\nexercise rights, then theoretically a Jewish restaurant could be denied the\nright to observe dietary restrictions.

I am thus far short of convinced\nthat Grote Industries and Korte & Luitjohan Contractors have\ndemonstrated a clear entitlement to preliminary injunctive\nrelief protecting whatever free exercise rights they might have.\nHobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1164–65 (Briscoe, C.J., concurring in\npart & dissenting in part); id. at 1183–84 (Matheson, J., concur-\nring in part & dissenting in part). The notion that any type of\ncorporation may possess its own free exercise rights is itself far\nfrom a settled proposition; and the plaintiffs’ claim calls for a\nwholly unprecedented extension of such rights to secular, for-\nprofit corporations.\n    There are, finally, significant logical difficulties posed by\nattributing religious rights to secular corporations. Whatever\nreligious rights a corporation might theoretically exercise can\nonly come from the people who establish, own, and manage a\ncorporation. See Conestoga Wood Specialties, 724 F.3d at 385\n(“General business corporations do not, separate and apart\nfrom the actions or belief systems of their individual owners or\nemployees, exercise religion.”) (quoting Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\nv. Sebelius, 870 F. Supp. 2d at 1291). And here, no one is saying\nthat Korte & Luitjohan Contractors and Grote Industries are\nCatholic corporations; instead, I understand the individual\nplaintiffs to be saying that they run the corporations in a way\nthat is consistent with, and expresses, the principles of their\nCatholic faith. But this poses some challenges in defining the\nreligious beliefs and rights of the corporation.\n   First, to the extent that a corporation’s religious principles\nand identity derive from its owners, what if the owners have\ndiverse beliefs, diverse degrees of devotion, and diverse\nnotions as to whether and how the corporation ought to reflect\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         99\n\ntheir religious beliefs?

Are challenges such as the\none presented in this case subject to re-litigation every time\nthere is a change in corporation ownership?\n    Third, are the religious beliefs of corporate owners solely\ndeterminative of the corporation’s religious principles?\nSuppose, for example, that a corporation’s owners have\nentirely entrusted the management of the corporation to its\nlongtime CEO, who is the public face of the corporation and\nwho also happens to have strongly held religious beliefs about\nthe way in which the corporation should be run. Are her\nbeliefs attributable to the corporation? Or suppose that the\nowners of a corporation have no professed religious interest in\nthe way in which a corporation is run, but the focus of the\ncorporation is on serving members of a particular reli-\ngion—selling kosher or halal food products, for example. See\nante at 51. Can the corporation be said to hold the religious\nbeliefs of its target market, even if its owners and managers do\nnot?\n     At oral argument, Grote Industries’ counsel conceded that\nif ownership of the company changed, as by death and\ninheritance, then a court might have to revisit the nature of the\ncorporation’s asserted religious interests. But why is that true\nif the corporation has its own free exercise rights? By permit-\nting a corporation to assert its own religious rights, we are, I\nwould think, saying that the corporation may possess such\nrights independent of what its owners believe and assert; a\nchange in ownership by itself would theoretically portend\nnothing about the status of the corporation’s religious interests.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           101\n\n    The court has also limited its holding today to closely-held\ncorporations. The reasons for that limitation are both prag-\nmatic and obvious: When a company is owned and managed\nby a small number of people, it is easy to appreciate the\noverlap between the interests of owners and corporation. Thus,\na firm that is owned and operated by a family united in its\nreligious beliefs presents the strongest case for making the type\nof free exercise claim presented here. But if a corporation has\nfree exercise rights because the Dictionary Act suggests it is\namong the “persons” to which RFRA grants the right to make\nsuch a claim, ante at 54 n.17, and if any distinctions between\nreligious and secular corporations do not matter, ante at 47–54,\nthen why does a corporation of large, diverse, or even public\nownership not have free exercise rights also? And how would\nthe beliefs of a public corporation be determined—by a vote at\nthe annual shareholders’ meeting, for example?\n    Although the court has held that Korte & Luitjohan\nContractors and Grote Industries have free exercise rights,\nwhat it is saying, in the end, is that it is the religious beliefs of\nthe Kortes and Grotes that matter; the corporations, in effect,\nembody the expression of their beliefs. See ante at 3, 59–60; see\nalso Autocam, 730 F.3d at 620 (noting that plaintiffs characterize\ntheir corporation as “the business form through which [they]\nendeavor to live their vocation as Christians in the world”).\nHolding that the two corporations have their own religious\ninterests is, as I said at the start, merely a means of circumvent-\ning the problem that while it is the beliefs of the Kortes and the\nGrotes that are at issue here, the duties imposed by the ACA\nupon the corporations do not significantly burden the free\n\f102                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nexercise rights of the Kortes and Grotes themselves. I turn to\nthat point next.\n                                4.\n    RFRA provides that “Government shall not substantially\nburden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden\nresults from a rule of general applicability,” unless the burden\nis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is\nthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(a) & (b). By its reference to substantial burdens,\nRFRA expressly calls for a qualitative assessment of the burden\nthat a challenged statute or other government action imposes\non an individual’s exercise of religion. As I discuss below,\ncourts have long engaged in such assessments, distinguishing\nbetween direct and indirect, and between minor and meaning-\nful burdens on the exercise of religion. Yet the court today\nrejects any such inquiry, departing from both historical\npractice and the language of RFRA.\n    Following the Tenth Circuit’s lead in Hobby Lobby, the\nmajority rejects any assessment of how direct or attenuated the\nburden imposed on the plaintiff’s religious practices may be,\nante at 57–60, reasoning that it is the equivalent of asking\nwhether the burdened religious practice is central to the\nplaintiff’s faith or whether the plaintiff is interpreting his\nreligious beliefs correctly, ante at 55–56. Instead, the majority\nholds that the pertinent inquiry is whether the penalties for\nnoncompliance with the government’s mandate exert a\nsufficiently coercive influence on the plaintiffs. Ante at 56\n(citing Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1137). This single-minded focus\non the coercive aspect of the mandate is yet another means of\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          103\n\ngetting past the point that a number of courts have made\npreviously: that because the mandate is imposed on the\ncorporate employers rather than the owners themselves, and\nbecause it does not require the owners themselves to do\nanything in violation of their religious faith, it does not directly\nand substantially burden the owners’ religious practices. See\nGrote, 708 F.3d at 858–59 (dissent) (coll. cases); see also Gilardi,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5854246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *29–*31 (Edwards, J., concurring in part &\ndissenting in part). Per the majority’s view, the individual\nplaintiffs need only cite an obligation imposed on the corpora-\ntions that is inconsistent with their own religious beliefs and\npractices; so long as the corporations are coerced into compli-\nance (as by the prospect of substantial fines if they do not\ncomply) that is enough to establish a substantial burden on\ntheir free exercise rights, without further inquiry into whether\nthe mandate genuinely and meaningfully interferes with their\nreligious practices. Hobby Lobby reasons that it is not the court’s\nbusiness to assess whether the obligation imposed by the\ngovernment is substantial in the sense of whether it directly\nburdens the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs and practices or instead\nis attenuated, as the government claims it to be. That assess-\nment is equated with a forbidden inquiry into the theological\nmerit of the plaintiffs’ claim. 723 F.3d at 1137. “Our only task\nis to determine whether the claimant’s belief is sincere, and if\nso, whether the government has applied substantial pressure\non the claimant to violate that belief.” Id.\n    This coercion-only test is one of the Tenth Circuit’s inven-\ntion.

The ACA unam-\nbiguously requires the two corporate plaintiffs to include\ncontraceptive coverage in their employee health plans. Even\nabsent the substantial financial penalties for non-compliance,\nthe two companies presumably would be subject to suit by the\ngovernment or by an employee for injunctive relief ordering\nthem to comply if they did not otherwise do so, see ante at 7\n(citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d); and, in any event, most\nindividuals and corporations will not feel free to deliberately\nignore what the law plainly requires them to do. So the entire\ninquiry into whether the ACA places substantial pressure on\nthe plaintiffs to take action over their objections is unnecessary\nand beside the point. There is no dispute that it does.\n    What the coercion inquiry does not answer, and which the\ncourt must turn to next, is whether the government, by\nrequiring the two companies to take action to which the\ncompanies and their owners object on religious grounds, is\nimposing a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ free exercise of\nreligion. This is where the Tenth Circuit’s decision in Hobby\nLobby, now embraced by this court, goes awry. Hobby Lobby\npostulates that evaluating the nature and degree of the burden\nimposed by the mandate will require an impermissible inquiry\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          107\n\ninto whether the plaintiffs are correctly interpreting and\nfollowing religious dogma. 724 F.3d at 1137; see Thomas, 450\nU.S. at 715, 101 S.

Hobby\nLobby thus concludes that once the plaintiff has shown the\ngovernment has put substantial pressure on him to do some-\nthing to which he sincerely objects on religious grounds, he has\nshown all that he needs to show to establish that his free\nexercise right is substantially burdened. 723 F.3d at 1137–38; see\nante at 56–57.\n   This holding effectively rewrites RFRA. The statute does\nnot prohibit the government from putting substantial pressure\non a plaintiff to do anything, or to be a party to anything, to\nwhich he has an honest religious objection; rather, it states that\nthe government “shall not substantially burden a person's\nexercise of religion … .” § 2000bb-1(a) (emphasis mine).\nCongress used the term “substantially” to modify “burden,”\nand the relevant inquiry considers how that burden affects the\nindividual’s ability to believe, profess, and practice his religion.\nAs Judge Edwards points out in Gilardi, RFRA was specifically\ndrafted in that way to make clear that not every burden\nimposed by government on religious exercise need be justified\nby a compelling governmental interest. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5854246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*27–*28 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissenting in part);\n\f108                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsee also Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1316 (“we do not intend to\nimply that every infringement on a religious exercise will\nconstitute a substantial burden”). By its plain terms, then, the\nstatute calls for a threshold inquiry into the nature of the\nburden placed on the plaintiff’s free exercise of religion:\n“substantial” is a term of degree, which invites the court to\ndistinguish large or considerable burdens from minor or\nincidental ones.

But simply because someone has a good-faith\nobjection, based in religion, to a particular government action\ndoes not mean that his right to the free exercise of religion is\n\n\n7\n  Some of the RLUIPA cases may be distinguished superficially, in that the\nplaintiffs were prisoners who sought damages for occasional denials of\nkosher or halal meals or other accommodations to their religious needs.\nE.g., Rapier, 172 F.3d at 1006 n.4 (unavailability of non-pork food trays to\nprisoner at three of 810 meals). This suit, by contrast, involves a challenge\nto a statutory mandate that the plaintiffs contend is inconsistent with their\nreligious beliefs. Nonetheless the cases remain relevant for the proposition\nthat not all burdens on the free exercise of religion qualify as substantial.\nThe nature of the claim (impingement on the free exercise of religion) is the\nsame; the only difference is the context in which the claim is asserted.\n\f112                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nactually and substantially burdened by that action. Courts\nroutinely undertake examinations of the degree to which a\ngiven law, regulation, or other government action does or does\nnot intrude upon an individual’s constitutionally protected\ninterests.

We do not\n     believe that such an effect is an absolute test for\n     determining whether the legislation violated the\n     freedom of religion protected by the First Amend-\n     ment.\nId. at 606–07, 81 S. Ct. at 1147–48. Hobby Lobby suggests that the\nCourt in Lee subsequently abandoned consideration of whether\nthe burden imposed by a statute on free exercise rights is direct\nor indirect. 723 F.3d at 1139–40. Yet, the government’s argu-\nment in Lee—that an Amish businessman could contribute to\nthe Social Security system without violating his religious belief\nthat it is sinful for a family not to care for its own elderly—was\nnot an argument about the direct or indirect effect of the law,\nbut rather a quarrel with Lee’s understanding of the Amish\nfaith; and the Court’s unwillingness to mediate a theological\n\f114                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ndispute was what led it to reject the argument. 455 U.S. at 257,\n102 S. Ct. at 1055. What is true is that the Court, subsequent to\nBraunfeld, rejected the directness or indirectness of the burden\nas a controlling factor in free exercise cases. See Sherbert v.\nVerner, supra, 374 U.S. at 403–04, 83 S. Ct. at 1794 (“[I]t is true\nthat no criminal sanctions directly compel appellant to work a\nsix-day week. But this is only the beginning, not the end, of our\ninquiry.”); see also Thomas, 450 U.S. at 714, 101 S. Ct. at 1432\n(“While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement\nupon free exercise rights is nonetheless substantial.”). But the\nCourt’s decision in Bowen v. Roy, supra, 476 U.S. at 706–07, 106\nS. Ct. at 2156, decided four years after Lee and which I discuss\nbelow, makes clear that the Court still regards it as a relevant\nconsideration. Lower court cases likewise confirm that the\ndirectness or indirectness of the burden imposed on the\nexercise of one’s religious exercise right remains a material\nconsideration.

For example, in Bowen v. Roy, a Native American man\nwith a young daughter objected to a statutory requirement that\nhe provide a Social Security number for each member of his\nhousehold in order to obtain benefits from the Aid to Families\nwith Dependent Children program (“AFDC”) and to a com-\npanion requirement that state AFDC plans use such numbers\nin administering their plans. With respect to the latter require-\nment, he believed that if state agencies used an identifying\nnumber for his daughter, they would “rob” her spirit and\n“prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power,” 476 U.S.\nat 696, 106 S. Ct. at 2150; he therefore contended that the\nrequirement that state agencies use their daughter’s Social\nSecurity number violated his right to the free exercise of his\nreligion. The Supreme Court disagreed. It noted that the\nplaintiff was not complaining of an intrusion on his freedom of\nreligious belief, which was absolute, or of an intrusion upon\nthe liberty of his own conduct, which was less than absolute;\ninstead, the plaintiff was invoking the free exercise clause in an\neffort to dictate how the government should transact its\n\f116                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nbusiness. Id. at 699, 106 S. Ct. at 2152. The Court rejected the\nnotion that the reach of free exercise clause extended this far:\n      Never to our knowledge has the Court interpreted\n      the First Amendment to require the Government\n      itself to behave in ways that the individual believes\n      will further his or her spiritual development or that\n      of his or her family. The Free Exercise Clause simply\n      cannot be understood to require the Government to\n      conduct its own internal affairs in ways that com-\n      port with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.\n      Just as the Government may not insist that appellees\n      engage in any set form of religious observance, so\n      appellees may not demand that the Government join\n      in their chosen religious practices by refraining from\n      using a number to identify their daughter. “[T]he\n      Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the\n      government cannot do to the individual, not in\n      terms of what the individual can extract from the\n      government.” Sherbert v.

Kaemmerling alleged that as\nan Evangelical Christian, he viewed DNA as the building block\nof God’s creative work, and he believed that the collection,\nstorage, and use of one’s DNA was tantamount to laying the\nfoundation for the rise of an anti-Christ. In rejecting the\nviability of Kaemmerling’s claim, the court emphasized that\nthe government was not forcing him to modify his own\nbehavior:\n     … Kaemmerling does not allege facts sufficient to\n     state a substantial burden on his religious exercise\n     because he cannot identify any “exercise” which is\n     the subject of the burden to which he objects. The\n     extraction and storage of DNA information are\n     entirely activities of the FBI, in which Kaemmerling\n\f118                                        Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n      plays no role and which occur after the [Bureau of\n      Prisons] has taken his fluid or tissue sample (to\n      which he does not object). The government’s extrac-\n      tion, analysis, and storage of Kaemmerling’s DNA\n      information does not call for Kaemmerling to mod-\n      ify his religious behavior in any way—it involves no\n      action or forbearance on his part, nor does it other-\n      wise interfere with any religious act in which he\n      engages. Although the government’s activities with\n      his fluid or tissue sample after the BOP takes it may\n      offend Kaemmerling’s religious beliefs, they cannot\n      be said to hamper his religious exercise because they\n      do not “pressure [him] to modify his behavior and\n      to violate his beliefs.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718, 101 S.\n      Ct. 1425.\n      Kaemmerling alleges no religious observance that\n      the DNA Act impedes, or acts in violation of his\n      religious beliefs that it pressures him to perform.\n      Religious exercise necessarily involves an action or\n      practice, as in Sherbert, where the denial of unem-\n      ployment benefits “impede[d] the observance” of\n      the plaintiff’s religion by pressuring her to work on\n      Saturday in violation of the tenets of her religion,\n      374 U.S. at 404, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Kaemmerling, in contrast, alleges that the\n      DNA Act’s requirement that the federal government\n      collect and store his DNA information requires the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           119\n\n     government to act in ways that violate his religious\n     beliefs, but he suggests no way in which these\n     governmental acts pressure him to modify his own\n     behavior in any way that would violate his beliefs.\n     See Appellant’s Br. at 21 (describing alleged substan-\n     tial burden as “knowing [his] strongly held beliefs\n     had been violated by a[n] unholy act of an oppres-\n     sive regime”).\n553 F.3d at 679. (The court went on to hold, alternatively, that\neven if the DNA mandate did impose a substantial burden on\nKaemmerling’s free exercise rights, it would nonetheless\nsurvive RFRA’s step-two strict scrutiny analysis. Id. at 680–85.)\n    These lines of cases thus supply two criteria that can help\nus to determine whether the burden imposed by government\naction upon a plaintiff’s free exercise rights is substantial. First,\nthe Braunfeld line of cases instructs us to look at the burden\nresulting from government action and consider the way in\nwhich it purportedly interferes with an individual’s exercise of\nreligion: is the burden direct, such that it actually prevents a\nperson from behaving in accordance with his religion, or does\nit impose only an indirect, incidental burden that, for example,\nmakes the observance of his religion more costly but does not\nactually preclude his religious exercise? Second, the Roy line of\ncases draws a distinction between what the law requires a\nplaintiff himself to do, and what it permits or requires a third\nparty to do. These cases recognize that although the plaintiff\nmay have a religiously-based objection to what the govern-\nment or another third party does with something that the law\nrequires the plaintiff to provide (in Roy, a Social Security\nnumber, in Kaemmerling, his DNA), the free exercise clause\n\f120                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ndoes not necessarily permit him to impose a restraint upon\nanother’s action.\n    Admittedly, neither line speaks directly to the issues before\nus now: the Supreme Court has never before considered\nwhether and under what circumstances the statutorily-man-\ndated provision of a particular benefit to an employee will\nsubstantially burden the employer’s free exercise rights. (The\nprecedent that is closest to that scenario is United States v. Lee,\nin which the Court held that the objecting Amish employer\nwas obliged to pay Social Security taxes notwithstanding his\nreligious objection to doing so, given the government’s\ncompelling interest in a uniform national system of retirement\npay.) The cases I have just discussed are nonetheless relevant\nin two senses. First, like the various circuit cases finding certain\nburdens on free exercise rights to be insubstantial, supra at 110-\n111, they confirm that we can and in fact must examine the\nnature and degree of the burden resulting from government\naction to decide whether it constitutes a substantial burden for\npurpose of RFRA. Second, they demonstrate that in making\nthat assessment, we must consider precisely how the objected-\nto action relates to the individual’s exercise of his religious\nrights.\n   Taking my cue from these cases, I move on to consider\nprecisely how the ACA’s requirement that a corporate em-\nployer provide health insurance to its employees that includes\ncontraceptive coverage does or does not burden the free\nexercise rights of its owners. Because the ACA does not\nactually require the individual plaintiffs themselves to do\nanything contrary to their religious beliefs, and because their\ndesire not to have their companies facilitate the use of contra-\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         121\n\nception necessarily implicates the private choices of employees\nas to how they will use the insurance coverage they have\nearned as a benefit of their work, I am convinced that any\nburden imposed on the free exercise rights of the individual\nplaintiffs is too attenuated to qualify as a substantial burden.\n                                5.\n    A substantial burden is one that bears direct, primary, and\nfundamental responsibility for making the plaintiff’s religious\nexercise impracticable.

Specifically, the company health plans must provide\ninsurance coverage which, by fully underwriting the cost of\ncontraceptive care, facilitates what the Kortes and the Grotes\nview as a moral wrong (the use of contraception).\n    For two key reasons, the mandate poses no direct burden\non the Kortes’ and Grotes’ exercise of religion. First, the\nmandate does not require them to alter their own practices in\nany way. As the court’s articulation of the asserted burden\nmakes clear, what they are objecting to is the use of contracep-\ntion by third parties, which the plaintiffs do not wish to\nfacilitate. Second, to the extent the Kortes’ and the Grotes’\nconcern has to do with facilitating what they believe to be\nimmoral conduct by third parties, it is the corporate health\n\f122                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nplans, not they, who fund the insurance which employees may\nuse to procure contraception.\n    The first point is obvious, and I have made it before, but it\ncannot be repeated often enough. Nothing in the ACA requires\nthe Kortes or the Grotes themselves to do anything that\nviolates the Catholic Church’s disapproval of contraception.\nThey need not purchase, use, or dispense contraceptives; they\nneed not promote or endorse the use of contraceptives; nor\nneed they remain silent as to what their faith teaches them\nabout the immorality of contraceptive use.

Their only connection\nto the objected-to use of contraception is indirect: (a) the Grotes\nand the Kortes are both the owners of closely-held corpora-\ntions; (b) which are now required by the ACA to provide\nstandardized health-care coverage to employees; (c) which\nemployees may elect, inter alia, to use to obtain contraception.\nEach step in this chain separates them by an additional degree\nfrom the objected-to practice of contraception.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                   123\n\n    It is the corporations, not the individual plaintiffs, which as\nthe employers are obligated to provide the requisite coverage\nto employees of the firms. The Kortes and the Grotes incorpo-\nrated their businesses for a reason. Business owners form\ncorporations precisely to insulate themselves from the obliga-\ntions of the corporation and to create a separate entity to carry\non the business. The corporations and only the corporations\nbear the obligation to provide the insurance coverage to\nemployees; the Kortes and the Grotes bear no personal\nobligation to pay for the coverage. Thus the money—the\n“material support,” as the court describes it—comes from\nKorte & Luitjohan Contractors and Grote Industries, not from\nthe pockets of the individual plaintiffs.8\n    Moreover, what the companies are providing is a form of\nemployee compensation, like wages. Handing over a paycheck\nto an employee may materially facilitate the purchase of any\nnumber of (perfectly legal) goods and services—alcohol,\nlottery tickets, cigarettes, adult pornography, contraception,\n\n\n8\n  The sparse record before us does not reveal whether and to what degree\nthe contraceptive mandate may increase the cost of health insurance to\nemployers. Full coverage of contraception may (like the mandated coverage\nof other preventive services) save insurers and employers money in the\nlong run by reducing the multiple costs associated with unplanned\npregnancies. See infra at 144-145; Institute of Medicine, Committee on\nPreventive Services for Women, Clinical Preventive Services for Women:\nClosing the Gaps, 107 (2011) (costs of unintended pregnancies in United\nStates in 2002 estimated to be $5 billion, while costs saved due to contracep-\ntion estimated to be $19.3 billion), available at http://www.nap.edu/\ncatalog.php?record_id=13181. In any case, the plaintiffs’ argument here\nturns not on the additional cost of providing contraceptive coverage but to\nfacilitating the use of contraceptives by providing that coverage, period.\n\f124                                            Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nabortion, and Harry Potter books, to name a few—that are\ncontrary to an employer’s religious beliefs. Of course, an\nemployer typically does not know how an employee will\nspend his wages. (Neither does he typically know what\nhealthcare decisions his employee is making.) But what if he\ndoes know? Suppose an employee announces, “As soon as I\nget my paycheck, I am going to have an abortion.” Or suppose\nit is well known at the workplace that a particular employee\ndrinks himself blind at a local tavern every Friday night after\nhe gets paid. Can the employer withhold the paycheck on the\ngrounds that turning it over will materially assist an act that he\nfinds morally intolerable? Without explaining why, the\nplaintiffs concede that an employer cannot do this. They do not\ncontend that the possibility, or even the foreknowledge, that an\nemployee can and will use her wages to engage in an activity\nproscribed by the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs substantially\nburdens their free exercise rights, notwithstanding that the\npayment of wages to the employees will facilitate the objected-\nto activity.9 How is the provision of health insurance different?\nOne difference is that the employer plays some role in estab-\nlishing and administering the health care plan, as opposed to\nsupplying the employee with a voucher that the employee can\nuse to purchase his own insurance elsewhere. But the insur-\n\n\n9\n   As Judge Edwards put it in Gilardi, “the Gilardis are no more of an\n‘essential cause’ of increasing the use of contraception when they authorize\nFreshway [their company] to pay for a benefits plan that employees might\nuse to get contraception than when they authorize wages that an employee\nmight use to purchase contraception she would not otherwise be able to\nafford.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5854246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *29 (Edwards, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (emphasis in original).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                       125\n\nance is nonetheless a component of compensation that the\nemployee has earned—an employee accepts less in salary or\nhourly pay in exchange for benefits like health insurance, and,\nin most cases, contributions have been withheld from the\nemployee’s paycheck to further defray the costs of that\ninsurance. See Sepper, Contraception and the Birth of Corporate\nConscience, supra, at 22.10 The fact that the employer in adminis-\ntering the plan is treated as a fiduciary, with a corresponding\nobligation to act in the employee’s interest is consistent with the\nnotion that the insurance, while provided by the employer,\nbelongs to the employee.

In Southworth, the objectors were public university\nstudents who argued that the use of their mandatory activity\nfees to support student groups whose missions and speech\nthey opposed violated their own First Amendment right to free\nspeech. The Supreme Court rejected the First Amendment\nclaims in both cases. In Zelman, the Court emphasized that\nbecause the voucher program was neutral with respect to\nreligion, and public money reached religious schools solely by\nway of “genuine and independent private choice,” the protest-\ning taxpayers did not have a valid Establishment Clause claim.\n536 U.S. at 652, 122 S. Ct. at 2467. And in Southworth, the Court\nlikewise stressed that because student activity funds were\nallocated on a viewpoint-neutral basis, ensuring that both\nminority and majority views would be heard, there was no\n\f128                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\ngenuine risk that any student group would be perceived as\nspeaking for the university and its students, and thus no\nmeritorious claim that the objecting students were being\ncompelled to “speak” in violation of their own beliefs and\nviews. 529 U.S. at 233–35, 120 S. Ct. at 1356–57.\n    Yes, Zelman and Southworth can be distinguished from this\ncase: Zelman involved an establishment clause claim, and\nSouthworth involved a free speech claim, whereas this case\npresents a free exercise clause claim. But at the bottom of all\nthree cases is the claim that forcing the plaintiff to give his\nfinancial aid to activity or speech that he finds objectionable\ncannot be reconciled with his First Amendment freedoms.\nCentral to the rejection of this claim in Zelman and Southworth\nwas official agnosticism, which permitted the funds to be used\nas third parties (in Zelman, the parents, and in Southworth, the\nstudent council) chose, with no reasonable perception that\nthose choices were attributable to either the government or the\nobjecting plaintiff. The same reasoning explains why manda-\ntory, employer-sponsored insurance coverage which includes\ncontraception as a covered service does not meaningfully\nburden the plaintiffs’ free exercise rights. By including contra-\nception in the required coverage, the government is in no way\nrequiring any company owner to use, endorse, or dispense\ncontraception in violation of his own religious beliefs; the\nchoice whether and under what circumstances to use that\ncoverage is left to the individual employee and her physician,\nto be made in private, with no participation by the employer.\nAlthough funds from the company health plan are being used\nto facilitate that choice, no objective observer would attribute\nthat choice to the company, let alone its owner. See Gilardi, 2013\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5854246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *30 (Edwards, J., concurring in part & dissent-\ning in part).\n    Finally, it is worth considering the ramifications of deeming\none choice that may be made by an employee using her\nworkplace healthcare plan to be a burden on her employer’s\nfree exercise rights. Again, what the ACA compels a covered\nemployer to provide is not a contraceptive care plan but a\ncomprehensive health care plan that includes thousands of\nmedical services, including contraceptive care. It may seem\nboth possible and reasonable to carve out the coverage of\ncontraceptives from the rest of the ACA-mandated insurance\nplan, in that the plaintiffs have a categorical objection to the\nuse of contraceptives (insofar as they are used to prevent\ncontraception) and the contraception mandate itself stands out\nin that it requires coverage of contraceptives without copay-\nment by the employee.12 (I suspect that as a matter of public\ndiscourse, if not judicial treatment, the fact that contraceptive\ncare implicates both sex and women, also has something to do\nwith the reason why the contraception mandate seems differ-\nent from other provisions of the ACA.) However, as I have\npointed out previously, a given employer might find any\n\n\n12\n   It is misleading, however, to say, as many reports do, that the mandate\nrequires the coverage of contraceptives at no cost to the employee, given\nthat most employees pay some portion of the cost of their workplace health\ninsurance. See supra n.10. Many other preventive and screening healthcare\nservices are likewise to be provided to the employee without a copayment\nunder the ACA. See http://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-\ncare-benefits (listing 15 categories of preventive care to be covered with no\ncopayments for all insureds, 22 categories of such care for women, and 25\ncategories for children) (last visited Nov. 7, 2013).\n\f130                                               Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nnumber of those services, either categorically or situationally,\ninconsistent with his or her religious beliefs. If, as the court\ntoday holds, it is a substantial burden on an employer’s free\nexercise rights to compel him to insure a form of medical care\nto which he objects on religious grounds, then all manner of\ninsured medical services are subject to challenge under RFRA.\nSee Gilardi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5854246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *32 (Edwards, J., concurring in\npart & dissenting in part).\n   Nor, logically, would the potential objections that employ-\ners could raise be limited to health insurance. Federal law\ngrants any number of rights to employees, the recognition and\naccommodation of which an employer might find to be\ninconsistent with his religious beliefs. My hypothetical about\nextending FMLA leave to a gay parent is but one example.\nLikewise, beyond the employer-employee relationship, there\nmay be any number of federal rights bestowed on third\nparties—customers, vendors, creditors, debtors—to which the\nowner of a business theoretically might pose a religious\nobjection. Today’s decision certainly opens the door to chal-\nlenging the enforcement of those rights against a business as a\nburden on the free exercise rights of its owner.13\n\n\n13\n  The variety of government requirements that individuals, businesses, and\nreligious organizations have challenged on free exercise grounds makes this\nclear.

The constitutional provision invoked is the\n     due process clause of the Fourteen Amendment\n     governing the states, as the due process clause\n     invoked in the Adkins Case governed Congress. In\n     each case the violation alleged by those attacking\n     minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation\n     of freedom of contract. What is this freedom? The\n     Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.\n     It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of\n     liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting\n     that deprivation, the Constitution does not recognize\n     an absolute and uncontrollable liberty. Liberty in\n     each of its phases has a history and connotation. But\n     the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organi-\n     zation which requires the protection of law against\n     the evils which menace the health, safety, morals,\n     and welfare of the people. Liberty under the Consti-\n     tution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of\n     due process, and regulation which is reasonable in\n     relation to its subject and is adopted in the interest\n     of the community is due process.\nId. at 391, 57 S.Ct. at 581–82. In concluding that the minimum-\nwage law fell within this broad police power, and did not\nimpermissibly intrude upon the rights of employers, the Court\nquoted approvingly from Justice Holmes’ dissent in Adkins:\n     This statute does not compel anybody to pay any-\n     thing. It simply forbids employment at rates below\n     those fixed as the minimum requirement of health\n     and right living. It is safe to assume that women will\n\f136                                       Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n      not be employed at even the lowest wages allowed\n      unless they earn them, or unless the employer’s\n      business can sustain the burden. In short the law in\n      its character and operation is like hundreds of so-\n      called police laws that have been up-held.\nId. at 396–97, 57 S.

Ct. at 406 (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n    What the plaintiffs’ claim has in common with the Lochner\njurisprudence is that it elevates the daily affairs of a secular,\nfor-profit corporation to constitutional status, treating the\nbusiness as the embodiment of its owners’ religious principles,\nsuch that a burden on the corporation is conceived of as a\nburden on the religious rights of the corporate owners. In this\nway, a statutory mandate that is amply justified by the govern-\nment’s police power, which falls solely on the corporation, and\nwhich requires the owners to do absolutely nothing in their\npersonal lives that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs, is\nnonetheless deemed to be an impermissible intrusion upon the\nexercise of their constitutionally protected religious beliefs. The\nburden, so conceived, is then used as the springboard for\noverruling a neutral, generally-applicable statutory provision\nthat Congress has deemed necessary to protect the rights of\nothers.\n    When the Kortes and the Grotes chose to enter the business\nworld, they did not surrender their free exercise rights, but\nthey did assume responsibility for the regulatory obligations\nimposed on all like businesses, including statutory obligations\nto their employees.

Like any secular\nemployer in a religiously pluralistic nation, the Kortes and the\nGrotes must realize that their companies employ individuals\nwho do not share their own religious beliefs and who may\nchoose to use their wages and benefits in ways that are\noffensive to those beliefs. As a matter of both common sense\nand legal reasoning, no one would plausibly treat those choices\nas the Kortes’ and Grotes’ own decisions, or as a meaningful\nburden on the exercise of their religious rights. What the ACA\nimposes on employers is an obligation to provide employee\nhealth insurance that covers a standard, comprehensive set of\nbenefits. How an individual employee uses those benefits is up\nto her; she not only earns the insurance through her labor but\ntypically contributes a significant portion of her wages to pay\nfor it. Her choices will be guided by, among other things, her\nown religious principles. Although an employer, in conveying\nthe benefits she has earned, no doubt facilitates those choices,\nher freedom to make choices that are inconsistent with the\nemployer’s own religious beliefs imposes nothing like a\n\f138                                            Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nsubstantial burden on the employer’s practice of religion.14\nOnly by extending the scope of an employer’s exercise of\nreligion far beyond his own belief, worship, and conduct to the\nconduct of his employees, can we conceive of the insurance\nbenefits provided to employees as an undue burden on the free\nexercise rights of the company owners. This is, in my view, far\nbeyond what Congress had in mind when it enacted RFRA.\n                                     6.\n    If it were necessary to reach the second prong of the RFRA\ninquiry, I would find that the contraception mandate is\nsupported by a compelling governmental interest. The court\nchides the government for not making more of a case in this\nrespect. But, to my mind, the nature and the weight of the\ninterests supporting the mandate are obvious. In this regard,\nI view this case as materially no different from Lee, in which\nthe court found the government’s interest in a national social\nsecurity system sufficiently compelling to warrant infringe-\nment on an Amish employer’s religious interests by requiring\nhim to pay into the system.\n\n\n\n\n14\n     As Judge Edwards has pointed out:\n     No Free Exercise decision issued by the Supreme Court has\n     recognized a substantial burden on a plaintiff’s religious exercise\n     where the plaintiff is not himself required to take or forgo action\n     that violates his religious beliefs, but is merely required to take\n     action that might enable other people to do things that are at odds\n     with the plaintiff’s religious beliefs.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5854246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *29 (emphasis in original).\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                        139\n\n    The government has an obvious and compelling interest in\nbroadening Americans’ access to health insurance. That all\nAmericans have a keen interest in access to medical goods and\nservices is beyond question. As the costs of both health care\nand health insurance have risen substantially in recent decades\nand the number of workplace insurance plans has declined, the\nneed for health insurance reform has become more urgent. In\n2010, the year that the ACA was enacted, some 50 million\nAmericans lacked health insurance—roughly 18 percent of the\nnon-elderly population.

Obtaining insurance in the individual\nmarket was expensive: In 2010, average monthly per-person\npremiums in the individual market for health insurance ranged\nfrom a low of $136 in Alabama to $437 in Massachusetts, for a\nnationwide average of $215 (more than $2,500 per year).

Kaiser Family Foundation, State Health Facts, Average Monthly\nPer Person Premiums in the Individual Market, available at\nhttp://http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/\nindividual-premiums/ (last visited Nov. 7, 2013). Needless to\nsay, many individuals and families—those who could afford\nthe premiums—spent far more. At the same time, medical\ndebtors—whether uninsured or underinsured—were becom-\ning a much larger share of those filing for bankruptcy. See\nDavid U. Himmelstein, et al., Medical Bankruptcy in the United\nStates, 2007: Results of a National Study, 122 AM. J. MED. (No. 8)\n741 (Aug. 2009).

It builds upon the American tradition of employer-\nsponsored health insurance that began in the early 20th\ncentury. See, e.g., David Blumenthal, Employer-Sponsored Health\nIns. in the U.S.—Origins and Implications, 355 NEW ENGLAND J.\nMED. No. 1, 82 (July 6, 2006). It takes advantage of risk-spread-\ning, economies of scale, quality control, and other features of\nemployer-procured insurance. And, although this was the\nwork of a Democratic President and Congress, it had the\nadvantage of having been first proposed by a Republican\nPresident—Nixon—nearly 40 years ago. See Special Message\nfrom President Richard M. Nixon to the Congress Proposing a\nComprehensive Health Insurance Plan (Feb. 6, 1974), available\nat http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4337\n(last visited Nov. 7, 2013). My intention here is neither to\nvalidate nor endorse the ACA as policy—that is not within my\npurview—but merely to recognize that it embodies rational\nchoices and that the road leading to those choices has been a\nlong and difficult one.\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                         141\n\n    Compelling government interests in both preventive health\ncare and gender equality support the inclusion of contracep-\ntives within the mandated coverage that insurance\nplans—including employer-sponsored plans—must provide\nwithout copayment by the insured. As the court has noted,\nincluded with the standard coverage required of all non-\ngrandfathered health plans are a series of preventive services\nthat must be provided to all adults without copayment,\nincluding immunizations for tetatanus, meningitis, measles,\ninfluenza, hepatitis B, and other communicable diseases;\nscreening for high cholesterol, diabetes, HIV infection, high\nblood pressure, colorectal cancer, and other potentially life-\nthreatening conditions; and both screening and counseling for\nalcohol abuse, tobacco use, and obesity. See\nhttp://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-\nbenefits (last visited Nov. 7, 2013). The rationale behind\nrequiring coverage of such services without copayment is\nobvious: these are services which either prevent illness\naltogether or facilitate detection at an earlier stage when it is\nmore amenable to treatment, thereby reducing the direct and\nindirect costs of illness otherwise borne by the insured, his\nfamily, his employer, his insurer, medical providers, and the\ngovernment. The Women’s Health Amendment to the ACA,\nspearheaded by U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski, expanded the\nrange of requisite preventive care to include a separate set of\npreventive services for women. In proposing the amendment,\nSenator Mikulski noted that many women forego preventive\nscreenings for the conditions that statistically are most likely to\nresult in their death—breast, cervical, colorectal, ovarian and\nlung cancer, and heart and vascular disease—either because\n\f142                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nthey lack insurance, the services are not covered by their\ninsurance plans, or because the large copayments required by\ntheir insurance companies for these screenings are beyond\ntheir financial means. “Women of childbearing age incur 68\npercent more out of pocket health care costs than men,” she\npointed out. “My amendment guarantees access to critical\npreventive screening and care for women to combat their\nnumber one killers and provides it at no cost. This amendment\neliminates a big barrier of high copayments.” Press release:\nMikulski Puts Women First in Health Care Debate (November 30,\n2009), available at http://www.mikulski.senate.gov/media/\npressrelease/11-30-2009-2.cfm (last visited Nov. 7, 2013); see also\nJessica Arons & Lindsay Rosenthal, Center for American\nProgress, Facts About the Health Insurance Compensation Gap\n(June 2012) (“Even with employer-based coverage, women\nhave higher out-of-pocket medical costs than men.

At\nthe very least, it is unlikely that any such plan will be estab-\nlished in the near future. Putting that aside, we must consider\nthat the entire point of the Women’s Health Amendment to the\nACA was to redress a history of gender-based inequalities in\nhealthcare and health insurance. Carving out from the stan-\ndard insurance coverage mandated by the ACA a type of\nhealthcare that a panel of experts has determined to be vital to\nthe health needs of women, and saying that it must be pro-\nvided for separately, reinforces the very disparities that\nmotivated the Amendment. Additional transaction costs surely\nwill attend the creation of a separate plan devoted to contra-\nception, be it a public option or a set of tax incentives, and the\nsegregation of this form of healthcare from standard insurance\ncoverage will stigmatize both these services and the employees\nwho wish to access them.15 This could hardly be more inconsis-\ntent with the intent underlying the Women’s Health Amend-\nment. Cf. Romer v. Evans, supra, 517 U.S. at 630–31, 116 S. Ct. at\n\n\n15\n    A woman would either have to enroll in a government program\ndedicated to providing contraceptive insurance coverage, establish a\nrelationship with a government-subsidized contraceptive manufacturer, or\nclaim credits for the purchase of contraception on her income tax return.\nEach alternative, aside from imposing extra burdens on her to obtain\ncontraceptive coverage, singles her out as a sexually-active woman who\nwishes to use contraception.\n\f148                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\n1626–27 (observing that state constitutional provision foreclos-\ning to gays and lesbians the protections of nondiscrimination\nlaws imposes a unique disability on that class of individuals);\nUnited States v.

As I have now pointed out several times, the\ncontraception mandate is merely one requirement in a compre-\nhensive set of requirements that the statute imposes on all\nhealth plans, and as I have discussed, there are any number of\nmedical services that health plans cover and medical choices\nthat an insured might make to which a particular employer\nmight object on religious grounds. Logically, the court’s\ndecision to relieve Korte & Luitjohan Contractors and Grote\nIndustries of the contraception mandate cannot be limited to\ncontraception alone. The relevant question, then, is not\nwhether the government feasibly may ensure access to\ncontraceptive care through other means, but whether it may\nfeasibly ensure access to all types of care to which employers\nmight object on religious grounds. The answer to that is\nobvious: it is not feasible to expect the government to establish\na public insurance option that picks up responsibility for the\ncrazy-quilt of individual services that any individual employer\nmight find incompatible with his individual religious beliefs.\n   The Supreme Court remarked in Lee that “[r]eligious beliefs\ncan be accommodated, but there is a point at which accommo-\ndation would ‘radically restrict the operational latitude of the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                          149\n\nlegislature.’” 455 U.S. at 259, 102 S. Ct. at 1056 (quoting\nBraunfeld, 366 U.S. at 606, 81 S. Ct. at 1147) (additional citations\nomitted). In a pluralistic society with many religions and even\nmore variants of religious beliefs, it would be impossible to\nmove toward a system of universal healthcare that relies\nsubstantially on employer-sponsored health insurance while\npermitting corporate owners with objections to particular types\nof health services or specific decisions about how to use those\nservices to exclude them from workplace health plans. Even if\nthe government chose instead to pursue universal healthcare\nthrough the means of an entirely publicly-funded, single-payer\nsystem of health insurance, corporate owners as taxpayers\nwould still be facilitating contraception and other healthcare\nservices to which they object. The decision in Lee makes clear\nthat the government would not be required to accommodate\nreligious-based objections where the program in question is\nfunded through general revenues. Indeed, the Kortes’ counsel\nconceded at oral argument that even an employer tax dedi-\ncated to a public program underwriting contraception might\nbe upheld under Lee’s analysis. Taxpayer funding facilitates\ncontraception just as much as any other means of financing.\nGranted, by making the government the middleman, taxpayer\nfinancing separates a corporate owner from his employee’s use\nof contraception. But as I have already pointed out, in the\ncontext of employer-financing of insurance, the corporate form,\nthe health plan’s separate identity, third-party administration\nof the health plan, and the private choices of employees and\ntheir physicians, similarly place corporate owners at a remove\nfrom an employee’s decision to use contraception. Insisting on\nan exception in one setting but not the other makes no sense,\n\f150                                     Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\nwhen in both cases corporate owners are lending support to a\ntype of healthcare they find objectionable, but in neither case\nare they in any meaningful sense a party to an individual’s\ndecision to use that service.\n    The exemptions already provided for in the ACA neither\nundermine the compelling nature of the government’s interests\nin broadening Americans’ access to healthcare and ensuring\nthat women have comprehensive healthcare nor do they make\nreligious-based exemptions any more reasonable or feasible.\nFirst, given the financial burdens associated with workplace\nhealth plans, exempting employers with fewer than 50 full-\ntime employees from the obligation to provide insurance is an\nentirely practical, logical, and justifiable accommodation to the\nfinancial needs of small employers, particularly in the first\nphase of a national effort to expand access to healthcare.\nIndividuals who work for those employers, like part-time\nemployees, self-employed individuals, and unemployed\nindividuals are steered to the insurance exchanges established\nunder the ACA, where the government offers subsidies to\nthose who cannot shoulder the full cost of insurance on their\nown. Likewise, grandfathering existing workplace health plans\nfollows a time-honored and common-sensical path in expedit-\ning the implementation of a new, complex, and potentially\nburdensome regulation. Employees participating in those\nplans by definition already have health insurance, so the\naccommodation to employers represented by this exemption\ndoes not unduly burden employees nor undermine the central\ngoal of the legislation. Existing plans will lose the benefit of\nthis exemption as they make major changes to their health\nplans that, inter alia, reduce benefits or increase costs to\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                                151\n\nemployees. 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g). There is no reason to think\nthis will take long for most employers,16 given the cost and\ncomplexity of insuring a broad range of healthcare and the\nmarket forces which prompt employers to make such revisions\non a regular basis; and, again, in the absence of such changes,\nemployees remain covered by the grandfathered plans, so the\ngoal of access to health insurance is served. Odds are, many of\nthese grandfathered plans already cover contraceptive care to\nsome degree.

Nw. Indian Cemetery\nProtective Ass’n, Justice O’Connor had this to say about the\nlimited reach of the free exercise clause:\n      However much we might wish that it were other-\n      wise, government simply could not operate if it\n      were required to satisfy every citizen’s religious\n      needs and desires. A broad range of government\n      activities—from social welfare programs to foreign\n      aid to conservation projects—will always be consid-\n      ered essential to the spiritual well-being of some\n      citizens, often on the basis of sincerely held religious\n      beliefs. Others will find the same activities deeply\n      offensive, and perhaps incompatible with their own\n      search for spiritual fulfillment and with the tenets of\n      their religion. The First Amendment must apply to\n      all citizens alike, and it can give to none of them a\n      veto over public programs that do not prohibit the\n\fNos. 12-3841 & 13-1077                                           153\n\n     free exercise of religion. The Constitution does not,\n     and courts cannot, offer to reconcile the various\n     competing demands on government, many of them\n     rooted in sincere religious belief, that inevitably\n     arise in so diverse a society as ours.

Furthermore,\nthe conduct for which the Kortes and the Grotes seek an\nexemption is their conduct as corporate owners in the commer-\ncial world; moreover, it is also conduct that implicates the\nrights of third parties—their employees. The reach of the free\nexercise clause in this setting is quite limited, whereas the\ngovernment’s interests in pursuing the uniform application of\n\f154                                      Nos. 12-3841 & 13-1077\n\na religiously-neutral statute promoting the rights of employees\nis quite strong.\n    The court’s holding granting the Kortes and the Grotes,\nalong with their two secular corporations, a religiously-based\nexemption from an insurance mandate represents a dramatic\nturn in free exercise jurisprudence for all of the reasons I have\ndiscussed.
