Because we hold that Warrick produced no\nevidence either that she suffered a sufficiently adverse employment action\namounting to discriminatory treatment, or that Motiva retaliated against a protected\nactivity, we do not reach the remainder of Motiva’s summary judgment grounds.\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      Warrick has been an employee at a refinery, now owned by Motiva, for over\nforty years. Currently, Motiva employs Warrick as a timekeeper. Warrick is the\nhighest paid timekeeper at the refinery.\n\n      In 2011, Motiva expected its timekeepers to arrive between 5:30 a.m. and\n7:00 a.m. At the time, Warrick was working a “9/80 Schedule,” which required\nher to work nine hours per day Monday through Thursday, and eight hours every\nother Friday. Warrick’s normal shift was from approximately 6:00 a.m. until 3:00\npm.\n\n      In April of 2011, during a meeting with her physician, Warrick “report[ed]\nbeing able to work 6–7 hours per day due to eye discomfort.” Her condition was\ndiagnosed as a left cranial nerve palsy. Warrick’s physician recommended that she\nnot drive at night, which she reported to Motiva. Warrick requested to report to\nwork at 7:00 a.m., after the sun rose. Motiva agreed to move Warrick’s start time\n\n\n                                           2\n\fto 7:00 a.m., but required her to continue working nine hours per day Monday\nthrough Thursday. 2 Warrick’s physician lifted the restriction on driving at night in\nAugust 2011.\n\n        On October 25, 2011, Warrick filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission. Warrick’s complaint alleged that Motiva employs three\nblack female payroll clerks, including herself, and one white male payroll clerk,\nand that the “white male is given preferential treatment and allowed to come and\ngo as he pleases . . . . We are forced to either make up our time or take vacations\ntime off. He is allowed to take long lunch breaks without taking vacation time\noff.”\n\n        Warrick further alleged that she had been “bullied” for 15 years, including\nthe most recent incident in which she was sent an e-mail including information\nabout a “book for ‘Dummies’” and later found a “dummy.txt” file on her computer.\nWarrick alleged that she had reported the matter to HR and was told the e-mail was\nintended for someone else. Warrick also alleged that she had developed a serious\nmedical condition and was unable to work, but felt that she was forced to return to\nwork and that she was not reasonably accommodated upon her return. Warrick\nalleged that her supervisor informed her that she could not report to work until the\nsun came up, and denied her request to be paid for her time that she could not\nreport to work.\n\n        In addition, Warrick alleged that she had “tried to resolve the racial\nharassment and workplace bullying through internal complaints” and that she had\nsent e-mail complaints to certain executives. Warrick alleged that she “believe[s\nshe] has been discriminated against based on [her] race (Black), not reasonably\n\n        2\n        Including her half-hour unpaid lunch break, this schedule would require Warrick to\nwork from 7:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.\n\n                                            3\n\faccommodated, and retaliated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as\namended.”\n\n      Motiva responded to the charge in December 2011.                In response to\nWarrick’s allegations regarding her eye condition, Motiva claimed that in such\ncircumstances, it does not pay nonexempt employees for hours not worked, but\nthat it fully accommodated Warrick’s medical restriction, allowing her to begin\nand end her shift during daylight hours.         Motiva also claimed that it had\ninvestigated Warrick’s claims regarding the white male employee and found data\nto support Warrick’s claims that he had taken longer lunch breaks and left work\nearlier than his schedule permitted. Motiva denied preferential treatment for the\nmale employee, however, as their supervisor had not authorized either the lunches\nnor early departures.      The employee was disciplined as a result of the\ninvestigation.3\n\n      On January 16, 2012, Warrick sent an e-mail to several high-ranking\ncompany executives, including a Vice President of Shell Oil Company and the\nChairman of the Board of Shell. The majority of Warrick’s e-mail described her\nbelief that Lee Poulter, a human resources manager at Motiva, was serially\nbullying her, which she defined as “when one employee targets another employee\nand repeatedly harasses them.” Warrick believed that Poulter had an investigator\nbreak into her home. Warrick accused Poulter of having stolen “a report from an\nInvestigator Company” and having placed a snake in her bed under the covers.\nWarrick also suggested that Poulter had arranged for her new pocket knife to fall\nout of the box it was packaged in, and that he had put twelve holes in one of her\n\n      3\n         Motiva reprimanded the other employee and required him to pay back the time he\nmissed in vacation hours.\n\n                                          4\n\ftires.\n\n         In the last two paragraphs of her e-mail, Warrick alleged that there was\nanother employee in her office “who has stolen time and overtime.” Warrick\nclaimed that she “wrote the EEOC about how the employee works approximately 7\nhours a day and get[s] paid for 9 hours.” Warrick alleged that the male employee\nhad stopped stealing time after a meeting with his supervisor and the human\nresources manager in December 2011, but that the employee’s behavior deserved\naction. Warrick also claimed she did not want anything to happen to the employee,\nbut that she had exercised her “rights as an American citizen.”\n\n         On January 24, Warrick was told that the company was concerned about her\nfitness for duty because her e-mail “contained some very serious and very unusual\nallegations about the company generally and . . . Poulter specifically.” Motiva\ninformed Warrick that it was requiring her to meet with a doctor, who would\nconduct an initial examination of her fitness for duty and may require her to meet\nwith a specialist to make a final assessment of her fitness for duty. Motiva\ninformed Warrick that she would be placed on paid disability leave until the\ncompany had a final assessment of her fitness for duty, but that she would be\nplaced on unpaid leave if she refused to see either the doctor or any specialist to\nwhom he may refer her. Motiva also told Warrick that failing to meet with either\nthe doctor or a recommended specialist “may lead to discipline, up to and\nincluding discharge.”\n\n         Warrick met with the doctor and was referred to a specialist. Specific\nreferral questions included (1) whether Warrick presented a physical risk to herself\nor others at the workplace and if so, the nature of the potential harm; (2) whether\nthere was anything the employer could do that might reduce such a threat; (3)\nwhether a psychiatric problem existed that would likely prevent Warrick from\n\n                                         5\n\fsafely and competently performing necessary job tasks; and (4) whether the\nspecialist had any suggestions to help the Motiva management team work\neffectively with Warrick.\n\n      Warrick filed a grievance with her union on February 7. Warrick asserted in\nher grievance letter that she was disciplined without just cause because she was\nrequired to meet with the doctor as a result of the e-mail she wrote on January 16.\nWarrick claimed that no one from the company had previously warned her that\nwriting letters was misconduct and could lead to her being disciplined. Warrick\nstated that she would not have written the letter if she had known she would be\nsubject to disciplinary action. Warrick also asserted that the comparison between\nMotiva’s actions regarding her and another employee who was called into the\nhuman resource manager’s officer for discipline illustrated her disparate treatment,\nbecause his violation was more serious but she received the more serious response\nfrom Motiva.\n\n      Warrick met with the specialist on February 17, and he submitted a report to\nMotiva on February 26. The specialist determined that Warrick presented a risk of\nphysical violence relative to the general population, but that the risk was negligible\nat the time of the evaluation. The specialist did not recommend time off for\nWarrick, but did provide suggestions for future relations between Warrick and\nMotiva. The specialist indicated that “[s]etting limits on what is appropriate is\nvery important,” including “clear instructions on the use of emails. If [Warrick]\nhas specific complaints, [Warrick] should know who to put her complaints to in\nwriting, rather than sending emails to a variety of individuals.” The specialist\nrecommended that Motiva “should avoid arguing with [Warrick] about her\nconcerns and continue to direct [Warrick] to the appropriate channels available to\nfollow through with her complaints if she believes management is not doing their\n\n                                          6\n\fpart.” The specialist cautioned that further action from Motiva may be appropriate\nif Warrick “demonstrate[d] an inability to stop sending inappropriate emails.”\n\n       On March 20, 2012, Motiva provided Warrick with a letter containing\nconditions for her return to duty. Motiva informed Warrick that if she failed to\nfollow the guidelines set out in the letter, she would be subject to disciplinary\naction that could include termination of her employment. The letter claimed that\nWarrick had “been making essentially the same harassment claims since 1999” and\nthat “[t]hese claims must stop now.” The letter further provided that Warrick was\nprohibited “from making any similar claims to any Motiva/Shell representative”\nand that she would “not be allowed to send emails, letters or initiate telephone\nconversations to anyone in Motiva/Shell with regard to similar harassment claims.”\nThe letter gave Warrick a “strictly established protocol”4 to follow in the event “a\nnew issue arises which is not similar or not connected to [her] previous claims.”\nThe letter did not provide any guidelines for determining whether future\ncomplaints were similar or connected to Warrick’s previous claims.\n\n       Warrick filed the present lawsuit in July 2012. Warrick asserted that Motiva\nunlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of her race and its perception that\nshe had a disability, as well as unlawfully retaliated against her for opposing\nMotiva’s discriminatory practices, in violation of Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor\nCode. 5 Motiva filed a traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\nMotiva contended that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Warrick’s\n       4\n        The protocol restricted Warrick to reporting new issues to a specifically designated\nemployee in Shell’s Equal Opportunity Department and provided the employee’s telephone\nnumber.\n       5\n         “Courts have referred to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the Texas Commission on\nHuman Rights Act (TCHRA or CHRA); however, the Comission on Human Rights has been\nreplaced with the Texas Workforce Commission civil rights division.” Waffle House, Inc. v.\nWilliams, 313 S.W.3d 796, 798 n.1 (Tex. 2010). We refer to the chapter as “the TCHRA” or\n“the Act.”\n\n                                             7\n\fclaims of disparate treatment on the basis of race and disability because she had\nnot suffered an adverse employment action. Motiva contended it was entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law on Warrick’s retaliation claims because her January 16\ne-mail cannot be regarded as protected activity under the TCHRA, and she was not\nsubject to an adverse employment action as a result.\n\n      In response, Warrick contended that she was subject to adverse employment\naction “when she was denied the same leave and pay package as her similarly\nsituated white coworker.” Warrick also contended that forcing her to undergo a\npsychiatric evaluation, take disability leave, and submit to restrictive conditions\nupon her return was an adverse employment action.          Warrick contended she\nengaged in protected activity “when she complained to Defendant via email about\noccurrences which she believed to be discrimination against her.”\n\n      The trial court granted Motiva’s motion for summary judgment and entered\na take nothing judgment for Warrick. The trial court denied and dismissed all of\nWarrick’s claims. This appeal followed.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n      Warrick raises three issues on appeal. In her first two issues, Warrick\ncontends the trial court erred in granting Motiva’s hybrid traditional and no-\nevidence motion for summary judgment regarding her claims of disparate\ntreatment on the basis of race and perceived disability. In her third issue, Warrick\ncontends the trial court erred in granting Motiva’s hybrid traditional and no-\nevidence motion regarding her retaliation claim. We consider the evidence as to\neach claim in turn.\n\nI.    Standard of review\n      We review a trial court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.            Lyda\n\n                                          8\n\fSwinerton Builders, Inc. v. Cathay Bank, 409 S.W.3d 221, 229 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. filed). In reviewing a summary judgment, “we\ntake as true all evidence favorable to the non[-]movant and we indulge every\nreasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the non[-]movant’s favor.” Joe v.\nTwo Thirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 157 (Tex. 2004). “Evidence is\nconclusive only if reasonable people could not differ in their conclusions.” Brown\nv. Hearthwood II Owners Ass’n Inc., 201 S.W.3d 153, 159 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied).\n\n       A defendant may prove entitlement to traditional summary judgment by\nconclusively negating at least one essential element of each of the plaintiff’s\ntheories of recovery. Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex.\n1997) (internal citation omitted). In a traditional motion for summary judgment,\nthe movant defendant has the initial burden of “demonstrat[ing] that no genuine\nissues of material fact exist and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\nLyda Swinerton Builders, Inc., 409 S.W.3d at 229. If the movant does so, the\nburden then shifts to the non-movant plaintiff to produce evidence sufficient to\nraise a fact issue. Id.\n\n       “In a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, the movant represents that\nthere is no evidence of one or more essential elements of the claims for which the\nnon-movant bears the burden of proof at trial.” Dias v. Goodman Mfg. Co., L.P.,\n214 S.W.3d 672, 676 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). A\ndefendant moving for a no-evidence summary judgment may prevail by alleging\nthat there is no evidence of an essential element for each of the plaintiff’s claims.\nSw. Elec. Power Co. v. Grant, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2002). To survive\nsummary judgment, the non-movant plaintiff then has the burden to present more\nthan a scintilla of evidence as to the challenged elements, i.e. evidence that would\n\n                                          9\n\fenable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Grant v.\nJoe Myers Toyota, Inc., 11 S.W.3d 419, 422 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2000, no pet.).\n\n       When the trial court does not specify the grounds on which it relied in\ngranting summary judgment, we will affirm the summary judgment if any grounds\npresented in the motion are meritorious. Olmstead v. Napoli, 383 S.W.3d 650, 652\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.).\n\nII.    Warrick failed to provide more than a scintilla of evidence that she\n       suffered an adverse employment action on the basis of her race or the\n       perception that she has a disability.\n       The TCHRA prohibits employers from taking actions that adversely affect\nan employee, whether on the basis of race or the perception that the employee has\na disability, or with the purpose of retaliating against the employee for opposing\ndiscriminatory practices. Tex. Labor Code Ann. §§ 21.002(6) 21.051, 21.055\n(West 2006 & Supp. 2014). Often, direct evidence of discriminatory intent does\nnot exist, and plaintiffs must rely on the burden-shifting mechanism articulated in\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973), 6 to obtain a\npresumption of discrimination by meeting the initial burden of establishing a prima\nfacie case of discrimination. Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 372\nS.W.3d 629, 634 (Tex. 2012).\n\n       A plaintiff’s prima facie case of unlawful employment discrimination\nconsists of proof that (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an\nadverse employment action, and (3) non-protected class employees were not\n\n\n       6\n         Because one of the purposes of the TCHRA is to execute the policies of Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments, we consult analogous federal statutes\nand cases interpreting them in our interpretation of the TCHRA. Quantum Chem. Corp. v.\nToennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex. 2001).\n\n                                              10\n\ftreated similarly. Flores v. City of Liberty, 318 S.W.3d 551, 554 (Tex. App.—\nBeaumont 2010, no pet.); Winters v. Chubb & Son, Inc., 132 S.W.3d 568, 574\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.). Although the ultimate burden of\npersuasion remains with the employee, once the employee has made a prima facie\ncase, the McDonnell–Douglas mechanism shifts the burden of production to the\nemployer to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the disparate\ntreatment. Gonzalez v. Champion Technologies, Inc., 384 S.W.3d 462, 466 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.); Flores, 318 S.W.3d at 554.\n\n      The Act “does not address every decision made by employers that arguably\nmight have some tangential effect on employment decisions.” Navy v. Coll. of the\nMainland, 407 S.W.3d 893, 899 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.).\nBecause the need for prophylactic measures is greater in the context of claims of\nretaliation than claims of discriminatory conduct, see Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry.\nCo. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006), the TCHRA distinguishes between the two\ntypes of claims. See Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 901 (citing Burlington N. & Santa Fe\nRy. Co., 548 U.S. at 67). A narrower range of employer conduct constitutes an\n“adverse employment action” in the context of a claim of disparate treatment on\nthe basis of a prohibited characteristic. Id.\n\n      With respect to a claim of disparate treatment, an employer commits an\nunlawful employment practice if the employer “limits, segregates, or classifies an\nemployee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to\ndeprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\nother manner the status of an employee” on the basis of a prohibited characteristic\nsuch as race or the perception that the employee is disabled. See Tex. Labor Code\nAnn. §§ 21.002(6), 21.051, 21.055; see also City of Houston v. Proler, 437 S.W.3d\n529, 532–33 (Tex. 2014). The prohibitions on discriminatory treatment address\n\n                                           11\n\f“ultimate employment decisions,” including those “involv[ing] hiring, granting\nleave, discharging, promoting, and compensation” and require the employee to\nshow more than an action “which might jeopardize employment in the future.”\nNavy, 407 S.W.3d at 899 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Here, Motiva challenged Warrick’s ability to meet her initial burden of\nestablishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment on the basis of either race or\nthe perception that she had a disability. In its motion for no-evidence summary\njudgment, Motiva contended Warrick could not establish a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact either that she was subjected to an adverse ultimate employment\ndecision or that a similarly situated employee in a non-protected class received\ndifferent treatment. We hold that Warrick failed to produce more than a scintilla of\nevidence that Motiva subjected her to an adverse employment action, and therefore\ndo not consider whether similarly situated employees received disparate treatment.\n\n      Warrick contends that she produced evidence of an adverse employment\naction for her claim of discrimination based on a perceived disability because\nMotiva’s request that she submit to psychological examinations “would well have\ndissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\ndiscrimination.” As discussed above, however, the prima facie case in the context\nof a claim of discriminatory conduct requires evidence of an adverse action that\nwould amount to an “ultimate employment decision,” such as those involving\n“hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensation.” Navy, 407\nS.W.3d at 899 (internal quotation marks omitted).         Warrick has not offered\nevidence that either the psychological assessments or her placement on paid\ndisability leave during the pendency of the assessments have had any impact on\nthose conditions of her employment.\n\n      With respect to race, Warrick contends that she was subject to adverse\n\n                                         12\n\femployment actions “when she was denied the same leave and pay package as her\nsimilarly situated white coworker.” Although “ultimate employment decisions” do\nencompass decisions regarding compensating employees and granting leave, see\nid., even if we were to assume that Warrick and her white co-worker were equally\nqualified, Warrick has not shown that either her leave or her compensation were\nadversely affected. Warrick herself alleges that the other employee was not using\nhis vacation hours, not that her white co-worker received a superior vacation\npackage.      Furthermore, the evidence establishes that Warrick and her co-worker\nwere expected to work the same number of hours within the same time period, and\nthat Warrick received a higher salary than the other employee for the required\nhours.\n\n         Warrick did allege that the employee worked fewer hours than the schedule\nrequired, but she acknowledges that following her request, the rules were enforced\nuniformly. 7 Warrick contends, however, that we should not consider Motiva’s\nlater uniform enforcement of the rules because Motiva “only acted upon Warrick’s\ncomplaints in order to avoid the appearance of unequal treatment.” This argument\nfails because there is no evidence in our record that Motiva had such an intent. See\nMission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 373 S.W.3d at 634 (holding that Texas courts\naccept the “two alternative methods of proof in discriminatory treatment cases” of\ndirect intent evidence and the McDonnell–Douglas presumption).                     Warrick is\nessentially asking us to relieve her of her burden to show the established\n\n         7\n          Warrick also contends that Motiva “had previous knowledge of [the employee’s]\nadjusted schedule,” but she has not produced any evidence other than her own assertions that\nMotiva was aware that her white coworker took extended lunches or left work early prior to its\ninvestigation. Cf. Winters, 132 S.W.3d at 576 (“An employee’s own subjective belief of\ndiscrimination, no matter how genuine, cannot serve as the basis for judicial relief.”) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Similarly, there is no evidence in the record to support Warrick’s\nassertion that had she not complained, the other employee “would still be working the adjusted\nhourly schedule without any assertion of breaking the rules.”\n\n                                               13\n\fcircumstances from which we could presume that Motiva had a discriminatory\nintent, see id., and instead infer Motiva’s desire to treat her unequally from its\nactions to negate any unequal treatment. That is not a permissible method of\nproving her claim.\n\n      Because Warrick has not provided more than allegations that she suffered an\nadverse employment action amounting to an ultimate employment decision, we\noverrule Warrick’s first two issues and affirm the summary judgment on Warrick’s\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n   III.   Warrick failed to present more than a scintilla of evidence that her\n          January 16 e-mail was protected activity under the TCHRA’s\n          provision against retaliation.\n      Turning to Warrick’s retaliation claim, she alleged that she suffered an\nadverse employment action—consisting of being put on disability leave, forced to\nundergo psychological assessments, and given special conditions for her return to\nwork—because of her January 16 e-mail. Because we hold the e-mail did not\narticulate opposition to any conduct made unlawful under the TCHRA, and\ntherefore was not a protected activity, we do not reach the question whether a\nreasonable employee would consider the complained-of actions materially adverse.\n\n      The TCHRA prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against\nan employee who “(1) opposes a discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a\ncharge; (3) files a complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner\nin an investigation proceeding or hearing.” Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.055. To\nestablish a prima facie case of retaliation under the TCHRA, an employee must\nshow that “(1) he participated in protected activity, (2) his employer took an\nadverse employment action against him, and (3) a causal connection existed\nbetween his protected activity and the adverse employment action.” Brewer v.\n\n\n                                          14\n\fColl. of the Mainland, 441 S.W.3d 723, 729 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014,\nno pet.). As with claims of disparate treatment, the burden then shifts to the\nemployer to rebut the presumption of retaliation “by articulating a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.” Thomas v. Clayton\nWilliams Energy, Inc., 2 S.W.3d 734, 739 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999,\nno pet.) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802).\n\n      Regardless of whether the employee has already filed a formal complaint,\n“actionable retaliation exists when an employer makes an adverse employment\ndecision against an employee who voices opposition to conduct made unlawful\nunder the [T]CHRA.” City of Waco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 152 (Tex. 2008).\nThe prohibition against retaliation protects against a broader category of employer\nactivity than the prohibitions against disparate treatment, extending to “actions that\na reasonable employee would have found materially adverse.” Navy, 407 S.W.3d\nat 901. A materially adverse employment action is one that is “likely to deter\nvictims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and their\nemployers.”    Id. at 901–902 (internal quotation marks omitted) (holding a\n“negative peer evaluation would not deter a reasonable victim of discrimination\nfrom complaining about the discriminatory conduct”).\n\n      Applying these principles to the evidence, we begin with the first element of\na prima facie case: participation in protected activity. An employee complaining\nof discrimination may be engaged in protected activity. The employee must offer\nevidence that she had a reasonable belief that the employer’s opposed practice was\nunlawful, and the employee must show more than a “vague charge of\ndiscrimination” to “invoke protection under the statute.” Azubuike v. Fiesta Mart,\nInc., 970 S.W.2d 60, 65 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.). The\nemployee must put the employer on notice that the employee is opposing practices\n\n                                         15\n\fthat the she believes constitute prohibited discrimination. E.g., Chandler v. CSC\nApplied Technologies, LLC, 376 S.W.3d 802, 823–824 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2012, no pet.) (plaintiff did not engage in protected activity by complaining\nhe was “‘eligible’ to go on [a] trip, but not specifically informing . . . management\nthat he believed his race was the reason why he was not included”); Martinez v.\nWilson Cnty., No. 04-09-00233-CV, 2010 WL 114407, at *3 (Tex. App.—San\nAntonio 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (“A complaint of unfair treatment and\nharassment does not put the employer on notice that the complaint was based on\n. . . sexual discrimination.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Brown v.\nUnited Parcel Serv., Inc., 406 F. App’x 837, 840 (5th Cir. 2010) (“Magic words\nare not required, but protected opposition must at least alert an employer to the\nemployee’s reasonable belief that unlawful discrimination is at issue.”); Harris–\nChilds v. Medco Health Solutions, Inc., 169 Fed. App’x. 913, 916 (5th Cir. 2006)\n(holding appellant produced no evidence that “when she made her complaints to\nmanagement, [she] ever mentioned that she felt she was being treated unfairly due\nto her race or sex”).\n\n      Here, Warrick has not alleged that Motiva retaliated against her for engaging\nin the protected activity of making complaints to her union or the EEOC. Instead,\nWarrick alleged that she “engaged in protected activity when she complained to\nDefendant via email about occurrences which she believed to be discrimination\nagainst her.” Warrick acknowledges that Motiva’s summary judgment motion\nchallenged the absence of an explicit complaint of racial or disability\ndiscrimination in the e-mail, but contends that her interrogatory responses “clearly\nindicate that her intent in sending the email was to oppose discrimination and\nharassment.”\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      The TCHRA proscribes retaliation against employees who voice opposition\nto discriminatory practices, however. Cf. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 152. An employer\ncannot retaliate against an employee for voicing opposition to discriminatory\npractices if the employee has not actually voiced such opposition. Cf. Dias, 214\nS.W.3d at 679 (rejecting an “exten[sion] of the statute’s scope to situations in\nwhich the employer only perceives the plaintiff has engaged in protected activity”).\nTherefore, the relevant inquiry is not Warrick’s intentions in sending the e-mail,\nbut whether her opposition to proscribed discriminatory practices was discernible\nin the e-mail itself. E.g. Harris-Childs, 169 F. App’x at 916 (holding plaintiff\nfailed to demonstrate “that she put the employer on notice that her complaint was\nbased on racial or sexual discrimination”). We conclude that it was not.\n\n      Aside from alleging that Poulter “had his investigators following the wrong\nperson,” Warrick’s e-mail does not identify any manner in which her treatment\ndiffered from the other employee’s. Although Warrick asserts on appeal that her e-\nmail referred to the other employee “being treated differently than her for years,”\nthe e-mail itself merely describes the other employee’s “stealing time.” The e-mail\nstates that Warrick “wrote the EEOC about how the [other] employee works\napproximately 7 hours a day and gets paid for 9.” Warrick’s e-mail sufficiently\naccuses her co-worker of unethical conduct, but it does not compare his\ncircumstances to Warrick’s own.       Cf. Brewer, 441 S.W.3d       at 729 (holding\nemployee must show “his employer took an adverse employment action against\nhim” (emphasis added)). The paragraph at issue gives the impression that Warrick\nis concerned that “what this employee has [done] deserves . . . action” rather than\nbeing concerned about her own relative treatment. All of Warrick’s complaints\nregarding her own treatment relate to Poulter’s alleged serial bullying, not to her\nco-worker’s “stealing time.”\n\n\n                                        17\n\f      Moreover, Warrick’s email does not allege that either her co-worker’s\ntreatment or the alleged bullying against her were based on a protected\ncharacteristic such as race or perceptions of disability. The email does not mention\neither her own race or the other employee’s race, nor does it mention Warrick’s\neye condition. The e-mail also does not claim that any of Poulter’s alleged actions\nagainst her, including having an investigator follow her, were based on Warrick’s\nrace or any perception that Warrick had a disability.\n\n      Nor does Warrick’s assertion that she had exercised her “rights as an\nAmerican citizen” convey any belief that she was being discriminated against on\nthe basis of her race or a disability. At most, the e-mail shows that Warrick\nmentioned she was communicating with the EEOC about another employee who\nwas not working his scheduled hours, not that Warrick was communicating\nopposition to practices made unlawful under the TCHRA. Although the record\nalso shows that Warrick had filed complaints with the EEOC prior to sending the\nJanuary 16 e-mail, Warrick does not identify an EEOC complaint in the e-mail that\nmight otherwise put Motiva on notice that Warrick’s e-mail was an attempt to\nvoice opposition to conduct she reasonably believed was unlawful under the\nTCHRA, as opposed to what she reasonably believed was unethical employee\nconduct.\n\n      For these reasons, we hold that Warrick failed to produce more than a\nscintilla of evidence that writing the e-mail constituted protected activity by\n“voic[ing] opposition to conduct made unlawful under the [T]CHRA.” Lopez, 259\nS.W.3d at 152.     We therefore overrule Warrick’s third issue and affirm the\nsummary judgment on her retaliation claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n\n       Having overruled each of appellant’s issues, we affirm the judgment of the\ntrial court.\n\n\n\n                                     /s/    J.

Because we hold that Warrick produced no\nevidence either that she suffered a sufficiently adverse employment action\namounting to discriminatory treatment, or that Motiva retaliated against a protected\nactivity, we do not reach the remainder of Motiva’s summary judgment grounds.\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      Warrick has been an employee at a refinery, now owned by Motiva, for over\nforty years. Currently, Motiva employs Warrick as a timekeeper. Warrick is the\nhighest paid timekeeper at the refinery.\n\n      In 2011, Motiva expected its timekeepers to arrive between 5:30 a.m. and\n7:00 a.m. At the time, Warrick was working a “9/80 Schedule,” which required\nher to work nine hours per day Monday through Thursday, and eight hours every\nother Friday. Warrick’s normal shift was from approximately 6:00 a.m. until 3:00\npm.\n\n      In April of 2011, during a meeting with her physician, Warrick “report[ed]\nbeing able to work 6–7 hours per day due to eye discomfort.” Her condition was\ndiagnosed as a left cranial nerve palsy. Warrick’s physician recommended that she\nnot drive at night, which she reported to Motiva. Warrick requested to report to\nwork at 7:00 a.m., after the sun rose. Motiva agreed to move Warrick’s start time\n\n\n                                           2\n\fto 7:00 a.m., but required her to continue working nine hours per day Monday\nthrough Thursday. 2 Warrick’s physician lifted the restriction on driving at night in\nAugust 2011.\n\n        On October 25, 2011, Warrick filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission. Warrick’s complaint alleged that Motiva employs three\nblack female payroll clerks, including herself, and one white male payroll clerk,\nand that the “white male is given preferential treatment and allowed to come and\ngo as he pleases . . . . We are forced to either make up our time or take vacations\ntime off. He is allowed to take long lunch breaks without taking vacation time\noff.”\n\n        Warrick further alleged that she had been “bullied” for 15 years, including\nthe most recent incident in which she was sent an e-mail including information\nabout a “book for ‘Dummies’” and later found a “dummy.txt” file on her computer.\nWarrick alleged that she had reported the matter to HR and was told the e-mail was\nintended for someone else. Warrick also alleged that she had developed a serious\nmedical condition and was unable to work, but felt that she was forced to return to\nwork and that she was not reasonably accommodated upon her return. Warrick\nalleged that her supervisor informed her that she could not report to work until the\nsun came up, and denied her request to be paid for her time that she could not\nreport to work.\n\n        In addition, Warrick alleged that she had “tried to resolve the racial\nharassment and workplace bullying through internal complaints” and that she had\nsent e-mail complaints to certain executives. Warrick alleged that she “believe[s\nshe] has been discriminated against based on [her] race (Black), not reasonably\n\n        2\n        Including her half-hour unpaid lunch break, this schedule would require Warrick to\nwork from 7:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.\n\n                                            3\n\faccommodated, and retaliated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as\namended.”\n\n      Motiva responded to the charge in December 2011.                In response to\nWarrick’s allegations regarding her eye condition, Motiva claimed that in such\ncircumstances, it does not pay nonexempt employees for hours not worked, but\nthat it fully accommodated Warrick’s medical restriction, allowing her to begin\nand end her shift during daylight hours.         Motiva also claimed that it had\ninvestigated Warrick’s claims regarding the white male employee and found data\nto support Warrick’s claims that he had taken longer lunch breaks and left work\nearlier than his schedule permitted. Motiva denied preferential treatment for the\nmale employee, however, as their supervisor had not authorized either the lunches\nnor early departures.      The employee was disciplined as a result of the\ninvestigation.3\n\n      On January 16, 2012, Warrick sent an e-mail to several high-ranking\ncompany executives, including a Vice President of Shell Oil Company and the\nChairman of the Board of Shell. The majority of Warrick’s e-mail described her\nbelief that Lee Poulter, a human resources manager at Motiva, was serially\nbullying her, which she defined as “when one employee targets another employee\nand repeatedly harasses them.” Warrick believed that Poulter had an investigator\nbreak into her home. Warrick accused Poulter of having stolen “a report from an\nInvestigator Company” and having placed a snake in her bed under the covers.\nWarrick also suggested that Poulter had arranged for her new pocket knife to fall\nout of the box it was packaged in, and that he had put twelve holes in one of her\n\n      3\n         Motiva reprimanded the other employee and required him to pay back the time he\nmissed in vacation hours.\n\n                                          4\n\ftires.\n\n         In the last two paragraphs of her e-mail, Warrick alleged that there was\nanother employee in her office “who has stolen time and overtime.” Warrick\nclaimed that she “wrote the EEOC about how the employee works approximately 7\nhours a day and get[s] paid for 9 hours.” Warrick alleged that the male employee\nhad stopped stealing time after a meeting with his supervisor and the human\nresources manager in December 2011, but that the employee’s behavior deserved\naction. Warrick also claimed she did not want anything to happen to the employee,\nbut that she had exercised her “rights as an American citizen.”\n\n         On January 24, Warrick was told that the company was concerned about her\nfitness for duty because her e-mail “contained some very serious and very unusual\nallegations about the company generally and . . . Poulter specifically.” Motiva\ninformed Warrick that it was requiring her to meet with a doctor, who would\nconduct an initial examination of her fitness for duty and may require her to meet\nwith a specialist to make a final assessment of her fitness for duty. Motiva\ninformed Warrick that she would be placed on paid disability leave until the\ncompany had a final assessment of her fitness for duty, but that she would be\nplaced on unpaid leave if she refused to see either the doctor or any specialist to\nwhom he may refer her. Motiva also told Warrick that failing to meet with either\nthe doctor or a recommended specialist “may lead to discipline, up to and\nincluding discharge.”\n\n         Warrick met with the doctor and was referred to a specialist. Specific\nreferral questions included (1) whether Warrick presented a physical risk to herself\nor others at the workplace and if so, the nature of the potential harm; (2) whether\nthere was anything the employer could do that might reduce such a threat; (3)\nwhether a psychiatric problem existed that would likely prevent Warrick from\n\n                                         5\n\fsafely and competently performing necessary job tasks; and (4) whether the\nspecialist had any suggestions to help the Motiva management team work\neffectively with Warrick.\n\n      Warrick filed a grievance with her union on February 7. Warrick asserted in\nher grievance letter that she was disciplined without just cause because she was\nrequired to meet with the doctor as a result of the e-mail she wrote on January 16.\nWarrick claimed that no one from the company had previously warned her that\nwriting letters was misconduct and could lead to her being disciplined. Warrick\nstated that she would not have written the letter if she had known she would be\nsubject to disciplinary action. Warrick also asserted that the comparison between\nMotiva’s actions regarding her and another employee who was called into the\nhuman resource manager’s officer for discipline illustrated her disparate treatment,\nbecause his violation was more serious but she received the more serious response\nfrom Motiva.\n\n      Warrick met with the specialist on February 17, and he submitted a report to\nMotiva on February 26. The specialist determined that Warrick presented a risk of\nphysical violence relative to the general population, but that the risk was negligible\nat the time of the evaluation. The specialist did not recommend time off for\nWarrick, but did provide suggestions for future relations between Warrick and\nMotiva. The specialist indicated that “[s]etting limits on what is appropriate is\nvery important,” including “clear instructions on the use of emails. If [Warrick]\nhas specific complaints, [Warrick] should know who to put her complaints to in\nwriting, rather than sending emails to a variety of individuals.” The specialist\nrecommended that Motiva “should avoid arguing with [Warrick] about her\nconcerns and continue to direct [Warrick] to the appropriate channels available to\nfollow through with her complaints if she believes management is not doing their\n\n                                          6\n\fpart.” The specialist cautioned that further action from Motiva may be appropriate\nif Warrick “demonstrate[d] an inability to stop sending inappropriate emails.”\n\n       On March 20, 2012, Motiva provided Warrick with a letter containing\nconditions for her return to duty. Motiva informed Warrick that if she failed to\nfollow the guidelines set out in the letter, she would be subject to disciplinary\naction that could include termination of her employment. The letter claimed that\nWarrick had “been making essentially the same harassment claims since 1999” and\nthat “[t]hese claims must stop now.” The letter further provided that Warrick was\nprohibited “from making any similar claims to any Motiva/Shell representative”\nand that she would “not be allowed to send emails, letters or initiate telephone\nconversations to anyone in Motiva/Shell with regard to similar harassment claims.”\nThe letter gave Warrick a “strictly established protocol”4 to follow in the event “a\nnew issue arises which is not similar or not connected to [her] previous claims.”\nThe letter did not provide any guidelines for determining whether future\ncomplaints were similar or connected to Warrick’s previous claims.\n\n       Warrick filed the present lawsuit in July 2012. Warrick asserted that Motiva\nunlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of her race and its perception that\nshe had a disability, as well as unlawfully retaliated against her for opposing\nMotiva’s discriminatory practices, in violation of Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor\nCode. 5 Motiva filed a traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\nMotiva contended that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Warrick’s\n       4\n        The protocol restricted Warrick to reporting new issues to a specifically designated\nemployee in Shell’s Equal Opportunity Department and provided the employee’s telephone\nnumber.\n       5\n         “Courts have referred to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the Texas Commission on\nHuman Rights Act (TCHRA or CHRA); however, the Comission on Human Rights has been\nreplaced with the Texas Workforce Commission civil rights division.” Waffle House, Inc. v.\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895233\"><a href=\"/opinion/895233/waffle-house-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 798 n.1 (Tex. 2010).

Motiva contended it was entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law on Warrick’s retaliation claims because her January 16\ne-mail cannot be regarded as protected activity under the TCHRA, and she was not\nsubject to an adverse employment action as a result.\n\n      In response, Warrick contended that she was subject to adverse employment\naction “when she was denied the same leave and pay package as her similarly\nsituated white coworker.” Warrick also contended that forcing her to undergo a\npsychiatric evaluation, take disability leave, and submit to restrictive conditions\nupon her return was an adverse employment action.          Warrick contended she\nengaged in protected activity “when she complained to Defendant via email about\noccurrences which she believed to be discrimination against her.”\n\n      The trial court granted Motiva’s motion for summary judgment and entered\na take nothing judgment for Warrick.

See Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 901 (citing Burlington N. & Santa Fe\nRy. Co., 548 U.S. at 67). A narrower range of employer conduct constitutes an\n“adverse employment action” in the context of a claim of disparate treatment on\nthe basis of a prohibited characteristic. Id.\n\n      With respect to a claim of disparate treatment, an employer commits an\nunlawful employment practice if the employer “limits, segregates, or classifies an\nemployee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to\ndeprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\nother manner the status of an employee” on the basis of a prohibited characteristic\nsuch as race or the perception that the employee is disabled. See Tex. Labor Code\nAnn. §§ 21.002(6), 21.051, 21.055; see also City of Houston v. Proler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">529</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532–33 (Tex. 2014). The prohibitions on discriminatory treatment address\n\n                                           11\n\f“ultimate employment decisions,” including those “involv[ing] hiring, granting\nleave, discharging, promoting, and compensation” and require the employee to\nshow more than an action “which might jeopardize employment in the future.”\nNavy, 407 S.W.3d at 899 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Here, Motiva challenged Warrick’s ability to meet her initial burden of\nestablishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment on the basis of either race or\nthe perception that she had a disability. In its motion for no-evidence summary\njudgment, Motiva contended Warrick could not establish a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact either that she was subjected to an adverse ultimate employment\ndecision or that a similarly situated employee in a non-protected class received\ndifferent treatment. We hold that Warrick failed to produce more than a scintilla of\nevidence that Motiva subjected her to an adverse employment action, and therefore\ndo not consider whether similarly situated employees received disparate treatment.\n\n      Warrick contends that she produced evidence of an adverse employment\naction for her claim of discrimination based on a perceived disability because\nMotiva’s request that she submit to psychological examinations “would well have\ndissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\ndiscrimination.” As discussed above, however, the prima facie case in the context\nof a claim of discriminatory conduct requires evidence of an adverse action that\nwould amount to an “ultimate employment decision,” such as those involving\n“hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensation.” Navy, 407\nS.W.3d at 899 (internal quotation marks omitted).         Warrick has not offered\nevidence that either the psychological assessments or her placement on paid\ndisability leave during the pendency of the assessments have had any impact on\nthose conditions of her employment.\n\n      With respect to race, Warrick contends that she was subject to adverse\n\n                                         12\n\femployment actions “when she was denied the same leave and pay package as her\nsimilarly situated white coworker.” Although “ultimate employment decisions” do\nencompass decisions regarding compensating employees and granting leave, see\nid., even if we were to assume that Warrick and her white co-worker were equally\nqualified, Warrick has not shown that either her leave or her compensation were\nadversely affected. Warrick herself alleges that the other employee was not using\nhis vacation hours, not that her white co-worker received a superior vacation\npackage.      Furthermore, the evidence establishes that Warrick and her co-worker\nwere expected to work the same number of hours within the same time period, and\nthat Warrick received a higher salary than the other employee for the required\nhours.\n\n         Warrick did allege that the employee worked fewer hours than the schedule\nrequired, but she acknowledges that following her request, the rules were enforced\nuniformly. 7 Warrick contends, however, that we should not consider Motiva’s\nlater uniform enforcement of the rules because Motiva “only acted upon Warrick’s\ncomplaints in order to avoid the appearance of unequal treatment.” This argument\nfails because there is no evidence in our record that Motiva had such an intent. See\nMission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 373 S.W.3d at 634 (holding that Texas courts\naccept the “two alternative methods of proof in discriminatory treatment cases” of\ndirect intent evidence and the McDonnell–Douglas presumption).                     Warrick is\nessentially asking us to relieve her of her burden to show the established\n\n         7\n          Warrick also contends that Motiva “had previous knowledge of [the employee’s]\nadjusted schedule,” but she has not produced any evidence other than her own assertions that\nMotiva was aware that her white coworker took extended lunches or left work early prior to its\ninvestigation. Cf. Winters, 132 S.W.3d at 576 (“An employee’s own subjective belief of\ndiscrimination, no matter how genuine, cannot serve as the basis for judicial relief.”) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Similarly, there is no evidence in the record to support Warrick’s\nassertion that had she not complained, the other employee “would still be working the adjusted\nhourly schedule without any assertion of breaking the rules.”\n\n                                               13\n\fcircumstances from which we could presume that Motiva had a discriminatory\nintent, see id., and instead infer Motiva’s desire to treat her unequally from its\nactions to negate any unequal treatment. That is not a permissible method of\nproving her claim.\n\n      Because Warrick has not provided more than allegations that she suffered an\nadverse employment action amounting to an ultimate employment decision, we\noverrule Warrick’s first two issues and affirm the summary judgment on Warrick’s\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n   III.   Warrick failed to present more than a scintilla of evidence that her\n          January 16 e-mail was protected activity under the TCHRA’s\n          provision against retaliation.\n      Turning to Warrick’s retaliation claim, she alleged that she suffered an\nadverse employment action—consisting of being put on disability leave, forced to\nundergo psychological assessments, and given special conditions for her return to\nwork—because of her January 16 e-mail. Because we hold the e-mail did not\narticulate opposition to any conduct made unlawful under the TCHRA, and\ntherefore was not a protected activity, we do not reach the question whether a\nreasonable employee would consider the complained-of actions materially adverse.\n\n      The TCHRA prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against\nan employee who “(1) opposes a discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a\ncharge; (3) files a complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner\nin an investigation proceeding or hearing.” Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.055. To\nestablish a prima facie case of retaliation under the TCHRA, an employee must\nshow that “(1) he participated in protected activity, (2) his employer took an\nadverse employment action against him, and (3) a causal connection existed\nbetween his protected activity and the adverse employment action.” Brewer v.\n\n\n                                          14\n\fColl. of the Mainland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729 (Tex.

A materially adverse employment action is one that is “likely to deter\nvictims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and their\nemployers.”    Id. at 901–902 (internal quotation marks omitted) (holding a\n“negative peer evaluation would not deter a reasonable victim of discrimination\nfrom complaining about the discriminatory conduct”).\n\n      Applying these principles to the evidence, we begin with the first element of\na prima facie case: participation in protected activity. An employee complaining\nof discrimination may be engaged in protected activity. The employee must offer\nevidence that she had a reasonable belief that the employer’s opposed practice was\nunlawful, and the employee must show more than a “vague charge of\ndiscrimination” to “invoke protection under the statute.” Azubuike v.

Instead,\nWarrick alleged that she “engaged in protected activity when she complained to\nDefendant via email about occurrences which she believed to be discrimination\nagainst her.” Warrick acknowledges that Motiva’s summary judgment motion\nchallenged the absence of an explicit complaint of racial or disability\ndiscrimination in the e-mail, but contends that her interrogatory responses “clearly\nindicate that her intent in sending the email was to oppose discrimination and\nharassment.”\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      The TCHRA proscribes retaliation against employees who voice opposition\nto discriminatory practices, however. Cf. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 152. An employer\ncannot retaliate against an employee for voicing opposition to discriminatory\npractices if the employee has not actually voiced such opposition. Cf. Dias, 214\nS.W.3d at 679 (rejecting an “exten[sion] of the statute’s scope to situations in\nwhich the employer only perceives the plaintiff has engaged in protected activity”).\nTherefore, the relevant inquiry is not Warrick’s intentions in sending the e-mail,\nbut whether her opposition to proscribed discriminatory practices was discernible\nin the e-mail itself. E.g. Harris-Childs, 169 F. App’x at 916 (holding plaintiff\nfailed to demonstrate “that she put the employer on notice that her complaint was\nbased on racial or sexual discrimination”). We conclude that it was not.\n\n      Aside from alleging that Poulter “had his investigators following the wrong\nperson,” Warrick’s e-mail does not identify any manner in which her treatment\ndiffered from the other employee’s. Although Warrick asserts on appeal that her e-\nmail referred to the other employee “being treated differently than her for years,”\nthe e-mail itself merely describes the other employee’s “stealing time.” The e-mail\nstates that Warrick “wrote the EEOC about how the [other] employee works\napproximately 7 hours a day and gets paid for 9.” Warrick’s e-mail sufficiently\naccuses her co-worker of unethical conduct, but it does not compare his\ncircumstances to Warrick’s own.       Cf. Brewer, 441 S.W.3d       at 729 (holding\nemployee must show “his employer took an adverse employment action against\nhim” (emphasis added)). The paragraph at issue gives the impression that Warrick\nis concerned that “what this employee has [done] deserves . . . action” rather than\nbeing concerned about her own relative treatment. All of Warrick’s complaints\nregarding her own treatment relate to Poulter’s alleged serial bullying, not to her\nco-worker’s “stealing time.”\n\n\n                                        17\n\f      Moreover, Warrick’s email does not allege that either her co-worker’s\ntreatment or the alleged bullying against her were based on a protected\ncharacteristic such as race or perceptions of disability. The email does not mention\neither her own race or the other employee’s race, nor does it mention Warrick’s\neye condition. The e-mail also does not claim that any of Poulter’s alleged actions\nagainst her, including having an investigator follow her, were based on Warrick’s\nrace or any perception that Warrick had a disability.\n\n      Nor does Warrick’s assertion that she had exercised her “rights as an\nAmerican citizen” convey any belief that she was being discriminated against on\nthe basis of her race or a disability. At most, the e-mail shows that Warrick\nmentioned she was communicating with the EEOC about another employee who\nwas not working his scheduled hours, not that Warrick was communicating\nopposition to practices made unlawful under the TCHRA. Although the record\nalso shows that Warrick had filed complaints with the EEOC prior to sending the\nJanuary 16 e-mail, Warrick does not identify an EEOC complaint in the e-mail that\nmight otherwise put Motiva on notice that Warrick’s e-mail was an attempt to\nvoice opposition to conduct she reasonably believed was unlawful under the\nTCHRA, as opposed to what she reasonably believed was unethical employee\nconduct.\n\n      For these reasons, we hold that Warrick failed to produce more than a\nscintilla of evidence that writing the e-mail constituted protected activity by\n“voic[ing] opposition to conduct made unlawful under the [T]CHRA.” Lopez, 259\nS.W.3d at 152.     We therefore overrule Warrick’s third issue and affirm the\nsummary judgment on her retaliation claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n\n       Having overruled each of appellant’s issues, we affirm the judgment of the\ntrial court.\n\n\n\n                                     /s/    J. Brett Busby\n                                            Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Boyce, Busby, and Wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f</pre>",
