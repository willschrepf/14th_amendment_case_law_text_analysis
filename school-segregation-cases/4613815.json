Compl.). According to Plaintiffs, this failure by the Treasury Department has led to—and,\n\nabsent correction, will continue to lead to—the infliction of an array of wrongs against the\n\nPalestinian people. Id. As a remedy, Plaintiffs seek an order requiring the Treasury Department\n\n“to . . . initiate an investigation into any and all tax-exempt entities based in America which\n\ntransmit $20,000 or more on an annual basis to any country in the world;” to “revoke the\n\n\n\n1\n  The amended complaint names former Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew as a defendant in\nthis case. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), the current Secretary of the\nTreasury, Steven Mnuchin, is automatically substituted in place of Secretary Lew.\n\fentit[ies’] tax-exempt status” where “appropriate;” and to “refer all tax fraud and money\n\nlaundering findings to the [Internal Revenue Service] and/or U.S. Department of Justice for\n\ncriminal prosecution.” Id. at 74–75.\n\n        Three motions are currently before the Court. First, Defendants move to dismiss the first\n\namended complaint for lack of Article III standing and for failure to state a claim. Dkt. 10 at 1–\n\n2. Second, Plaintiffs seek leave to file a second amended complaint, which would join five\n\nadditional plaintiffs and detail the harms that they have allegedly suffered (or will allegedly\n\nsuffer) due to Defendants’ failure to monitor the actions of the U.S.-based tax-exempt entities.\n\nDkt. 18. Finally, Sam Abrams, a U.S. taxpayer and resident of New York State, moves to\n\nintervene, asserting that, if the Treasury Department is required “to investigate pro-Israel\n\ncharities,” it should “also investigate . . . charities . . . hostile to Israel.” Dkt. 13 at 2–3. In\n\nopposing the latter two motions, Defendants extend their jurisdictional defense to the claims that\n\nthe five additional putative plaintiffs and Abrams seek to assert.\n\n        As explained below, the Court agrees that the existing Plaintiffs, the five additional\n\nputative plaintiffs, and Abrams all lack Article III standing. The Court, accordingly, will grant\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction, will deny\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion to file a second amended complaint as futile, and will deny Abrams’ motion\n\nfor leave to intervene on the ground that neither he nor any other party has standing to assert his\n\nproposed claim.\n\n                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Because Defendants “challenge[] the adequacy of [the first amended] complaint and\n\n[exhibits] to support [Plaintiffs’] standing,” the Court “accept[s] [their] well-pleaded factual\n\nallegations as true and draw[s] all reasonable inferences from those allegations in [Plaintiffs’]\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n \n\ffavor.” Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see also West v. Lynch, 845 F.3d\n\n1228, 1231 (D.C. Cir. 2017). The same standard applies, moreover, to the Court’s consideration\n\nof whether Plaintiffs’ proposed second amended complaint contains allegations sufficient to\n\nestablish Article III standing, or whether, instead, the proposed amendment is futile. See\n\nWilliams v. Lew, 819 F.3d 466, 471–73 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Because the issues presented in\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss and in their opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend\n\noverlap, and because the proposed second amended complaint is identical to the first amended\n\ncomplaint, save for the addition of one paragraph that details the allegations of the five plaintiffs\n\nseeking to join the suit, compare Dkt. 7 with Dkt. 18-2, the Court will focus on (and cite to) the\n\nfactual allegations set forth in the proposed second amended complaint.\n\nA.     Factual Allegations\n\n       Plaintiffs, a group of thirty-seven individuals, “join[ed] in this litigation” due to their\n\n“concerns” over the “explosive settlement expansion” by Israelis in the West Bank and East\n\nJerusalem. Dkt. 18-2 at 1–3, 8 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 6). They allege that organizations in the\n\nUnited States that were granted tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) based on their\n\n“‘charitable’ or ‘educational’ . . . nature[s]” actually serve as “financial ‘pass-throughs’” from\n\n“wealthy U.S. donors” to Israeli entities committed to “the forcible expulsion of indigenous non-\n\nJewish Palestinians,” the “theft of private property,” the malicious destruction of private\n\nproperty, and the “murder[]” of Palestinians. Id. at 4–5. Plaintiffs allege that the actions of these\n\nU.S. nonprofit organizations “violate[] numerous . . . [§] 501(c)(3) regulations” and “at least\n\neight federal criminal statutes.” Id. at 5–6. Plaintiffs also allege that, [d]espite the[se] rampant”\n\nviolations of law, the Treasury Department has “not challenged or revoked the[] tax-exempt\n\nstatus” of the “approximately 200 U.S. pro-Israeli-settlement [§] 501(c)(3) [organizations].” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n \n\fat 4–5. And Plaintiffs further allege that, because the Treasury Department has failed to\n\n“investigate the criminal activities that these tax-exempt entities have been funding or engaging\n\nin for at least the last [forty] years,” the entities continue “to openly solicit[] tax-deductible\n\ncontributions” in order to fund “the various settlements they have chosen to adopt.” Id. at 6.\n\n        Of the thirty-seven plaintiffs, the proposed second amended complaint contains specific\n\nallegations about only eight of them. As they also alleged in the first amended complaint,\n\nPlaintiffs allege that “John Doe” “has been concerned about [the Treasury Department’s] failure\n\nto monitor” the § 501(c)(3) organizations described above “for a number of years” and has\n\n“heard from various Palestinian friends and neighbors” about “the atrocities that are being\n\ncommitted” which, he asserts, are being “largely subsidized by the American taxpayer.” Id. at 9\n\n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 7). Plaintiffs allege that Susan Abulhawa is also “concerned about [the\n\nTreasury Department’s] ongoing failure to . . . prevent the criminal activities engaged in by th[e]\n\npro-settlement tax-exempt entities,” and, more significantly, that Israel “[has] dislocat[ed]” her\n\nfrom the “patch of earth” in Jerusalem “where [her] family ha[d] dwelt for centuries.” Id. at 10\n\n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 9). They further allege that Michael Several “has visited Israel on many\n\noccasions and [has] seen first-hand what settlement expansion has meant to the ordinary\n\nPalestinian citizen.” Id. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 10). And, they allege that Several, who has\n\nperformed “significant research on U.S. donors and pro-settlement tax-exempt entities,” “firmly\n\nbelieves that financial support rendered by” those entities has “promoted widespread violence\n\nagainst Palestinians” and has “perpetuated the environment and conditions that give[] rise to\n\nviolent resistance to the Israeli occupation.” Id. at 10–11 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10–11).\n\n        The proposed second amended complaint would add allegations about five more\n\nplaintiffs who seek to join the litigation. Most notably, Plaintiffs allege (or, more precisely, seek\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n \n\fleave to allege) that putative plaintiff Linda Kateeb “owns six plots of land in the West Bank;”\n\nthat an “Israeli settler organization . . . supported by funds provided by U.S. tax-exempt entities”\n\nrecently “purported to purchase two” of her plots from “violent Israeli settlers who had set up\n\noutposts on [her] land;” and that she “is worried that if [the Treasury Department] continues to\n\nallow so-called tax-exempt funds to flow to the organization, she will lose her remaining four\n\nplots of land.” Dkt. 18-2 at 11 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13(a)). Plaintiffs also seek leave to allege\n\nthat Abbas Hamideh “similarly has lost, and fears that he will continue to lose, . . . family land in\n\nthe West Bank” if U.S.-based nonprofits “are permitted to provide funds to violent settlers.” Id.\n\nThey seek leave to allege that Doa’a Abu Amer “lost fourteen family members when the Israeli\n\narmy bombed the daycare center [in Gaza] in which they sought refuge,” id. at 12 (Second Am.\n\nCompl. ¶ 13(b)), and that Ahmed Al-Zeer was “beaten by violent settlers while on his own\n\nproperty outside [of a] segregated settlement” in the West Bank, id. (Second Am. Compl.\n\n¶ 13(c)). Finally, Plaintiffs seek leave to allege that Danny Awad “lost the Christian center” he\n\nmanaged in the West Bank due to an “illegal transaction” involving “a settler organization and\n\nits U.S. backers.” Id. at 12–13 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13(d)).\n\n       Aside from these paragraphs detailing plaintiff-specific factual allegations, see id. at 9–13\n\n(Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 7–13), the remaining 113 numbered paragraphs of the proposed second\n\namended complaint include a litany of allegations of wrongdoing by the U.S.-based § 501(c)(3)\n\nentities that, Plaintiffs claim, the Treasury Department has failed to regulate. Among other\n\nallegations, the proposed second amended complaint addresses the “history of settlement\n\nexpansion funded by U.S. donors and tax-exempt entities,” id. at 15–25 (Second Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 18–34); the “United States public policy regarding settlement expansion activity;” id. at 26–\n\n30 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35–37), and the “statutory violations” that Plaintiffs contend that\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n \n\f“U.S. tax-exempt entities and their donors have all conspired to” commit, including money\n\nlaundering, wire fraud, racketeering, and “war crimes,” id. at 42–50 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 59–\n\n73). Plaintiffs claim that scores of § 501(c)(3) organizations have engaged in these purported\n\nviolations of law “with the express knowledge of” the Treasury Department and despite the\n\nDepartment’s duty “to ensure that the perpetrators of [such] activities . . . [are] sanctioned to the\n\nfullest extent of the law.” Id. at 72–73 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 111, 113).\n\nB.     Procedural History\n\n       Plaintiffs brought suit on December 16, 2015, Dkt. 1, and filed their first amended\n\ncomplaint on February 5, 2016, Dkt. 7. Then, on April 4, 2016—four days before Defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss the first amended complaint—Plaintiffs purported to file a second amended\n\ncomplaint adding five plaintiffs. Dkt. 9. Plaintiffs did not seek leave of the Court or consent\n\nfrom Defendants before doing so. In their reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss,\n\nDefendants argued that the Court “should disregard the second amended complaint” for failure to\n\ncomply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), but, “[o]ut of an abundance of caution,”\n\nthey nevertheless addressed the merits, arguing that the additional plaintiffs and allegations\n\nwould not cure the jurisdictional defects they had identified. Dkt. 16 at 3. Recognizing their\n\nprocedural misstep, Plaintiffs then moved for leave to file their second amended complaint,\n\narguing that granting them leave to file the proposed second amended complaint would not\n\nprejudice Defendants, would best serve judicial economy, and would be in the interest of justice.\n\nDkt. 18.\n\n       While the parties were briefing Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Abrams moved to\n\nintervene. Dkt. 13. He argues that, in the event that the Court “open[s] the floodgates” to\n\ncomplaints like the one filed by Plaintiffs, he should be permitted to seek an order compelling\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n \n\fDefendants to “investigate the tax status” of “charities that are hostile to Israel.” Id. at 2–3. The\n\nCourt ordered Defendants to respond to Abrams’s motion and, in particular, to address whether\n\nAbrams has standing to intervene. See Minute Order, May 21, 2016. In response, Defendants\n\nfiled a memorandum arguing that Abrams lacks standing and that, accordingly, he should not be\n\npermitted to intervene. Dkt. 17 at 2.\n\n                                    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA.     Motion to Dismiss Under 12(b)(1)\n\n       Because “[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, possessing only that power\n\nauthorized by Constitution and statute,” Gunn v. Minton, 133 S. Ct. 1059, 1064 (2013) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted), they have “an affirmative obligation to consider whether the constitutional and\n\nstatutory authority exist for [them] to hear each dispute” brought before them, James Madison\n\nLtd. ex rel. Hecht v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1092 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (quotation marks omitted). If\n\nthe “court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss\n\nthe action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\n\n       “[D]efect[s] of standing” constitute “defect[s] in subject matter jurisdiction.” Haase v.\n\nSessions, 835 F.2d 902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The “plaintiff bears the burden of . . . establishing\n\nthe elements of standing,” and each element “‘must be supported in the same way as any other\n\nmatter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of\n\nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.’” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 19 (quoting\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)). Accordingly, “[t]o survive a motion\n\nto dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim\n\n[of standing] that is plausible on its face.” Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\n\n(2009)) (alterations in original). “[T]hreadbare recitals of the elements of [standing], supported\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n \n\fby mere conclusory statements, [will] not suffice,” id. (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678) (second\n\nalteration in original), and the Court need not “assume the truth of legal conclusions” nor must it\n\n“‘accept inferences that are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint,’” id. (quoting\n\nIslamic Am. Relief Agency v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 728, 732 (D.C. Cir. 2007)).2\n\nB.     Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint Under Rule 15(a)\n\n       After a party has amended its complaint “once as a matter of course” pursuant to Rule\n\n15(a)(1), it may only further amend “with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s\n\nleave.” Fed R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Although courts “should freely give leave [to amend] when\n\njustice so requires,” id., in “deciding whether to allow a party to amend a complaint, . . . courts\n\nmay consider ‘undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated\n\nfailure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing\n\nparty by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment,’” Mahon v.\n\nAnesthesia Bus. Consultants, LLC, No. 15-cv-1227, 2016 WL 1452333, at *9 (D.D.C. April 13,\n\n2016) (quoting Forman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). “Courts may deny a motion to\n\namend a complaint as futile . . . if the proposed claim would not survive a motion to dismiss.”\n\nJames Madison Ltd., 82 F.3d at 1099.\n\nC.     Motion to Intervene Under Rule 24(b)(2)\n\n       “Permissive intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b), which\n\nprovides, in pertinent part, that . . . ‘the court may permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a\n\nclaim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.’” Aristotle\n\nInt’l, Inc. v. NGP Software, Inc., 714 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. 2010) (second alteration in\n\n\n\n2\n  Although a Court may “elicit information outside the pleadings” in “considering [a plaintiff’s]\nstanding under [Rule] 12(b)(1),” Haase, 835 F.2d at 908, the parties here have not requested that\nthe Court do so.\n                                                  8\n \n\foriginal). “In order to litigate a claim on the merits” under Rule 24(b), “the putative intervenor\n\nmust ordinarily present: (1) an independent ground for subject matter jurisdiction; (2) a timely\n\nmotion; and (3) a claim or defense that has a question of law or fact in common with the main\n\naction.” EEOC v. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., Inc., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1998). “In\n\nexercising its discretion” to decide whether permissive intervention is warranted, the Court\n\n“must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the\n\noriginal parties’ rights.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). “[P]ermissive intervention is an inherently\n\ndiscretionary enterprise,” and district courts are afforded “wide latitude” in determining whether\n\na third-party should be permitted to intervene. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., 146 F.3d at 1046.\n\n                                           III. ANALYSIS\n\nA.      Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) and Motion for Leave to Amend\n\n        The first two motions before the Court—Defendants’ motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for leave to file the proposed second amended complaint—raise the same threshold\n\nquestion: Are the factual allegations contained in either pleading, if accepted as true, sufficient\n\nto establish that at least one plaintiff or putative plaintiff has Article III standing to pursue this\n\nlitigation? If the first amended complaint fails this test, then it must be dismissed. And, if the\n\nproposed second amended complaint fails the test, the proposed amendment would be futile and,\n\nthus, the motion for leave to amend should be denied. The Court’s task in answering these\n\nquestions, moreover, is simplified by the fact that the proposed second amended complaint\n\ndiffers from the first amended complaint in only one meaningful way—the addition of\n\nallegations pertaining to the five additional plaintiffs that the proposed pleading seeks to join.\n\nBecause the Court concludes that, even if these additional allegations are considered, no plaintiff\n\nhas standing to pursue this action, the Court can consider—and resolve—both motions together.\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n \n\f       “Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to ‘actual cases or\n\ncontroversies between proper litigants.’” Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1010 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2014) (quoting Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 661 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc)).\n\nAmong other things, this means that the Court lacks power to resolve a dispute unless at least\n\none plaintiff has standing. See Del. Dep’t of Natural Res. & Envtl. Control v. EPA, 785 F.3d 1, 8\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2015). And, at the motion to dismiss stage, it means that “the plaintiff must\n\nsufficiently allege a ‘concrete and particularized’ injury that is ‘fairly traceable to the challenged\n\naction of the defendant’ and ‘likely’ to be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’” West, 845 F.3d\n\nat 1230 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61). “Injury in fact is the ‘invasion of a legally\n\nprotected interest which is . . . actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;’” the “‘causal\n\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of’ must be” attributable to the\n\ndefendant, “‘and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the\n\ncourt;’” and the injury must be redressable (or “‘likely’” redressable) “‘by a favorable decision.’”\n\nArpaio, 797 F.3d at 19 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561). Together, these three elements—injury\n\nin fact, causation, and redressability—constitute the “irreducible constitutional minimum of\n\nstanding.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\n\n       1. Injury in Fact\n\n       Defendants concede that the lead plaintiff, Susan Abulhawa, has alleged a “concrete and\n\nparticularized injury-in-fact”—namely, the loss of certain real property, Dkt. 10-1 at 14 n.2 —\n\nand they do not contest that the five plaintiffs added in the proposed second amended complaint\n\nhave also alleged concrete injuries in fact, see Dkt. 16 at 4. The Court need not resolve the\n\nquestion whether Abulhawa, the five additional putative plaintiffs, or any of the remaining thirty-\n\none plaintiffs have alleged cognizable injuries in fact, however, because none of the thirty-seven\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n \n\fplaintiffs and putative plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to meet the causation or\n\nredressability prongs of the governing standard. See West, 845 F.3d at 1235.\n\n       2. Causation\n\n       Defendants argue that “[P]laintiffs cannot establish a causal link between an alleged\n\ninjury and the challenged conduct;” that is, they have not alleged facts sufficient to “show that\n\nthe alleged criminal activity” carried out by the U.S.-based nonprofits in coordination with\n\nIsraeli settlers “would not have occurred but for the grant of, and failure to investigate or revoke,\n\ntax-exempt status by the United States.” Dkt. 10-1 at 15. Plaintiffs disagree, arguing that a\n\n“simple chain of causation” supports Kateeb’s claim to standing and that this same reasoning\n\napplies to other plaintiffs as well. Dkt. 15 at 8. As they explain the theory applicable to\n\nKateeb’s claims, two plots of land located in the West Bank belonging to Kateeb were\n\npurportedly sold to an “Israeli settler organization” by “violent Israeli settlers supported by funds\n\nprovided by U.S. tax-exempt entities (most likely American Friends of Bet El Yeshiva or\n\nChristian Friends of Israeli Communities).” Id. at 6. “The theft of . . . Kateeb’s property”—or,\n\nat the time, her father’s property—“would not have occurred” but for the following alleged\n\nevents: (1) the U.S. § 501(c)(3) “entities receive[d] massive donations from wealthy donors in\n\nthe United States;” (2) those entities “then transfer[ed] those monies abroad into . . . Israel-based\n\ncharity bank accounts;” (3) the Israel-based charities then transfered the “monies . . . to settler\n\nofficials;” (4) the “settler officials” then used the funds to “set up armed militia units;” and,\n\nfinally, (5) the militia units then injured Kateeb by “annex[ing]” her father’s land. Dkt. 15 at 8.3\n\n\n\n3\n  Plaintiffs allege similar chains of causation for other plaintiffs. For example, Amer alleges that\none U.S.-based § 501(c)(3) organization donated funds to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF); the\nIDF used those funds to “deploy its troops” for a bombing attack; and Amer’s family sustained\ninjuries as a result of one of those bombing attacks. Dkt. 15 at 10. Without the funds provided\nby the U.S. § 501(c)(3) organization, Amer alleges, the IDF’s “operations would have been\n                                                  11\n \n\fMost importantly for present purposes, all of this turned, in Plaintiffs’ view, on the predicate that\n\nthe Treasury Department did not exercise its authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of those\n\n§ 501(c)(3) organizations that provide funding to groups that support the Israeli settlers. In short,\n\n“[w]ithout having . . . [§] 501(c)(3) status bestowed on them by the [Internal Revenue Service],\n\nthese [U.S.-based] organizations would not have been able to solicit contributions and transfer\n\nfunds to the settlement[s],” which, in turn, would mean that those donated funds would not be\n\navailable “to arm violent settlers” or “fund the illegal theft of . . . property,” and, accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs would not have been injured. Id. at 8–9, 11.\n\n        Standing arguments of this type are not new. Most notably, the Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether a similar “chain of causation between the challenged Government conduct\n\nand the asserted injury” gave rise to constitutional standing in Allen v. Wright. 468 U.S. 737,\n\n759 (1984). There, “[p]arents of black public school children” alleged that “the Internal Revenue\n\nService (IRS) ha[d] not adopted sufficient standards and procedures to fulfill its obligation to\n\ndeny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools” and that, by this omission, the\n\nIRS “harm[ed] them directly and interfere[d] with the ability of their children to receive an\n\neducation in desegregated public schools.” Id. at 739–40. The parents’ theory was that: (1) the\n\nIRS’s conferral of tax-exempt status on schools that were admitting only white students\n\n“facilitate[d] the raising of funds to organize [such] schools and expand [the] existing schools;”\n\n(2) white students left desegregated public schools in order to attend these white-only private\n\n\n\n\ncurtailed,” and, possibly, he would not have sustained injuries due to the bombing attack. Id.\nSimilarly, Al-Zeer alleges that, but for contributions funneled through an American § 501(c)(3)\nto an Israeli settlement organization, the settlers never would have “been able to purchase [the]\nexpensive military hardware” they used to attack him. Id.\n                                                  12\n \n\fschools; and (3) the black children of the plaintiff parents were thereby deprived of the\n\nopportunity to attend desegregated schools. See id. at 746, 758 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In rejecting this theory, the Supreme Court concluded that the “line of causation between\n\n[the IRS’s] conduct and desegregation of [the black children’s] schools [wa]s attenuated at best,”\n\nid. at 757, and that the “links in the chain of causation . . . [we]re far too weak for the chain as a\n\nwhole to sustain [the parents’] standing,” id. at 759. The Court emphasized that the hypothesized\n\nchain of events “involve[d] numerous third parties”—for example, the “officials of racially\n\ndiscriminatory schools receiving tax exemptions and the parents of children attending such\n\nschools”—whose “independent decisions may not collectively have [had] a significant effect on\n\nthe ability of public school students to receive a desegregated education.” Id. at 759. Despite the\n\n“constitutional importance of curing” one of “the most serious injuries recognized in our legal\n\nsystem”—the “diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated school”—the\n\nCourt concluded that it could not redress plaintiffs’ injury because it was “not fairly traceable to\n\nthe Government conduct . . . challenge[d] as unlawful.” Id. at 756–57.\n\n        The same conclusion holds here. The chain of causation linking the Treasury\n\nDepartment’s alleged “failure to monitor” the § 501(c)(3) status of U.S.-based charities and the\n\ninjuries sustained by Plaintiffs “is attenuated at best,” id. at 759, and, as in Allen, that chain relies\n\non a series of speculative inferences about the “independent action[s] of some third part[ies] not\n\nbefore the [C]ourt,” id. at 757 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 42\n\n(1976)). Plaintiffs speculate, for example, that (1) the donors to the U.S.-based § 501(c)(3)\n\norganizations made their contributions only because those entities are tax-exempt; (2) the U.S.\n\ncharities would be unable to find alternative sources of funding; (3) the Israeli settlers could not\n\nobtain other sources of funding; and (4) absent the continued influx of funding from U.S.\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n \n\fcharities, the Israeli settlers would be unable to acquire new land and might even give up the land\n\nthat they currently possess. At each of these links, a third-party actor could break the causal\n\nchain—a donor might decide to donate to one of the U.S.-based § 501(c)(3) organizations\n\nbecause he or she supports its goals, not because it is tax exempt; other donors might take the\n\nplace of any donors who will contribute only to tax-exempt groups; the Israeli settlers may\n\nalready possess the “weapons” and “equipment” that they need to remain in the disputed areas;\n\nor they may be committed to staying put, regardless of the support they receive from U.S.-based\n\ncharities. Although, in general, the Court “must take the complaint’s allegations of facts,\n\nhistorical or otherwise demonstrable, as true,” that presumption does not extend to allegations,\n\nlike those at issue here, that speculate about future events and that purport to predict how third\n\nparties might someday react to changed circumstances. Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 21 (quotation marks\n\nomitted); Osborn v. Visa, Inc., 797 F.3d 1057, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ “reliance on the anticipated action[s] of unrelated third parties makes it\n\nconsiderably harder to show the causation required to support standing.” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 20.\n\n“Although ‘standing is not precluded’ in a case that turns on third-party conduct, ‘it is ordinarily\n\nsubstantially more difficult to establish,’” id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562), and the D.C.\n\nCircuit “ha[s] required ‘substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the government\n\npolicy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to causation,’” id. (quoting Nat’l\n\nWrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d 930, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). Here,\n\nPlaintiffs’ theory of causation is based on speculation upon speculation about how third parties\n\nmight act.\n\n       To be sure, the precise contours of Article III standing are “not susceptible of precise\n\ndefinition.” Allen, 468 U.S. at 751. But, as the Supreme Court explained in Allen v. Wright, this\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n \n\f“hardly leaves courts at sea” because individual cases can often be resolved “by comparing the\n\nallegations of the particular complaint to those made in prior standing cases.” Id. at 751–52.\n\nThat observation is particularly apt here because Allen itself provides such a close comparator to\n\nthe present case. Indeed, if anything, the chain of events that Plaintiffs posit is more attenuated\n\nand more uncertain than the one relied upon by the respondents—and rejected by the Supreme\n\nCourt—in Allen.\n\n        This case also finds a close comparator in Khalaf v. Regan, No. 83-cv-2963, 1985 WL\n\n392 (D.D.C. Jan. 8, 1985), a case that, like this one, was brought by a group of individuals\n\nseeking to challenge the tax-exempt status of a number of organizations that allegedly supported\n\nIsraeli settlement efforts in the West Bank. As in this case, some of the plaintiffs alleged that\n\nthey owned land in the West Bank that had “been confiscated by Israeli authorities” for use as\n\n“Jewish settlements” and that these “expropriations [had] been financed in substantial part with\n\nfunds obtained from contributions to the subject organizations.” Id. at *2. Relying on Allen, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing, id. at *3, and the D.C. Circuit\n\nconfirmed that “no sensible jurisprudence could allow th[at] case to proceed while disallowing\n\nfor want of standing cases like Allen” and others, Khalaf v. Regan, No. 85-5274, 1986 U.S. App.\n\nLEXIS 33734 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 19, 1986). Five years later, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that\n\nconclusion in Fulani v. Brady, 935 F.2d 1324, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1991). There, the D.C. Circuit\n\ncited Khalaf with approval and, more generally, observed that, “where a party is seeking simply\n\nto remove a third party’s entitlement to a tax exemption, the exemption likely will not bear\n\nsufficient links of traceability . . . to the alleged injury to warrant standing under Allen v.\n\nWright.” Id. There is nothing about the present case that would warrant an exception to this\n\ngeneral rule.\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n \n\f        The Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs—in both their amended complaint and\n\nproposed second amended complaint—have failed to carry their “burden of . . . establishing the\n\n[causation] element[] of standing.” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 19.\n\n        3. Redressability\n\n        Both the first amended and proposed second amended complaints fail for a second reason\n\nas well: Neither complaint alleges facts sufficient to meet the redressability prong of the\n\nstanding test. “Redressability examines whether the relief sought, assuming that the court\n\nchooses to grant it, w[ould] likely alleviate the particularized injury alleged by the plaintiff.”\n\nWest, 845 F.3d at 1235 (quoting Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 663–64). “The key word is\n\n‘likely,’” id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561), and thus “the prospect of obtaining relief from the\n\ninjury as a result of a favorable ruling” cannot be “too speculative,” Allen, 468 U.S. at 752. As\n\nwith the causation analysis, when redressability “depends on the unfettered choices made by\n\nindependent actors not before the court[] and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion\n\nthe courts cannot presume either to control or to predict, it becomes substantially more difficult\n\nto establish standing.” Scenic Am., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Trans., 836 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2016)\n\n(quotation marks omitted). “Courts do not lightly speculate how independent actors not before\n\nthem might” act, and, “[w]hen conjecture is necessary, redressability is lacking.” West, 845 F.3d\n\nat 1237 (quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n        The starting point in the redressability analysis is necessarily the relief sought. In this\n\ncase, that relief is purely prospective. Plaintiffs do not seek damages for any losses or injuries\n\nthey have already sustained, but rather seek or order (1) “requiring [the] Treasury [Department]\n\nto . . . initiate an investigation into any and all tax-exempt entities based in [the United States,]\n\nwhich transmit $20,000 or more on an annual basis to any country in the world” and requiring\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n \n\fthat the Department, “where appropriate, revoke the entit[ies’] tax-exempt status;” (2) requiring\n\nthat the Treasury Department “refer all tax fraud and money laundering findings to the IRS\n\nand/or U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution;” (3) requiring that the Treasury\n\nDepartment’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network “investigate the entities . . . who have\n\nengaged in [the alleged] money laundering activities;” and (4) requiring that the Treasury\n\nDepartment “initiate a long-overdue investigation of all of the financial sponsorship of and\n\ncommission of the [alleged] violent activities . . .on the part of U.S. tax exempt entities, their\n\ndonors, and [Israeli Defense Forces].” Dkt. 18-2 at 77–78.\n\n       For those plaintiffs alleging past injuries—for example, the loss of property already taken\n\nor a physical assault already suffered—an order from this Court compelling Defendants to\n\ninvestigate the § 501(c)(3) status of U.S.-based charities will do nothing to redress their alleged\n\ninjuries. Even if Defendants were to revoke the § 501(c)(3) status of U.S. entities, if any, found\n\nto have financially supported illegal activity in the West Bank or East Jerusalem, those actions\n\nwould not make Plaintiffs whole; neither the investigation, the revocation of tax-exempt status,\n\nnor even the prosecution of U.S. nonprofit organizations would result in the return of any\n\nillegally obtained property in the West Bank or East Jerusalem or in the payment of damages for\n\nphysical assaults that occurred in those territories. “Absent a sufficient likelihood that [they] will\n\nagain be wronged in a similar way,” Plaintiffs are “no more entitled to an injunction” or\n\ndeclaratory judgment than anyone else, and “a federal court may not entertain a claim by any or\n\nall citizens who no more than assert that certain” agency action—or inaction—is unlawful. City\n\nof Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983).\n\n       For Plaintiffs alleging future injuries —for example, Kateeb’s fear that “if [Defendants]\n\ncontinue[] to allow so-called tax-exempt funds to flow to [an Israeli settler] organization, she\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n \n\fwill lose her remaining four plots of land,” Dkt. 18-2 at 11 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13(a))—the\n\nredressability is a closer call, but only slightly closer. It is conceivable, Plaintiffs argue, that if\n\nthe Treasury Department investigates a particular U.S.-based § 501(c)(3) organization, the\n\nDepartment might revoke the organization’s tax-exempt status, which might decrease the\n\nfinancial contributions made to that organization, which might lead to fewer funds sent by that\n\norganization to Israeli-based nonprofits, which might lead those Israeli nonprofits to reduce\n\nexpenditures in support of West Bank or East Jerusalem settlers, who, in turn, might have fewer\n\nfunds to take steps that might ultimately injure Plaintiffs. But as this chain of inferences lays\n\nbare, the likelihood that the requested relief would actually redress an imminent harm to any of\n\nthe plaintiffs is both speculative and remote. It requires the Court to “pile conjecture on\n\nconjecture,” West, 845 F.3d at 1237, forcing it to assume, for example, that donors would stop\n\ncontributing funds to U.S.-based nonprofits stripped of their tax-exempt status; that Israel-based\n\nnonprofits would not find some other funding source to fill any gap created by a reduction in\n\nU.S. financial support; and, most importantly, that the individual actors—the settlers in the West\n\nBank and East Jerusalem—would refrain from taking actions that could injure Plaintiffs. Such\n\n“unadorned speculation as to the existence of a relationship between the challenged government\n\naction and the third-party conduct will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power.” Scenic\n\nAmerica, 836 F.3d at 50 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Plaintiffs can only “establish the redressability prong required for standing” if they can\n\nshow that the “declaratory judgment sought w[as] the sine qua non for, or would ‘significantly\n\nincrease [their] likelihood’ of” staving off the future injuries they detail in their proposed second\n\namended complaint. Hispanic Affairs Project v. Perez, 15-cv-1562, 2016 WL 4734350, at *9\n\n(D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2016) (quoting Lichoulas v. FERC, 606 F.3d 769, 775 (D.C. Cir. 2010)). Even\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n \n\faccepting the allegations contained in Plaintiffs’ proposed second amended complaint as true,\n\nthey have failed to satisfy the redressability requirement of Article III standing.\n\n                                          *       *       *\n\n       Because Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to meet two essential elements of\n\nconstitutional standing, the Court will grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended\n\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(1).4 Dkt. 10. For the same reasons, moreover, the Court will deny\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, Dkt. 18, as futile. See James\n\nMadison Ltd., 82 F.3d at 1099 (“Courts may deny a motion to amend a complaint as futile . . . if\n\nthe proposed claim would not survive a motion to dismiss.”).\n\nB.     Motion to Intervene Under Rule 24(b)\n\n       Finally, the Court addresses Abrams’s motion to intervene under Rule 24(b). See Dkt.\n\n13. “In order to litigate a claim on the merits under Rule 24(b)(2), the putative intervenor must\n\nordinarily present,” among other things, “an independent ground for subject matter jurisdiction.”\n\nEEOC v. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This requirement stems\n\n“from the basic principle that a court may not adjudicate claims over which it lacks subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction,” and because the “typical [third-party] movant asks the district court to\n\nadjudicate an additional claim on the merits.” Id. at 1046. Although it “remains an open\n\nquestion in this circuit whether Article III standing is required for permissive intervention,”\n\nDefenders of Wildlife v. Perciasepe, 714 F.3d 1317, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quotation marks and\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Because the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, it need not—and should not—address Defendants’ merits-based\narguments. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998) (“Without\njurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare the law,\nand when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact\nand dismissing the cause.” (quotation marks omitted)).\n                                                 19\n \n\falteration omitted), no amount of “flexibil[ity]” in the interpretation of Rule 24, see Nat’l\n\nChildren’s Center, Inc., 146 F.3d at 1045–46, can overcome the constitutional hurdle posed\n\nwhen no party to the litigation has standing and thus there is no “case or controversy” within the\n\nmeaning of Article III.\n\n       Here, no one—not even Abrams—argues that Abrams has sustained, or is likely to\n\nsustain, (1) an injury in fact (2) that is fairly traceable to the wrong he alleges (3) that would be\n\nredressed by a favorable ruling. To the contrary, Abrams asserts that “[i]t appears, based on\n\nprecedent, that the [o]riginal [p]laintiffs lack standing to assert their claims in this Court,” and he\n\nmerely asks that, “if this Court is of a mind to open the floodgates,” it should permit him to press\n\nhis claim as well. Dkt. 13 at 1–2. As explained above, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs lack\n\nstanding. That conclusion, moreover, extends with even greater force to Abrams, who has not\n\neven alleged that he has suffered, or is likely to suffer, a particularized injury in fact, much less\n\nthat any such injury is fairly traceable to the tax-exempt status of Doctors Without Borders or\n\nthat IRS review of that organization’s tax-exempt status would redress any such injury. The\n\n“floodgates” will thus remain closed to both Plaintiffs and Abrams.\n\n       The Court will, accordingly, deny Abrams motion for permissive intervention.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n \n\f                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       The Court will, accordingly, GRANT Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended\n\ncomplaint, Dkt. 10, DENY Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, Dkt.\n\n18, and DENY Abrams’s motion to intervene, Dkt. 13.\n\n       A separate order will issue.\n\n                                                   /s/ Randolph D.

Compl.). According to Plaintiffs, this failure by the Treasury Department has led to—and,\n\nabsent correction, will continue to lead to—the infliction of an array of wrongs against the\n\nPalestinian people. Id. As a remedy, Plaintiffs seek an order requiring the Treasury Department\n\n“to . . . initiate an investigation into any and all tax-exempt entities based in America which\n\ntransmit $20,000 or more on an annual basis to any country in the world;” to “revoke the\n\n\n\n1\n  The amended complaint names former Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew as a defendant in\nthis case.

Finally, Sam Abrams, a U.S. taxpayer and resident of New York State, moves to\n\nintervene, asserting that, if the Treasury Department is required “to investigate pro-Israel\n\ncharities,” it should “also investigate . . . charities . . . hostile to Israel.” Dkt. 13 at 2–3. In\n\nopposing the latter two motions, Defendants extend their jurisdictional defense to the claims that\n\nthe five additional putative plaintiffs and Abrams seek to assert.\n\n        As explained below, the Court agrees that the existing Plaintiffs, the five additional\n\nputative plaintiffs, and Abrams all lack Article III standing. The Court, accordingly, will grant\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction, will deny\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion to file a second amended complaint as futile, and will deny Abrams’ motion\n\nfor leave to intervene on the ground that neither he nor any other party has standing to assert his\n\nproposed claim.\n\n                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Because Defendants “challenge[] the adequacy of [the first amended] complaint and\n\n[exhibits] to support [Plaintiffs’] standing,” the Court “accept[s] [their] well-pleaded factual\n\nallegations as true and draw[s] all reasonable inferences from those allegations in [Plaintiffs’]\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n \n\ffavor.” Arpaio v.

Cir. 2017). The same standard applies, moreover, to the Court’s consideration\n\nof whether Plaintiffs’ proposed second amended complaint contains allegations sufficient to\n\nestablish Article III standing, or whether, instead, the proposed amendment is futile. See\n\nWilliams v. Lew, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 471–73 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Because the issues presented in\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss and in their opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend\n\noverlap, and because the proposed second amended complaint is identical to the first amended\n\ncomplaint, save for the addition of one paragraph that details the allegations of the five plaintiffs\n\nseeking to join the suit, compare Dkt. 7 with Dkt. 18-2, the Court will focus on (and cite to) the\n\nfactual allegations set forth in the proposed second amended complaint.\n\nA.     Factual Allegations\n\n       Plaintiffs, a group of thirty-seven individuals, “join[ed] in this litigation” due to their\n\n“concerns” over the “explosive settlement expansion” by Israelis in the West Bank and East\n\nJerusalem. Dkt. 18-2 at 1–3, 8 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 6). They allege that organizations in the\n\nUnited States that were granted tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) based on their\n\n“‘charitable’ or ‘educational’ . . . nature[s]” actually serve as “financial ‘pass-throughs’” from\n\n“wealthy U.S. donors” to Israeli entities committed to “the forcible expulsion of indigenous non-\n\nJewish Palestinians,” the “theft of private property,” the malicious destruction of private\n\nproperty, and the “murder[]” of Palestinians. Id. at 4–5. Plaintiffs allege that the actions of these\n\nU.S. nonprofit organizations “violate[] numerous . . . [§] 501(c)(3) regulations” and “at least\n\neight federal criminal statutes.” Id. at 5–6. Plaintiffs also allege that, [d]espite the[se] rampant”\n\nviolations of law, the Treasury Department has “not challenged or revoked the[] tax-exempt\n\nstatus” of the “approximately 200 U.S. pro-Israeli-settlement [§] 501(c)(3) [organizations].” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n \n\fat 4–5. And Plaintiffs further allege that, because the Treasury Department has failed to\n\n“investigate the criminal activities that these tax-exempt entities have been funding or engaging\n\nin for at least the last [forty] years,” the entities continue “to openly solicit[] tax-deductible\n\ncontributions” in order to fund “the various settlements they have chosen to adopt.” Id. at 6.\n\n        Of the thirty-seven plaintiffs, the proposed second amended complaint contains specific\n\nallegations about only eight of them. As they also alleged in the first amended complaint,\n\nPlaintiffs allege that “John Doe” “has been concerned about [the Treasury Department’s] failure\n\nto monitor” the § 501(c)(3) organizations described above “for a number of years” and has\n\n“heard from various Palestinian friends and neighbors” about “the atrocities that are being\n\ncommitted” which, he asserts, are being “largely subsidized by the American taxpayer.” Id. at 9\n\n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 7). Plaintiffs allege that Susan Abulhawa is also “concerned about [the\n\nTreasury Department’s] ongoing failure to . . . prevent the criminal activities engaged in by th[e]\n\npro-settlement tax-exempt entities,” and, more significantly, that Israel “[has] dislocat[ed]” her\n\nfrom the “patch of earth” in Jerusalem “where [her] family ha[d] dwelt for centuries.” Id. at 10\n\n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 9). They further allege that Michael Several “has visited Israel on many\n\noccasions and [has] seen first-hand what settlement expansion has meant to the ordinary\n\nPalestinian citizen.” Id. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 10). And, they allege that Several, who has\n\nperformed “significant research on U.S. donors and pro-settlement tax-exempt entities,” “firmly\n\nbelieves that financial support rendered by” those entities has “promoted widespread violence\n\nagainst Palestinians” and has “perpetuated the environment and conditions that give[] rise to\n\nviolent resistance to the Israeli occupation.” Id. at 10–11 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10–11).\n\n        The proposed second amended complaint would add allegations about five more\n\nplaintiffs who seek to join the litigation. Most notably, Plaintiffs allege (or, more precisely, seek\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n \n\fleave to allege) that putative plaintiff Linda Kateeb “owns six plots of land in the West Bank;”\n\nthat an “Israeli settler organization . . . supported by funds provided by U.S. tax-exempt entities”\n\nrecently “purported to purchase two” of her plots from “violent Israeli settlers who had set up\n\noutposts on [her] land;” and that she “is worried that if [the Treasury Department] continues to\n\nallow so-called tax-exempt funds to flow to the organization, she will lose her remaining four\n\nplots of land.” Dkt. 18-2 at 11 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13(a)). Plaintiffs also seek leave to allege\n\nthat Abbas Hamideh “similarly has lost, and fears that he will continue to lose, . . . family land in\n\nthe West Bank” if U.S.-based nonprofits “are permitted to provide funds to violent settlers.” Id.\n\nThey seek leave to allege that Doa’a Abu Amer “lost fourteen family members when the Israeli\n\narmy bombed the daycare center [in Gaza] in which they sought refuge,” id. at 12 (Second Am.\n\nCompl. ¶ 13(b)), and that Ahmed Al-Zeer was “beaten by violent settlers while on his own\n\nproperty outside [of a] segregated settlement” in the West Bank, id. (Second Am. Compl.\n\n¶ 13(c)). Finally, Plaintiffs seek leave to allege that Danny Awad “lost the Christian center” he\n\nmanaged in the West Bank due to an “illegal transaction” involving “a settler organization and\n\nits U.S. backers.” Id. at 12–13 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13(d)).\n\n       Aside from these paragraphs detailing plaintiff-specific factual allegations, see id. at 9–13\n\n(Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 7–13), the remaining 113 numbered paragraphs of the proposed second\n\namended complaint include a litany of allegations of wrongdoing by the U.S.-based § 501(c)(3)\n\nentities that, Plaintiffs claim, the Treasury Department has failed to regulate. Among other\n\nallegations, the proposed second amended complaint addresses the “history of settlement\n\nexpansion funded by U.S. donors and tax-exempt entities,” id. at 15–25 (Second Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 18–34); the “United States public policy regarding settlement expansion activity;” id. at 26–\n\n30 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35–37), and the “statutory violations” that Plaintiffs contend that\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n \n\f“U.S. tax-exempt entities and their donors have all conspired to” commit, including money\n\nlaundering, wire fraud, racketeering, and “war crimes,” id. at 42–50 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 59–\n\n73). Plaintiffs claim that scores of § 501(c)(3) organizations have engaged in these purported\n\nviolations of law “with the express knowledge of” the Treasury Department and despite the\n\nDepartment’s duty “to ensure that the perpetrators of [such] activities . . . [are] sanctioned to the\n\nfullest extent of the law.” Id. at 72–73 (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 111, 113).\n\nB.     Procedural History\n\n       Plaintiffs brought suit on December 16, 2015, Dkt. 1, and filed their first amended\n\ncomplaint on February 5, 2016, Dkt. 7. Then, on April 4, 2016—four days before Defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss the first amended complaint—Plaintiffs purported to file a second amended\n\ncomplaint adding five plaintiffs. Dkt. 9. Plaintiffs did not seek leave of the Court or consent\n\nfrom Defendants before doing so. In their reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss,\n\nDefendants argued that the Court “should disregard the second amended complaint” for failure to\n\ncomply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), but, “[o]ut of an abundance of caution,”\n\nthey nevertheless addressed the merits, arguing that the additional plaintiffs and allegations\n\nwould not cure the jurisdictional defects they had identified. Dkt. 16 at 3. Recognizing their\n\nprocedural misstep, Plaintiffs then moved for leave to file their second amended complaint,\n\narguing that granting them leave to file the proposed second amended complaint would not\n\nprejudice Defendants, would best serve judicial economy, and would be in the interest of justice.\n\nDkt. 18.\n\n       While the parties were briefing Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Abrams moved to\n\nintervene. Dkt. 13. He argues that, in the event that the Court “open[s] the floodgates” to\n\ncomplaints like the one filed by Plaintiffs, he should be permitted to seek an order compelling\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n \n\fDefendants to “investigate the tax status” of “charities that are hostile to Israel.” Id. at 2–3. The\n\nCourt ordered Defendants to respond to Abrams’s motion and, in particular, to address whether\n\nAbrams has standing to intervene. See Minute Order, May 21, 2016. In response, Defendants\n\nfiled a memorandum arguing that Abrams lacks standing and that, accordingly, he should not be\n\npermitted to intervene. Dkt. 17 at 2.\n\n                                    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA.

Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) and Motion for Leave to Amend\n\n        The first two motions before the Court—Defendants’ motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for leave to file the proposed second amended complaint—raise the same threshold\n\nquestion: Are the factual allegations contained in either pleading, if accepted as true, sufficient\n\nto establish that at least one plaintiff or putative plaintiff has Article III standing to pursue this\n\nlitigation? If the first amended complaint fails this test, then it must be dismissed. And, if the\n\nproposed second amended complaint fails the test, the proposed amendment would be futile and,\n\nthus, the motion for leave to amend should be denied. The Court’s task in answering these\n\nquestions, moreover, is simplified by the fact that the proposed second amended complaint\n\ndiffers from the first amended complaint in only one meaningful way—the addition of\n\nallegations pertaining to the five additional plaintiffs that the proposed pleading seeks to join.\n\nBecause the Court concludes that, even if these additional allegations are considered, no plaintiff\n\nhas standing to pursue this action, the Court can consider—and resolve—both motions together.\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n \n\f       “Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to ‘actual cases or\n\ncontroversies between proper litigants.’” Mendoza v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1010 (D.C.

Cir. 1996) (en banc)).\n\nAmong other things, this means that the Court lacks power to resolve a dispute unless at least\n\none plaintiff has standing. See Del. Dep’t of Natural Res. & Envtl. Control v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2015). And, at the motion to dismiss stage, it means that “the plaintiff must\n\nsufficiently allege a ‘concrete and particularized’ injury that is ‘fairly traceable to the challenged\n\naction of the defendant’ and ‘likely’ to be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’” West, 845 F.3d\n\nat 1230 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61). “Injury in fact is the ‘invasion of a legally\n\nprotected interest which is . . . actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;’” the “‘causal\n\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of’ must be” attributable to the\n\ndefendant, “‘and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the\n\ncourt;’” and the injury must be redressable (or “‘likely’” redressable) “‘by a favorable decision.’”\n\nArpaio, 797 F.3d at 19 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561). Together, these three elements—injury\n\nin fact, causation, and redressability—constitute the “irreducible constitutional minimum of\n\nstanding.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\n\n       1. Injury in Fact\n\n       Defendants concede that the lead plaintiff, Susan Abulhawa, has alleged a “concrete and\n\nparticularized injury-in-fact”—namely, the loss of certain real property, Dkt. 10-1 at 14 n.2 —\n\nand they do not contest that the five plaintiffs added in the proposed second amended complaint\n\nhave also alleged concrete injuries in fact, see Dkt. 16 at 4. The Court need not resolve the\n\nquestion whether Abulhawa, the five additional putative plaintiffs, or any of the remaining thirty-\n\none plaintiffs have alleged cognizable injuries in fact, however, because none of the thirty-seven\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n \n\fplaintiffs and putative plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to meet the causation or\n\nredressability prongs of the governing standard. See West, 845 F.3d at 1235.\n\n       2. Causation\n\n       Defendants argue that “[P]laintiffs cannot establish a causal link between an alleged\n\ninjury and the challenged conduct;” that is, they have not alleged facts sufficient to “show that\n\nthe alleged criminal activity” carried out by the U.S.-based nonprofits in coordination with\n\nIsraeli settlers “would not have occurred but for the grant of, and failure to investigate or revoke,\n\ntax-exempt status by the United States.” Dkt. 10-1 at 15. Plaintiffs disagree, arguing that a\n\n“simple chain of causation” supports Kateeb’s claim to standing and that this same reasoning\n\napplies to other plaintiffs as well. Dkt. 15 at 8. As they explain the theory applicable to\n\nKateeb’s claims, two plots of land located in the West Bank belonging to Kateeb were\n\npurportedly sold to an “Israeli settler organization” by “violent Israeli settlers supported by funds\n\nprovided by U.S. tax-exempt entities (most likely American Friends of Bet El Yeshiva or\n\nChristian Friends of Israeli Communities).” Id. at 6. “The theft of . . . Kateeb’s property”—or,\n\nat the time, her father’s property—“would not have occurred” but for the following alleged\n\nevents: (1) the U.S. § 501(c)(3) “entities receive[d] massive donations from wealthy donors in\n\nthe United States;” (2) those entities “then transfer[ed] those monies abroad into . . . Israel-based\n\ncharity bank accounts;” (3) the Israel-based charities then transfered the “monies . . . to settler\n\nofficials;” (4) the “settler officials” then used the funds to “set up armed militia units;” and,\n\nfinally, (5) the militia units then injured Kateeb by “annex[ing]” her father’s land. Dkt. 15 at 8.3\n\n\n\n3\n  Plaintiffs allege similar chains of causation for other plaintiffs. For example, Amer alleges that\none U.S.-based § 501(c)(3) organization donated funds to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF); the\nIDF used those funds to “deploy its troops” for a bombing attack; and Amer’s family sustained\ninjuries as a result of one of those bombing attacks. Dkt. 15 at 10. Without the funds provided\nby the U.S. § 501(c)(3) organization, Amer alleges, the IDF’s “operations would have been\n                                                  11\n \n\fMost importantly for present purposes, all of this turned, in Plaintiffs’ view, on the predicate that\n\nthe Treasury Department did not exercise its authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of those\n\n§ 501(c)(3) organizations that provide funding to groups that support the Israeli settlers. In short,\n\n“[w]ithout having . . . [§] 501(c)(3) status bestowed on them by the [Internal Revenue Service],\n\nthese [U.S.-based] organizations would not have been able to solicit contributions and transfer\n\nfunds to the settlement[s],” which, in turn, would mean that those donated funds would not be\n\navailable “to arm violent settlers” or “fund the illegal theft of . . . property,” and, accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs would not have been injured. Id. at 8–9, 11.\n\n        Standing arguments of this type are not new. Most notably, the Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether a similar “chain of causation between the challenged Government conduct\n\nand the asserted injury” gave rise to constitutional standing in Allen v. Wright. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n759 (1984). There, “[p]arents of black public school children” alleged that “the Internal Revenue\n\nService (IRS) ha[d] not adopted sufficient standards and procedures to fulfill its obligation to\n\ndeny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools” and that, by this omission, the\n\nIRS “harm[ed] them directly and interfere[d] with the ability of their children to receive an\n\neducation in desegregated public schools.” Id. at 739–40. The parents’ theory was that: (1) the\n\nIRS’s conferral of tax-exempt status on schools that were admitting only white students\n\n“facilitate[d] the raising of funds to organize [such] schools and expand [the] existing schools;”\n\n(2) white students left desegregated public schools in order to attend these white-only private\n\n\n\n\ncurtailed,” and, possibly, he would not have sustained injuries due to the bombing attack. Id.\nSimilarly, Al-Zeer alleges that, but for contributions funneled through an American § 501(c)(3)\nto an Israeli settlement organization, the settlers never would have “been able to purchase [the]\nexpensive military hardware” they used to attack him. Id.\n                                                  12\n \n\fschools; and (3) the black children of the plaintiff parents were thereby deprived of the\n\nopportunity to attend desegregated schools. See id. at 746, 758 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In rejecting this theory, the Supreme Court concluded that the “line of causation between\n\n[the IRS’s] conduct and desegregation of [the black children’s] schools [wa]s attenuated at best,”\n\nid. at 757, and that the “links in the chain of causation . . . [we]re far too weak for the chain as a\n\nwhole to sustain [the parents’] standing,” id. at 759. The Court emphasized that the hypothesized\n\nchain of events “involve[d] numerous third parties”—for example, the “officials of racially\n\ndiscriminatory schools receiving tax exemptions and the parents of children attending such\n\nschools”—whose “independent decisions may not collectively have [had] a significant effect on\n\nthe ability of public school students to receive a desegregated education.” Id. at 759. Despite the\n\n“constitutional importance of curing” one of “the most serious injuries recognized in our legal\n\nsystem”—the “diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated school”—the\n\nCourt concluded that it could not redress plaintiffs’ injury because it was “not fairly traceable to\n\nthe Government conduct . . . challenge[d] as unlawful.” Id. at 756–57.\n\n        The same conclusion holds here. The chain of causation linking the Treasury\n\nDepartment’s alleged “failure to monitor” the § 501(c)(3) status of U.S.-based charities and the\n\ninjuries sustained by Plaintiffs “is attenuated at best,” id. at 759, and, as in Allen, that chain relies\n\non a series of speculative inferences about the “independent action[s] of some third part[ies] not\n\nbefore the [C]ourt,” id. at 757 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109462\"><a href=\"/opinion/109462/simon-v-eastern-ky-welfare-rights-organization/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42\n\n(1976)). Plaintiffs speculate, for example, that (1) the donors to the U.S.-based § 501(c)(3)\n\norganizations made their contributions only because those entities are tax-exempt; (2) the U.S.\n\ncharities would be unable to find alternative sources of funding; (3) the Israeli settlers could not\n\nobtain other sources of funding; and (4) absent the continued influx of funding from U.S.\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n \n\fcharities, the Israeli settlers would be unable to acquire new land and might even give up the land\n\nthat they currently possess. At each of these links, a third-party actor could break the causal\n\nchain—a donor might decide to donate to one of the U.S.-based § 501(c)(3) organizations\n\nbecause he or she supports its goals, not because it is tax exempt; other donors might take the\n\nplace of any donors who will contribute only to tax-exempt groups; the Israeli settlers may\n\nalready possess the “weapons” and “equipment” that they need to remain in the disputed areas;\n\nor they may be committed to staying put, regardless of the support they receive from U.S.-based\n\ncharities. Although, in general, the Court “must take the complaint’s allegations of facts,\n\nhistorical or otherwise demonstrable, as true,” that presumption does not extend to allegations,\n\nlike those at issue here, that speculate about future events and that purport to predict how third\n\nparties might someday react to changed circumstances. Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 21 (quotation marks\n\nomitted); Osborn v.

Cir. 2015).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ “reliance on the anticipated action[s] of unrelated third parties makes it\n\nconsiderably harder to show the causation required to support standing.” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 20.\n\n“Although ‘standing is not precluded’ in a case that turns on third-party conduct, ‘it is ordinarily\n\nsubstantially more difficult to establish,’” id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562), and the D.C.\n\nCircuit “ha[s] required ‘substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the government\n\npolicy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to causation,’” id. (quoting Nat’l\n\nWrestling Coaches Ass’n v.

Cir. 2004)). Here,\n\nPlaintiffs’ theory of causation is based on speculation upon speculation about how third parties\n\nmight act.\n\n       To be sure, the precise contours of Article III standing are “not susceptible of precise\n\ndefinition.” Allen, 468 U.S. at 751. But, as the Supreme Court explained in Allen v. Wright, this\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n \n\f“hardly leaves courts at sea” because individual cases can often be resolved “by comparing the\n\nallegations of the particular complaint to those made in prior standing cases.” Id. at 751–52.\n\nThat observation is particularly apt here because Allen itself provides such a close comparator to\n\nthe present case. Indeed, if anything, the chain of events that Plaintiffs posit is more attenuated\n\nand more uncertain than the one relied upon by the respondents—and rejected by the Supreme\n\nCourt—in Allen.\n\n        This case also finds a close comparator in Khalaf v. Regan, No. 83-cv-2963, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">392</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. Jan. 8, 1985), a case that, like this one, was brought by a group of individuals\n\nseeking to challenge the tax-exempt status of a number of organizations that allegedly supported\n\nIsraeli settlement efforts in the West Bank. As in this case, some of the plaintiffs alleged that\n\nthey owned land in the West Bank that had “been confiscated by Israeli authorities” for use as\n\n“Jewish settlements” and that these “expropriations [had] been financed in substantial part with\n\nfunds obtained from contributions to the subject organizations.” Id. at *2. Relying on Allen, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing, id. at *3, and the D.C. Circuit\n\nconfirmed that “no sensible jurisprudence could allow th[at] case to proceed while disallowing\n\nfor want of standing cases like Allen” and others, Khalaf v. Regan, No. 85-5274, 1986 U.S. App.\n\nLEXIS 33734 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 19, 1986). Five years later, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that\n\nconclusion in Fulani v. Brady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563195\"><a href=\"/opinion/563195/lenora-b-fulani-dr-v-nicholas-f-brady-secretary-of-the-treasury-fred/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1991). There, the D.C. Circuit\n\ncited Khalaf with approval and, more generally, observed that, “where a party is seeking simply\n\nto remove a third party’s entitlement to a tax exemption, the exemption likely will not bear\n\nsufficient links of traceability . . . to the alleged injury to warrant standing under Allen v.\n\nWright.” Id. There is nothing about the present case that would warrant an exception to this\n\ngeneral rule.\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n \n\f        The Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs—in both their amended complaint and\n\nproposed second amended complaint—have failed to carry their “burden of . . . establishing the\n\n[causation] element[] of standing.” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 19.\n\n        3. Redressability\n\n        Both the first amended and proposed second amended complaints fail for a second reason\n\nas well: Neither complaint alleges facts sufficient to meet the redressability prong of the\n\nstanding test. “Redressability examines whether the relief sought, assuming that the court\n\nchooses to grant it, w[ould] likely alleviate the particularized injury alleged by the plaintiff.”\n\nWest, 845 F.3d at 1235 (quoting Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 663–64). “The key word is\n\n‘likely,’” id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561), and thus “the prospect of obtaining relief from the\n\ninjury as a result of a favorable ruling” cannot be “too speculative,” Allen, 468 U.S. at 752. As\n\nwith the causation analysis, when redressability “depends on the unfettered choices made by\n\nindependent actors not before the court[] and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion\n\nthe courts cannot presume either to control or to predict, it becomes substantially more difficult\n\nto establish standing.” Scenic Am., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Trans., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2016)\n\n(quotation marks omitted). “Courts do not lightly speculate how independent actors not before\n\nthem might” act, and, “[w]hen conjecture is necessary, redressability is lacking.” West, 845 F.3d\n\nat 1237 (quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n        The starting point in the redressability analysis is necessarily the relief sought. In this\n\ncase, that relief is purely prospective. Plaintiffs do not seek damages for any losses or injuries\n\nthey have already sustained, but rather seek or order (1) “requiring [the] Treasury [Department]\n\nto . . . initiate an investigation into any and all tax-exempt entities based in [the United States,]\n\nwhich transmit $20,000 or more on an annual basis to any country in the world” and requiring\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n \n\fthat the Department, “where appropriate, revoke the entit[ies’] tax-exempt status;” (2) requiring\n\nthat the Treasury Department “refer all tax fraud and money laundering findings to the IRS\n\nand/or U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution;” (3) requiring that the Treasury\n\nDepartment’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network “investigate the entities . . . who have\n\nengaged in [the alleged] money laundering activities;” and (4) requiring that the Treasury\n\nDepartment “initiate a long-overdue investigation of all of the financial sponsorship of and\n\ncommission of the [alleged] violent activities . . .on the part of U.S. tax exempt entities, their\n\ndonors, and [Israeli Defense Forces].” Dkt. 18-2 at 77–78.\n\n       For those plaintiffs alleging past injuries—for example, the loss of property already taken\n\nor a physical assault already suffered—an order from this Court compelling Defendants to\n\ninvestigate the § 501(c)(3) status of U.S.-based charities will do nothing to redress their alleged\n\ninjuries. Even if Defendants were to revoke the § 501(c)(3) status of U.S. entities, if any, found\n\nto have financially supported illegal activity in the West Bank or East Jerusalem, those actions\n\nwould not make Plaintiffs whole; neither the investigation, the revocation of tax-exempt status,\n\nnor even the prosecution of U.S. nonprofit organizations would result in the return of any\n\nillegally obtained property in the West Bank or East Jerusalem or in the payment of damages for\n\nphysical assaults that occurred in those territories. “Absent a sufficient likelihood that [they] will\n\nagain be wronged in a similar way,” Plaintiffs are “no more entitled to an injunction” or\n\ndeclaratory judgment than anyone else, and “a federal court may not entertain a claim by any or\n\nall citizens who no more than assert that certain” agency action—or inaction—is unlawful.

Lyons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1983).\n\n       For Plaintiffs alleging future injuries —for example, Kateeb’s fear that “if [Defendants]\n\ncontinue[] to allow so-called tax-exempt funds to flow to [an Israeli settler] organization, she\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n \n\fwill lose her remaining four plots of land,” Dkt. 18-2 at 11 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13(a))—the\n\nredressability is a closer call, but only slightly closer. It is conceivable, Plaintiffs argue, that if\n\nthe Treasury Department investigates a particular U.S.-based § 501(c)(3) organization, the\n\nDepartment might revoke the organization’s tax-exempt status, which might decrease the\n\nfinancial contributions made to that organization, which might lead to fewer funds sent by that\n\norganization to Israeli-based nonprofits, which might lead those Israeli nonprofits to reduce\n\nexpenditures in support of West Bank or East Jerusalem settlers, who, in turn, might have fewer\n\nfunds to take steps that might ultimately injure Plaintiffs. But as this chain of inferences lays\n\nbare, the likelihood that the requested relief would actually redress an imminent harm to any of\n\nthe plaintiffs is both speculative and remote. It requires the Court to “pile conjecture on\n\nconjecture,” West, 845 F.3d at 1237, forcing it to assume, for example, that donors would stop\n\ncontributing funds to U.S.-based nonprofits stripped of their tax-exempt status; that Israel-based\n\nnonprofits would not find some other funding source to fill any gap created by a reduction in\n\nU.S. financial support; and, most importantly, that the individual actors—the settlers in the West\n\nBank and East Jerusalem—would refrain from taking actions that could injure Plaintiffs. Such\n\n“unadorned speculation as to the existence of a relationship between the challenged government\n\naction and the third-party conduct will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power.” Scenic\n\nAmerica, 836 F.3d at 50 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Plaintiffs can only “establish the redressability prong required for standing” if they can\n\nshow that the “declaratory judgment sought w[as] the sine qua non for, or would ‘significantly\n\nincrease [their] likelihood’ of” staving off the future injuries they detail in their proposed second\n\namended complaint.
