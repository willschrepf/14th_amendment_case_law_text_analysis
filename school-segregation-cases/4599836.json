The rule of~the highway com-\n       pany In operation was that white passengers were\n       served first; three separate meal calls were made in'\n       the day coaches and sleepers for the white passengers.\n       If there were any negro passengers desiring the meal,\n       they were not served~until the lapse of\"a reasonable\n       time following the making of the last call, when there\n       was no probability of other white passengers coming\n       into the car for service. In OUP opinion we should\n       not read into the'statute anything that would prevent\n       such a just regulation by the CSIPPI~P, unless compelled\n       to do so. The ruleradmits of railway trains malntain-\n       ing schedules that are not slowed down by stops for\n       roadside meals, and It does not lead to denial of\n       meals to members of either race, OP to reasonable in-\n       convenience.\" (Underscoring ours)\n            We therefore answer your question as follows: .Itis;\n    under Revised Statutes, 1925, Art. 6417 and Penal Code, 1925,\n    Arts, 1659-60 (known as our Jim CPOW Law)'unlawful for rail-\n    roads to serve whites'and blacks in the same dining car at the\n    sametime.
