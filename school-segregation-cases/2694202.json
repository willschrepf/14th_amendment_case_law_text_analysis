In the event jurisdiction exists, they challenge the legal sufficiency of the\r\nevidence supporting the trial court’s judgment in favor of appellee Marvin Moore. \r\nWe conclude that the trial court had jurisdiction, affirm in part, and reverse and\r\nrender in part.<span>The Facts</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Kenneth and Nancy French are husband and wife.  They have two daughters,\r\nKaren French and Sandra Boyd.  Marvin Moore is Sandra Boyd’s ex-husband.  While\r\nMoore and Boyd were married, they encountered financial trouble.  Kenneth, Nancy,\r\nand Karen French loaned the couple money to assist them with the operation of their\r\nbusiness, Moore Moving Systems, and to assist them with their personal expenses. \r\nMoore “wanted to expand [the business] and get it out of [their] house.”  Kenneth and\r\nNancy French owned two pieces of real property located at 17847 Huffsmith\r\nKohrville (“the warehouse property”) and 18304 Huffsmith Kohrville (“the office\r\nproperty”), and personal property located on those properties.  According to Moore,\r\nhe entered into a partnership with Kenneth and Nancy French.  Their oral agreement\r\nprovided that Kenneth and Nancy would contribute cash and their warehouse and\r\noffice property to the partnership.  Moore in turn would improve and maintain the\r\nwarehouse and office property, and pay the utilities and taxes assessed on it.  <span>Moore\r\ntestified at trial that he built a fence, a parking lot, and the “main shell” of the\r\nbuilding on the warehouse property, and that the Frenches agreed to “finish out\r\neverything.”  </span>Moore completed the improvements in the spring of 1999.  Moore\r\ntestified that the parties also agreed to expand Moore Moving by developing the\r\nFrenches’ office property.  Thereafter, Moore and Boyd sold their home and invested\r\nsome of the proceeds of that sale into the office property.  The couple divorced in July\r\n2002.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Approximately one week after the divorce became final, the Frenches\r\ndemanded Moore’s key to the warehouse property, and informed him that he had no\r\nright to enter the property.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Two police officers escorted Moore from the property.\r\nWithin several days, Moore sued Nancy and Kenneth French in the Harris County\r\nCourt at Law, alleging wrongful eviction, breach of contract, conversion, and fraud\r\n– all in connection with the warehouse property.  Moore also sued his ex-sister-in-law, Karen French, for conversion and unjust enrichment, in a dispute over ownership\r\nof a tractor.  Kenneth and Nancy French countered by filing two forcible entry and\r\ndetainer actions in the justice court, asking the court to remove Moore from the office\r\nand warehouse property.  The justice court awarded possession of both properties to\r\nKenneth and Nancy French.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The parties agreed to consolidate Moore’s appeal of the justice court rulings\r\nwith Moore’s county court at law suit.  Moore then filed a supplemental petition, in\r\nwhich he added damages for claims arising out of the office property.  The Frenches\r\ncounterclaimed, asserting causes of action for <span>breach of contract, conversion,\r\nquantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and negligence</span><span>.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>The parties waived their right to a jury, and proceeded to a bench trial.  The\r\ntrial court found no partnership existed, but found against Kenneth and Nancy French\r\non Moore’s unjust enrichment and wrongful eviction claims.  It awarded Moore\r\ndamages of $60,000 for unjust enrichment and $5,000 for wrongful eviction.  The\r\ntrial court included another $45,000 for Moore in attorney’s fees.  In addition, the\r\ntrial court found Karen French liable to Moore for conversion, and awarded $18,000\r\nin damages.  Finally, the trial court found Moore liable to Kenneth French on his\r\ncounterclaim, and awarded French $6,000 in damages for unjust enrichment.  The\r\ntrial court also determined that Kenneth French owned a trailer, and that Karen\r\nFrench owned an Agmeier Box Scrapper and a Modern Stand Post Digger.  It thus\r\nordered Moore to transfer possession of that personal property to Kenneth and Karen\r\nFrench, respectively.  The trial court ordered Moore to relinquish possession of the\r\nwarehouse and office properties, and to release all <i>lis pendens</i> he had filed on the\r\nproperty.  It denied all other relief, including <span>the Frenches’ claim for attorney’s fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Jurisdiction and the Amount in Controversy</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Frenches contend that the county court at law lacked jurisdiction over this\r\ncase because the amount in controversy for Moore’s aggregate claims against\r\nKenneth and Nancy French exceeds the trial court’s $100,000 jurisdictional limit.  In\r\nresolving this issue, we consider (1) the standard of review for a challenge to\r\njurisdiction based upon the amount in controversy; (2) the rules to apply in\r\ndetermining the amount in controversy; and (3) the application of those rules to the\r\nfacts of this case.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Standard of Review</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>A court must have subject matter jurisdiction to decide a case. <i> Tex. Ass’n of\r\nBus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd.</i>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 443 (Tex. 1993).  The Texas\r\nConstitution and legislative enactments confer subject matter jurisdiction, combined\r\nwith the existence of the facts necessary for a court to exercise jurisdiction.  <i>Lee v. El\r\nPaso County</i>, 965 S.W.2d 668, 671 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1998, pet. denied).  The\r\ndetermination as to whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law, and we review it\r\n<i>de novo</i>.  <i>Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale,</i> 964 S.W.2d 922, 928 (Tex. 1998).  The\r\nallegations in the plaintiff’s petition ordinarily establish the amount in controversy\r\nfor a jurisdictional analysis. <i> Continental Coffee Products Co. v. Cazarez</i>, 937 S.W.2d\r\n444, 449 (Tex. 1996).  <i>See also Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue</i>, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555\r\n(Tex. 2000) (jurisdictional challenges based upon amount in controversy “must\r\nordinarily be decided solely on the pleadings”).  We presume that a trial court has\r\njurisdiction unless the absence of jurisdiction affirmatively appears on the face of the\r\npetition.  <i>Lee</i>, 965 S.W.2d at 671.  The plaintiff’s pleadings are determinative of the\r\namount in controversy, unless the defendant alleges that the amount pleaded was\r\nmerely a sham to wrongfully obtain jurisdiction.  <i>Bland</i>, 34 S.W.3d at 554.  If,\r\nhowever, a litigant fails to state an amount in controversy in its petition for recovery,\r\nthe trial court is not thereby deprived of jurisdiction.  <i>Peek v. Equip. Serv. Co.</i>, 779\r\nS.W.2d 802, 804 (Tex. 1989).  Rather, a litigant may prove jurisdiction at trial.  <i>Peek,\r\n</i>779 S.W.2d at 804.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>When deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, the trial court must consider evidence\r\nrelevant to the jurisdictional issue if that evidence is necessary to resolve the\r\njurisdictional question, and <span>it has discretion in determining whether the jurisdictional\r\nissue can be resolved in a preliminary hearing, or instead requires fuller development\r\nof the merits of the case.  <i>Id. </i>at 554-55.</span>  As the trial court considered evidence in\r\nfinding that it had jurisdiction, and served as the finder of fact in the bench trial of\r\nthis case, we review the facts in a light favorable to the trial court’s judgment.  <i>See\r\nTex. Dept. of Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004)\r\n(holding that a trial court can consider evidence in connection with a jurisdictional\r\ninquiry and that the fact-finder is to resolve fact issues with regard to jurisdiction).</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><i></i></span></span><span><span><i>Rules for Determining the Amount in Controversy</i><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Sections 25.0003 and 25.1032 of the Texas Government Code grant\r\njurisdiction to statutory county courts and to the Harris County Civil Courts at Law. \r\n<i>See </i><span>Tex. Gov’t Code Ann</span>. § 25.0003 (Vernon 2004); <span>Tex. Gov’t Code Ann</span>. §\r\n25.1032 (Vernon 2004).  <i>See also Cazarez</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 447-49.  The jurisdictional\r\nlimit of the Harris County Civil Courts at Law is more than $500 but less than\r\n$100,000, excluding interest, statutory or punitive damages, penalties, attorney’s fees,\r\nand costs.  <span>Tex.  Gov’t Code Ann</span>. § 25.0003(c)(1) (Vernon 2004);  <span>Tex.  Gov’t\r\nCode Ann</span>. § 25.1032(a) (Vernon 2004).  <i>See also Smith v. Clary Corp</i>, 917 S.W.2d\r\n796, 798 (Tex. 1996) (stating general jurisdictional rule, and noting “many\r\nexceptions” exist).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Texas Supreme Court and the various courts of appeals have developed a\r\nframework for assessing the “amount in controversy” for jurisdictional purposes. \r\nFirst, if one plaintiff asserts multiple claims against only one defendant, the amounts\r\nof each separate claim are aggregated to determine the amount in controversy.  <i>See\r\nTejas Toyota, Inc. v. Griffin</i>, 587 S.W.2d 775, 776 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1979, writ\r\nref’d n.r.e.)  (counter-plaintiff asserted DTPA claim and claims for damage to credit\r\nreputation, loss of use of automobile, and attorney fees against counter-defendant;\r\namount of each claim aggregated and exceeded jurisdictional limits of county court). \r\nSecond, if a plaintiff asserts a single claim through alternative theories of recovery,\r\nfor the purpose of determining jurisdiction, the amount in controversy is determined\r\nby looking to the theory that would yield the largest award.  <i>See Lucey v. Southeast\r\nTex. Emergency Physicians Assoc.</i>, 802 S.W.2d 300, 302 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1990,\r\nwrit denied).  Third, if one plaintiff asserts separate, independent and distinct claims\r\nagainst multiple defendants, the claims asserted against each defendant are judged\r\nseparately, and must independently lie within the jurisdictional parameters of the\r\ncourt.  <i>Borrego v. del Palacio</i>, 445 S.W.2d 620, 622 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1969,\r\nno writ).</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Fourth, a counterclaim, whether permissive or compulsory, must be within\r\nthe trial court’s jurisdictional limits, and the trial court should dismiss a counterclaim\r\nif it exceeds the trial court’s maximum jurisdictional limit.  <i>Smith v. Clary Corp.</i>, 917\r\nS.W.2d 796, 798 (Tex. 1996);<i> Kitchen Designs, Inc. v. Wood</i>, 584 S.W.2d 305, 307\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Texarkana 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.).  Fifth, if a plaintiff’s pleadings\r\nseek an amount within the trial court’s jurisdictional limits, subsequent amendments\r\nincreasing the amount in controversy above the trial court’s jurisdictional limit do not\r\ndivest the trial court of jurisdiction, but only if the increase is due to the passage of\r\ntime.  <i>Flynt v. Garcia</i>, 587 S.W.2d 109, 110 (Tex. 1979).  Sixth, claims in an\r\namended petition for additional damages – not due to the passage of time – are\r\nincluded in the amount in controversy.  <i>Smith, </i>917 S.W.2d at 798 n.1; <i>Crumpton v.\r\nStevens,</i> 936 S.W.2d 473, 477 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, no writ).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Finally, if a litigant alleges an amount of damages exceeding the trial court’s\r\njurisdictional limit, and the alleged damages are liquidated and non-severable, the\r\nparty may not amend its pleadings to reduce its liquidated damage claim to an amount\r\nwithin the trial court’s jurisdictional limits.  <i>Smith Detective Agency v. Stanley Smith\r\nSecurity, Inc.</i>, 938 S.W.2d 743, 747 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1996, writ denied); <i>see also\r\nFailing v. Equity Management Corp.</i>, 674 S.W.2d 906, 908–09 (Tex. App.—Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 1984, no writ).  A litigant may, however, reduce its unliquidated claim for\r\ndamages to an amount within the trial court’s jurisdictional limit if that party pleads\r\nin good faith.  <i>Smith Detective Agency</i>, 938 S.W.2d at 747; s<span><i>ee also Failing</i>, 674\r\nS.W.2d at 908–09 (plaintiff in court of limited jurisdiction may amend claim by\r\nentirely abandoning any severable item to reduce claim to amount within jurisdiction\r\nof court, but cannot amend to confer jurisdiction by waiving portion of severable\r\nclaim or by arbitrarily reducing alleged value of property or services to reduce claim\r\nto amount within court’s jurisdiction); <i>Isbell v. Kenyon Warner Dredging Co.</i>, 113\r\nTex. 528, 261 S.W. 762, 763 (1924) (trial court properly dismissed claim added after\r\nsuit filed that increased amount in controversy above trial court’s jurisdictional limit,\r\nand retained initial claim).</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>The Application of the Amount in Controversy Rules</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Moore’s original petition alleges an unliquidated, unspecified amount of\r\ndamages for the warehouse property against Kenneth and Nancy French collectively. \r\nIt separately alleges damages against Karen French for the conversion of a tractor. \r\nMoore’s supplemental petition alleges additional unspecified damages for claims\r\narising out of the office property.  In his original petition, Moore further alleges that\r\nthe damages he seeks for his wrongful eviction and fraud claims were “<i>within </i>the\r\ncourt’s jurisdictional limits” and that the damages he seeks for his breach of contract,\r\nunjust enrichment, and conversion claims “exceeded the court’s <i>minimum\r\n</i>jurisdictional limits.”  (Emphasis added).    Moore did not specifically allege that his\r\naggregate claims against Nancy and Kenneth French were less than $100,000.  Moore\r\nlater amended his petition to seek further unliquidated damages against Kenneth and\r\nNancy French for the office property.  The Frenches did not specially except to either\r\npetition to seek clarification of the amount in controversy, nor did they allege that\r\nMoore’s representation that his claims fell within the jurisdictional limits was a sham. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At trial, Moore offered testimony that, as of the date he filed his original\r\npetition, his damages were at least $103,000.  Moore also testified that the damages\r\nfor both the warehouse and office properties ranged anywhere from $103,000 to\r\n$200,000.  Moore further testified that he spent “about $60,000.00” on improvements\r\nto the warehouse property, and “about [$]70,000” on the office property.  Moore\r\nasked the court to “dissolve the partnership and distribute the proceeds from the sale\r\nof the properties.” Moore quantified the value of the assets held by the partnership as\r\nfollows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>From the property, roughly thirty-four thousand, net; and, basically, it\r\nwould be twenty percent, which would be $70,000.00 to them and\r\n[$]80,000.00 to them, approximately; so that would leave roughly two\r\nhundred thousand, plus attorney fees. </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Moore also claimed that if no partnership agreement existed, then he had “receipts\r\nshowing [$]133,000.00.”  Moore agreed on cross-examination that he sought\r\npartnership damages in the amount of $200,000, and that no change in circumstances\r\nhad occurred between the date of trial and the month that he filed suit.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>After hearing Moore’s testimony, the trial judge inquired whether the court had\r\njurisdiction.  He asked Moore’s counsel to address the jurisdictional issue.  Moore\r\nagain testified that, although he did not know the liquidated amount of damages that\r\nhe sought on the date he filed suit, the amount that he initially sought was “about”\r\n$103,000.  Moore testified, however, that at the time he filed suit, he did not have a\r\nliquidated number as to the damages he sought.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Before the evidence closed, Moore’s attorney made the following\r\nannouncement:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Judge, at this time the Plaintiff is going <i>to amend the pleadings to take\r\nout the dissolution of the partnership and the claims made for the\r\ngreater amounts and are going back to the original petition as it was\r\nfiled</i>, which would then come well within the jurisdictional limits of the\r\nCourt.  I can demonstrate that real quickly by the original petition and\r\nthe testimony.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>(Emphasis added).</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>After counsel’s trial amendment, Moore testified that when he filed his original\r\npetition, he sought $5,000 for wrongful eviction, and $60,000 for his claims related\r\nto the warehouse property.  Moore specifically testified that the $103,000 figure\r\nconsisted of “two components” – the warehouse property, which represented\r\n“roughly” $60,000 – and the office property, which represented “roughly 20, \r\n40,000.00.”  The office property dispute arose, however, in Moore’s supplemental \r\npetition.  Moore also testified that he sought separate damages in the amount of\r\n$18,000 for conversion of a tractor against Karen French, and that he could not\r\nquantify the amount of other damages that he sought for conversion.  At a second\r\nhearing on jurisdiction, the Frenches and Moore agreed upon a stipulation of evidence\r\n“as to what the amount in controversy was at the time of filing.”  The agreed\r\nstipulation reads: “the Court’s understanding is that the total for actual damages the\r\nPlaintiffs are seeking did not have value in excess of $99,000 on the date of filing.” \r\nBased upon the evidence it received, including the stipulation, the trial court\r\nconcluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the case and enter judgment.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>On appeal, the Frenches contend that the trial court lacked jurisdiction,\r\nmaintaining that parties may not confer jurisdiction by agreement if no jurisdiction\r\nexists.  Moore responds that, in context, his trial testimony referred to an aggregate\r\namount in controversy of all parties and all claims, including claims in his amended\r\npetition he later abandoned, and his independent claims for conversion against co-defendant Karen French.  Relying on <i>Gonzalez v. Sanchez</i>, 927 S.W.2d 218, 221-22\r\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 1996, no writ), the Frenches reply that, by accepting the\r\nstipulation, the trial court impermissibly allowed the parties to “fix” the jurisdictional\r\nproblem.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>We conclude that <i>Gonzalez </i>is inapplicable here.  In that case, Gonzalez failed\r\nto timely perfect an appeal, and the trial court lost its jurisdiction.  Gonzalez then\r\ncontended that the parties had agreed to extend the time for which her motion for new\r\ntrial would be overruled by operation of law, in order to deem the appeal timely\r\nperfected.  <i>Gonzalez</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 219-20.  Unlike <i>Gonzalez</i>, the parties in this case\r\ndid not attempt to resurrect jurisdiction in the trial court with a stipulation of law,\r\nafter it had been lost by operation of law.  Rather, in this case, the parties submitted\r\nagreed evidence as to certain facts.  Based upon those facts, the trial court determined\r\nthat it had jurisdiction.  It is true that, if a trial court lacks jurisdiction, it cannot be\r\nconferred through an agreement of the parties.  <i>Gonzalez</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 221-22; <i>Kirk\r\nv. Head</i>, 137 Tex. 44, 152 S.W.2d 726, 728-29 (1941).  It is also true, however, that\r\n“where potential jurisdiction is dependent on the existence of facts, the litigating\r\nparties to a cause can agree on the jurisdictional facts; and from such agreed facts the\r\ncourt can determine the question of jurisdiction.”  <i>Head</i>, 137 Tex. 44, 152 S.W.2d at\r\n728-29.  Because the parties in this case agreed on certain facts, and based upon those\r\nfacts, the trial court determined it had jurisdiction, we conclude that the county court\r\nat law properly determined that it had jurisdiction over this lawsuit.  <i>See id; see also\r\nHouston Lighting &amp; Power Co. v.

They further contend that there is no evidence that Moore paid $60,000 for the\r\nbenefit of Kenneth and Nancy French under circumstances indicating that he intended\r\nto be repaid.

Hynson testified that she met with Kenneth,\r\nNancy, and Karen French, Sandra Boyd, and Moore for a “family meeting” regarding\r\ntheir plan to expand Moore Moving.  Hynson testified that the family decided to sell\r\nthe residence on Windpipe and to use some of the proceeds to “reimburse some\r\nmoney,” and some of the proceeds to purchase acreage to expand Moore Moving. \r\nThe family also decided to list the warehouse property, and, likewise, planned to\r\ninvest some of the money realized upon the sale of that property into land for Moore\r\nMoving, and the remainder to reimburse family members who had invested in the\r\nbusiness.  They listed the warehouse property for $148,900, which, if realized, would\r\nenable them to accomplish their goals of investing in a larger piece of land, and\r\nreimbursing those family members who had invested in Moore Moving. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>  Moore testified that he entered into a partnership agreement with Kenneth and\r\nNancy French, made improvements, maintained, and paid the utilities and taxes on\r\nthe warehouse property.  Moore built the “shell” of a building, a parking lot, and\r\nerected a fence on the warehouse property.  Moore offered receipts for $60,000 that\r\nhe spent on improvements to the warehouse property, admitted without objection, and\r\ntestified that the Frenches helped him “finish out” the building on the warehouse\r\nproperty, which he completed in the spring of 1999.  Moore testified that he agreed\r\nwith Kenneth and Nancy French that the money he invested in the warehouse\r\nproperty would be refunded upon its sale, together with anything left after the\r\nFrenches had been paid back for their investment.  Moore produced an insurance\r\npolicy that he purchased for Moore Moving, listing it as a partnership, and testified\r\nthat the insurance company informed him that the Frenches attempted to change the\r\ndescription of Moore Moving from a partnership.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Moore admitted at trial that some of the damages that he was seeking were paid\r\nfrom a checking account owned by Nancy and Kenneth French, but testified that the\r\nmoney in that account came from Moore Moving.  Moore testified that Nancy and\r\nKenneth French allowed Moore and Boyd to deposit money into their checking\r\naccount.  According to Moore, he and Boyd agreed to this arrangement, and\r\nfrequently approached Nancy French for checks.  Nancy French eventually authorized\r\nBoyd to sign Nancy French’s name on checks drawn on that account.  Moore testified\r\nthat he and Boyd deposited $74,000 into the checking account owned by Kenneth and\r\nNancy French, and explained, “I had to trust in them.  If not, I would have never\r\ndeposited a $74,000.00 check into an account that I could not sign on.”  <span>Moore\r\ntestified that he and Boyd contributed funds to the account, and used the funds to\r\nconstruct a warehouse at a cost of $60,000.</span>  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The trial court found, pre-judgment, as follows: </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>•Plaintiff and Defendants did NOT enter into an express or implied\r\npartnership.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>•Defendants did not breach a FIDUCIARY duty to Plaintiff.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>•Defendants did not fail to comply with a partnership agreement.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>•Plaintiff is entitled to a quantum meruit recovery.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>•Plaintiff is entitled to recover unjust enrichment damages in the\r\namount of $60,000.00.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>(Emphasis in original).</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Viewing the evidence in a light that tends to support the trial\r\ncourt’s judgment, and disregarding evidence and inferences to the contrary, we\r\nconclude that more than a scintilla of evidence supports the trial court’s finding and\r\ndamage award of $60,000 to Moore under the doctrine of unjust enrichment.  The\r\nevidence indicates that Moore invested $60,000 in the property, expecting that his\r\nexpenditure would be refunded upon the sale of the warehouse property.  Such\r\nevidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s award.  <i>See Canchola,</i> 121\r\nS.W.3d at 739; <i>Sanchez</i>, 997 S.W.2d at 588.<span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><i>Wrongful Eviction</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Section 93.002(g)(2) of the Texas Property Code allows a tenant to recover\r\nfrom a landlord “an amount equal to the sum of the tenant’s actual damages, one\r\nmonth’s rent or $500, whichever is greater, reasonable attorney’s fees, and court\r\ncosts, less any delinquent rents or other sums for which the tenant is liable to the\r\nlandlord.”  <span>Tex.

The Frenches contend\r\nthat “this court need not delve into the particulars of the damage models for wrongful\r\neviction, because Moore failed to present any evidence at trial to support damages\r\nunder this theory, other than his unsubstantiated statement that he was entitled to\r\n$5,000.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Moore testified at trial that he sought $5,000 in damages for wrongful eviction. \r\nHe testified that the amount of damages he sought is based upon the fact that he was\r\nrequired to find another storage facility to store his “household contents” that he had\r\nstored at the warehouse property.  The Frenches’ attorneys neither cross-examined\r\nMoore on this issue, nor offered controverting evidence regarding Moore’s damages\r\nfor wrongful eviction.  Viewing this evidence in a light that supports the trial court’s\r\njudgment and disregarding all evidence and inferences to the contrary, we conclude\r\nthat more than a scintilla of evidence supports the trial court’s damage award of\r\n$5,000 to Moore.  <i>See Canchola,</i> 121 S.W.3d at 739; <i>Sanchez</i>, 997 S.W.2d at 588.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><i>Conversion</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Karen French contends that Moore offered no evidence of conversion to\r\nsupport the trial court’s finding that she converted a tractor that she removed from the\r\nwarehouse property.  She further contends that the testimony and documentary\r\nevidence at trial conclusively establish that she is the record owner of the tractor, and\r\nthat Moore presented no evidence demonstrating that he had title or a superior right\r\nto possess the tractor.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In order to recover on a claim for conversion, a plaintiff must prove that: (1)\r\nthe plaintiff owned, had legal possession of, or was entitled to possession of the\r\nproperty; (2) the defendant assumed and exercised dominion and control over the\r\nproperty in an unlawful and unauthorized manner, to the exclusion of and inconsistent\r\nwith the plaintiff’s rights; (3) the plaintiff made a demand for the property; and (4)\r\nthe defendant refused to return the property.  <i>Ojeda v.

Moore relies on his\r\ntestimony that Karen French took the tractor from him after he had made loan\r\npayments on it.  Moore admitted that he was not making payments on the tractor at\r\nthe time of trial, and that payments were nonetheless due each month on the tractor. \r\nKaren French testified that she is the borrower on the $18,000 note, and she took\r\npossession of the tractor to keep track of it.  She further explained, “When he left my\r\nmom’s house, I would not know where he was.  I wasn’t assured that he was going\r\nto pay these loans, and I went ahead and asked him if I could use the tractor.”  Moore\r\nrelinquished possession to French.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Although Moore argues in his brief that he had a superior right to possess the\r\ntractor, he has not directed us to any evidence in the record, nor have we found any,\r\ndemonstrating that he had a superior right to possess the tractor at the time that Karen\r\nFrench took possession of it – indeed, she is the record owner and, as the borrower\r\non the note, was responsible for payment.  Absent any evidence of a lease or other\r\nagreement, Moore did not present legally sufficient evidence to support his\r\nconversion claim.  In order to prevail on a claim for conversion, the aggrieved party\r\nmust either own, possess, or have the right to immediate possession of the property\r\nalleged to have been converted.  <i>Crutcher v. Continental Nat’l Bank</i>, 884 S.W.2d\r\n884, 888 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1994, writ denied).  <i>See also Waisath v.

We therefore reverse the trial court’s\r\naward of $18,000 for conversion damages against Karen French, and render judgment\r\nin her favor that Moore take nothing in his claim for conversion.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><i>Moore’s Award of Attorney’s Fees</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Nancy and Kenneth French contend that the evidence presented to the trial\r\ncourt in support of Moore’s award of $45,000 in attorney’s fees is insufficient to\r\nsupport that award, and that the amount of the trial court’s award is unreasonable as\r\na matter of law.  In support of their contention, they argue that because Moore is not\r\nentitled to recover attorney’s fees on any of the theories upon which the trial court\r\nawarded damages, no basis exists for the trial court to award him attorney’s fees.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> \r\nThe Frenches note that the trial in this case lasted less than one day, the parties\r\nconducted no discovery, and that the trial occurred less than three months after Moore\r\nfiled suit.  They also attack the trial court’s award, because “despite the relatively\r\nsimple nature of this case, almost every task in the case was attended by two, and\r\noften three, legal personnel.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Moore’s attorney submitted invoices to the trial court for attorney’s fees of\r\nalmost $65,000.  Moore’s attorney, David Tang, testified that he reviewed the legal\r\nwork performed in preparation of this case, that he has participated in trials in Harris\r\nCounty, Texas, and that he is familiar with the amount that attorneys in Harris County\r\ncharge as a reasonable and necessary attorney’s fee.  Mr. Tang testified that, based\r\nupon the novelty of the issues in this case and the amount of work performed, a\r\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fee would be $45,000.  When given the\r\nopportunity, the Frenches’ attorney declined to cross-examine Mr. Tang.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span><span>A trial court, sitting as finder of fact, may award attorney’s fees as a matter of\r\nlaw based upon an interested witness’ </span><span>testimony if it is accurate, clear, direct, and\r\npositive, and not contradicted by any other witnesses, other evidence, or attendant\r\ncircumstances, “especially when the opposing party has the means and opportunity\r\nof disproving the testimony or evidence and fails to do so.”  </span><span><i>Ragsdale v.

The trial court’s award of attorney\r\nfees is supported by Mr. Tang’s uncontroverted testimony.  We therefore conclude\r\nthat the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to\r\nMoore.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>The Frenches’ Claims</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Karen, Nancy, and Kenneth French <span>asserted counter claims against Moore for\r\nbreach of contract, conversion, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and negligence</span><span>. \r\n</span>Karen French contends that the county court at law’s failure to award her damages\r\nin the amount of $13,647.85 is against the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence, but <span>seeks <i>rendition </i>of judgment, awarding her damages in that amount.</span> \r\nKaren, Nancy, and Kenneth French also contend that the trial court’s failure to award\r\nthem their attorney’s fees is against the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence, and seek <i>rendition </i>of judgment, awarding them attorney’s fees in the\r\namount of $15,000.  The Frenches have briefed these issues as a challenge to the legal\r\nsufficiency of the evidence.  Neither Karen, Nancy, or Kenneth French request that\r\nwe remand this case to the trial court on the basis that the trial court’s findings are\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, as an alternative to\r\nrendition.  We therefore construe their complaints as challenges to the legal\r\nsufficiency of the evidence.  <i>See Anderson v.

When asked whether he “stopped giving her\r\nmonthly payments that you and/or Sandra used to give her when y’all were together,”\r\nMoore responded that he continued to make payments on that loan after he and\r\nSandra Boyd had separated.

Moore also acknowledged at trial that\r\nKaren French purchased a computer and fax machine for Moore Moving, but Moore\r\ntestified that he paid her cash for that equipment five months after she purchased it. \r\nAs further evidence that he paid for that equipment, Moore explained that he had the\r\npaperwork for that equipment, and that Karen French had retained possession of the\r\npaperwork for the equipment until after he had fully paid her for it. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>As Moore disputed French’s testimony, Karen French fails to meet her burden\r\nof showing that the evidence conclusively establishes that she was entitled to\r\njudgment in the amount of $11,782.94 regarding the loan proceeds, and $1,864.91\r\nregarding the computer and fax machine.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Karen French further complains of the trial court’s refusal to award her\r\nadditional monetary damages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  She asserted claims against Moore for breach of\r\ncontract, conversion, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and negligence.

They claim entitlement to all of the attorney’s fees that they\r\nincurred in this lawsuit, because the claims in this case are so intertwined that their\r\nattorney was unable to segregate his attorney’s fees between claims, or between\r\nprosecution and defense activities.

Co. v. Sterling</i>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991).  A party\r\nseeking attorney fees has a duty to segregate nonrecoverable fees from recoverable\r\nfees, and to segregate the fees owed by different parties.  <i>See id.</i> at 11.  An exception\r\nto the duty to segregate arises when the attorney fees incurred are in connection with\r\nclaims arising out of the same transaction, and are so interrelated that their\r\nprosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts.  <i>Sterling,\r\n</i>822 S.W.2d at 11.   When causes of action involved in a suit are dependent upon the\r\nsame set of facts or circumstances, and thus are “intertwined to the point of being\r\ninseparable,” the party suing for attorney fees may recover the entire amount covering\r\nall claims.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At trial, the Frenches’ attorney testified that the claims in this case are\r\nintertwined, and he thus could not segregate his fees between claims, nor between\r\nprosecution and defense activities.

In support of their contention\r\nthat they are entitled to rendition of judgment in the amount of $15,000, the Frenches\r\nrely on the trial court’s pre-judgment findings, which state that they are entitled to\r\nattorney’s fees incurred in the prosecution of their two forcible entry and detainer\r\nactions, and <i>Caldwell &amp; Hurst v.

The Frenches have not\r\ndirected us to evidence in the record demonstrating that they complied with the\r\nprocedural requirements of Section 38.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. \r\n<i>See Sterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 690; <i>Smith</i>, 774 S.W.2d at 412 (party who attacks legal\r\nsufficiency of adverse finding on an issue as to which he bore the burden of proof\r\nmust demonstrate on appeal that evidence conclusively established all vital facts in\r\nsupport of issue).  Because the Frenches have not demonstrated that they complied\r\nwith the procedural requirements of Section 38.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and\r\nRemedies Code, the Frenches have failed to conclusively establish that they are\r\nentitled to recover their attorney’s fees incurred in the prosecution of Kenneth\r\nFrenches’ unjust enrichment claim.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>If the parties agree on facts, and from those agreed facts the trial court\r\ndetermines the legal question of jurisdiction, a party is estopped from asserting on\r\nappeal that the facts are different from those agreed to in the trial court.  We conclude\r\nthat the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to decide this case.  We further\r\nconclude that (1) the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s findings\r\nwith respect to Moore’s claims for wrongful eviction, unjust enrichment, and\r\nattorney’s fees; (2) Karen French has failed to conclusively establish that she is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law in the amount of $13,647.85 with respect to\r\nher <span>claims against Moore for breach of contract, conversion, quantum meruit, unjust\r\nenrichment, and negligence; and (3) </span>the Frenches failed to conclusively establish that\r\nthey were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their claims for attorney’s fees. \r\nBecause Karen French is the record owner of the tractor, is responsible for the debt\r\nit secures, and Moore has not directed us to any evidence demonstrating that he had\r\na “superior right” to possess the tractor at the time that Karen French took possession\r\nof it, we conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court’s\r\naward of $18,000 to Moore against Karen French for conversion.  We therefore\r\nreverse and render judgment that Moore take nothing on his conversion claim against\r\nKaren French, and affirm the trial court’s judgment in all other respects.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                             </span>Jane Bland</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                             </span>Justice</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Alcala and Bland.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

In the event jurisdiction exists, they challenge the legal sufficiency of the\r\nevidence supporting the trial court’s judgment in favor of appellee Marvin Moore. \r\nWe conclude that the trial court had jurisdiction, affirm in part, and reverse and\r\nrender in part.<span>The Facts</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Kenneth and Nancy French are husband and wife.  They have two daughters,\r\nKaren French and Sandra Boyd.  Marvin Moore is Sandra Boyd’s ex-husband.  While\r\nMoore and Boyd were married, they encountered financial trouble.  Kenneth, Nancy,\r\nand Karen French loaned the couple money to assist them with the operation of their\r\nbusiness, Moore Moving Systems, and to assist them with their personal expenses. \r\nMoore “wanted to expand [the business] and get it out of [their] house.”  Kenneth and\r\nNancy French owned two pieces of real property located at 17847 Huffsmith\r\nKohrville (“the warehouse property”) and 18304 Huffsmith Kohrville (“the office\r\nproperty”), and personal property located on those properties.  According to Moore,\r\nhe entered into a partnership with Kenneth and Nancy French.  Their oral agreement\r\nprovided that Kenneth and Nancy would contribute cash and their warehouse and\r\noffice property to the partnership.  Moore in turn would improve and maintain the\r\nwarehouse and office property, and pay the utilities and taxes assessed on it.  <span>Moore\r\ntestified at trial that he built a fence, a parking lot, and the “main shell” of the\r\nbuilding on the warehouse property, and that the Frenches agreed to “finish out\r\neverything.”  </span>Moore completed the improvements in the spring of 1999.  Moore\r\ntestified that the parties also agreed to expand Moore Moving by developing the\r\nFrenches’ office property.  Thereafter, Moore and Boyd sold their home and invested\r\nsome of the proceeds of that sale into the office property.  The couple divorced in July\r\n2002.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Approximately one week after the divorce became final, the Frenches\r\ndemanded Moore’s key to the warehouse property, and informed him that he had no\r\nright to enter the property.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Two police officers escorted Moore from the property.\r\nWithin several days, Moore sued Nancy and Kenneth French in the Harris County\r\nCourt at Law, alleging wrongful eviction, breach of contract, conversion, and fraud\r\n– all in connection with the warehouse property.  Moore also sued his ex-sister-in-law, Karen French, for conversion and unjust enrichment, in a dispute over ownership\r\nof a tractor.  Kenneth and Nancy French countered by filing two forcible entry and\r\ndetainer actions in the justice court, asking the court to remove Moore from the office\r\nand warehouse property.  The justice court awarded possession of both properties to\r\nKenneth and Nancy French.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The parties agreed to consolidate Moore’s appeal of the justice court rulings\r\nwith Moore’s county court at law suit.  Moore then filed a supplemental petition, in\r\nwhich he added damages for claims arising out of the office property.  The Frenches\r\ncounterclaimed, asserting causes of action for <span>breach of contract, conversion,\r\nquantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and negligence</span><span>.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>The parties waived their right to a jury, and proceeded to a bench trial.  The\r\ntrial court found no partnership existed, but found against Kenneth and Nancy French\r\non Moore’s unjust enrichment and wrongful eviction claims.  It awarded Moore\r\ndamages of $60,000 for unjust enrichment and $5,000 for wrongful eviction.  The\r\ntrial court included another $45,000 for Moore in attorney’s fees.  In addition, the\r\ntrial court found Karen French liable to Moore for conversion, and awarded $18,000\r\nin damages.  Finally, the trial court found Moore liable to Kenneth French on his\r\ncounterclaim, and awarded French $6,000 in damages for unjust enrichment.  The\r\ntrial court also determined that Kenneth French owned a trailer, and that Karen\r\nFrench owned an Agmeier Box Scrapper and a Modern Stand Post Digger.  It thus\r\nordered Moore to transfer possession of that personal property to Kenneth and Karen\r\nFrench, respectively.  The trial court ordered Moore to relinquish possession of the\r\nwarehouse and office properties, and to release all <i>lis pendens</i> he had filed on the\r\nproperty.  It denied all other relief, including <span>the Frenches’ claim for attorney’s fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Jurisdiction and the Amount in Controversy</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Frenches contend that the county court at law lacked jurisdiction over this\r\ncase because the amount in controversy for Moore’s aggregate claims against\r\nKenneth and Nancy French exceeds the trial court’s $100,000 jurisdictional limit.  In\r\nresolving this issue, we consider (1) the standard of review for a challenge to\r\njurisdiction based upon the amount in controversy; (2) the rules to apply in\r\ndetermining the amount in controversy; and (3) the application of those rules to the\r\nfacts of this case.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Standard of Review</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>A court must have subject matter jurisdiction to decide a case. <i> Tex.

Griffin</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1520110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1520110/tejas-toyota-inc-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 776 (Tex.

(counter-plaintiff asserted DTPA claim and claims for damage to credit\r\nreputation, loss of use of automobile, and attorney fees against counter-defendant;\r\namount of each claim aggregated and exceeded jurisdictional limits of county court). \r\nSecond, if a plaintiff asserts a single claim through alternative theories of recovery,\r\nfor the purpose of determining jurisdiction, the amount in controversy is determined\r\nby looking to the theory that would yield the largest award.  <i>See Lucey v. Southeast\r\nTex.

App.—El Paso 1990,\r\nwrit denied).  Third, if one plaintiff asserts separate, independent and distinct claims\r\nagainst multiple defendants, the claims asserted against each defendant are judged\r\nseparately, and must independently lie within the jurisdictional parameters of the\r\ncourt.  <i>Borrego v. del Palacio</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2464452\"><a href=\"/opinion/2464452/borrego-v-del-palacio/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 622 (Tex.

Civ. App.—Texarkana 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.).  Fifth, if a plaintiff’s pleadings\r\nseek an amount within the trial court’s jurisdictional limits, subsequent amendments\r\nincreasing the amount in controversy above the trial court’s jurisdictional limit do not\r\ndivest the trial court of jurisdiction, but only if the increase is due to the passage of\r\ntime.  <i>Flynt v.

Moore\r\nasked the court to “dissolve the partnership and distribute the proceeds from the sale\r\nof the properties.” Moore quantified the value of the assets held by the partnership as\r\nfollows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>From the property, roughly thirty-four thousand, net; and, basically, it\r\nwould be twenty percent, which would be $70,000.00 to them and\r\n[$]80,000.00 to them, approximately; so that would leave roughly two\r\nhundred thousand, plus attorney fees. </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Moore also claimed that if no partnership agreement existed, then he had “receipts\r\nshowing [$]133,000.00.”  Moore agreed on cross-examination that he sought\r\npartnership damages in the amount of $200,000, and that no change in circumstances\r\nhad occurred between the date of trial and the month that he filed suit.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>After hearing Moore’s testimony, the trial judge inquired whether the court had\r\njurisdiction.  He asked Moore’s counsel to address the jurisdictional issue.  Moore\r\nagain testified that, although he did not know the liquidated amount of damages that\r\nhe sought on the date he filed suit, the amount that he initially sought was “about”\r\n$103,000.  Moore testified, however, that at the time he filed suit, he did not have a\r\nliquidated number as to the damages he sought.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Before the evidence closed, Moore’s attorney made the following\r\nannouncement:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Judge, at this time the Plaintiff is going <i>to amend the pleadings to take\r\nout the dissolution of the partnership and the claims made for the\r\ngreater amounts and are going back to the original petition as it was\r\nfiled</i>, which would then come well within the jurisdictional limits of the\r\nCourt.  I can demonstrate that real quickly by the original petition and\r\nthe testimony.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>(Emphasis added).</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>After counsel’s trial amendment, Moore testified that when he filed his original\r\npetition, he sought $5,000 for wrongful eviction, and $60,000 for his claims related\r\nto the warehouse property.  Moore specifically testified that the $103,000 figure\r\nconsisted of “two components” – the warehouse property, which represented\r\n“roughly” $60,000 – and the office property, which represented “roughly 20, \r\n40,000.00.”  The office property dispute arose, however, in Moore’s supplemental \r\npetition.  Moore also testified that he sought separate damages in the amount of\r\n$18,000 for conversion of a tractor against Karen French, and that he could not\r\nquantify the amount of other damages that he sought for conversion.  At a second\r\nhearing on jurisdiction, the Frenches and Moore agreed upon a stipulation of evidence\r\n“as to what the amount in controversy was at the time of filing.”  The agreed\r\nstipulation reads: “the Court’s understanding is that the total for actual damages the\r\nPlaintiffs are seeking did not have value in excess of $99,000 on the date of filing.” \r\nBased upon the evidence it received, including the stipulation, the trial court\r\nconcluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the case and enter judgment.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>On appeal, the Frenches contend that the trial court lacked jurisdiction,\r\nmaintaining that parties may not confer jurisdiction by agreement if no jurisdiction\r\nexists.  Moore responds that, in context, his trial testimony referred to an aggregate\r\namount in controversy of all parties and all claims, including claims in his amended\r\npetition he later abandoned, and his independent claims for conversion against co-defendant Karen French.

In that case, Gonzalez failed\r\nto timely perfect an appeal, and the trial court lost its jurisdiction.

Unlike <i>Gonzalez</i>, the parties in this case\r\ndid not attempt to resurrect jurisdiction in the trial court with a stipulation of law,\r\nafter it had been lost by operation of law.  Rather, in this case, the parties submitted\r\nagreed evidence as to certain facts.  Based upon those facts, the trial court determined\r\nthat it had jurisdiction.  It is true that, if a trial court lacks jurisdiction, it cannot be\r\nconferred through an agreement of the parties.  <i>Gonzalez</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 221-22; <i>Kirk\r\nv.

It is also true, however, that\r\n“where potential jurisdiction is dependent on the existence of facts, the litigating\r\nparties to a cause can agree on the jurisdictional facts; and from such agreed facts the\r\ncourt can determine the question of jurisdiction.”  <i>Head</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span>, 152 S.W.2d at\r\n728-29.  Because the parties in this case agreed on certain facts, and based upon those\r\nfacts, the trial court determined it had jurisdiction, we conclude that the county court\r\nat law properly determined that it had jurisdiction over this lawsuit.  <i>See id; see also\r\nHouston Lighting &amp; Power Co. v.

Moore offered receipts for $60,000 that\r\nhe spent on improvements to the warehouse property, admitted without objection, and\r\ntestified that the Frenches helped him “finish out” the building on the warehouse\r\nproperty, which he completed in the spring of 1999.  Moore testified that he agreed\r\nwith Kenneth and Nancy French that the money he invested in the warehouse\r\nproperty would be refunded upon its sale, together with anything left after the\r\nFrenches had been paid back for their investment.

Moore admitted that he was not making payments on the tractor at\r\nthe time of trial, and that payments were nonetheless due each month on the tractor. \r\nKaren French testified that she is the borrower on the $18,000 note, and she took\r\npossession of the tractor to keep track of it.  She further explained, “When he left my\r\nmom’s house, I would not know where he was.  I wasn’t assured that he was going\r\nto pay these loans, and I went ahead and asked him if I could use the tractor.”  Moore\r\nrelinquished possession to French.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Although Moore argues in his brief that he had a superior right to possess the\r\ntractor, he has not directed us to any evidence in the record, nor have we found any,\r\ndemonstrating that he had a superior right to possess the tractor at the time that Karen\r\nFrench took possession of it – indeed, she is the record owner and, as the borrower\r\non the note, was responsible for payment.  Absent any evidence of a lease or other\r\nagreement, Moore did not present legally sufficient evidence to support his\r\nconversion claim.

The Frenches have briefed these issues as a challenge to the legal\r\nsufficiency of the evidence.  Neither Karen, Nancy, or Kenneth French request that\r\nwe remand this case to the trial court on the basis that the trial court’s findings are\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, as an alternative to\r\nrendition.

Nor does he dispute that she purchased a computer and fax\r\nmachine for $1,864.91, and that he had possession of that equipment.  Karen French\r\ncontends that “in light of the uncontroverted testimony and documentary evidence,\r\nthe trial court should have awarded total damages to Karen French of $13,647.85,”\r\nand “[t]hat this Court should reverse the trial court’s judgment and render judgment\r\nthat Karen French recover actual damages against Moore in the amount of\r\n$13,647.85.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Moore testified that, in October 2000, Karen French borrowed $11,782.94 and\r\ngave him the proceeds of that loan.  He also testified that he was not aware whether\r\nor not the loan had been fully repaid.  When asked whether he “stopped giving her\r\nmonthly payments that you and/or Sandra used to give her when y’all were together,”\r\nMoore responded that he continued to make payments on that loan after he and\r\nSandra Boyd had separated.  When asked why he could not produce a canceled check\r\nto document that he made payments after he and Sandra had separated, Moore\r\nexplained that he gave Karen French cash.  Moore also acknowledged at trial that\r\nKaren French purchased a computer and fax machine for Moore Moving, but Moore\r\ntestified that he paid her cash for that equipment five months after she purchased it. \r\nAs further evidence that he paid for that equipment, Moore explained that he had the\r\npaperwork for that equipment, and that Karen French had retained possession of the\r\npaperwork for the equipment until after he had fully paid her for it. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>As Moore disputed French’s testimony, Karen French fails to meet her burden\r\nof showing that the evidence conclusively establishes that she was entitled to\r\njudgment in the amount of $11,782.94 regarding the loan proceeds, and $1,864.91\r\nregarding the computer and fax machine.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Karen French further complains of the trial court’s refusal to award her\r\nadditional monetary damages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  She asserted claims against Moore for breach of\r\ncontract, conversion, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and negligence.

They claim entitlement to all of the attorney’s fees that they\r\nincurred in this lawsuit, because the claims in this case are so intertwined that their\r\nattorney was unable to segregate his attorney’s fees between claims, or between\r\nprosecution and defense activities.  Moore contends that the Frenches failed to\r\npresent conclusive evidence in support of their claim for attorney’s fees, and that they\r\nare therefore not entitled to rendition of judgment. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In order to show the reasonableness and necessity of attorney fees, the party\r\nseeking attorney fees must show that the fees were incurred (1) while suing the party\r\nsought to be charged with the fees and (2) on a claim which allows recovery of such\r\nfees.  <i>Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 10 (Tex. 1991).  A party\r\nseeking attorney fees has a duty to segregate nonrecoverable fees from recoverable\r\nfees, and to segregate the fees owed by different parties.  <i>See id.</i> at 11.  An exception\r\nto the duty to segregate arises when the attorney fees incurred are in connection with\r\nclaims arising out of the same transaction, and are so interrelated that their\r\nprosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts.  <i>Sterling,\r\n</i>822 S.W.2d at 11.   When causes of action involved in a suit are dependent upon the\r\nsame set of facts or circumstances, and thus are “intertwined to the point of being\r\ninseparable,” the party suing for attorney fees may recover the entire amount covering\r\nall claims.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At trial, the Frenches’ attorney testified that the claims in this case are\r\nintertwined, and he thus could not segregate his fees between claims, nor between\r\nprosecution and defense activities.  He also testified that the Frenches incurred\r\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $15,000 through trial.  In support of their contention\r\nthat they are entitled to rendition of judgment in the amount of $15,000, the Frenches\r\nrely on the trial court’s pre-judgment findings, which state that they are entitled to\r\nattorney’s fees incurred in the prosecution of their two forcible entry and detainer\r\nactions, and <i>Caldwell &amp; Hurst v.

One of the requirements\r\nof Section 24.006 is that the landlord must provide a tenant unlawfully in possession\r\nof the landlord’s premises with a written demand to vacate the premises.  The\r\ndemanding party must send the demand by registered or certified mail, return receipt\r\nrequested, at least 10 days before suit is filed.  <span>Tex. Prop.

Because\r\ntheir demand did not comply with the requirements of Section 24.006 of the Texas\r\nProperty Code, the Frenches have failed to conclusively establish that they are\r\nentitled to recover their attorney’s fees incurred in the prosecution of the forcible\r\nentry and detainer causes of action.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i><span>Unjust Enrichment</span></i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In order to be eligible to recover attorney’s fees pursuant to Chapter 38 of the\r\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a claimant must comply with Section\r\n38.002.  Section 38.002 requires that:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(1) the claimant must be represented by an attorney; </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(2) the claimant must present the claim to the opposing party or to a duly\r\nauthorized agent of the opposing party;  and </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>(3) payment for the amount owed must not have been tendered before\r\nthe expiration of the 30th day after the claim is presented.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Tex.

The Frenches have not\r\ndirected us to evidence in the record demonstrating that they complied with the\r\nprocedural requirements of Section 38.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. \r\n<i>See Sterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 690; <i>Smith</i>, 774 S.W.2d at 412 (party who attacks legal\r\nsufficiency of adverse finding on an issue as to which he bore the burden of proof\r\nmust demonstrate on appeal that evidence conclusively established all vital facts in\r\nsupport of issue).  Because the Frenches have not demonstrated that they complied\r\nwith the procedural requirements of Section 38.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and\r\nRemedies Code, the Frenches have failed to conclusively establish that they are\r\nentitled to recover their attorney’s fees incurred in the prosecution of Kenneth\r\nFrenches’ unjust enrichment claim.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>If the parties agree on facts, and from those agreed facts the trial court\r\ndetermines the legal question of jurisdiction, a party is estopped from asserting on\r\nappeal that the facts are different from those agreed to in the trial court.  We conclude\r\nthat the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to decide this case.  We further\r\nconclude that (1) the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s findings\r\nwith respect to Moore’s claims for wrongful eviction, unjust enrichment, and\r\nattorney’s fees; (2) Karen French has failed to conclusively establish that she is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law in the amount of $13,647.85 with respect to\r\nher <span>claims against Moore for breach of contract, conversion, quantum meruit, unjust\r\nenrichment, and negligence; and (3) </span>the Frenches failed to conclusively establish that\r\nthey were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their claims for attorney’s fees. \r\nBecause Karen French is the record owner of the tractor, is responsible for the debt\r\nit secures, and Moore has not directed us to any evidence demonstrating that he had\r\na “superior right” to possess the tractor at the time that Karen French took possession\r\nof it, we conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court’s\r\naward of $18,000 to Moore against Karen French for conversion.  We therefore\r\nreverse and render judgment that Moore take nothing on his conversion claim against\r\nKaren French, and affirm the trial court’s judgment in all other respects.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                             </span>Jane Bland</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                             </span>Justice</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Alcala and Bland.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
