While this\n\npractice facilitates discourse between readers and interaction with their online news\n\nproducts, it also opens the door to potentially objectionable material, as readers are\n\nallowed to post comments anonymously, hiding behind a pseudonym.              This case\n\naddresses whether a non-party news organization can be compelled to disclose to a\n\nplaintiff who has filed a defamation lawsuit the identity of one such anonymous\n\ncommenter. In order to analyze this issue of first impression in our state, we consider\n\nIndiana’s Shield Law, which provides an absolute privilege to the news media not to\n\ndisclose the source of any information obtained in the course of employment, the First\n                                             2\n\fAmendment, which has a celebrated history of vigorously protecting anonymous speech,\n\nand the Indiana Constitution, which more jealously protects freedom of speech\n\nguarantees than the United States Constitution.\n\n      Under our Shield Law, we hold that an anonymous person who comments on an\n\nalready-published online story and whose comment was not used by the news\n\norganization in carrying out its newsgathering and reporting function cannot be\n\nconsidered “the source of any information procured or obtained in the course of the\n\nperson’s employment or representation of a newspaper” according to Indiana Code\n\nsection 34-46-4-2. Under the United States Constitution, to strike a balance between\n\nprotecting anonymous speech and preventing defamatory speech, we adopt a modified\n\nversion of the Dendrite test, requiring the plaintiff to produce prima facie evidence of\n\nevery element of his defamation claim that does not depend on the commenter’s identity\n\nbefore the news organization is compelled to disclose that identity. With this test being\n\ncalled the most speech-protective standard that has been articulated and neither party\n\nadvocating a different test, we adopt the modified version of the Dendrite test under the\n\nIndiana Constitution as well.\n\n                                Facts and Procedural History\n\n      Jeffrey Miller was president and CEO of Junior Achievement of Central Indiana,\n\nInc. from September 1994 until his retirement on December 31, 2008. Jennifer Burk\n\nreplaced Miller as President and CEO of Junior Achievement. After his retirement from\n\nJunior Achievement, Miller continued in his role as president of the Experiential\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fLearning and Entrepreneurship Foundation (“the Foundation”), an organization that\n\nsupported Junior Achievement, until February 2010.\n\n      In May 2008, during Miller’s tenure as president, a three-way collaborative project\n\nwas announced between the Foundation, Junior Achievement, and Ivy Tech Community\n\nCollege for the Foundation to construct a $4 million culinary school on the Junior\n\nAchievement campus to be financed in part by a $2 million grant from the Central\n\nIndiana Community Foundation/Eugene Glick family (“The Glick Fund”). Brian Payne\n\nis president of Central Indiana Community Foundation. As a result of this collaboration,\n\nIvy Tech would lease the culinary school from the Foundation once the school was fully\n\nconstructed and furnished with the latest culinary equipment.\n\n      Construction began in August 2009 but was suspended in January 2010 because\n\nThe Glick Fund stopped paying for the invoices submitted by the Foundation even\n\nthough there was sufficient money in the fund. Miller claims that the funding stopped\n\nbecause Burk and Payne made allegations that he somehow misappropriated the funds\n\nthat had already been distributed.    Specifically, Miller alleges that Burk made the\n\nfollowing defamatory statements:\n\n      (1) On October 22, 2009, Burk stated during a Junior Achievement\n      Executive Committee meeting that Miller had been “very dishonest” about\n      funds she believed should be available to Junior Achievement.\n\n      (2) In the fall of 2009, Burk told Sharon Lents, the former Junior\n      Achievement Chief Operating Officer, that “Jeff Miller’s House of Cards is\n      about to fall down.”\n\n      (3) In March 2010, Burk stated that she was distancing Junior Achievement\n      from Miller and the Foundation, which implies that Miller had\n      misappropriated the funds.\n\n\n                                            4\n\fAppellant’s App. p. 28. As for Payne, Miller alleges that in early 2010, he was in\n\ndiscussions with individuals in Mayor of Indianapolis Greg Ballard’s office regarding the\n\nposition of Senior Policy Advisor. Miller alleges that a job announcement was scheduled\n\nfor the end of February when Payne told Mayor Ballard’s Chief of Staff that Miller had\n\nmisappropriated funds and there were concerns regarding Miller and the way money from\n\nThe Glick Fund was inappropriately moved around at Junior Achievement and the\n\nFoundation. Mayor Ballard’s Chief of Staff withdrew Miller’s employment offer. Miller\n\nclaims that Burk’s and Payne’s statements are false.\n\n        After Burk and Payne allegedly made these defamatory statements, The\n\nIndianapolis Star (“The Star”) published an online news article on March 19, 2010,\n\nentitled “Junior Achievement faces questions, audit.” Id. at 64. The article stated that\n\nJunior Achievement was “facing a series of questions about its own financial affairs –\n\nquestions about missed payments to contractors on a building project and unaccounted-\n\nfor grant money.” Id. The article also stated that Payne said The Glick Fund had “halted\n\npayment” and those payments “won’t resume . . . until an independent auditor can sort\n\nout what’s become of the $765,000 in grant payments that Junior Achievement has\n\nalready received.” Id.\n\n        On April 6, 2010,1 an anonymous commenter using the pseudonym\n\n“DownWithTheColts” posted the following comment about the story on indystar.com:\n\n\n\n        1\n          Miller asserts that this is the date the anonymous commenter made the post. However, the\nactual comment indicates that it was posted at 11:48 a.m. on March 23, 2010. See Appellant’s App. p. 66.\nThe Star notes that “[n]othing in the record indicates the trial court relied on either date to support its\nOrder, and The Star does not assert the privilege analysis needs a determination of the correct date.”\nAppellant’s Br. p. 4.\n                                                    5\n\f      This is not JA’s responsibility. They need to look at the FORMER\n      president of JA and others on the [Foundation] board. The “missing”\n      money can be found in their bank accounts.\n\nId. at 66. The Star concedes that there is no evidence in the record that it used this\n\ncomment in any way, such as to pursue the lead for a follow-up story.\n\n      That “DownWithTheColts” commented on an online news article has become\n\ncommonplace today. “As news organizations have experimented with ways to encourage\n\ntheir readers to interact with their online news products, one of the most popular options\n\nhas been to allow readers to post comments adjacent to a story.” Jane E. Kirtley, Mask,\n\nShield, and Sword: Should the Journalist’s Privilege Protect the Identity of Anonymous\n\nPosters to News Media Websites?, 94 Minn. L. Rev. 1478, 1488 (2010). Although this\n\ncan facilitate robust discussion and promote a “conversation” between journalists and\n\ntheir readers, it has also encouraged “moronic, anonymous, unsubstantiated and often\n\nvenomous [speech].” Id. at 1488-89 (quotation omitted). “This is particularly likely to\n\noccur when posters are permitted to use a pseudonym, or remain anonymous.” Id. at\n\n1489; see also Ashley I. Kissinger & Katharine Larsen, Protections for Anonymous\n\nOnline Speech, 1068 PLI/Pat 815, 822 (Nov. 2011) (“Millions of people communicate on\n\nthe Internet every day. They choose a login name other than their own to post comments\n\non websites or in other fora, they share files without sharing their names, and they avoid\n\nproviding any personal information when registering for email addresses and blogs. . . .\n\nAs the number of so-called ‘anonymous’ users of the Internet has continued to rise, so\n\nhave efforts to ‘unmask’ them.”). As shown below, a common compromise is to require\n\nusers to register with the website, provide some form of identifying information, and\n\n\n                                            6\n\fagree to abide by the news organization’s Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy.\n\nKirtley, 94 Minn. L. Rev. at 1489.\n\n        Before the comment by “DownWithTheColts,” the editor of The Star, Dennis\n\nRyerson, announced that his newspaper would begin requiring commenter registration\n\nand take other steps, such as segregating comments from stories, in response to reader\n\ncomplaints about offensive rants. Jason A. Martin, Mark R. Caramanica & Anthony L.\n\nFargo, Anonymous Speakers and Confidential Sources: Using Shield Laws When They\n\nOverlap Online, 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y 89, 90 (Winter 2011) (citing Dennis Ryerson,\n\nStory Comments Welcome—If Tone is Civil, The Indianapolis Star, Jan. 10, 2010, at B7).2\n\nThen, while this case was on appeal, Ryerson announced yet a new change for his paper,\n\nconnecting posts to a commenter’s Facebook identity3:\n\n        For several years we have allowed users of IndyStar.com, our main news\n        website, to provide their comments with stories we post. Our intent was to\n\n\n\n        2\n            An April 2010 article in The New York Times on this point notes:\n\n        When new sites, after years of hanging back, embraced the idea of allowing readers to\n        post comments, the near-universal assumption was that anyone could weigh in and\n        remain anonymous. But now, that idea is under attack from several directions, and\n        journalists, more than ever, are questioning whether anonymity should be a given on\n        news sites.\n\nRichard Perez-Pena, News Sites Rethink Anonymous Online Comments, N.Y. Times, Apr. 11, 2010,\nwww.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/technology/12comments.html. The article noted that The Washington\nPost, The New York Times, The Post, The Huffington Post, and many others had moved in stages toward\nrequiring that people register before posting comments and provide information about themselves that is\nnot shown onscreen. Id.\n        3\n           On December 5, 2011, Miller filed a Notice of Additional Authority citing Ryerson’s article as\nadditional authority (as well as an article from a Detroit newspaper). On December 9, The Star filed a\nmotion to strike Miller’s notice of additional authority because “Newspaper columns published nearly\ntwo years after the anonymous source’s comments at issue in this appeal do not constitute ‘authority.’”\nIndiana Newspapers, Inc. v. Miller, No. 49A02-1103-PL-234 (Dec. 9, 2011). In an order issued today,\nwe deny The Star’s motion to strike and note that while we reference Ryerson’s article, we do so merely\nto explain the background of this case, and not as authority when analyzing the merits.\n                                                     7\n\fuse the Internet to provide immediate reader comment as stories were\nbreaking.\n\nUnlike our signature requirements for letters to the editor, we have allowed\nanonymous comments on IndyStar.com. Our theory was that robust\nconversation would promote more conversation and that we should not\nrestrict the openness of the worldwide web.\n\nIt didn’t work as intended, which is why, beginning Tuesday [November\n29, 2011], we will be moving all story comment to the Facebook social\nnetwork site.\n\nWe’re doing this because along with anonymity has come an unacceptable\nlevel of hatred, crude language and other nastiness.\n\nWe’ve tried to limit it. First, we hid the comments so they wouldn’t\nautomatically appear with a story. If readers wanted to read the posts they\ncould, but they needed to request access to the comments.\n\nIt was a small step in the right direction, but it wasn’t sufficient.\n\nWe then contracted with an outside monitoring service to help us assess and\nremove comments users flagged as objectionable.\n\nThat helped as well, but still the abuses continued.\n\nSeveral newspapers have “beta” tested Facebook comments and universally\nfound that tying comments to a person’s Facebook identity promotes civil\ndiscourse. An ambitious study by the Los Angeles Times allowed readers\nto post comments anonymously while other readers were directed to\nFacebook. The latter significantly reduced name-calling and other bad\nbehavior.\n\nNo system is perfect. Not all readers have or want Facebook accounts.\nSome individuals may have worthy comment or news about an institution\nor business, but because of the fear of offending a boss or colleague won’t\noffer it if they can be identified.\n\nBut I’m convinced that many, many more people are avoiding comment\nnow because they don’t want to participate in what they perceive as a gutter\nof ugliness.\n\nStory comment is a privilege, not a right. Under the First Amendment,\nnews organizations may exercise any standards they deem appropriate for\n\n                                        8\n\f       online or print platforms. If people want to be less than civil with their\n       remarks, fine by me. They’ll just have to do it someplace other than on\n       IndyStar.com.\n\nDennis Ryerson, Editorial, Move to Facebook Comments is Meant to Keep the\n\nConversation         Civil,       The       Indianapolis        Star,       Nov.       27,       2011,\n\nwww.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011111270379.4\n\n       The Star’s Privacy Notice, which governs how information from its online users is\n\ncollected and used, contains a subsection entitled How We Collect and Use Information.\n\nIt provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about our\n       visitors if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such\n       disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to\n       enforce our Terms of Service; or (c) to protect the rights, property, or\n       personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors,\n       employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.\n\nPrivacy Notice, The Indianapolis Star, http://www.indystar.com/section/privacy (last\n\nupdated Nov. 9, 2011). The Star’s Terms of Service includes a subsection entitled\n\nResponsibility for User-Provided Content, which generally provides: (1) commenters\n\nhave read and agree to the rules; (2) the materials will not violate the rights of or cause\n\ninjury to any person or entity; (3) commenters are responsible for materials posted; (4)\n\nThe Star does not control the messages; (5) The Star has no obligation to monitor any\n\ninformation; (6) commenters will indemnify The Star and hold it harmless; and (7) The\n\n\n       4\n          And on November 30, 2011, The New York Times introduced a similar policy that requires\n“trusted commenters,” whose posts do not have to be screened, “to connect [their] Facebook account and\n[their] commenting profile to verify [their] name and location.” Jill Abramson, Editorial, A Note to Our\nReaders About Comments, link to Trusted Commenters,                    N.Y.

Appellant’s App. p. 24. Thereafter, Miller sought non-party7 discovery\n\nfrom The Star requesting the following:\n\n        Any and all records, documents, including electronic information or\n        documents and/or digital information of all kinds, log files, reports, notes or\n        any other documentation, relating to the posting and/or identity of\n        “DownWithTheColts,” the individual who posted a comment on the article\n        titled “Junior Achievement faces questions, audit” (dated March 19, 2010)\n        posted on IndyStar.com.\n\nId. at 62.\n\n        After Miller unsuccessfully tried to obtain the requested discovery from The Star,\n\nhe resorted to the courts and filed a motion to compel discovery. Id. at 16 (CCS), 52.\n\nThe Star filed an extensive brief in opposition to Miller’s motion to compel claiming\n\n\n        5\n          We note that Miller, who relies on the Privacy Notice and Terms of Service for his argument,\ndoes not provide us with The Star’s Privacy Notice and Terms of Service that were effective when\n“DownWithTheColts” made the anonymous post. Rather, he refers us to the current ones. As noted\nabove, however, the Privacy Notice and Terms of Service were last updated November 9, 2011, and\nJanuary 21, 2011, respectively. Nevertheless, The Star does not argue that the Privacy Notice and Terms\nof Service, which Miller quotes in his brief, have been substantially updated since “DownWithTheColts”\ncommented on the online newspaper article.\n        6\n           Miller later amended his complaint to add his wife, Cynthia S. Miller, as a plaintiff and a claim\nfor her loss of consortium. Appellant’s App. p. 10 (CCS), 24. Nevertheless, we continue to refer to the\nplaintiffs in the singular as “Miller” and note that Cynthia’s claim rises and falls with her husband’s\ndefamation claim.\n        7\n          The Communications Decency Act (CDA) bars plaintiffs from holding internet service\nproviders (ISPs) and website operators legally responsible for information posted independently by third\nparties.

Specifically,\n\nSweeney is employed and receives income as the “digital news director for The\n\nIndianapolis Star, a daily newspaper of general circulation published in Indianapolis,\n\nIndiana.” Id. at 110. Sweeney reports to Scott Goldman, a senior editor who serves as\n\nthe newsroom’s director of digital and visuals, who in turn reports to Ryerson. Id.\n\nAccording to Sweeney, before readers can provide content to indystar.com or provide\n\ncommentary on the website about editorial content supplied by The Star, “they are\n\nrequired to provide the website with information about themselves. The Star maintains\n\nthis information about the source of reader-supplied content and commentary, and does\n\nnot publish or otherwise disclose it.” Id. at 111.\n\n        Miller amended his complaint to add numerous individuals and businesses,\n\nincluding John Doe #3 a/k/a “DownWithTheColts,” as defendants. Id. at 16 (CCS).\n\nSpecifically, in his defamation per se claim, Miller alleged that the defendants’\n\nstatements about his misappropriation of funds were “unfounded” and “made with the\n\nknowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for whether they were true or\n\nfalse so as to indicate a conscious indifference to the rights of Mr. Miller.” Appellee’s\n\nApp. p. 14. The trial court granted this motion. Appellant’s App. p. 16; Appellee’s App.\n\np. 1.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f        Without holding a hearing, the trial court issued an order compelling discovery.8\n\nThis order provides, in pertinent part:\n\n        Non-Party The Indianapolis Star is hereby ORDERED to produce\n        immediately the following:\n\n                1. Any and all records, documents, including electronic information\n        or documents and/or digital information of all kinds, log files, reports, notes\n        or any other documentation, relating to the posting and/or identity of\n        “DownWithTheColts,” the individual who posted a comment on the article\n        titled “Junior Achievement faces questions, audit” (date March 19, 2010)\n        posted on IndyStar.com.\n\nAppellant’s App. p. 113.\n\n        The Star now appeals the trial court’s order compelling discovery of the identity of\n\n“DownWithTheColts,” which has been stayed pending appeal.9 Two amici curiae are\n\nparticipating in this appeal, both on behalf of The Star: (1) Public Citizen, Inc., which is a\n\npublic-interest organization in Washington, D.C., and (2) numerous media organizations,\n\nLee Enterprises, Incorporated (The Times of Northwest Indiana), LIN Television\n\nCorporation d/b/a LIN Media, The E.W. Scripps Company, Gray Television, Inc.,\n\nHoosier State Press Association, and The Electronic Frontier Foundation (collectively\n\n“Lee Enterprises”). We held oral argument in December 2011.\n\n                                      Discussion and Decision\n\n\n        8\n          Miller also sought discovery from other non-party news organizations, such as The Indianapolis\nBusiness Journal and WRTV-6. These websites also contained alleged defamatory comments about\nMiller from commenters with pseudonyms. See Appellee’s App. p. 34-38. It appears that The IBJ and\nWRTV-6 complied with Miller’s discovery requests, with the exception of one comment of a sexual\nnature on WRTV-6 which the news station did not provide discovery on. See Appellee’s Br. p. 13 (noting\nthat an emergency hearing on this matter had been scheduled for August 17, 2011, which was after the\nbriefs in this case were filed). The Star points out in its reply brief that it “is not bound by other news\norganizations’ decisions.” Appellant’s Reply Br. p. 7.\n        9\n           The CCS reflects that The Star filed a motion to stay order pending appeal and Miller opposed a\nstay, but the CCS does not reflect whether it was granted. See Appellant’s App. p. 18, 22.\n                                                    12\n\f       In this issue of first impression in our state, The Star raises three main defenses\n\nthat it claims protect it from being compelled to disclose the identity of\n\n“DownWithTheColts”: (1) Indiana’s Shield Law; (2) the First Amendment right to\n\nanonymous speech; and (3) Article 1, Section 9 of the Indiana Constitution. The amici\n\ncuriae in this case focus their briefs on issue two, anonymous speech under the First\n\nAmendment.\n\n       Miller argues that the identity of “DownWithTheColts” is essential to his\n\ndefamation claim because without the identity, he has no means to identify the\n\nanonymous commenter and hold him accountable for his malicious defamation on\n\nindystar.com. This requires us to carefully balance the rights of Miller to seek redress for\n\ninjury, The Star’s right not to disclose the identity of the anonymous commenter\n\n“DownWithTheColts” under our Shield Law, and the right of “DownWithTheColts” to\n\nspeak anonymously.\n\n       The rules of discovery are designed to “allow a liberal discovery process, the\n\npurposes of which are to provide parties with information essential to litigation of the\n\nissues, to eliminate surprise, and to promote settlement.”         Hatfield v. Edward J.\n\nDeBartolo Corp., 676 N.E.2d 395, 399 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997), reh’g denied, trans. denied.\n\nOur review of discovery matters is limited to determining whether the trial court abused\n\nits discretion. Bridgestone Ams. Holding, Inc. v. Mayberry, 878 N.E.2d 189, 191 (Ind.\n\n2007). An abuse of discretion may occur if the trial court’s decision is clearly against the\n\nlogic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court or if the trial court has\n\nmisinterpreted the law. Id.\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                                     I. Indiana’s Shield Law\n\n        The Star first contends that Indiana’s Shield Law protects it from being compelled\n\nto disclose the identity of the anonymous commenter, “DownWithTheColts.”\n\n        Traditionally, a newsgatherer, in the absence of a statute or court rule to the\n\ncontrary, has no privilege to conceal and may be compelled to disclose in a legal\n\nproceeding before a court, grand jury, or other governmental bodies the confidential\n\ninformation or the identity of a confidential source of information obtained by him in his\n\nprofessional capacity. Romualdo P. Eclavea, Annotation, Privilege of Newsgatherer\n\nAgainst Disclosure of Confidential Sources or Information, 99 A.L.R.3d 37 (Supp. 2011).\n\n“Neither the common law nor the United States Constitution[10] give a newsperson a\n\nprivilege to refuse to disclose the identity of a person, or ‘source,’ who gave the\n\nnewsperson information.”          12 Robert Lowell Miller, Jr., Indiana Practice: Indiana\n\nEvidence § 501.582 (3rd ed. 2007) (footnotes omitted).\n\n        This common-law rule of disclosure, however, has been abrogated or modified in\n\nsome states by the enactment of statutes commonly known as “shield laws.” Eclavea, 99\n\nA.L.R.3d 37 (footnote omitted). To date, approximately thirty-nine states and the District\n\nof Columbia have enacted reporter shield laws. See Joshua A. Faucette, Note, Your\n\nSecret’s Safe With Me . . . Or So You Think: How the States Have Cashed in on\n\n\n        10\n           The United States Supreme Court held in the seminal case of Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665\n(1972), that reporters called to testify before a grand jury do not enjoy a First Amendment “conditional”\nprivilege to refuse disclosure of confidential sources or information gathered in the course of reporting.\nIn re WTHR-TV, 693 N.E.2d 1, 10 (Ind. 1998). The Branzburg Court suggested that journalists could\nseek protection for sources through state legislatures. 408 U.S. at 706. In addition, the Branzburg Court\nnoted, “It goes without saying, of course, that we are powerless to bar state courts from responding in\ntheir own way and construing their own constitutions so as to recognize a news[person]’s privilege, either\nqualified or absolute.” Id.\n\n                                                   14\n\fBranzburg’s “Blank Check,” 44 Val. U. L. Rev. 183, 187 n.31 (2009) (listing thirty-five\n\nstates plus District of Columbia); State Shield Law Statutes, Media Law Resource Center,\n\nhttp://www.medialaw.org/Template.cfm?Section=State_Shield_Law_Statutes                 (last\n\nvisited Nov. 17, 2011) (listing four additional states that have since adopted shield laws);\n\nsee also Martin et al., 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y at 105 n.90. These laws generally grant\n\nnewsgatherers the privilege – of varying breadth or nature – not to disclose in a legal\n\nproceeding the information or the source of information obtained by them in their\n\nprofessional capacity. Eclavea, 99 A.L.R.3d 37; see also 81 Am. Jur. 2d Witnesses § 526\n\n(2004) (“In some jurisdictions, a statutory ‘shield law’ provides those who collect, edit,\n\nor publish news at least a qualified privilege in a legal proceeding or investigation from\n\ndisclosing the source of any information obtained by him or her.”). Federal law has no\n\nstatutory equivalent to the various states’ shield laws. Too Much Media, LLC v. Hale, 20\n\nA.3d 364, 374 (N.J. 2011). The extent of a newsperson’s privilege under federal law\n\nderives from the First Amendment, id., and the anonymous speech aspect of the First\n\nAmendment is addressed later in this opinion.\n\n       Indiana’s Shield Law is codified at Indiana Code chapter 34-46-4 (formerly\n\nIndiana Code chapter 34-3-5). Our Shield Law has only two sections. Specifically,\n\nIndiana Code section 34-46-4-2 provides:\n\n       A person described in section 1 of this chapter shall not be compelled to\n       disclose in any legal proceedings or elsewhere the source of any\n       information procured or obtained in the course of the person’s employment\n       or representation of a newspaper, periodical, press association, radio\n       station, television station, or wire service, whether:\n\n              (1) published or not published:\n                     (A) in the newspaper or periodical; or\n\n                                            15\n\f                     (B) by the press association or wire service; or\n              (2) broadcast or not broadcast by the radio station or television\n              station;\n\n       by which the person is employed.\n\n(Emphasis added). The other section, Indiana Code section 34-46-4-1, in turn, provides\n\nthat the chapter applies to:\n\n       (1) any person connected with, or any person who has been connected with\n       or employed by:\n\n              (A) a newspaper or other periodical issued at regular intervals and\n              having a general circulation; or\n              (B) a recognized press association or wire service;\n\n       as a bone fide owner, editorial or reportorial employee, who receives or has\n       received income from legitimate gathering, writing, editing and\n       interpretation of news.\n\n       (2) any person connected with a licensed radio or television station as\n       owner, official, or as an editorial or reportorial employee who receives or\n       has received income from legitimate gathering, writing, editing,\n       interpreting, announcing or broadcasting of news.\n\nThis privilege is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. Miller,\n\n§ 501.82.\n\n       This statute has never been construed in the context presented in this case. Indeed,\n\na statute should be construed so as to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the\n\nlegislature as expressed in the statute. Fuller v. State, 752 N.E.2d 235, 237 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n2001). In so doing, the objects and purposes of the statute in question must be considered\n\nas well as the effect and consequences of such interpretation. Id. at 237-38.         When\n\ninterpreting the words of a single section of a statute, we must construe them with due\n\nregard for all other sections of the act and with regard for the legislative intent to carry\n\n\n                                            16\n\fout the spirit and purpose of the act. Id. at 238. We presume that the legislature intended\n\nits language to be applied in a logical manner consistent with the statute’s underlying\n\npolicy and goals. Id. Courts are not bound to adopt a construction that would lead to\n\nmanifest absurdity in order that the strict letter of the statute may be adhered to. Id. They\n\nwill rather look to the intention of the legislature, as gathered from the import of the\n\nwhole act, and will carry out such intention as thus obtained. Id.\n\n        Our Shield Law was first enacted in 1941. Jamerson v. Anderson Newspapers,\n\nInc., 469 N.E.2d 1243, 1247 n.2 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984), overruled on other grounds by\n\nMilkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1 (1990); see also Hestand v. State, 257 Ind.\n\n191, 273 N.E.2d 282, 283 (1971) (listing legislative history of Indiana’s shield-law\n\nstatute up to that point, starting in 1941).      Before the 1973 amendment and 1998\n\nrecodification that produced the statute in its present form, the privilege was “far more\n\nrestrictive” regarding who was covered by the statute. Miller, § 501.582. That is, the\n\nprivilege could be claimed only by those whose principal income was associated with\n\nnews.     Id.   The privilege was available only to those associated with licensed\n\nbroadcasting stations or newspapers published at least tri-weekly for five consecutive\n\nyears in the same city or town with a paid circulation of at least two percent of the county\n\nin which it was published. Id.\n\n        Despite the Shield Law’s lengthy existence in our state, there is very little Indiana\n\ncase law on the statute. And what case law we have is not current. In one of these cases,\n\nJamerson, a former police chief sued Anderson Newspapers, Inc. and a reporter from The\n\nAnderson Herald for a series of articles which the chief considered to be defamatory.\n\n\n                                             17\n\fThe chief later filed a motion to compel the newspaper and the reporter to reveal their\n\nunnamed sources. The defendants refused, asserting the Shield Law as a defense. A\n\nbench trial was held, and “judgment was entered that [the chief] take nothing in the\n\naction.” Jamerson, 469 N.E.2d at 1245.\n\n       On appeal, we said that “our shield law . . . confers, without a doubt, an absolute\n\nprivilege on the news media.” Id. at 1246. As support, we cited the following language\n\nfrom the statute, “Any person . . . connected with a newspaper . . . shall not be compelled\n\nto disclose in any legal proceeding or elsewhere the source of any information procured\n\nor obtained in the course of his employment . . . .” Id. Therefore, while Indiana’s\n\nprivilege is indeed absolute, it is only absolute to the extent a source is involved. This\n\nwas no doubt the case in Jamerson.\n\n       At the time of Jamerson in 1984, we noted that Indiana was one of eight states that\n\nhad what was described as the “ultimate” in news media protections; that is, the press had\n\n“a seemingly unassailable privilege not to disclose the source of any information obtained\n\nin the course of employment.” Id. at 1248 (footnote omitted); see also Faucette, 44 Val.\n\nU. L. Rev. at 198 n.68 (now listing Indiana as one of ten states with an absolute\n\nprivilege).\n\n        Both parties agree that no Indiana appellate court has had the occasion to address\n\nthe Shield Law in the context of an anonymous commenter11 to an online news article.\n\nAppellant’s Br. p. 11 n.5; Appellee’s Br. p. 26. This, however, is about the only point the\n\nparties agree on.\n\n\n       11\n           The word “commenter” “has emerged in popular press as the apparent favored alternative to\n‘poster,’ which has other, more common meanings . . . .” Martin et al., 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y at 90 n.5.\n                                                 18\n\f        While the parties’ and our own research have revealed that other states have\n\naddressed their shield laws in the context of anonymous commenters to online news\n\narticles, these decisions are predominantly trial court orders, not appellate opinions. See,\n\ne.g., Appellant’s Br. p. 11 n.5 (citing trial court orders); Appellee’s Br. p. 26-28 (citing\n\ntrial court orders); see also Kirtley, 94 Minn. L. Rev. at 1494-99 (discussing trial court\n\norders in several states).\n\n       Specifically, “in seven recent cases in state courts in which litigation parties or\n\ninvestigators have sought the identities of newspaper Web site commentators, news\n\norganizations and judges have turned to laws designed to protect journalists’ confidential\n\nsources.” Martin et al., 16 Comm’n L. & Pol’y at 91. And in six of those seven cases,\n\nthe judges agreed that those identities met the shield laws’ definitions of “information”\n\nprotected by the laws. Id. at 111.\n\n       We now turn to the parties’ arguments on our Shield Law. The crux of their\n\narguments is who and what the Shield Law protects. At oral argument, The Star argued\n\nthat the Shield Law protects any comment to an article on a newspaper’s website, even if\n\nthe comment was unrelated to the story and falsely accused someone of murder, because\n\nthe Shield Law protects even defamatory speech. On the other hand, Miller argues that\n\n“The Star may not invoke the Shield Law because the reader who commented online is\n\nnot a ‘source’ and this reader’s identity was not ‘procured’ or ‘obtained’ by an individual\n\nin an editorial or reportorial role for The Star.” Appellee’s Br. p. 14. The parties focus\n\non the individual language of the statute to make their respective arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f        Initially, Miller argues that The Star has waived the Shield Law privilege because\n\nof its Privacy Notice. Miller also argues that by posting a comment on The Star’s\n\nwebsite, “DownWithTheColts” acknowledged and agreed that The Star could release\n\ninformation to “respond to claims that any content or materials submitted by you violate\n\nthe   rights     of   third   parties.”       Terms      of   Service,     The    Indianapolis      Star,\n\nhttp://www.indystar.com/section/terms (last updated Jan. 21, 2011). But these arguments\n\nby Miller overlook the fact that Indiana’s privilege is personal to the newsperson and\n\nmust be claimed by the newsperson, not the source. Jamerson, 469 N.E.2d at 1246;\n\nNorthside Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Bradley, 462 N.E.2d 1321, 1325 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984);\n\nsee also Miller, § 501.582. The Star’s Privacy Policy merely warns users that their\n\ninformation can be released, not that it will be released. And here, The Star has clearly\n\nchosen to keep the identity of “DownWithTheColts” confidential. The Star did not waive\n\nits privilege.\n\n        Although the parties make several arguments on appeal,12 this case boils down to\n\nwhether “DownWithTheColts” is “the source of any information.” See I.C. § 34-46-4-2\n\n(“A person described in section 1 of this chapter shall not be compelled to disclose in any\n\nlegal proceedings or elsewhere the source of any information procured or obtained in the\n\ncourse of the person’s employment or representation of a newspaper . . . .” (emphasis\n\nadded)).\n\n\n\n        12\n            For example, Miller argues that: (1) Sweeney is not an editorial or reportorial employee; (2)\nthere has been no showing that Sweeney received income from legitimate gathering, writing, editing, and\ninterpretation of news; and (3) our Shield Law is inapplicable to current-day internet technology in which\na reader comments on news articles. In light of our resolution of the source issue, we do not need to\naddress these issues.\n                                                   20\n\f       “Source” is not defined in the statute as it has been in other states’ statutes. See,\n\ne.g., Del. Code Ann. Tit. 10, § 4320 (West 1999) (“‘Source’ means a person from whom\n\na reporter obtained information by means of written or spoken communication or the\n\ntransfer of physical objects, but does not include a person from whom a reporter obtained\n\ninformation by means of personal observation unaccompanied by any other form of\n\ncommunication and does not include a person from whom another person who is not a\n\nreporter obtained information, even if the information was ultimately obtained by a\n\nreporter.”); 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-902 (West 2003) (defining source to mean “the\n\nperson or means from or through which the news or information was obtained”).\n\n       Source in the journalistic world is a term of art meaning a person, record,\n\ndocument, or event that gives information to a reporter in order to help write or decide to\n\nwrite a story.      See The Wall Street Journal, Terms in Journalism (1997),\n\nhttp://info.wsj.com/college/glossary/journalism.pdf (defining “source” as “Person, record,\n\ndocument or event that provides the information for the story.”).\n\n       Here, the anonymous commenter wrote his comments on the website only after\n\nThe Star’s article was published and not during the newsgathering process. Importantly,\n\nthere is no evidence that The Star used this anonymous post in any way to further\n\ninvestigate and report on its initial story.     The Star merely provided a place for\n\n“DownWithTheColts” to place his comment similar to if The Star had placed a bulletin\n\nboard outside of its office building for anyone to tack an announcement. For this reason\n\nalone, we determine that the anonymous commenter was not a source as envisioned by\n\nour Shield Law. At least one trial court has found the same. See Martin et al., 16\n\n\n                                            21\n\fComm’n L. & Pol’y at 111 & n.130 (citing Illinois trial court order in Alton Telegraph v.\n\nIllinois, No. 08-MR-548 (Ill. Cir. Ct. May 15, 2009)).\n\n       Furthermore, looking to the statute as a whole, we believe that this outcome is\n\nconsistent with our legislature’s intent. The statute protects only the “the source of any\n\ninformation.” The information from the source must be “procured or obtained in the\n\ncourse of the person’s employment or representation of a newspaper.” I.C. § 34-46-4-2.\n\nThe person who obtains the information is not any person in the news bureau but rather\n\nmust be “a bona fide owner, editorial or reportorial employee.” Id. § 34-46-4-1. This\n\nlanguage as a whole evinces a legislative intent to protect that information received by a\n\nperson with editorial or reportorial functions who then uses those functions to evaluate in\n\nsome way the information before deciding whether to disseminate it to the public.\n\n       Our legislature, like other legislatures, enacted our Shield law to ensure “public\n\ninterest in the free flow of information through the press.” 23 Charles Alan Wright &\n\nKenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 5426 (1980) (emphasis\n\nadded). To be sure, the free flow of information is vital, but that free flow is balanced by\n\nreasonable assurances that the information is reliable because it is sifted through and\n\nscrutinized by professional journalists.         Indeed, “[p]rofessional integrity is the\n\ncornerstone of a journalist’s credibility.” Society of Professional Journalists, Code of\n\nEthics (1996), available at http://www.spj.org/pdf/ethicscode.pdf. “[J]ournalists should\n\nbe honest, fair and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.” Id.\n\nWhen doing so, they must test the accuracy of the information from all sources and\n\nidentify sources where feasible as the public is entitled to know as much information as\n\n\n                                            22\n\fpossible on sources’ reliability.    Id.   No such evaluation of the information from\n\n“DownWithTheColts” was done here by any reporter, editor, or owner of The Star. As a\n\nresult, there is no protection provided by our Shield Statute.\n\n       Edward Wasserman, the Knight Professor of Journalism Ethics at Washington and\n\nLee University, believes that protecting anonymous commenters is a “bad idea.” Kirtley,\n\n94 Minn. L. Rev. at 1479. Wasserman posits that “anonymous posters are nothing like\n\nconfidential sources”:\n\n       [N]ews organizations know who their confidential sources are, and what\n       their agendas and biases may be. They vouch for the credibility of their\n       sources to their readers and viewers, and by relying on them, put their own\n       credibility on the line. By contrast, the identities of posters are “truly\n       unknown,” and “no one even tries to verify the information from the\n       anonymous poster.” “[C]laiming for anonymous posters the protections\n       that confidential sources deserve debases the currency, mak[ing] a\n       whistleblower no different from a crank. As an ethical matter, it’s\n       indefensible.”\n\nId. at 1480 (footnotes and quotations omitted).\n\n       Giving anonymous commenters all-out protection is indeed a “bad idea.”\n\nExtending an absolute privilege to anonymous commenters could actually work to\n\nundermine the privilege. See Kissinger & Larsen, 1068 PLI/Pat at 840-41. That is, the\n\ncombination of shield-law protection for anonymous commenters and immunity under\n\nthe CDA for website operators “could leave legitimately injured plaintiffs without a legal\n\nremedy.” Id. As a result, some “fear that state legislatures might seek to narrow shield\n\nlaws to rebalance the poster’s and plaintiff’s competing rights, with the consequence\n\nbeing encroachment on the protection presently enjoyed by the press for keeping its more\n\ntraditional sources confidential.” Id. at 840-41.\n\n\n                                             23\n\f      Strictly construing our Shield Law in a manner that looks to the language of the\n\nwhole act and does not lead to manifest absurdity, we hold that to be considered “the\n\nsource of any information,” one must provide information that is then interpreted by the\n\nnews organization. But as The Star conceded at oral argument, the record does not show\n\nthat it used the comment by “DownWithTheColts” in any way. Given the facts in this\n\ncase, “DownWithTheColts” was not the source of any information as contemplated by\n\nthe Shield Law because the story was already published when the comment was made\n\nand there is no evidence that The Star utilized the anonymous comment in carrying out its\n\nnewsgathering and reporting function.\n\n                                II. Anonymous Speech\n\n      The Star also contends that the First Amendment right to anonymous speech\n\nprevents it from having to turn over the identity of “DownWithTheColts.”          Miller,\n\nhowever, argues that the comments made were defamatory per se and therefore ineligible\n\nfor constitutional protection. Analyzing this issue requires us to balance the right of\n\nMiller to seek redress for his grievance against the anonymous speech right of\n\n“DownWithTheColts.”\n\n                               A. Federal Constitution\n\n      Anonymous speech has played an important role in the history of this country.\n\n“Under our Constitution, anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent\n\npractice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy or of dissent.”      McIntyre v. Ohio\n\nElections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 356 (1995). This First Amendment protection has been\n\nextended to material on the internet as well. Reno v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S.\n\n\n                                           24\n\f844, 870 (1997) (“[O]ur cases provide no basis for qualifying the level of First\n\nAmendment scrutiny that should be applied to [the internet].”). Unlike our Shield Law,\n\nthis protection is a qualified privilege that requires the balancing of other rights against\n\nthe right to anonymous speech, most commonly the right to seek redress for an injury. 13\n\nSee, e.g., McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 353 (balancing right to anonymity and right to protection\n\nfrom fraud).\n\n        Although raised by neither party, when a third-party entity, such as a newspaper, is\n\nsubpoenaed to reveal the identity of an anonymous commenter who has used that third\n\nparty as a forum for his anonymous speech, the third-party has standing to contest the\n\nsubpoena under the principle of jus tertii. McVicker v. King, 266 F.R.D. 92, 95 (W.D. Pa.\n\n2010). This is so because “the relationship between [the newspaper] and readers posting\n\nin the [n]ewspaper’s online forums is the type of relationship that allows [the newspaper]\n\nto assert the First Amendment rights of the anonymous commentators.” Enterline v.\n\nPocono Med. Ctr., 751 F.Supp.2d 782, 786 (M.D. Pa. 2008). Further, courts have found\n\nthat (1) anonymous commenters face practical problems contesting the subpoena\n\nthemselves, as doing so would require them to reveal their identities; (2) newspapers\n\ninvolved in these types of cases have suffered an adequate injury-in-fact to meet Article\n\nIII’s case or controversy requirements; and (3) the newspaper will zealously argue the\n\nissues before the court. See, e.g., McVicker, 266 F.R.D. at 96; Enterline, 751 F. Supp. 2d\n\n\n        13\n           We also note that this case involves expressive speech and courts have given differing levels of\nprotection to anonymous expressive speech depending on the nature of that speech. When the speech is\ncommercial, for example, anonymous speakers are given less constitutional protection than those who\nengage in anonymous political speech, so courts will not impose the high bar of a summary judgment-\nbased test when the identity of the anonymous speaker is sought. See In re Anonymous Online Speakers,\n661 F.2d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. 2011).\n                                                   25\n\fat 786. As a result, The Star has standing to argue these First Amendment issues on\n\nbehalf of “DownWithTheColts.”\n\n      Although free speech is vigorously protected, a statement will not be afforded\n\nconstitutional protection if it is defamatory. See Ind. Const. art. 1, § 12 (“[a]ll courts\n\nshall be open; and every person, for injury done to him in his . . . reputation, shall have\n\nremedy by due course of law.”). There are two types of defamatory speech in Indiana:\n\ndefamation per se and defamation per quod. Baker v. Tremco, 917 N.E.2d 650, 657 (Ind.\n\n2009). In order to maintain an action for defamation per se, a plaintiff must first assert\n\nthat the statement is false.   See Ind. Const. art. 1, § 10.     The plaintiff must then\n\ndemonstrate “(1) a communication with a defamatory imputation; (2) malice; (3)\n\npublication; and (4) damages.” Baker, 917 N.E.2d at 657.\n\n      A statement is defamatory per se if it imputes “(1) criminal conduct; (2) a\n\nloathsome disease; (3) misconduct in a person’s trade, profession, office, or occupation;\n\nor (4) sexual misconduct.”      Kelley v. Tanoos, 865 N.E.2d 593, 596 (Ind. 2007).\n\nHowever, it is not enough that the statement carry with it one of those four defamatory\n\nimputations; rather, it must “constitute ‘a serious charge of incapacity or misconduct in\n\nwords so obviously and naturally harmful that proof of their injurious character can be\n\ndispensed with.’” Moore v. Univ. of Notre Dame, 968 F. Supp. 1330, 1334 (N.D. Ind.\n\n1997) (quoting Schrader v. Eli Lilly & Co., 639 N.E.2d 258 (Ind. 1994), reh’g denied).\n\nThe offensiveness of the statements cannot be determined by how the plaintiff views the\n\nstatement; the defamatory nature must be present in the nature of the words without any\n\nadditional facts or circumstances to give context. See id.; McQueen v. Fayette Cnty. Sch.\n\n\n                                            26\n\fCorp., 711 N.E.2d 62, 65 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999), trans. denied; Levee v. Beeching, 729\n\nN.E.2d 215, 220 (Ind. 2000) (remarks that principal was a “liar” and “favored some staff”\n\nwere not defamatory per se because they required reference to previous personal attacks\n\nagainst the principal to gain their defamatory meaning).\n\n      Whether the anonymous post by “DownWithTheColts” is defamatory per se,\n\nhowever, is a question of law for the court to decide. Miller argues that the statement is\n\ndefamatory per se because it imputes criminal conduct and/or misconduct in his\n\nprofession or occupation. He says that because the post refers to the former president of\n\nJunior Achievement, Appellee’s Br. p. 17, and he was the president for fourteen years\n\nbefore the post, Appellee’s App. p. 30, the post was directed at him. The Star, on the\n\nother hand, argues that Miller is not the only former president of Junior Achievement and\n\nthe post does not even mention him by name. See Lee v. Weston, 402 N.E.2d 23, 29 (Ind.\n\nCt. App. 1980) (holding that “defamatory words are not actionable unless they refer to\n\nsome ascertained or ascertainable person, and that person must be the plaintiff.”). Based\n\non the facts, however, it is reasonable to conclude that the post was made in reference to\n\nMiller, and that it imputed to Miller criminal conduct (theft) and misconduct in his\n\noccupation. The statement therefore was defamatory per se.\n\n      If the plaintiff can show that the statement was in fact defamatory per se, he still\n\nneeds to demonstrate publication, damages, falsity, and malice in order to maintain a\n\nsuccessful defamation action. Kelley, 865 N.E.2d at 597. Publication has clearly been\n\nestablished in this case.   Additionally, damages may be presumed in an action for\n\ndefamation per se “‘as a natural and probable consequence’ of the per se defamation.”\n\n\n                                            27\n\fId. (quoting Rambo v. Cohen, 587 N.E.2d 140, 145 (Ind. Ct. App. 1992), reh’g denied,\n\ntrans. denied). However, while Miller has alleged in his complaint that the statement\n\nmade was false, he has yet to provide any proof of this assertion, which is necessary for\n\nhis defamation claim to move forward.\n\n       In regards to malice, Indiana has adopted an “actual malice” standard in\n\ndefamation for both private and public plaintiffs in matters of public concern. Journal-\n\nGazette Co., Inc. v. Bandido’s, Inc., 712 N.E.2d 446, 452 (Ind. 1999). The culinary\n\nschool project was a matter of public concern, so Miller must show by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the defendant published the defamatory statement “‘with\n\nknowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.’” Id.\n\nat 456 (quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80 (1964)). Since the\n\ncomment at issue was anonymous, it will be impossible for Miller to make a showing of\n\nactual malice under Indiana law without the commenter’s identity.\n\n       While we do not want defamatory commenters to hide behind the First\n\nAmendment protection of anonymous speech, we must balance the prospect of too\n\nreadily revealing the identity of these anonymous commenters. Different states have\n\nadopted a variety of standards in addressing this issue, and there has yet to be an opinion\n\nfrom the Supreme Court of the United States to settle this issue.\n\n       Despite the inconsistency, two relatively similar standards for revealing the\n\nidentity of an online commenter have emerged as the most commonly used across the\n\ncountry. Sinclair v. TubeSockTedD, 596 F. Supp. 2d 128, 132 (D.D.C. 2009). Those two\n\nstandards are the Dendrite standard and the Cahill standard, and both require that the\n\n\n                                            28\n\fplaintiff provide some proof of his defamation claim before the anonymous speaker is\n\nrevealed. See Martin et al., 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y at 95.\n\n       The Dendrite test comes from the 2001 New Jersey case of Dendrite\n\nInternational, Inc. v. Doe No. 3, 775 A.2d 756 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001). In\n\nDendrite, anonymous commenters made defamatory comments about the financial state\n\nof Dendrite International on a Yahoo! message board following the release of its\n\nQuarterly Report. Id. at 762. Dendrite sought an order to show cause why it should not\n\nbe granted leave to conduct limited discovery to determine the true identities of the\n\nanonymous commenters.        Id. at 763.   The trial court allowed limited discovery to\n\ndetermine the identities of two of the four commenters. Dendrite appealed the order in\n\nregards to one of the commenters for whom discovery was denied. Id. at 764.\n\n       In making its decision, the court announced a four-part test that balanced the\n\ndefendant’s First Amendment rights with the plaintiff’s reputation rights. In order to\n\nascertain the identity of an anonymous online commenter, the plaintiff must: (1) notify\n\nthe anonymous commenter via the website on which the comment was made that he is\n\nthe subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure and allow him time to\n\noppose the application or subpoena; (2) identify the exact statements he believes to be\n\ndefamatory; and (3) produce prima facie evidence to support every element of their cause\n\nof action before the disclosure of the commenter’s identity. Id. at 760. If the plaintiff can\n\nsatisfy all three of those factors, then the trial court must (4) “balance the defendant’s\n\nFirst Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the prima facie\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fcase presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant’s identity\n\nto allow the plaintiff to properly proceed.” Id. at 760-61.\n\n       In addition to Dendrite, the other test that has been frequently adopted is the\n\nCahill test. This test was articulated in a 2005 Delaware Supreme Court case and is a\n\nmodification of the Dendrite test. Doe v. Cahill, 884 A.2d 451 (Del. 2005). In Cahill, a\n\ncity council member sued four defendants who anonymously posted allegedly defamatory\n\ncomments on a blog.       Id. at 454.   In an effort to serve process upon one of the\n\ncommenters, Cahill sought an order from the trial court to require the owner of the IP\n\naddress to reveal the commenter’s identity, and the anonymous commenter immediately\n\nfiled an emergency motion for a protective order. Id. at 455. The trial court applied a\n\ngood-faith standard and granted Cahill’s order. Id. (good-faith standard required Cahill\n\nto establish (1) that he had a legitimate, good-faith basis upon which to bring the claim;\n\n(2) the identifying information was directly and materially related to the claim; and (3) he\n\ncould not obtain the information from any other source). The anonymous commenter\n\nappealed, claiming the standard used was not protective enough of his First Amendment\n\nright to free speech. Agreeing with the anonymous commenter and finding a need to\n\nbetter balance the protection of anonymous speech against defamatory speech, the\n\nDelaware Supreme Court reversed and adopted a modified version of the Dendrite test.\n\nId. at 460-61.\n\n       In making its ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court found that the good faith\n\nstandard was too lenient and could “chill potential commenters from exercising their First\n\nAmendment right to speak anonymously.” Id. at 457. The court decided on the summary\n\n\n                                             30\n\fjudgment standard but distinguished its standard from the Dendrite standard. Id. at 460.\n\nSpecifically, the court adopted a modified Dendrite standard consisting only of Dendrite\n\nrequirements one and three: the plaintiff must make reasonable efforts to notify the\n\ndefendant and must present enough evidence to withstand a summary judgment motion.\n\nId. at 461. The court found the second and fourth Dendrite factors unnecessary: the\n\nsecond prong, setting forth the alleged defamatory statements, was part of the summary\n\njudgment inquiry of the third prong, and the fourth prong of balancing interests was also\n\ninherent in the summary judgment inquiry and added no additional protection. Id\n\n        After reviewing these tests, we find that the test that draws the most appropriate\n\nbalance between protecting anonymous speech and preventing defamatory speech is the\n\nDendrite test.      This test contains the two elements that we find most important in\n\ndeciding this issue: a summary judgment standard and a balancing of interests. The\n\nsummary judgment standard is highly protective of speech and balancing the right of the\n\ninjured party to seek redress against the anonymous speech rights ensures that no party’s\n\nrights are unnecessarily infringed.            Factors that the trial court should consider in\n\nbalancing the parties’ rights include “the type of speech involved, the speaker’s\n\nexpectation of privacy, the potential consequence of a discovery order to the speaker and\n\nothers similarly situated, the need for the identity of the speaker to advance the requesting\n\nparty’s position, and the availability of other discovery methods.”14 Mobilisa, Inc. v.\n\n\n\n        14\n           Miller alleges that Burk is “DownWithTheColts,” but according to Miller, Burk denied any\nknowledge of the identity of “DownWithTheColts” in her Answer to his Second and Third Amended\nComplaints. Appellee’s Br. p. 18. Miller therefore argues that The Star is the sole entity with this\nidentifying information, a critical factor in an analysis under the test articulated in In re Subpoena Duces\nTecum to Stearns v. Zulka. 489 N.E.2d 146, 151 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986). However, we note that Zulka is\n                                                    31\n\fDoe, 170 P.2d 712, 720 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2007). We also note that this is the test that the\n\namici urge us to adopt. See Amicus Br. of Lee Enterprises p. 14; Amicus Br. of Public\n\nCitizen p. 19.\n\n        However, Indiana’s defamation per se law presents a particular challenge because\n\nthe plaintiff must prove actual malice. Such proof of actual malice would be impossible\n\nwithout identifying the commenter. Thus, a pure Dendrite test is not workable in Indiana.\n\nWe therefore adopt Dendrite but modify it as was done in Mobilisa and require the\n\nplaintiff to produce prima facie evidence to support only those elements of their cause of\n\naction that are not dependent on the commenter’s identity. 170 P.3d at 721. Therefore,\n\nprima facie evidence of actual malice is not required.\n\n        We remand this back to the trial court with instructions to apply the modified\n\nversion of Dendrite to the facts of this case to determine if Miller has satisfied the\n\nrequirements for obtaining the identity of “DownWithTheColts.”\n\n                                     B. Indiana Constitution\n\n        The Star further argues that the strong protection afforded to speech in Indiana\n\nrequires reversal in this case because “the chilling effect of the disclosure of anonymous\n\nspeakers’ identities cannot be countenanced.” Appellant’s Br. p. 20. Miller, however,\n\nagain argues that the comment posted by “DownWithTheColts” is defamatory per se,\n\ndenying it constitutional protection and requiring the disclosure of the commenter’s\n\nidentity.\n\n\n\n\nnot applicable here, as it sets forth a test for determining whether information should be produced rather\nthan whether the identity of a speaker should be produced.\n                                                   32\n\f       We recognize that the Indiana Constitution “‘more jealously protects freedom of\n\nspeech guarantees than does the United States Constitution.’” Mishler v. MAC Sys., Inc.,\n\n771 N.E.2d 92, 97 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Lach v. Lake Cnty., 621 N.E.2d 357, 362\n\nn.1 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993), trans. denied). The newsroom is a place where free speech has\n\nbeen particularly protected. In In re WTHR-TV, our Supreme Court stated “[w]here a\n\nmedia organization is subpoenaed, the Trial Rules require sensitivity to any possible\n\nimpediments to press freedom. A showing that the information is unique and likely not\n\navailable from another source should normally be required.” 693 N.E.2d 1, 9 (Ind. 1998).\n\n       However, we adopt the modified Dendrite test as discussed above to determine\n\nwhether Miller may obtain the identity of “DownWithTheColts” under the Indiana\n\nConstitution.    While Indiana gives more protection to speech than does the federal\n\nconstitution, this modified version of the Dendrite test has been called “likely the most\n\nspeech protective standard in cases where defamation plaintiffs seek access to an\n\nanonymous online speaker’s identity.” Martin et al., 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y at 99. With\n\nneither party advocating a different test that would comport with Indiana’s “jealous\n\nprotection” of speech, we instruct the trial court to apply the same version of Dendrite as\n\nmodified by Mobilisa to the facts of this case under the Indiana Constitution to determine\n\nif   Miller     has   satisfied   the   requirements   for   obtaining   the   identity   of\n\n“DownWithTheColts.”\n\n       Reversed and remanded with instructions.\n\nFRIEDLANDER, J., and DARDEN, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f",

Reid, Judge\n                           Cause No. 49D14-1003-PL-14761\n\n\n                                     February 21, 2012\n\n                               OPINION - FOR PUBLICATION\n\nVAIDIK, Judge\n\n                                      Case Summary\n\n       In keeping up with the proliferation of the internet and social media, news\n\norganizations allow readers to both read and comment on their stories online. While this\n\npractice facilitates discourse between readers and interaction with their online news\n\nproducts, it also opens the door to potentially objectionable material, as readers are\n\nallowed to post comments anonymously, hiding behind a pseudonym.              This case\n\naddresses whether a non-party news organization can be compelled to disclose to a\n\nplaintiff who has filed a defamation lawsuit the identity of one such anonymous\n\ncommenter. In order to analyze this issue of first impression in our state, we consider\n\nIndiana’s Shield Law, which provides an absolute privilege to the news media not to\n\ndisclose the source of any information obtained in the course of employment, the First\n                                             2\n\fAmendment, which has a celebrated history of vigorously protecting anonymous speech,\n\nand the Indiana Constitution, which more jealously protects freedom of speech\n\nguarantees than the United States Constitution.\n\n      Under our Shield Law, we hold that an anonymous person who comments on an\n\nalready-published online story and whose comment was not used by the news\n\norganization in carrying out its newsgathering and reporting function cannot be\n\nconsidered “the source of any information procured or obtained in the course of the\n\nperson’s employment or representation of a newspaper” according to Indiana Code\n\nsection 34-46-4-2. Under the United States Constitution, to strike a balance between\n\nprotecting anonymous speech and preventing defamatory speech, we adopt a modified\n\nversion of the Dendrite test, requiring the plaintiff to produce prima facie evidence of\n\nevery element of his defamation claim that does not depend on the commenter’s identity\n\nbefore the news organization is compelled to disclose that identity. With this test being\n\ncalled the most speech-protective standard that has been articulated and neither party\n\nadvocating a different test, we adopt the modified version of the Dendrite test under the\n\nIndiana Constitution as well.\n\n                                Facts and Procedural History\n\n      Jeffrey Miller was president and CEO of Junior Achievement of Central Indiana,\n\nInc. from September 1994 until his retirement on December 31, 2008. Jennifer Burk\n\nreplaced Miller as President and CEO of Junior Achievement. After his retirement from\n\nJunior Achievement, Miller continued in his role as president of the Experiential\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fLearning and Entrepreneurship Foundation (“the Foundation”), an organization that\n\nsupported Junior Achievement, until February 2010.\n\n      In May 2008, during Miller’s tenure as president, a three-way collaborative project\n\nwas announced between the Foundation, Junior Achievement, and Ivy Tech Community\n\nCollege for the Foundation to construct a $4 million culinary school on the Junior\n\nAchievement campus to be financed in part by a $2 million grant from the Central\n\nIndiana Community Foundation/Eugene Glick family (“The Glick Fund”). Brian Payne\n\nis president of Central Indiana Community Foundation. As a result of this collaboration,\n\nIvy Tech would lease the culinary school from the Foundation once the school was fully\n\nconstructed and furnished with the latest culinary equipment.\n\n      Construction began in August 2009 but was suspended in January 2010 because\n\nThe Glick Fund stopped paying for the invoices submitted by the Foundation even\n\nthough there was sufficient money in the fund. Miller claims that the funding stopped\n\nbecause Burk and Payne made allegations that he somehow misappropriated the funds\n\nthat had already been distributed.    Specifically, Miller alleges that Burk made the\n\nfollowing defamatory statements:\n\n      (1) On October 22, 2009, Burk stated during a Junior Achievement\n      Executive Committee meeting that Miller had been “very dishonest” about\n      funds she believed should be available to Junior Achievement.\n\n      (2) In the fall of 2009, Burk told Sharon Lents, the former Junior\n      Achievement Chief Operating Officer, that “Jeff Miller’s House of Cards is\n      about to fall down.”\n\n      (3) In March 2010, Burk stated that she was distancing Junior Achievement\n      from Miller and the Foundation, which implies that Miller had\n      misappropriated the funds.\n\n\n                                            4\n\fAppellant’s App. p. 28. As for Payne, Miller alleges that in early 2010, he was in\n\ndiscussions with individuals in Mayor of Indianapolis Greg Ballard’s office regarding the\n\nposition of Senior Policy Advisor. Miller alleges that a job announcement was scheduled\n\nfor the end of February when Payne told Mayor Ballard’s Chief of Staff that Miller had\n\nmisappropriated funds and there were concerns regarding Miller and the way money from\n\nThe Glick Fund was inappropriately moved around at Junior Achievement and the\n\nFoundation. Mayor Ballard’s Chief of Staff withdrew Miller’s employment offer. Miller\n\nclaims that Burk’s and Payne’s statements are false.\n\n        After Burk and Payne allegedly made these defamatory statements, The\n\nIndianapolis Star (“The Star”) published an online news article on March 19, 2010,\n\nentitled “Junior Achievement faces questions, audit.” Id. at 64. The article stated that\n\nJunior Achievement was “facing a series of questions about its own financial affairs –\n\nquestions about missed payments to contractors on a building project and unaccounted-\n\nfor grant money.” Id. The article also stated that Payne said The Glick Fund had “halted\n\npayment” and those payments “won’t resume . . . until an independent auditor can sort\n\nout what’s become of the $765,000 in grant payments that Junior Achievement has\n\nalready received.” Id.\n\n        On April 6, 2010,1 an anonymous commenter using the pseudonym\n\n“DownWithTheColts” posted the following comment about the story on indystar.com:\n\n\n\n        1\n          Miller asserts that this is the date the anonymous commenter made the post. However, the\nactual comment indicates that it was posted at 11:48 a.m. on March 23, 2010. See Appellant’s App. p. 66.\nThe Star notes that “[n]othing in the record indicates the trial court relied on either date to support its\nOrder, and The Star does not assert the privilege analysis needs a determination of the correct date.”\nAppellant’s Br. p. 4.\n                                                    5\n\f      This is not JA’s responsibility. They need to look at the FORMER\n      president of JA and others on the [Foundation] board. The “missing”\n      money can be found in their bank accounts.\n\nId. at 66. The Star concedes that there is no evidence in the record that it used this\n\ncomment in any way, such as to pursue the lead for a follow-up story.\n\n      That “DownWithTheColts” commented on an online news article has become\n\ncommonplace today. “As news organizations have experimented with ways to encourage\n\ntheir readers to interact with their online news products, one of the most popular options\n\nhas been to allow readers to post comments adjacent to a story.” Jane E.

Rev. 1478, 1488 (2010). Although this\n\ncan facilitate robust discussion and promote a “conversation” between journalists and\n\ntheir readers, it has also encouraged “moronic, anonymous, unsubstantiated and often\n\nvenomous [speech].” Id. at 1488-89 (quotation omitted). “This is particularly likely to\n\noccur when posters are permitted to use a pseudonym, or remain anonymous.” Id. at\n\n1489; see also Ashley I. Kissinger & Katharine Larsen, Protections for Anonymous\n\nOnline Speech, 1068 PLI/Pat 815, 822 (Nov. 2011) (“Millions of people communicate on\n\nthe Internet every day. They choose a login name other than their own to post comments\n\non websites or in other fora, they share files without sharing their names, and they avoid\n\nproviding any personal information when registering for email addresses and blogs. . . .\n\nAs the number of so-called ‘anonymous’ users of the Internet has continued to rise, so\n\nhave efforts to ‘unmask’ them.”). As shown below, a common compromise is to require\n\nusers to register with the website, provide some form of identifying information, and\n\n\n                                            6\n\fagree to abide by the news organization’s Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy.\n\nKirtley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 1489.\n\n        Before the comment by “DownWithTheColts,” the editor of The Star, Dennis\n\nRyerson, announced that his newspaper would begin requiring commenter registration\n\nand take other steps, such as segregating comments from stories, in response to reader\n\ncomplaints about offensive rants. Jason A. Martin, Mark R. Caramanica & Anthony L.\n\nFargo, Anonymous Speakers and Confidential Sources: Using Shield Laws When They\n\nOverlap Online, 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y 89, 90 (Winter 2011) (citing Dennis Ryerson,\n\nStory Comments Welcome—If Tone is Civil, The Indianapolis Star, Jan. 10, 2010, at B7).2\n\nThen, while this case was on appeal, Ryerson announced yet a new change for his paper,\n\nconnecting posts to a commenter’s Facebook identity3:\n\n        For several years we have allowed users of IndyStar.com, our main news\n        website, to provide their comments with stories we post. Our intent was to\n\n\n\n        2\n            An April 2010 article in The New York Times on this point notes:\n\n        When new sites, after years of hanging back, embraced the idea of allowing readers to\n        post comments, the near-universal assumption was that anyone could weigh in and\n        remain anonymous. But now, that idea is under attack from several directions, and\n        journalists, more than ever, are questioning whether anonymity should be a given on\n        news sites.\n\nRichard Perez-Pena, News Sites Rethink Anonymous Online Comments, N.Y. Times, Apr. 11, 2010,\nwww.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/technology/12comments.html. The article noted that The Washington\nPost, The New York Times, The Post, The Huffington Post, and many others had moved in stages toward\nrequiring that people register before posting comments and provide information about themselves that is\nnot shown onscreen. Id.\n        3\n           On December 5, 2011, Miller filed a Notice of Additional Authority citing Ryerson’s article as\nadditional authority (as well as an article from a Detroit newspaper). On December 9, The Star filed a\nmotion to strike Miller’s notice of additional authority because “Newspaper columns published nearly\ntwo years after the anonymous source’s comments at issue in this appeal do not constitute ‘authority.’”\nIndiana Newspapers, Inc. v. Miller, No. 49A02-1103-PL-234 (Dec. 9, 2011). In an order issued today,\nwe deny The Star’s motion to strike and note that while we reference Ryerson’s article, we do so merely\nto explain the background of this case, and not as authority when analyzing the merits.\n                                                     7\n\fuse the Internet to provide immediate reader comment as stories were\nbreaking.\n\nUnlike our signature requirements for letters to the editor, we have allowed\nanonymous comments on IndyStar.com. Our theory was that robust\nconversation would promote more conversation and that we should not\nrestrict the openness of the worldwide web.\n\nIt didn’t work as intended, which is why, beginning Tuesday [November\n29, 2011], we will be moving all story comment to the Facebook social\nnetwork site.\n\nWe’re doing this because along with anonymity has come an unacceptable\nlevel of hatred, crude language and other nastiness.\n\nWe’ve tried to limit it. First, we hid the comments so they wouldn’t\nautomatically appear with a story. If readers wanted to read the posts they\ncould, but they needed to request access to the comments.\n\nIt was a small step in the right direction, but it wasn’t sufficient.\n\nWe then contracted with an outside monitoring service to help us assess and\nremove comments users flagged as objectionable.\n\nThat helped as well, but still the abuses continued.\n\nSeveral newspapers have “beta” tested Facebook comments and universally\nfound that tying comments to a person’s Facebook identity promotes civil\ndiscourse. An ambitious study by the Los Angeles Times allowed readers\nto post comments anonymously while other readers were directed to\nFacebook. The latter significantly reduced name-calling and other bad\nbehavior.\n\nNo system is perfect. Not all readers have or want Facebook accounts.\nSome individuals may have worthy comment or news about an institution\nor business, but because of the fear of offending a boss or colleague won’t\noffer it if they can be identified.\n\nBut I’m convinced that many, many more people are avoiding comment\nnow because they don’t want to participate in what they perceive as a gutter\nof ugliness.\n\nStory comment is a privilege, not a right. Under the First Amendment,\nnews organizations may exercise any standards they deem appropriate for\n\n                                        8\n\f       online or print platforms. If people want to be less than civil with their\n       remarks, fine by me. They’ll just have to do it someplace other than on\n       IndyStar.com.\n\nDennis Ryerson, Editorial, Move to Facebook Comments is Meant to Keep the\n\nConversation         Civil,       The       Indianapolis        Star,       Nov.       27,       2011,\n\nwww.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011111270379.4\n\n       The Star’s Privacy Notice, which governs how information from its online users is\n\ncollected and used, contains a subsection entitled How We Collect and Use Information.\n\nIt provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about our\n       visitors if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such\n       disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to\n       enforce our Terms of Service; or (c) to protect the rights, property, or\n       personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors,\n       employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.\n\nPrivacy Notice, The Indianapolis Star, http://www.indystar.com/section/privacy (last\n\nupdated Nov. 9, 2011).

Terms of Service, The Indianapolis Star,\n\nhttp://www.indystar.com/section/terms (last updated Jan. 21, 2011).5\n\n        Miller6 filed a complaint alleging, among other claims, defamation against Junior\n\nAchievement, Central Indiana Community Foundation, and their respective presidents,\n\nBurk and Payne. Appellant’s App. p. 24. Thereafter, Miller sought non-party7 discovery\n\nfrom The Star requesting the following:\n\n        Any and all records, documents, including electronic information or\n        documents and/or digital information of all kinds, log files, reports, notes or\n        any other documentation, relating to the posting and/or identity of\n        “DownWithTheColts,” the individual who posted a comment on the article\n        titled “Junior Achievement faces questions, audit” (dated March 19, 2010)\n        posted on IndyStar.com.\n\nId. at 62.\n\n        After Miller unsuccessfully tried to obtain the requested discovery from The Star,\n\nhe resorted to the courts and filed a motion to compel discovery. Id. at 16 (CCS), 52.\n\nThe Star filed an extensive brief in opposition to Miller’s motion to compel claiming\n\n\n        5\n          We note that Miller, who relies on the Privacy Notice and Terms of Service for his argument,\ndoes not provide us with The Star’s Privacy Notice and Terms of Service that were effective when\n“DownWithTheColts” made the anonymous post. Rather, he refers us to the current ones. As noted\nabove, however, the Privacy Notice and Terms of Service were last updated November 9, 2011, and\nJanuary 21, 2011, respectively. Nevertheless, The Star does not argue that the Privacy Notice and Terms\nof Service, which Miller quotes in his brief, have been substantially updated since “DownWithTheColts”\ncommented on the online newspaper article.\n        6\n           Miller later amended his complaint to add his wife, Cynthia S. Miller, as a plaintiff and a claim\nfor her loss of consortium. Appellant’s App. p. 10 (CCS), 24. Nevertheless, we continue to refer to the\nplaintiffs in the singular as “Miller” and note that Cynthia’s claim rises and falls with her husband’s\ndefamation claim.\n        7\n          The Communications Decency Act (CDA) bars plaintiffs from holding internet service\nproviders (ISPs) and website operators legally responsible for information posted independently by third\nparties. See 47 U.S.C.A. § 230(c) (2001); Matthew Mazzotta, Note, Balancing Act: Finding Consensus\non Standards for Unmasking Anonymous Internet Speakers, 51 B.C. L. Rev. 833, 842 n.73 (2010).\nAccordingly, Miller cannot sue The Star for the post at issue.\n\n                                                    10\n\fprivilege under Indiana’s Shield Law and that the anonymous speech was protected by\n\nthe United States and Indiana Constitutions. Id. at 75. The Star included a verified\n\ndeclaration from Jonathan Sweeney, The Star’s digital news director.        Specifically,\n\nSweeney is employed and receives income as the “digital news director for The\n\nIndianapolis Star, a daily newspaper of general circulation published in Indianapolis,\n\nIndiana.” Id. at 110. Sweeney reports to Scott Goldman, a senior editor who serves as\n\nthe newsroom’s director of digital and visuals, who in turn reports to Ryerson. Id.\n\nAccording to Sweeney, before readers can provide content to indystar.com or provide\n\ncommentary on the website about editorial content supplied by The Star, “they are\n\nrequired to provide the website with information about themselves. The Star maintains\n\nthis information about the source of reader-supplied content and commentary, and does\n\nnot publish or otherwise disclose it.” Id. at 111.\n\n        Miller amended his complaint to add numerous individuals and businesses,\n\nincluding John Doe #3 a/k/a “DownWithTheColts,” as defendants. Id. at 16 (CCS).\n\nSpecifically, in his defamation per se claim, Miller alleged that the defendants’\n\nstatements about his misappropriation of funds were “unfounded” and “made with the\n\nknowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for whether they were true or\n\nfalse so as to indicate a conscious indifference to the rights of Mr. Miller.” Appellee’s\n\nApp. p. 14. The trial court granted this motion.

Any and all records, documents, including electronic information\n        or documents and/or digital information of all kinds, log files, reports, notes\n        or any other documentation, relating to the posting and/or identity of\n        “DownWithTheColts,” the individual who posted a comment on the article\n        titled “Junior Achievement faces questions, audit” (date March 19, 2010)\n        posted on IndyStar.com.\n\nAppellant’s App. p. 113.\n\n        The Star now appeals the trial court’s order compelling discovery of the identity of\n\n“DownWithTheColts,” which has been stayed pending appeal.9 Two amici curiae are\n\nparticipating in this appeal, both on behalf of The Star: (1) Public Citizen, Inc., which is a\n\npublic-interest organization in Washington, D.C., and (2) numerous media organizations,\n\nLee Enterprises, Incorporated (The Times of Northwest Indiana), LIN Television\n\nCorporation d/b/a LIN Media, The E.W. Scripps Company, Gray Television, Inc.,\n\nHoosier State Press Association, and The Electronic Frontier Foundation (collectively\n\n“Lee Enterprises”). We held oral argument in December 2011.\n\n                                      Discussion and Decision\n\n\n        8\n          Miller also sought discovery from other non-party news organizations, such as The Indianapolis\nBusiness Journal and WRTV-6. These websites also contained alleged defamatory comments about\nMiller from commenters with pseudonyms. See Appellee’s App. p. 34-38. It appears that The IBJ and\nWRTV-6 complied with Miller’s discovery requests, with the exception of one comment of a sexual\nnature on WRTV-6 which the news station did not provide discovery on. See Appellee’s Br. p. 13 (noting\nthat an emergency hearing on this matter had been scheduled for August 17, 2011, which was after the\nbriefs in this case were filed). The Star points out in its reply brief that it “is not bound by other news\norganizations’ decisions.” Appellant’s Reply Br. p. 7.\n        9\n           The CCS reflects that The Star filed a motion to stay order pending appeal and Miller opposed a\nstay, but the CCS does not reflect whether it was granted. See Appellant’s App. p. 18, 22.\n                                                    12\n\f       In this issue of first impression in our state, The Star raises three main defenses\n\nthat it claims protect it from being compelled to disclose the identity of\n\n“DownWithTheColts”: (1) Indiana’s Shield Law; (2) the First Amendment right to\n\nanonymous speech; and (3) Article 1, Section 9 of the Indiana Constitution.

The extent of a newsperson’s privilege under federal law\n\nderives from the First Amendment, id., and the anonymous speech aspect of the First\n\nAmendment is addressed later in this opinion.\n\n       Indiana’s Shield Law is codified at Indiana Code chapter 34-46-4 (formerly\n\nIndiana Code chapter 34-3-5). Our Shield Law has only two sections. Specifically,\n\nIndiana Code section 34-46-4-2 provides:\n\n       A person described in section 1 of this chapter shall not be compelled to\n       disclose in any legal proceedings or elsewhere the source of any\n       information procured or obtained in the course of the person’s employment\n       or representation of a newspaper, periodical, press association, radio\n       station, television station, or wire service, whether:\n\n              (1) published or not published:\n                     (A) in the newspaper or periodical; or\n\n                                            15\n\f                     (B) by the press association or wire service; or\n              (2) broadcast or not broadcast by the radio station or television\n              station;\n\n       by which the person is employed.\n\n(Emphasis added). The other section, Indiana Code section 34-46-4-1, in turn, provides\n\nthat the chapter applies to:\n\n       (1) any person connected with, or any person who has been connected with\n       or employed by:\n\n              (A) a newspaper or other periodical issued at regular intervals and\n              having a general circulation; or\n              (B) a recognized press association or wire service;\n\n       as a bone fide owner, editorial or reportorial employee, who receives or has\n       received income from legitimate gathering, writing, editing and\n       interpretation of news.\n\n       (2) any person connected with a licensed radio or television station as\n       owner, official, or as an editorial or reportorial employee who receives or\n       has received income from legitimate gathering, writing, editing,\n       interpreting, announcing or broadcasting of news.\n\nThis privilege is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. Miller,\n\n§ 501.82.\n\n       This statute has never been construed in the context presented in this case. Indeed,\n\na statute should be construed so as to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the\n\nlegislature as expressed in the statute. Fuller v.

Before the 1973 amendment and 1998\n\nrecodification that produced the statute in its present form, the privilege was “far more\n\nrestrictive” regarding who was covered by the statute. Miller, § 501.582. That is, the\n\nprivilege could be claimed only by those whose principal income was associated with\n\nnews.     Id.   The privilege was available only to those associated with licensed\n\nbroadcasting stations or newspapers published at least tri-weekly for five consecutive\n\nyears in the same city or town with a paid circulation of at least two percent of the county\n\nin which it was published. Id.\n\n        Despite the Shield Law’s lengthy existence in our state, there is very little Indiana\n\ncase law on the statute. And what case law we have is not current. In one of these cases,\n\nJamerson, a former police chief sued Anderson Newspapers, Inc. and a reporter from The\n\nAnderson Herald for a series of articles which the chief considered to be defamatory.\n\n\n                                             17\n\fThe chief later filed a motion to compel the newspaper and the reporter to reveal their\n\nunnamed sources. The defendants refused, asserting the Shield Law as a defense. A\n\nbench trial was held, and “judgment was entered that [the chief] take nothing in the\n\naction.” Jamerson, 469 N.E.2d at 1245.\n\n       On appeal, we said that “our shield law . . . confers, without a doubt, an absolute\n\nprivilege on the news media.” Id. at 1246. As support, we cited the following language\n\nfrom the statute, “Any person . . . connected with a newspaper . . . shall not be compelled\n\nto disclose in any legal proceeding or elsewhere the source of any information procured\n\nor obtained in the course of his employment . . . .” Id. Therefore, while Indiana’s\n\nprivilege is indeed absolute, it is only absolute to the extent a source is involved. This\n\nwas no doubt the case in Jamerson.\n\n       At the time of Jamerson in 1984, we noted that Indiana was one of eight states that\n\nhad what was described as the “ultimate” in news media protections; that is, the press had\n\n“a seemingly unassailable privilege not to disclose the source of any information obtained\n\nin the course of employment.” Id. at 1248 (footnote omitted); see also Faucette, 44 Val.\n\nU. L. Rev. at 198 n.68 (now listing Indiana as one of ten states with an absolute\n\nprivilege).\n\n        Both parties agree that no Indiana appellate court has had the occasion to address\n\nthe Shield Law in the context of an anonymous commenter11 to an online news article.\n\nAppellant’s Br. p. 11 n.5; Appellee’s Br. p. 26. This, however, is about the only point the\n\nparties agree on.\n\n\n       11\n           The word “commenter” “has emerged in popular press as the apparent favored alternative to\n‘poster,’ which has other, more common meanings . . . .” Martin et al., 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y at 90 n.5.\n                                                 18\n\f        While the parties’ and our own research have revealed that other states have\n\naddressed their shield laws in the context of anonymous commenters to online news\n\narticles, these decisions are predominantly trial court orders, not appellate opinions. See,\n\ne.g., Appellant’s Br. p. 11 n.5 (citing trial court orders); Appellee’s Br. p. 26-28 (citing\n\ntrial court orders); see also Kirtley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 1494-99 (discussing trial court\n\norders in several states).\n\n       Specifically, “in seven recent cases in state courts in which litigation parties or\n\ninvestigators have sought the identities of newspaper Web site commentators, news\n\norganizations and judges have turned to laws designed to protect journalists’ confidential\n\nsources.” Martin et al., 16 Comm’n L. & Pol’y at 91. And in six of those seven cases,\n\nthe judges agreed that those identities met the shield laws’ definitions of “information”\n\nprotected by the laws. Id. at 111.\n\n       We now turn to the parties’ arguments on our Shield Law. The crux of their\n\narguments is who and what the Shield Law protects. At oral argument, The Star argued\n\nthat the Shield Law protects any comment to an article on a newspaper’s website, even if\n\nthe comment was unrelated to the story and falsely accused someone of murder, because\n\nthe Shield Law protects even defamatory speech. On the other hand, Miller argues that\n\n“The Star may not invoke the Shield Law because the reader who commented online is\n\nnot a ‘source’ and this reader’s identity was not ‘procured’ or ‘obtained’ by an individual\n\nin an editorial or reportorial role for The Star.” Appellee’s Br. p. 14. The parties focus\n\non the individual language of the statute to make their respective arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f        Initially, Miller argues that The Star has waived the Shield Law privilege because\n\nof its Privacy Notice. Miller also argues that by posting a comment on The Star’s\n\nwebsite, “DownWithTheColts” acknowledged and agreed that The Star could release\n\ninformation to “respond to claims that any content or materials submitted by you violate\n\nthe   rights     of   third   parties.”       Terms      of   Service,     The    Indianapolis      Star,\n\nhttp://www.indystar.com/section/terms (last updated Jan. 21, 2011). But these arguments\n\nby Miller overlook the fact that Indiana’s privilege is personal to the newsperson and\n\nmust be claimed by the newsperson, not the source. Jamerson, 469 N.E.2d at 1246;\n\nNorthside Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028829\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028829/northside-sanitary-landfill-inc-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1325 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984);\n\nsee also Miller, § 501.582. The Star’s Privacy Policy merely warns users that their\n\ninformation can be released, not that it will be released. And here, The Star has clearly\n\nchosen to keep the identity of “DownWithTheColts” confidential. The Star did not waive\n\nits privilege.\n\n        Although the parties make several arguments on appeal,12 this case boils down to\n\nwhether “DownWithTheColts” is “the source of any information.” See I.C. § 34-46-4-2\n\n(“A person described in section 1 of this chapter shall not be compelled to disclose in any\n\nlegal proceedings or elsewhere the source of any information procured or obtained in the\n\ncourse of the person’s employment or representation of a newspaper . . . .” (emphasis\n\nadded)).\n\n\n\n        12\n            For example, Miller argues that: (1) Sweeney is not an editorial or reportorial employee; (2)\nthere has been no showing that Sweeney received income from legitimate gathering, writing, editing, and\ninterpretation of news; and (3) our Shield Law is inapplicable to current-day internet technology in which\na reader comments on news articles. In light of our resolution of the source issue, we do not need to\naddress these issues.\n                                                   20\n\f       “Source” is not defined in the statute as it has been in other states’ statutes. See,\n\ne.g., Del. Code Ann. Tit. 10, § 4320 (West 1999) (“‘Source’ means a person from whom\n\na reporter obtained information by means of written or spoken communication or the\n\ntransfer of physical objects, but does not include a person from whom a reporter obtained\n\ninformation by means of personal observation unaccompanied by any other form of\n\ncommunication and does not include a person from whom another person who is not a\n\nreporter obtained information, even if the information was ultimately obtained by a\n\nreporter.”); 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-902 (West 2003) (defining source to mean “the\n\nperson or means from or through which the news or information was obtained”).\n\n       Source in the journalistic world is a term of art meaning a person, record,\n\ndocument, or event that gives information to a reporter in order to help write or decide to\n\nwrite a story.      See The Wall Street Journal, Terms in Journalism (1997),\n\nhttp://info.wsj.com/college/glossary/journalism.pdf (defining “source” as “Person, record,\n\ndocument or event that provides the information for the story.”).\n\n       Here, the anonymous commenter wrote his comments on the website only after\n\nThe Star’s article was published and not during the newsgathering process. Importantly,\n\nthere is no evidence that The Star used this anonymous post in any way to further\n\ninvestigate and report on its initial story.     The Star merely provided a place for\n\n“DownWithTheColts” to place his comment similar to if The Star had placed a bulletin\n\nboard outside of its office building for anyone to tack an announcement. For this reason\n\nalone, we determine that the anonymous commenter was not a source as envisioned by\n\nour Shield Law. At least one trial court has found the same. See Martin et al., 16\n\n\n                                            21\n\fComm’n L. & Pol’y at 111 & n.130 (citing Illinois trial court order in Alton Telegraph v.\n\nIllinois, No. 08-MR-548 (Ill. Cir. Ct. May 15, 2009)).\n\n       Furthermore, looking to the statute as a whole, we believe that this outcome is\n\nconsistent with our legislature’s intent. The statute protects only the “the source of any\n\ninformation.” The information from the source must be “procured or obtained in the\n\ncourse of the person’s employment or representation of a newspaper.” I.C. § 34-46-4-2.\n\nThe person who obtains the information is not any person in the news bureau but rather\n\nmust be “a bona fide owner, editorial or reportorial employee.” Id. § 34-46-4-1. This\n\nlanguage as a whole evinces a legislative intent to protect that information received by a\n\nperson with editorial or reportorial functions who then uses those functions to evaluate in\n\nsome way the information before deciding whether to disseminate it to the public.\n\n       Our legislature, like other legislatures, enacted our Shield law to ensure “public\n\ninterest in the free flow of information through the press.” 23 Charles Alan Wright &\n\nKenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 5426 (1980) (emphasis\n\nadded). To be sure, the free flow of information is vital, but that free flow is balanced by\n\nreasonable assurances that the information is reliable because it is sifted through and\n\nscrutinized by professional journalists.         Indeed, “[p]rofessional integrity is the\n\ncornerstone of a journalist’s credibility.” Society of Professional Journalists, Code of\n\nEthics (1996), available at http://www.spj.org/pdf/ethicscode.pdf. “[J]ournalists should\n\nbe honest, fair and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.” Id.\n\nWhen doing so, they must test the accuracy of the information from all sources and\n\nidentify sources where feasible as the public is entitled to know as much information as\n\n\n                                            22\n\fpossible on sources’ reliability.    Id.   No such evaluation of the information from\n\n“DownWithTheColts” was done here by any reporter, editor, or owner of The Star. As a\n\nresult, there is no protection provided by our Shield Statute.\n\n       Edward Wasserman, the Knight Professor of Journalism Ethics at Washington and\n\nLee University, believes that protecting anonymous commenters is a “bad idea.” Kirtley,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 1479. Wasserman posits that “anonymous posters are nothing like\n\nconfidential sources”:\n\n       [N]ews organizations know who their confidential sources are, and what\n       their agendas and biases may be. They vouch for the credibility of their\n       sources to their readers and viewers, and by relying on them, put their own\n       credibility on the line. By contrast, the identities of posters are “truly\n       unknown,” and “no one even tries to verify the information from the\n       anonymous poster.” “[C]laiming for anonymous posters the protections\n       that confidential sources deserve debases the currency, mak[ing] a\n       whistleblower no different from a crank. As an ethical matter, it’s\n       indefensible.”\n\nId. at 1480 (footnotes and quotations omitted).\n\n       Giving anonymous commenters all-out protection is indeed a “bad idea.”\n\nExtending an absolute privilege to anonymous commenters could actually work to\n\nundermine the privilege. See Kissinger & Larsen, 1068 PLI/Pat at 840-41. That is, the\n\ncombination of shield-law protection for anonymous commenters and immunity under\n\nthe CDA for website operators “could leave legitimately injured plaintiffs without a legal\n\nremedy.” Id. As a result, some “fear that state legislatures might seek to narrow shield\n\nlaws to rebalance the poster’s and plaintiff’s competing rights, with the consequence\n\nbeing encroachment on the protection presently enjoyed by the press for keeping its more\n\ntraditional sources confidential.” Id. at 840-41.\n\n\n                                             23\n\f      Strictly construing our Shield Law in a manner that looks to the language of the\n\nwhole act and does not lead to manifest absurdity, we hold that to be considered “the\n\nsource of any information,” one must provide information that is then interpreted by the\n\nnews organization. But as The Star conceded at oral argument, the record does not show\n\nthat it used the comment by “DownWithTheColts” in any way. Given the facts in this\n\ncase, “DownWithTheColts” was not the source of any information as contemplated by\n\nthe Shield Law because the story was already published when the comment was made\n\nand there is no evidence that The Star utilized the anonymous comment in carrying out its\n\nnewsgathering and reporting function.\n\n                                II. Anonymous Speech\n\n      The Star also contends that the First Amendment right to anonymous speech\n\nprevents it from having to turn over the identity of “DownWithTheColts.”          Miller,\n\nhowever, argues that the comments made were defamatory per se and therefore ineligible\n\nfor constitutional protection. Analyzing this issue requires us to balance the right of\n\nMiller to seek redress for his grievance against the anonymous speech right of\n\n“DownWithTheColts.”\n\n                               A.

As a result, The Star has standing to argue these First Amendment issues on\n\nbehalf of “DownWithTheColts.”\n\n      Although free speech is vigorously protected, a statement will not be afforded\n\nconstitutional protection if it is defamatory.

In order to maintain an action for defamation per se, a plaintiff must first assert\n\nthat the statement is false.   See Ind. Const. art. 1, § 10.     The plaintiff must then\n\ndemonstrate “(1) a communication with a defamatory imputation; (2) malice; (3)\n\npublication; and (4) damages.” Baker, 917 N.E.2d at 657.\n\n      A statement is defamatory per se if it imputes “(1) criminal conduct; (2) a\n\nloathsome disease; (3) misconduct in a person’s trade, profession, office, or occupation;\n\nor (4) sexual misconduct.”      Kelley v.

Miller argues that the statement is\n\ndefamatory per se because it imputes criminal conduct and/or misconduct in his\n\nprofession or occupation. He says that because the post refers to the former president of\n\nJunior Achievement, Appellee’s Br. p. 17, and he was the president for fourteen years\n\nbefore the post, Appellee’s App. p. 30, the post was directed at him. The Star, on the\n\nother hand, argues that Miller is not the only former president of Junior Achievement and\n\nthe post does not even mention him by name. See Lee v. Weston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2044587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2044587/lee-v-weston/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (Ind.\n\nCt.

Based\n\non the facts, however, it is reasonable to conclude that the post was made in reference to\n\nMiller, and that it imputed to Miller criminal conduct (theft) and misconduct in his\n\noccupation. The statement therefore was defamatory per se.\n\n      If the plaintiff can show that the statement was in fact defamatory per se, he still\n\nneeds to demonstrate publication, damages, falsity, and malice in order to maintain a\n\nsuccessful defamation action. Kelley, 865 N.E.2d at 597. Publication has clearly been\n\nestablished in this case.   Additionally, damages may be presumed in an action for\n\ndefamation per se “‘as a natural and probable consequence’ of the per se defamation.”\n\n\n                                            27\n\fId.

However, while Miller has alleged in his complaint that the statement\n\nmade was false, he has yet to provide any proof of this assertion, which is necessary for\n\nhis defamation claim to move forward.\n\n       In regards to malice, Indiana has adopted an “actual malice” standard in\n\ndefamation for both private and public plaintiffs in matters of public concern. Journal-\n\nGazette Co., Inc. v. Bandido’s, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853857\"><a href=\"/opinion/853857/journal-gazette-co-v-bandidos-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452 (Ind. 1999).

Since the\n\ncomment at issue was anonymous, it will be impossible for Miller to make a showing of\n\nactual malice under Indiana law without the commenter’s identity.\n\n       While we do not want defamatory commenters to hide behind the First\n\nAmendment protection of anonymous speech, we must balance the prospect of too\n\nreadily revealing the identity of these anonymous commenters. Different states have\n\nadopted a variety of standards in addressing this issue, and there has yet to be an opinion\n\nfrom the Supreme Court of the United States to settle this issue.\n\n       Despite the inconsistency, two relatively similar standards for revealing the\n\nidentity of an online commenter have emerged as the most commonly used across the\n\ncountry. Sinclair v. TubeSockTedD, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1676851\"><a href=\"/opinion/1676851/sinclair-v-tubesocktedd/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (D.D.C. 2009). Those two\n\nstandards are the Dendrite standard and the Cahill standard, and both require that the\n\n\n                                            28\n\fplaintiff provide some proof of his defamation claim before the anonymous speaker is\n\nrevealed. See Martin et al., 16 Comm. L. & Pol’y at 95.\n\n       The Dendrite test comes from the 2001 New Jersey case of Dendrite\n\nInternational, Inc. v. Doe No. 3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050970\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050970/dendrite-intern-inc-v-doe-no-3/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001). In\n\nDendrite, anonymous commenters made defamatory comments about the financial state\n\nof Dendrite International on a Yahoo! message board following the release of its\n\nQuarterly Report. Id. at 762. Dendrite sought an order to show cause why it should not\n\nbe granted leave to conduct limited discovery to determine the true identities of the\n\nanonymous commenters.        Id. at 763.   The trial court allowed limited discovery to\n\ndetermine the identities of two of the four commenters. Dendrite appealed the order in\n\nregards to one of the commenters for whom discovery was denied. Id. at 764.\n\n       In making its decision, the court announced a four-part test that balanced the\n\ndefendant’s First Amendment rights with the plaintiff’s reputation rights. In order to\n\nascertain the identity of an anonymous online commenter, the plaintiff must: (1) notify\n\nthe anonymous commenter via the website on which the comment was made that he is\n\nthe subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure and allow him time to\n\noppose the application or subpoena; (2) identify the exact statements he believes to be\n\ndefamatory; and (3) produce prima facie evidence to support every element of their cause\n\nof action before the disclosure of the commenter’s identity. Id. at 760. If the plaintiff can\n\nsatisfy all three of those factors, then the trial court must (4) “balance the defendant’s\n\nFirst Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the prima facie\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fcase presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant’s identity\n\nto allow the plaintiff to properly proceed.” Id. at 760-61.\n\n       In addition to Dendrite, the other test that has been frequently adopted is the\n\nCahill test. This test was articulated in a 2005 Delaware Supreme Court case and is a\n\nmodification of the Dendrite test. Doe v. Cahill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472540\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472540/doe-v-cahill/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del. 2005). In Cahill, a\n\ncity council member sued four defendants who anonymously posted allegedly defamatory\n\ncomments on a blog.       Id. at 454.   In an effort to serve process upon one of the\n\ncommenters, Cahill sought an order from the trial court to require the owner of the IP\n\naddress to reveal the commenter’s identity, and the anonymous commenter immediately\n\nfiled an emergency motion for a protective order. Id. at 455. The trial court applied a\n\ngood-faith standard and granted Cahill’s order. Id. (good-faith standard required Cahill\n\nto establish (1) that he had a legitimate, good-faith basis upon which to bring the claim;\n\n(2) the identifying information was directly and materially related to the claim; and (3) he\n\ncould not obtain the information from any other source). The anonymous commenter\n\nappealed, claiming the standard used was not protective enough of his First Amendment\n\nright to free speech. Agreeing with the anonymous commenter and finding a need to\n\nbetter balance the protection of anonymous speech against defamatory speech, the\n\nDelaware Supreme Court reversed and adopted a modified version of the Dendrite test.\n\nId. at 460-61.\n\n       In making its ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court found that the good faith\n\nstandard was too lenient and could “chill potential commenters from exercising their First\n\nAmendment right to speak anonymously.” Id. at 457. The court decided on the summary\n\n\n                                             30\n\fjudgment standard but distinguished its standard from the Dendrite standard. Id. at 460.\n\nSpecifically, the court adopted a modified Dendrite standard consisting only of Dendrite\n\nrequirements one and three: the plaintiff must make reasonable efforts to notify the\n\ndefendant and must present enough evidence to withstand a summary judgment motion.\n\nId. at 461. The court found the second and fourth Dendrite factors unnecessary: the\n\nsecond prong, setting forth the alleged defamatory statements, was part of the summary\n\njudgment inquiry of the third prong, and the fourth prong of balancing interests was also\n\ninherent in the summary judgment inquiry and added no additional protection. Id\n\n        After reviewing these tests, we find that the test that draws the most appropriate\n\nbalance between protecting anonymous speech and preventing defamatory speech is the\n\nDendrite test.      This test contains the two elements that we find most important in\n\ndeciding this issue: a summary judgment standard and a balancing of interests. The\n\nsummary judgment standard is highly protective of speech and balancing the right of the\n\ninjured party to seek redress against the anonymous speech rights ensures that no party’s\n\nrights are unnecessarily infringed.            Factors that the trial court should consider in\n\nbalancing the parties’ rights include “the type of speech involved, the speaker’s\n\nexpectation of privacy, the potential consequence of a discovery order to the speaker and\n\nothers similarly situated, the need for the identity of the speaker to advance the requesting\n\nparty’s position, and the availability of other discovery methods.”14 Mobilisa, Inc. v.\n\n\n\n        14\n           Miller alleges that Burk is “DownWithTheColts,” but according to Miller, Burk denied any\nknowledge of the identity of “DownWithTheColts” in her Answer to his Second and Third Amended\nComplaints. Appellee’s Br. p. 18. Miller therefore argues that The Star is the sole entity with this\nidentifying information, a critical factor in an analysis under the test articulated in In re Subpoena Duces\nTecum to Stearns v. Zulka. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101260/subpoena-duces-tecum-to-stearns-v-zulka/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151 (Ind.

See Amicus Br. of Lee Enterprises p. 14; Amicus Br. of Public\n\nCitizen p. 19.\n\n        However, Indiana’s defamation per se law presents a particular challenge because\n\nthe plaintiff must prove actual malice. Such proof of actual malice would be impossible\n\nwithout identifying the commenter. Thus, a pure Dendrite test is not workable in Indiana.\n\nWe therefore adopt Dendrite but modify it as was done in Mobilisa and require the\n\nplaintiff to produce prima facie evidence to support only those elements of their cause of\n\naction that are not dependent on the commenter’s identity. 170 P.3d at 721. Therefore,\n\nprima facie evidence of actual malice is not required.\n\n        We remand this back to the trial court with instructions to apply the modified\n\nversion of Dendrite to the facts of this case to determine if Miller has satisfied the\n\nrequirements for obtaining the identity of “DownWithTheColts.”\n\n                                     B. Indiana Constitution\n\n        The Star further argues that the strong protection afforded to speech in Indiana\n\nrequires reversal in this case because “the chilling effect of the disclosure of anonymous\n\nspeakers’ identities cannot be countenanced.” Appellant’s Br. p. 20. Miller, however,\n\nagain argues that the comment posted by “DownWithTheColts” is defamatory per se,\n\ndenying it constitutional protection and requiring the disclosure of the commenter’s\n\nidentity.\n\n\n\n\nnot applicable here, as it sets forth a test for determining whether information should be produced rather\nthan whether the identity of a speaker should be produced.\n                                                   32\n\f       We recognize that the Indiana Constitution “‘more jealously protects freedom of\n\nspeech guarantees than does the United States Constitution.’” Mishler v.
