EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:*\n       This case arises from the death of 26 year old Jason Ray Brown in the\nWichita County Jail in Texas while he was a pretrial detainee. This is the\nsecond appeal in this case. In the prior appeal, Brown v. Callahan, 623 F.3d 249\n(5th Cir. 2010) (Callahan), a panel of this court held that the Wichita County\nSheriff Thomas Callahan was entitled to qualified immunity. Based largely on\nthat decision, the district court later granted summary judgment for Wichita\nCounty and Dr. Daniel Bolin, the physician in charge of the jail, on the plaintiffs’\nfederal civil rights claims. The plaintiffs now appeal that judgment, which we\naffirm.\n                                             I.\n       Because the district court decided this case on summary judgment, this\ncourt “must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light\nmost favorable to [the plaintiffs].” Wyatt v. Hunt Plywood Co., Inc., 297 F.3d\n405, 409 (5th Cir. 2002); see also Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., 74 F.3d 633, 636\n(5th Cir. 1996)(en banc). Accordingly, the facts below present the summary\njudgment evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs.\n       On Thursday July 22, 2004 around 3:00 p.m., Brown was arrested and\nbrought to the Wichita County Jail. Brown told the booking officer at the jail\nthat he was under the care of a local specialist, Dr. Joseph Dean, for several\nserious medical conditions, including autoimmune chronic hepatitis, esophageal\nvarices (enlarged veins in the lower part of the esophagus), anemia, jaundice,\nand splenomegaly (an enlargement of the spleen). Brown was placed in the jail’s\ngeneral population. At 4:00 p.m., Brown complained that he felt nauseous and\nhad vomited a small amount of blood. Nurse Michelle George contacted Brown’s\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\n                                              2\n\f    Case: 11-10511    Document: 00512081470     Page: 3    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                      No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\npharmacist, who gave her Brown’s list of prescribed medications, which were\nprescribed to be taken every few hours. The pharmacist also told her that Brown\nhad not picked up his medications in several months. Nurse George attempted\nto reach Brown’s physician, Dr. Dean. George then spoke with her supervisor,\nNurse Rose Ingram, who told her not to order the medications until the patient\nwas seen by the jail’s medical officer, Dr. Daniel Bolin. Dr. Bolin was under\ncontract with Wichita County to be the physician in charge of providing medical\ncare to inmates at the jail, as well as supervising the jail’s nursing staff and\nproviding written standing orders for the nursing staff.\n      The following day, July 23, shortly before midnight, Brown vomited a large\namount of blood. Other inmates contacted officers for help. Corporal Green and\nOfficer Sours responded. They found a large puddle of blood next to Brown.\nOfficer Sours described the puddle of blood as covering an area 1 to 1.5 feet in\nwidth and 2 to 2.5 feet in length. Brown told Officer Sours that he had gastric\nulcers, that he took a significant amount of medications each month, and that\nhe had received 27 units of blood transfusions over the preceding six months.\nCorporal Greene called Kaye Krajca, who was a nurse at the jail, and explained\nthe situation to her. Krajca told him to give Brown a tube of liquid antacid per\n“standing orders.”\n      Brown took the antacid but soon other inmates alerted the officers that\nBrown was complaining that he was in a lot of pain. Officer Sours called Krajca\nagain and she asked whether anyone actually saw Brown throw up blood. Sours\ntold her, “Kaye, I had to clean it up.” Krajca told the officers to give Brown a\nphenergan suppository for the nausea from Dr. Bolin’s standing orders. Around\n2:25 a.m. (now July 24), the officers returned to Brown’s cell to administer the\nsuppository but found Brown moaning and incoherent. The officers called Krajca\nat home again and told her that Brown was incoherent. Krajca advised that she\nwas en route.\n\n                                       3\n\f    Case: 11-10511       Document: 00512081470   Page: 4     Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                         No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\n      When Krajca arrived at the jail, Brown was largely unresponsive. Krajca\nhad Brown moved to medical solitary and administered the suppositories.\nDuring a cigarette break, Krajca asked Sours, “Do you know what kind of ass\nchewing I would get from Dr. Bolin if I sent him to the hospital in the good\nhealth that he is in?”\n      On Saturday, July 24, between 3:12 a.m. and 11:30 p.m., detention officers\nallegedly monitored Brown through a slot in the cell door. At approximately\n11:30 p.m., Brown was found unresponsive and without a pulse by the two\nofficers. Krajca advised them to call emergency services. The medical response\nteam reported that Brown had died quite some time prior to their arrival. The\nautopsy report indicates that Brown died from a massive gastrointestinal\nhemorrhage.\n      The plaintiffs, Brown’s parents, sued Wichita County; the Wichita County\nSheriff; Dr. Bolin; and nurses and officers at the jail. In addition to state law\nnegligence claims, the plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nthat the defendants violated Brown’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due\nprocess through their deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The\ndistrict court denied summary judgment for the County, and denied summary\njudgment for Dr. Bolin and the Sheriff, concluding that they were not entitled\nto qualified immunity. Sheriff Callahan appealed and this court reversed,\nconcluding that Sheriff Callahan was entitled to qualified immunity. Callahan,\n623 F.3d 249. Callahan disclaimed any opinion on the liability of Dr. Bolin,\n“Whether Dr. Bolin, jail nurses, or other staff violated Brown's rights is not\nbefore us; the Browns' case against Dr. Bolin and Nurse Krajca, awaits trial\npending the outcome of this appeal, and we express no opinion on its merits.”\nCallahan, 623 F.3d at 253. However, in light of that decision, the County and\nDr. Bolin asked the district court to reconsider its prior orders denying their\nmotions for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity. The court\n\n                                        4\n\f    Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470      Page: 5    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                       No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\ngranted reconsideration, and relying heavily on Callahan, reversed its prior\norders and granted summary judgment for the County and Dr. Bolin on the\nplaintiffs’ § 1983 claims. The plaintiffs timely appealed.\n                                        II.\n      This court reviews de novo the grant of summary judgment. Callahan,\n623 F.3d at 253. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). The issue\npresented in the motions for summary judgment decided by the district court\nconcerned the defense of qualified immunity asserted by the defendants. As we\nstated in Callahan,\n      A qualified immunity defense alters the usual summary judgment\n      burden of proof. See Michalik v. Hermann, 422 F.3d 252, 262 (5th\n      Cir. 2005). Once an official pleads the defense, the burden then\n      shifts to the plaintiff, who must rebut the defense by establishing a\n      genuine fact issue as to whether the official's allegedly wrongful\n      conduct violated clearly established law. Id. The plaintiff bears the\n      burden of negating qualified immunity, id., but all inferences are\n      drawn in his favor.\n\n      The qualified immunity defense has two prongs: whether an\n      official's conduct violated a constitutional right of the plaintiff; and\n      whether the right was clearly established at the time of the\n      violation. Manis v. Lawson, 585 F.3d 839, 843 (5th Cir. 2009). A\n      court may rely on either prong of the defense in its analysis. Id.\n\n      If the defendant's actions violated a clearly established\n      constitutional right, the court then asks whether qualified immunity\n      is still appropriate because the defendant's actions were \"objectively\n      reasonable\" in light of \"law which was clearly established at the\n      time of the disputed action.\" Collins v. Ainsworth, 382 F.3d 529, 537\n      (5th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). Whether an official's conduct was\n      objectively reasonable is a question of law for the court, not a matter\n      of fact for the jury. Williams v. Bramer, 180 F.3d 699, 703 (5th Cir.\n      1999). To be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,\n      the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable\n\n                                         5\n\f       Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470    Page: 6    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                          No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\n        official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\n        Brown v. Miller, 519 F.3d 231, 236 (5th Cir. 2008). The\n        unlawfulness of the defendant's actions must have been readily\n        apparent from sufficiently similar situations, but it is not necessary\n        that the defendant's exact act have been illegal. Id. at 236-37. An\n        official's actions must be judged in light of the circumstances that\n        confronted him, without the benefit of hindsight. Graham v. Connor,\n        490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989). In\n        essence, a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that\n        no reasonable officer could have believed his actions were proper.\n        Babb v. Dorman, 33 F.3d 472, 477 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\nId. at 253.\n                                        III.\n        As a pretrial detainee, Brown had a clearly established Fourteenth\nAmendment right not to be denied medical care as a result of deliberate\nindifference. Hare, 74 F.3d at 650. Brown appeals the grant of summary\njudgment on the issue of qualified immunity both as to Dr. Bolin and as to\nWichita County.         Determining what standard to apply hinges on whether\nBrown’s claims as a pretrial detainee are properly classified as a condition of\nconfinement or as an episodic act or omission. Id. at 644. A condition of\nconfinement case occurs when a constitutional attack is made on the “general\nconditions, practices, rules, or restrictions of pretrial confinement.” Id.        A\ncondition is usually the manifestation of an explicit policy or restriction, such as\nthe number of bunks per cell, mail privileges, disciplinary segregation, etc.\nShephard v. Dallas County, 591 F.3d 445, 452 (5th Cir. 2009), citing Scott v.\nMoore, 114 F.3d 51, 53 n.2 (5th Cir. 1997)(en banc). In the absence of an explicit\npolicy, a plaintiff may prove a condition reflected by an unstated policy\nestablished by evidence of a pattern of acts or omissions “sufficiently extended\nor pervasive, or otherwise typical of extended or pervasive misconduct by [jail]\nofficials to prove an intended condition or practice.” Id., citing Hare, 74 F.3d at\n645.\n\n                                          6\n\f      Case: 11-10511    Document: 00512081470      Page: 7   Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                        No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\n       More often, however, a plaintiff's claim, properly characterized,\n       faults specific jail officials for their acts or omissions because the\n       plaintiff cannot establish the existence of an officially sanctioned\n       unlawful condition. In these cases, \"an actor usually is interposed\n       between the detainee and the municipality, such that the detainee\n       complains first of a particular act of, or omission by, the actor and\n       then points derivatively to a policy, custom, or rule (or lack thereof)\n       of the municipality that permitted or caused the act or omission.\"\n       Scott, 114 F.3d at 53.\n\nId.\n       We conclude that this case presents an episodic acts complaint. The\nspecific complaint in this case is that Nurse Krajca, faced with Brown’s critical\nmedical situation, should have sent Brown to the hospital or at least called Dr.\nBolin for advice. Brown alleges that Krajca’s conduct was a consequence of Dr.\nBolin’s and the County’s policy of: (1) placing inadequately trained vocational\nnurses in the position to make critical medical decisions for the inmates without\nadequate guidance, training or supervision; and (2) with the knowledge that the\nsupervising physician intimidated nurses to prevent them from calling him after\nhours. However, the claim starts with Nurse Krajca’s determination that\nBrown’s medical condition could be handled in the jail by use of the standing\norders for medication without sending him to the hospital. See Scott, 114 F.3d\nat 53-54; Sibley v. Lemaire, 184 F.3d 481, 487-88 (5th Cir. 1999).\n       The record lacks evidence of a systemic failure of medical care of the type\nthat we have found to present a unconstitutional condition of confinement. In\nShepherd, the plaintiff indicted the entire jail medical system as a cause of his\nstroke. 591 F.3d at 453. The jail had a history of problems “evaluat[ing],\nmonitoring, and treat[ing] inmates with chronic illness . . . due to poor or non-\nexistent procedures and understaffing of guards and medical personel.” Id.\nShepherd also presented independent evidence of the deficiencies including\ninvestigative reports from the County and Department of Justice and affidavits\n\n\n                                         7\n\f    Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470      Page: 8   Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                       No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\nfrom employees of the jail and its medical contractor. For example, the jail’s\npharmacist testified that “the administration of medication at the jail was so\ninadequate that, according to surveys he conducted, half or more of inmates did\nnot receive their prescription medications.” Id. at 456.\n      Similarly, in Duval v. Dallas County, the plaintiff contracted a severe\ninfection that was resistant to typical antibiotic treatment. 631 F.3d 203, 206\n(5th Cir. 2011). The plaintiff presented evidence that the jail had a “bizarrely\nhigh incidence” of the infection compared to other jails and that the County was\naware of the problem, continued to house inmates in the face of the inadequately\ncontrolled infection, and knew how to control the infection but failed to\nimplement known measures to eradicate or control the situation. Id. at 208.\nThis case lacks similar evidence of a systemic failure of emergency medical care\nat the Wichita County Jail. We are therefore persuaded that the district court\nproperly analyzed this case as an episodic acts case.\n                                       IV.\n      We turn next to the issue of whether the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity in favor of Dr. Bolin. In\norder to overcome the qualified immunity defense in an episodic acts case,\nBrown must prove that the official “acted or failed to act with deliberate\nindifference to the detainee’s needs.” Hare, 74 F.3d at 648. To establish\ndeliberate indifference, the plaintiff must establish that the official knew of and\ndisregarded an excessive risk of inmate health or safety. Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU.S. 825, 837 (1994); Hare, 74 F.3d at 648-49 (applying Farmer standard for\nconvicted inmates in a condition of confinement case to pretrial detainee’s claim\nof episodic act). The official “must both be aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\nmust also draw the inference.” Id. Because Dr. Bolin was not directly involved\nin the events surrounding Brown’s death and “liability under the doctrine of\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470      Page: 9    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                       No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\nrespondeat superior is not cognizable in § 1983 actions,” the plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst Dr. Bolin are premised on supervisory liablity. See Cozzo v. Tangipahoa\nParish Council -Pres. Govt., 279 F.3d 273, 286 (5th Cir. 2002).\n      An official\n      not personally involved in the acts that deprived the plaintiff of [his]\n      constitutional rights is liable under section 1983 if: 1) the\n      [supervisor] failed to train or supervise the officers involved; 2)\n      there is a causal connection between the alleged failure to supervise\n      or train and the alleged violation of the plaintiff's rights; and 3) the\n      failure to train or supervise constituted deliberate indifference to\n      the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n\nId., (citing Thompson v. Upshur Cnty., Tex., 245 F.3d 447, 459 (5th Cir. 2001)).\nProof of a single instance of constitutional violations resulting from alleged\ninadequate training will not ordinarily support a plaintiff’s claim that lack of\ntraining caused the violation of his constitutional rights. Id. at 286-87. Rather,\na pattern of similar violations is ordinarily required to sustain a plaintiff’s\nburden of proof. Id.\n      Supervisory liability can also be established without direct participation\nin the alleged events “if supervisory officials implement a policy so deficient that\nthe policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force\nof the constitutional violation.\" Thompkins v.

Thompkins, 828 F.2d at 304.\n       Brown’s evidence on summary judgment paints a picture of a system of\nmedical care for prison inmates and detainees that has serious potential for the\ntype of harm that befell Brown. Although the County has in place a General\nOrder for Health Services, it was drafted by the Sheriff and the summary\njudgment evidence reflects that neither Dr. Bolin nor Nurse Krajca were aware\nof it. The General Order outlines circumstances in which an inmate should be\ntransported for emergency medical care – including severe loss of blood. Dr.\nBolin’s contract with the County placed him in charge of the medical care for the\ninmates and charged him with supervision of the professional activities of the\nnurses. However, he did not review the nurses’ decisions that occurred in his\nabsence and performed no evaluations of the nurses’ performance. The nurses\nwere the first line providers of health care and Dr. Bolin became involved when\nthe nurses called him.\n       The nurses who were charged with the gatekeeping function between the\ninmates and Dr. Bolin or medical care other than what could be provided via the\nstanding orders were LVNs, licensed vocational nurses. According to the Texas\nOccupations Code for Health Profession, V.T.C.A. § 301.002(5), nurses with this\nqualification are not trained to diagnose patients or do procedures.1 Rather, they\n\n\n       1\n           The Texas Occupations Code for Health Professions defines Vocational Nursing as\nfollows:\n§ 301.002. Definitions\n(5) “Vocational nursing” means a directed scope of nursing practice, including the\nperformance of an act that requires specialized judgment and skill, the proper\nperformance of which is based on knowledge and application of the principles of\nbiological, physical, and social science as acquired by a completed course in an\napproved school of vocational nursing. The term does not include acts of medical\ndiagnosis or the prescription of therapeutic or corrective measures.

Id.\nAccordingly, Brown argues that allowing the LVNs to medicate detainees from\nthe standing orders required them to perform medical care beyond their\nprofessional training. The summary judgment record also includes evidence that\nDr. Bolin intimidated the nurses when they called him about inmate’s medical\nneeds.\n      Nurse Krajca, who observed Brown’s condition, undoubtedly acted with\ndeliberate indifference to Brown’s medical needs. However, to find that Dr.\nBolin was deliberately indifferent, there must be evidence from which we can\nconclude that Dr. Bolin was aware that the failure to properly train or supervise\nthe nurses or that his other policies and procedures for medical care at the jail\ncreated a substantial risk of harm to the detainees and then acted with\ndeliberate indifference to that risk. Hare, 74 F.3d at 650. The deliberate\nindifference standard is high. Negligence or even gross negligence is not enough.\n\nnursing involves:\n\n      (A) collecting data and performing focused nursing assessments of the\n      health status of an individual;\n      (B) participating in the planning of the nursing care needs of an individual;\n\n      (C) participating in the development and modification of the nursing care\n      plan;\n\n      (D) participating in health teaching and counseling to promote, attain,\n      and maintain the optimum health level of an individual;\n\n      (E) assisting in the evaluation of an individual's response to a nursing\n      intervention and the identification of an individual's needs; and\n\n      (F) engaging in other acts that require education and training, as\n      prescribed by board rules and policies, commensurate with the nurse's\n      experience, continuing education, and demonstrated competency.\n\nV.T.C.A., Occupations Code § 301.002(5).

Dr.\nBolin had no knowledge of Brown’s medical problems before he died. The record\ncontains no evidence of past instances where inmates suffered harm due to\nimproper nursing assessment, treatment from the standing orders, or failure to\ncall Dr. Bolin due to fear of reprimand. It also contains no evidence that Dr.\nBolin knew that the system of medical care at the jail, including staffing and\ndecision making by LVNs, had been assessed as deficient by any reviewing\nauthority. See Shepherd, 591 F.3d at 453. In fact, the jail passed State\ncertification. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary\njudgment for Dr. Bolin on the issue of qualified immunity.\n                                         V.\n      For similar reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in\ngranting summary judgment for Wichita County on the issue of qualified\nimmunity. A plaintiff seeking to hold a municipality liable under § 1983 must\nput on evidence demonstrating that (1) a policymaker; (2) exercised deliberate\nindifference in promulgating an unconstitutional policy; and (3) the\nunconstitutional policy was a moving force in the violation of an individual’s\nconstitutional rights. Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 578-79 (5th\nCir. 2001). Even if we assume that Dr. Bolin can be a policymaker for purposes\nof imputing liability on the County, Brown’s case fails for lack of evidence that\nthe County exercised deliberate indifference in promulgating an unconstitutional\npolicy. Id.\n        The existence of a constitutional violation and a municipality’s liability\nfor that violation are two separate issues. Hare, 74 F.3d at 649, n.4.\n\n                                         12\n\f      Case: 11-10511    Document: 00512081470      Page: 13   Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                        No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\n        Different versions of the deliberate indifference test govern the two\n        inquiries. Our opinion in this case makes clear that to prove an\n        underlying constitutional violation in an individual or episodic case,\n        a pre-trial detainee must establish that an official acted with\n        subjective deliberate indifference. Once the detainee has met this\n        burden, she has proved a violation of her rights under the Due\n        Process Clause. To succeed in holding a municipality accountable\n        for that due process violation, however, the detainee must show that\n        the municipal employee’s act resulted from a municipal policy or\n        custom adopted or maintained with objective deliberate indifference\n        to the detainee’s constitutional rights. See Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1981\n        (“It would be hard to describe the Canton understanding of\n        deliberate indifference, permitting liability to be premised on\n        obviousness or constructive notice, as anything but objective.”).\n\nId.\n        In Scott v. Moore, 114 F.3d 51, 54 (5th Cir. 1997), this court analyzed\nwhether the city’s failure to adopt a policy of additional staffing to prevent\nsexual abuse of female detainees amounted to objective deliberate indifference\nas follows;\n        First, there is no showing that the city had actual knowledge that\n        its staffing policy created a substantial risk of harm to female\n        detainees. To the contrary, the city had followed the same staffing\n        procedures since the late 1970's without any incident and had\n        received no complaint of sexual assault by a jailer prior to this\n        incident.\nId. Further the jailers underwent a background investigation, medical exam\nand polygraph test which revealed no cause for concern. The specific jailer in\nquestion had served for four years as a commissioned police officer without\nincident and had been trained by experienced jailers in the official policies of the\njail. See also Snyder v. Trepagnier, 142 F.3d 791, 799 (5th Cir. 1998)(No\nevidence showing that the city was aware of the supposedly high stress levels in\nthe New Orleans Police Department or knowledge that the absence of a stress\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f    Case: 11-10511   Document: 00512081470     Page: 14   Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                      No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\nmanagement program was likely to endanger the constitutional rights of its\ncitizens.)\n      As stated above, the record contains no evidence of failure of the system\nof medical care at the Wichita County Jail that would indicate that the County\nwas deliberately indifferent in maintaining that policy.       Accordingly, we\nconclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the\nissue of qualified immunity in favor of the County.\n                                      VI.\n      Although we reach these conclusions based on the facts available to Dr.\nBolin and the County at the time of Brown’s incarceration, this holding is not\napproval of the medical care provided by Dr. Bolin or the Wichita County Jail.\nAs pointed out by the plaintiffs, there have been two documented cases of\nimproper assessment by the nursing staff at the jail since Brown’s death which\ncould be viewed as evidence that the nurses do not have the proper training to\nrecognize critical medical situations. These incidents may be sufficient to put\nthe Sheriff, Dr. Bolin and the County on notice that their present policies may\nbe likely to endanger the constitutional rights of the inmates in the Wichita\nCounty Jail. However, based on the record in this case, we affirm the judgment\nof the district court granting qualified immunity to these defendants.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      14\n\f    Case: 11-10511          Document: 00512081470         Page: 15      Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                             No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\n\nDENNIS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n       I agree with the majority’s holding that Wichita County cannot be held\nliable as a municipality under 28 U.S.C. § 1983 for the death of Jason Ray\nBrown. Actions by those with final authority for making a decision in the\nmunicipality constitute an official policy of the municipality for purposes of §\n1983.1 For the reasons given below, I believe that the alleged facts concerning\nDr. Bolin’s actions present a submissible case of his liability for Brown’s death.\nHowever, Dr. Bolin is a contract employee of the County, not a final\ndecisionmaker of the County, and as such his actions would not give rise to\nliability on the part of the County.2 Sheriff Callahan is a final decisionmaker of\nthe Wichita County Jail,3 and this panel is bound by the panel’s decision in\nBrown v. Callahan, 623 F.3d 249, 252 (5th Cir. 2010) (Brown I) that Sheriff\nCallahan was entitled to qualified immunity. I continue to disagree with the\nholding in Brown I.4 However, I agree with the majority’s implicit premise in\nthis case that we are bound by the panel’s holding in Brown I that Sheriff\nCallahan lacked the requisite knowledge or notice to satisfy supervisory liability;\ntherefore, I agree that the County cannot be held liable for Sheriff Callahan’s\ndecisionmaking with regard to medical care administered in this case.                           I\ntherefore concur in the majority’s holding as to Wichita County.\n\n\n       1\n           E.g., Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986).\n       2\n         Cf. Mandel v.

The majority holds\nthat, although Nurse Krajca was deliberately indifferent to Brown’s obviously\nexigent medical circumstances, Dr. Bolin should not be held liable because there\nwas insufficient evidence that he knew his policy of nighttime inaccessibility for\nmedical advice or authorization of emergency hospitalization would cause\nsubstantial risk of harm to prisoners due to their inadequate medical treatment\nat the jail. In my view, a jury could reasonably find that Dr. Bolin had a practice\nof intimidating nurses to prevent them from calling him or sending inmates to\nthe hospital when they became dangerously ill; and that as a medical doctor, Dr.\nBolin must have known that the effect of his conduct would be to endanger the\nlives of those detainees, but was deliberately indifferent to that risk. I would\ntherefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to allow\na jury to decide whether Dr. Bolin should be held responsible for Brown’s death.\n      In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), the Supreme Court recognized\nthat the Eighth Amendment requires the government to provide medical care to\ninmates because the failure to do so “may actually produce physical ‘torture or\na lingering death’” or unnecessary “pain and suffering.” Id. at 103 (citation\nomitted). We have held that the Fourteenth Amendment confers the same right\nto pretrial detainees, who have a well-established constitutional right to be free\nfrom pain, suffering, and death due to the denial of adequate medical care while\nthey are incarcerated. Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633, 649 (5th Cir. 1996).\n      A prison official may be held liable for his or her policy affecting pretrial\ndetainees that deprives them of basic human needs, including adequate medical\ncare, if the official knew of a substantial risk of harm to detainees but responded\nwith deliberate indifference to that risk. Id. In such a situation, the official’s\n“policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of\nthe constitutional violation.” Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council-President\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 11-10511        Document: 00512081470          Page: 17     Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                             No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\nGov’t, 279 F.3d 273, 289 (5th Cir. 2002) (quotation marks omitted). To prevail,\na § 1983 “claimant need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act\nbelieving that harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that the official\nacted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.”\nFarmer v.

For instance, a defendant could “not\nescape liability if the evidence showed that he . . . refused to verify underlying\nfacts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of\nrisk that he strongly suspected to exist[,] . . .

Knowledge is thus a question for the\njury. See id. at 843 & n.8.\n       The plaintiffs have alleged that Dr. Bolin implemented a policy\ndiscouraging nurses from permitting access to necessary life-saving medical\ntreatment to seriously ill pretrial detainees. There is concrete, specific evidence\nin the record that Dr. Bolin maintained such a policy, creating dangerous\nconditions for critically ill inmates in the jail. Two former jail nurses attested\nthat Dr. Bolin discouraged them from calling him for advice at nighttime, and\nthey described two incidents in which they consulted Dr. Bolin about an inmate’s\nmedical condition and were instructed not to send the patient to the emergency\nroom for treatment. When the nurses did so anyway, it led to a confrontation\nwith Dr. Bolin in which they attested that they felt bullied and intimidated. The\nnurses attested that they witnessed Dr. Bolin’s similar intimidation and\n\n\nobvious”) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842); Oxendine v. Kaplan, 241 F.3d 1272, 1278-79 (10th\nCir. 2001) (holding that the failure to refer an inmate to a specialist after he showed signs of\nnecrosis following a surgical procedure posed an obvious health risk).\n\n                                              18\n\f    Case: 11-10511    Document: 00512081470      Page: 19    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                          No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\nmistreatment of other nurses on the jail staff. Nurse Krajca, who oversaw Jason\nBrown’s treatment, attested that she did not send Brown to the emergency room\nbecause she did not want an “ass-chewing” from the doctor. Specifically, after\nNurse Krajca ordered Brown transferred to a medical solitary cell, she stated to\na detention officer during a cigarette break: “Do you know what kind of ass-\nchewing I would get from Dr. Bolin if I sent [Brown] to the hospital in the good\nhealth that he is in?’”\n      Thus, the plaintiffs introduced evidence indicating that Dr. Bolin’s well-\nknown policy of unavailability for consultations at night, coupled with his strong\ndisapproval of emergency hospitalization of prisoners without his assent, created\na dilemma for the nurses and caused Nurse Krajca to deny Brown necessary,\nlife-saving medical treatment. The plaintiffs therefore introduced evidence that\nDr. Bolin’s policy violated Brown’s constitutional right to emergency medical\ncare. Accordingly, there are genuine disputes as to material facts, viz., whether\nDr. Bolin by his policy knowingly created a risk of serious harm or death to\nprisoners, was deliberately indifferent to that risk, and thereby caused Nurse\nKrajca’s failure to secure for Brown the emergency medical attention that he\nobviously needed. In my view, a reasonable jury could find that Dr. Bolin had\nsuch a policy that created an undue risk to inmates’ health and safety, that he\nwas deliberately indifferent to that risk, and that the policy deprived Brown of\nhis constitutional rights and led to Brown’s death.\n      I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that there was insufficient\nevidence that Dr. Bolin knew his policy of nighttime inaccessibility would cause\nsubstantial risk of harm to prisoners due to their inadequate medical treatment\nat the jail. The plaintiffs presented evidence that Dr. Bolin’s actions endangered\nall inmates and that such a risk was obvious.

He took no\nsteps to mitigate or otherwise prevent the serious harm that awaited inmates\nwhen they were not sent to the emergency room for their critical conditions, even\nthough the risk was brought to his attention by the nurses on his staff.\nMoreover, Dr. Bolin knew that the nurses at the county jail were not equipped\nor qualified to administer emergency treatment on their own; even worse, Dr.\nBolin had openly adopted a policy of refusing to respond to the nurses’ requests\nfor advice and assistance.      Dr. Bolin’s knowledge may be established by\nreference to circumstantial evidence and inferences from the concrete evidence\nof Dr. Bolin’s behavior and its effect. Like a prison official who “knows that some\ndiseases are communicable and that a single needle is being used to administer\nflu shots to prisoners[,]” id. at 843 n.8, Dr. Bolin, a medical doctor, was faced\nwith the obvious risk of inadequate care for serious medical emergencies that\nwould arise and in fact proceeded to deliberately disregard that risk despite the\nnurses’ protestations. Under those conditions, the inmates were virtually\ncertain to be denied proper medical treatment for their life-threatening\nconditions. A reasonable jury could find that such actions created an obvious\nrisk of danger to the inmates in the jail’s care.\n      Other circuits have permitted suits to go forward against prison\nsupervisors for their own policies of deliberate indifference to inmates’ safety and\nmedical needs when the officials’ alleged conduct created an obvious risk. For\nexample, in McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248 (11th Cir. 1999), an inmate with\na history of stomach problems began suffering from severe abdominal pain and\nvomiting while incarcerated; it was later determined that the inmate was\nsuffering from colon cancer. Id. at 1251-52.

Id. at 1251-54. The\nsupervising physician saw him infrequently in the course of several months and\ndid not proscribe stronger medication or order further exams, despite the\ninmate’s worsening symptoms. Id. The Court of Appeals held that the nurses\nwere deliberately indifferent to the inmate’s medical needs because he was\nobviously in pain and in need of a more efficacious course of treatment. Id. at\n1256-58. The court also held that the physician was deliberately indifferent\nnotwithstanding the fact that the physician claimed that he did not have the\nrequisite knowledge of the inmate’s condition. Id. at 1257-58. The physician\nwas aware that the inmate was in considerable pain even though he saw him\ninfrequently, and, importantly, the long delays between visits themselves caused\nthe inmate unnecessary suffering. Id. As the court explained, the inmate “often\nhad to wait in great pain in order even to be seen by [the doctor]. A jury could\nfind that these delays evidence the defendants’ deliberate indifference.” Id. at\n1258. The court further observed, in response to the physician’s “suggest[ion]\nthat these delays occurred because of decisions by the nursing staff,” that the\nphysician “set up the system in which the nursing staff responds, without review\nby [the doctor], to requests to see him. . . . [A]n official does not insulate his\npotential liability for deliberately indifferent actions by instituting a policy of\nindifference.” Id. at 1258 n.7 (quotation marks omitted).\n      Similarly, in Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, 439 F.3d 280 (6th Cir. 2006), an\ninmate died of dehydration in his cell during an intense psychotic episode lasting\nseveral days; jail officials filled out a psychiatric referral form but did not\nactively follow up on the request for psychiatric help or ensure that the inmate\nwas capable of remaining fed and hydrated during the episode. Id. at 282-83.\nThe Sixth Circuit held that there was a triable issue of fact as to the liability of\n\n                                        21\n\f    Case: 11-10511        Document: 00512081470           Page: 22      Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                             No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\neleven of the defendants involved, including several officers, nurses, a\npsychologist who saw the inmate, and a supervisor who did not respond to an\nemail regarding the need for a psychiatric referral. Id. The court held that the\nvarious officials were not entitled to qualified immunity because “for\nsummary-judgment purposes, [the] . . . defendants could have perceived a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to [the plaintiff].                 Whether in fact they\nperceived, inferred or disregarded that risk is an issue for trial. ‘Whether a\nprison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of\nfact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, and a factfinder may conclude\nthat a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk\nwas obvious.’” Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).6\n       The majority’s judgment that Dr. Bolin did not know or appreciate the\nlikely consequences of his alleged policy discouraging nurses from administering\nproper treatment to inmates is contrary to the Supreme Court’s pronouncement\nin Farmer that a jury must decide questions of deliberate indifference when a\nrisk of harm to inmates is obvious, and it sets us apart from other courts that\nhave confronted similar situations. Similar to the situation in the Wichita\nCounty Jail, the jail physician in McElligott set up a system by which the nurses\nhad too much discretion to deny care and in which the physician would rarely\ntreat the inmates himself although only the physician had the authority to\n\n\n\n       6\n          See also, e.g., Thomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1313-16 (11th Cir. 2010) (denying\nqualified immunity to jail officials in a suit challenging the officials’ policy of indiscriminate\nuse of chemical agents against inmates where the officials “‘turned a blind eye’ to [the\nplaintiff’s] mental health needs and the obvious danger that the use of chemical agents\npresented to his psychological well-being [because] [t]urning a blind eye to such obvious\ndanger provides ample support for the finding of the requisite recklessness”) (citing Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 842); Calderon-Ortiz v. LaBoy-Alvarado, 300 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 2002) (in a\nprison sexual assault case, denying qualified immunity to prison officials who “followed a\npractice of not enforcing policies of the . . . Administration of Correction of Puerto Rico to\nensure that weak, vulnerable inmates are housed separately from stronger, dangerous\ninmates”) (alterations omitted).\n\n                                               22\n\f    Case: 11-10511         Document: 00512081470         Page: 23      Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                              No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\nprescribe more serious medications and treatments. See McElligott, 182 F.3d at\n1258 & n.7. Thus, although the physician in McElligott actually saw the patient,\nthough infrequently, that was not determinative in the Eleventh Circuit’s view.\nSee id. at 1258 & n.7. Rather, the physician was not entitled to qualified\nimmunity because he “set up the system in which the nursing staff responds,\nwithout review by [the doctor], to requests to see him” and for that reason could\n“not insulate his potential liability for deliberately indifferent actions by\ninstituting a policy of indifference.” Id. (quotation marks omitted).7 Likewise,\nin Clark-Murphy, the Sixth Circuit denied summary judgment to a jail\npsychologist and supervisor who did not respond to an email requesting care for\nthe inmate because a jury could reasonably find that those jail officials were\ndeliberately indifferent based on circumstantial evidence or the fact that the risk\ntheir conduct posed to the inmate’s health was “‘obvious.’” 439 F.3d at 282-83\n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).\n       Here, as in the foregoing cases, the plaintiffs have submitted sufficient\nevidence that would allow a jury to reasonably conclude that Dr. Bolin’s alleged\npolicy of nurse intimidation posed an obvious risk to the inmates at the Wichita\nCounty Jail. The majority impermissibly imposes a barrier to the plaintiffs’\nability to demonstrate Dr. Bolin’s knowledge “in the usual ways,” based on\ninference from circumstantial evidence and the obvious nature of the risk.\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 842-44. Dr. Bolin should not be permitted to “turn[] a blind\neye” to inmates’ medical needs8 or to “insulate [himself] . . . by instituting a\npolicy of indifference.”9\n\n\n       7\n        See also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843 (“[I]t does not matter whether . . . a prisoner faces\nan excessive risk of [harm] for reasons personal to him or because all prisoners in his situation\nface such a risk.”).\n       8\n           Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1316.\n       9\n           McElligott, 182 F.3d at 1258 & n.7.\n\n                                                 23\n\f    Case: 11-10511       Document: 00512081470         Page: 24     Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                            No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\n       The circumstances surrounding Brown’s death are disturbing, but\nunfortunately they are not unique. Since Brown’s death, at least two other\ndetainees, including Chelsea Bowden and Wilbert Henson, have suffered\nextremely serious medical mistreatment in the Wichita County Jail, resulting\nin Bowden’s life-threatening illness and Henson’s death.10 Because there are\ngenuine disputes as to material issues of fact, as well as permissible inferences\nand ambiguities that must be resolved in the nonmovant’s favor, Dr. Bolin was\nnot entitled to summary judgment on the record presented.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n         See Estate of Henson v.

Accordingly, the facts below present the summary\njudgment evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs.\n       On Thursday July 22, 2004 around 3:00 p.m., Brown was arrested and\nbrought to the Wichita County Jail. Brown told the booking officer at the jail\nthat he was under the care of a local specialist, Dr. Joseph Dean, for several\nserious medical conditions, including autoimmune chronic hepatitis, esophageal\nvarices (enlarged veins in the lower part of the esophagus), anemia, jaundice,\nand splenomegaly (an enlargement of the spleen). Brown was placed in the jail’s\ngeneral population. At 4:00 p.m., Brown complained that he felt nauseous and\nhad vomited a small amount of blood. Nurse Michelle George contacted Brown’s\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\n                                              2\n\f    Case: 11-10511    Document: 00512081470     Page: 3    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                      No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\npharmacist, who gave her Brown’s list of prescribed medications, which were\nprescribed to be taken every few hours. The pharmacist also told her that Brown\nhad not picked up his medications in several months. Nurse George attempted\nto reach Brown’s physician, Dr. Dean. George then spoke with her supervisor,\nNurse Rose Ingram, who told her not to order the medications until the patient\nwas seen by the jail’s medical officer, Dr. Daniel Bolin. Dr. Bolin was under\ncontract with Wichita County to be the physician in charge of providing medical\ncare to inmates at the jail, as well as supervising the jail’s nursing staff and\nproviding written standing orders for the nursing staff.\n      The following day, July 23, shortly before midnight, Brown vomited a large\namount of blood. Other inmates contacted officers for help. Corporal Green and\nOfficer Sours responded. They found a large puddle of blood next to Brown.\nOfficer Sours described the puddle of blood as covering an area 1 to 1.5 feet in\nwidth and 2 to 2.5 feet in length. Brown told Officer Sours that he had gastric\nulcers, that he took a significant amount of medications each month, and that\nhe had received 27 units of blood transfusions over the preceding six months.\nCorporal Greene called Kaye Krajca, who was a nurse at the jail, and explained\nthe situation to her. Krajca told him to give Brown a tube of liquid antacid per\n“standing orders.”\n      Brown took the antacid but soon other inmates alerted the officers that\nBrown was complaining that he was in a lot of pain. Officer Sours called Krajca\nagain and she asked whether anyone actually saw Brown throw up blood. Sours\ntold her, “Kaye, I had to clean it up.” Krajca told the officers to give Brown a\nphenergan suppository for the nausea from Dr. Bolin’s standing orders. Around\n2:25 a.m. (now July 24), the officers returned to Brown’s cell to administer the\nsuppository but found Brown moaning and incoherent. The officers called Krajca\nat home again and told her that Brown was incoherent. Krajca advised that she\nwas en route.\n\n                                       3\n\f    Case: 11-10511       Document: 00512081470   Page: 4     Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                         No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\n      When Krajca arrived at the jail, Brown was largely unresponsive. Krajca\nhad Brown moved to medical solitary and administered the suppositories.\nDuring a cigarette break, Krajca asked Sours, “Do you know what kind of ass\nchewing I would get from Dr. Bolin if I sent him to the hospital in the good\nhealth that he is in?”\n      On Saturday, July 24, between 3:12 a.m. and 11:30 p.m., detention officers\nallegedly monitored Brown through a slot in the cell door. At approximately\n11:30 p.m., Brown was found unresponsive and without a pulse by the two\nofficers. Krajca advised them to call emergency services. The medical response\nteam reported that Brown had died quite some time prior to their arrival. The\nautopsy report indicates that Brown died from a massive gastrointestinal\nhemorrhage.\n      The plaintiffs, Brown’s parents, sued Wichita County; the Wichita County\nSheriff; Dr. Bolin; and nurses and officers at the jail. In addition to state law\nnegligence claims, the plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nthat the defendants violated Brown’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due\nprocess through their deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The\ndistrict court denied summary judgment for the County, and denied summary\njudgment for Dr. Bolin and the Sheriff, concluding that they were not entitled\nto qualified immunity. Sheriff Callahan appealed and this court reversed,\nconcluding that Sheriff Callahan was entitled to qualified immunity. Callahan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"176882\"><a href=\"/opinion/176882/brown-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Callahan disclaimed any opinion on the liability of Dr. Bolin,\n“Whether Dr. Bolin, jail nurses, or other staff violated Brown's rights is not\nbefore us; the Browns' case against Dr. Bolin and Nurse Krajca, awaits trial\npending the outcome of this appeal, and we express no opinion on its merits.”\nCallahan, 623 F.3d at 253. However, in light of that decision, the County and\nDr. Bolin asked the district court to reconsider its prior orders denying their\nmotions for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity. The court\n\n                                        4\n\f    Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470      Page: 5    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                       No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\ngranted reconsideration, and relying heavily on Callahan, reversed its prior\norders and granted summary judgment for the County and Dr. Bolin on the\nplaintiffs’ § 1983 claims. The plaintiffs timely appealed.\n                                        II.\n      This court reviews de novo the grant of summary judgment. Callahan,\n623 F.3d at 253. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). The issue\npresented in the motions for summary judgment decided by the district court\nconcerned the defense of qualified immunity asserted by the defendants. As we\nstated in Callahan,\n      A qualified immunity defense alters the usual summary judgment\n      burden of proof. See Michalik v. Hermann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"39242\"><a href=\"/opinion/39242/michalik-v-hermann/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 262 (5th\n      Cir. 2005). Once an official pleads the defense, the burden then\n      shifts to the plaintiff, who must rebut the defense by establishing a\n      genuine fact issue as to whether the official's allegedly wrongful\n      conduct violated clearly established law. Id. The plaintiff bears the\n      burden of negating qualified immunity, id., but all inferences are\n      drawn in his favor.\n\n      The qualified immunity defense has two prongs: whether an\n      official's conduct violated a constitutional right of the plaintiff; and\n      whether the right was clearly established at the time of the\n      violation. Manis v. Lawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"68578\"><a href=\"/opinion/68578/manis-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843 (5th Cir. 2009). A\n      court may rely on either prong of the defense in its analysis. Id.\n\n      If the defendant's actions violated a clearly established\n      constitutional right, the court then asks whether qualified immunity\n      is still appropriate because the defendant's actions were \"objectively\n      reasonable\" in light of \"law which was clearly established at the\n      time of the disputed action.\" Collins v.

Brown alleges that Krajca’s conduct was a consequence of Dr.\nBolin’s and the County’s policy of: (1) placing inadequately trained vocational\nnurses in the position to make critical medical decisions for the inmates without\nadequate guidance, training or supervision; and (2) with the knowledge that the\nsupervising physician intimidated nurses to prevent them from calling him after\nhours. However, the claim starts with Nurse Krajca’s determination that\nBrown’s medical condition could be handled in the jail by use of the standing\norders for medication without sending him to the hospital.

The jail had a history of problems “evaluat[ing],\nmonitoring, and treat[ing] inmates with chronic illness . . . due to poor or non-\nexistent procedures and understaffing of guards and medical personel.” Id.\nShepherd also presented independent evidence of the deficiencies including\ninvestigative reports from the County and Department of Justice and affidavits\n\n\n                                         7\n\f    Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470      Page: 8   Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                       No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\nfrom employees of the jail and its medical contractor.

Existence of a constitutionally deficient policy cannot be inferred from a\nsingle wrongful act. Thompkins, 828 F.2d at 304.\n       Brown’s evidence on summary judgment paints a picture of a system of\nmedical care for prison inmates and detainees that has serious potential for the\ntype of harm that befell Brown. Although the County has in place a General\nOrder for Health Services, it was drafted by the Sheriff and the summary\njudgment evidence reflects that neither Dr. Bolin nor Nurse Krajca were aware\nof it. The General Order outlines circumstances in which an inmate should be\ntransported for emergency medical care – including severe loss of blood. Dr.\nBolin’s contract with the County placed him in charge of the medical care for the\ninmates and charged him with supervision of the professional activities of the\nnurses. However, he did not review the nurses’ decisions that occurred in his\nabsence and performed no evaluations of the nurses’ performance. The nurses\nwere the first line providers of health care and Dr. Bolin became involved when\nthe nurses called him.\n       The nurses who were charged with the gatekeeping function between the\ninmates and Dr. Bolin or medical care other than what could be provided via the\nstanding orders were LVNs, licensed vocational nurses. According to the Texas\nOccupations Code for Health Profession, V.T.C.A. § 301.002(5), nurses with this\nqualification are not trained to diagnose patients or do procedures.1 Rather, they\n\n\n       1\n           The Texas Occupations Code for Health Professions defines Vocational Nursing as\nfollows:\n§ 301.002. Definitions\n(5) “Vocational nursing” means a directed scope of nursing practice, including the\nperformance of an act that requires specialized judgment and skill, the proper\nperformance of which is based on knowledge and application of the principles of\nbiological, physical, and social science as acquired by a completed course in an\napproved school of vocational nursing. The term does not include acts of medical\ndiagnosis or the prescription of therapeutic or corrective measures. Vocational\n\n                                             10\n\f    Case: 11-10511     Document: 00512081470      Page: 11    Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                       No. 11-10511, cons. with 11-10512\n\nare qualified to assess a patient’s situation and report on the same. Id.\nAccordingly, Brown argues that allowing the LVNs to medicate detainees from\nthe standing orders required them to perform medical care beyond their\nprofessional training. The summary judgment record also includes evidence that\nDr. Bolin intimidated the nurses when they called him about inmate’s medical\nneeds.\n      Nurse Krajca, who observed Brown’s condition, undoubtedly acted with\ndeliberate indifference to Brown’s medical needs. However, to find that Dr.\nBolin was deliberately indifferent, there must be evidence from which we can\nconclude that Dr. Bolin was aware that the failure to properly train or supervise\nthe nurses or that his other policies and procedures for medical care at the jail\ncreated a substantial risk of harm to the detainees and then acted with\ndeliberate indifference to that risk. Hare, 74 F.3d at 650. The deliberate\nindifference standard is high. Negligence or even gross negligence is not enough.\n\nnursing involves:\n\n      (A) collecting data and performing focused nursing assessments of the\n      health status of an individual;\n      (B) participating in the planning of the nursing care needs of an individual;\n\n      (C) participating in the development and modification of the nursing care\n      plan;\n\n      (D) participating in health teaching and counseling to promote, attain,\n      and maintain the optimum health level of an individual;\n\n      (E) assisting in the evaluation of an individual's response to a nursing\n      intervention and the identification of an individual's needs; and\n\n      (F) engaging in other acts that require education and training, as\n      prescribed by board rules and policies, commensurate with the nurse's\n      experience, continuing education, and demonstrated competency.\n\nV.T.C.A., Occupations Code § 301.002(5).

Dr.\nBolin had no knowledge of Brown’s medical problems before he died. The record\ncontains no evidence of past instances where inmates suffered harm due to\nimproper nursing assessment, treatment from the standing orders, or failure to\ncall Dr. Bolin due to fear of reprimand. It also contains no evidence that Dr.\nBolin knew that the system of medical care at the jail, including staffing and\ndecision making by LVNs, had been assessed as deficient by any reviewing\nauthority. See Shepherd, 591 F.3d at 453. In fact, the jail passed State\ncertification. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary\njudgment for Dr. Bolin on the issue of qualified immunity.\n                                         V.\n      For similar reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in\ngranting summary judgment for Wichita County on the issue of qualified\nimmunity. A plaintiff seeking to hold a municipality liable under § 1983 must\nput on evidence demonstrating that (1) a policymaker; (2) exercised deliberate\nindifference in promulgating an unconstitutional policy; and (3) the\nunconstitutional policy was a moving force in the violation of an individual’s\nconstitutional rights.

Even if we assume that Dr. Bolin can be a policymaker for purposes\nof imputing liability on the County, Brown’s case fails for lack of evidence that\nthe County exercised deliberate indifference in promulgating an unconstitutional\npolicy.

Our opinion in this case makes clear that to prove an\n        underlying constitutional violation in an individual or episodic case,\n        a pre-trial detainee must establish that an official acted with\n        subjective deliberate indifference. Once the detainee has met this\n        burden, she has proved a violation of her rights under the Due\n        Process Clause. To succeed in holding a municipality accountable\n        for that due process violation, however, the detainee must show that\n        the municipal employee’s act resulted from a municipal policy or\n        custom adopted or maintained with objective deliberate indifference\n        to the detainee’s constitutional rights. See Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1981\n        (“It would be hard to describe the Canton understanding of\n        deliberate indifference, permitting liability to be premised on\n        obviousness or constructive notice, as anything but objective.”).\n\nId.\n        In Scott v.

In my view, a jury could reasonably find that Dr. Bolin had a practice\nof intimidating nurses to prevent them from calling him or sending inmates to\nthe hospital when they became dangerously ill; and that as a medical doctor, Dr.\nBolin must have known that the effect of his conduct would be to endanger the\nlives of those detainees, but was deliberately indifferent to that risk.

Nurse Krajca, who oversaw Jason\nBrown’s treatment, attested that she did not send Brown to the emergency room\nbecause she did not want an “ass-chewing” from the doctor. Specifically, after\nNurse Krajca ordered Brown transferred to a medical solitary cell, she stated to\na detention officer during a cigarette break: “Do you know what kind of ass-\nchewing I would get from Dr. Bolin if I sent [Brown] to the hospital in the good\nhealth that he is in?’”\n      Thus, the plaintiffs introduced evidence indicating that Dr. Bolin’s well-\nknown policy of unavailability for consultations at night, coupled with his strong\ndisapproval of emergency hospitalization of prisoners without his assent, created\na dilemma for the nurses and caused Nurse Krajca to deny Brown necessary,\nlife-saving medical treatment. The plaintiffs therefore introduced evidence that\nDr. Bolin’s policy violated Brown’s constitutional right to emergency medical\ncare. Accordingly, there are genuine disputes as to material facts, viz., whether\nDr. Bolin by his policy knowingly created a risk of serious harm or death to\nprisoners, was deliberately indifferent to that risk, and thereby caused Nurse\nKrajca’s failure to secure for Brown the emergency medical attention that he\nobviously needed. In my view, a reasonable jury could find that Dr. Bolin had\nsuch a policy that created an undue risk to inmates’ health and safety, that he\nwas deliberately indifferent to that risk, and that the policy deprived Brown of\nhis constitutional rights and led to Brown’s death.\n      I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that there was insufficient\nevidence that Dr. Bolin knew his policy of nighttime inaccessibility would cause\nsubstantial risk of harm to prisoners due to their inadequate medical treatment\nat the jail. The plaintiffs presented evidence that Dr. Bolin’s actions endangered\nall inmates and that such a risk was obvious. The majority impermissibly erects\na bar to the plaintiffs’ ability to demonstrate Dr. Bolin’s knowledge “in the usual\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f    Case: 11-10511    Document: 00512081470         Page: 20   Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                         No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\nways, including inference from circumstantial evidence [and] . . . the obvious.”\nId. at 842-44.\n      Dr. Bolin was a trained medical doctor. A jury could reasonably find that\nthis substantial risk of harm to prisoners was obvious to Dr. Bolin. He took no\nsteps to mitigate or otherwise prevent the serious harm that awaited inmates\nwhen they were not sent to the emergency room for their critical conditions, even\nthough the risk was brought to his attention by the nurses on his staff.\nMoreover, Dr. Bolin knew that the nurses at the county jail were not equipped\nor qualified to administer emergency treatment on their own; even worse, Dr.\nBolin had openly adopted a policy of refusing to respond to the nurses’ requests\nfor advice and assistance.      Dr. Bolin’s knowledge may be established by\nreference to circumstantial evidence and inferences from the concrete evidence\nof Dr. Bolin’s behavior and its effect. Like a prison official who “knows that some\ndiseases are communicable and that a single needle is being used to administer\nflu shots to prisoners[,]” id. at 843 n.8, Dr. Bolin, a medical doctor, was faced\nwith the obvious risk of inadequate care for serious medical emergencies that\nwould arise and in fact proceeded to deliberately disregard that risk despite the\nnurses’ protestations. Under those conditions, the inmates were virtually\ncertain to be denied proper medical treatment for their life-threatening\nconditions. A reasonable jury could find that such actions created an obvious\nrisk of danger to the inmates in the jail’s care.\n      Other circuits have permitted suits to go forward against prison\nsupervisors for their own policies of deliberate indifference to inmates’ safety and\nmedical needs when the officials’ alleged conduct created an obvious risk.

(alteration omitted) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).6\n       The majority’s judgment that Dr. Bolin did not know or appreciate the\nlikely consequences of his alleged policy discouraging nurses from administering\nproper treatment to inmates is contrary to the Supreme Court’s pronouncement\nin Farmer that a jury must decide questions of deliberate indifference when a\nrisk of harm to inmates is obvious, and it sets us apart from other courts that\nhave confronted similar situations. Similar to the situation in the Wichita\nCounty Jail, the jail physician in McElligott set up a system by which the nurses\nhad too much discretion to deny care and in which the physician would rarely\ntreat the inmates himself although only the physician had the authority to\n\n\n\n       6\n          See also, e.g., Thomas v.

See McElligott, 182 F.3d at\n1258 & n.7. Thus, although the physician in McElligott actually saw the patient,\nthough infrequently, that was not determinative in the Eleventh Circuit’s view.\nSee id. at 1258 & n.7. Rather, the physician was not entitled to qualified\nimmunity because he “set up the system in which the nursing staff responds,\nwithout review by [the doctor], to requests to see him” and for that reason could\n“not insulate his potential liability for deliberately indifferent actions by\ninstituting a policy of indifference.” Id. (quotation marks omitted).7 Likewise,\nin Clark-Murphy, the Sixth Circuit denied summary judgment to a jail\npsychologist and supervisor who did not respond to an email requesting care for\nthe inmate because a jury could reasonably find that those jail officials were\ndeliberately indifferent based on circumstantial evidence or the fact that the risk\ntheir conduct posed to the inmate’s health was “‘obvious.’” 439 F.3d at 282-83\n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).\n       Here, as in the foregoing cases, the plaintiffs have submitted sufficient\nevidence that would allow a jury to reasonably conclude that Dr. Bolin’s alleged\npolicy of nurse intimidation posed an obvious risk to the inmates at the Wichita\nCounty Jail. The majority impermissibly imposes a barrier to the plaintiffs’\nability to demonstrate Dr. Bolin’s knowledge “in the usual ways,” based on\ninference from circumstantial evidence and the obvious nature of the risk.\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 842-44. Dr. Bolin should not be permitted to “turn[] a blind\neye” to inmates’ medical needs8 or to “insulate [himself] . . . by instituting a\npolicy of indifference.”9\n\n\n       7\n        See also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843 (“[I]t does not matter whether . . . a prisoner faces\nan excessive risk of [harm] for reasons personal to him or because all prisoners in his situation\nface such a risk.”).\n       8\n           Thomas, 614 F.3d at 1316.\n       9\n           McElligott, 182 F.3d at 1258 & n.7.\n\n                                                 23\n\f    Case: 11-10511       Document: 00512081470         Page: 24     Date Filed: 12/12/2012\n\n\n\n                            No. 11-10511 c/w No. 11-10512\n\n       The circumstances surrounding Brown’s death are disturbing, but\nunfortunately they are not unique. Since Brown’s death, at least two other\ndetainees, including Chelsea Bowden and Wilbert Henson, have suffered\nextremely serious medical mistreatment in the Wichita County Jail, resulting\nin Bowden’s life-threatening illness and Henson’s death.10 Because there are\ngenuine disputes as to material issues of fact, as well as permissible inferences\nand ambiguities that must be resolved in the nonmovant’s favor, Dr. Bolin was\nnot entitled to summary judgment on the record presented.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n         See Estate of Henson v.
