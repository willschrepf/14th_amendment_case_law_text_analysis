On appeal, Ge argues that she has shown an individualized risk of harm\n\nshould she return to Indonesia, based on her Chinese heritage and Christian\n\nreligion. After thoroughly reviewing the briefs, we deny Ge’s petition.\n\n      In a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review factual determinations\n\nunder the substantial evidence test. Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 577 F.3d 1341,\n\n1350–51 (11th Cir. 2009). Under the substantial evidence test, we draw every\n\nreasonable inference from the evidence in favor of the BIA’s decision, and reverse\n\na finding of fact only if the record compels reversal. Id. at 1351. The fact that the\n\nrecord may support a contrary conclusion is insufficient to reverse. Id. We review\n\nthe BIA’s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ’s\n\ndecision. Id. at 1350. Where the BIA expressly adopts the IJ’s decision, we will\n\nreview the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. Id.\n\n      An applicant for asylum must meet the INA’s definition of a refugee. INA\n\n§ 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1). The INA defines a refugee as:\n\n\n                                          2\n\f              Case: 12-15277     Date Filed: 05/20/2013   Page: 3 of 5\n\n\n      any person who is outside of any country of such person’s nationality\n      . . . and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or\n      unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country\n      because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n      account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n      social group, or political opinion.\n\nINA § 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\n      To show eligibility for asylum, an applicant may satisfy her burden of proof\n\nin either of two ways: First, she may show that she was persecuted in the past in\n\nher home country on a protected ground. Sepulveda v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d\n\n1226, 1230–31 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). Second, an applicant may meet her\n\nburden by establishing that she has a well-founded fear that she will be persecuted\n\nin the future on account of a protected ground. Id. at 1231. She must demonstrate\n\nthat her well-founded fear of future persecution is subjectively genuine and\n\nobjectively reasonable. Id. The applicant must present specific, detailed facts that\n\nshow a good reason to fear that she will be singled out for persecution. Id.\n\nHowever, the applicant does not need to prove that she would be singled out for\n\npersecution if she proves she is a member of a group that is subjected to a pattern\n\nor practice of persecution in her country of nationality. See Kazemzadeh, 577 F.3d\n\nat 1352. When considering whether the applicant has established a pattern or\n\npractice of persecution in her home country, the BIA is entitled to rely heavily on\n\nthe U.S. State Department’s Country Reports. Id. at 1354.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f              Case: 12-15277     Date Filed: 05/20/2013   Page: 4 of 5\n\n\n      Persecution is an “extreme concept” and requires “more than a few isolated\n\nincidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.” Sepulveda, 401 F.3d at 1231\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Drawing every reasonable inference from the\n\nevidence in favor of the judgment, the record supports the BIA and IJ’s judgment\n\nthat Ge has not demonstrated past persecution. Ge recounts being segregated at\n\nschool, being inappropriately touched and spoken to on multiple occasions, and\n\nexperiencing discrimination. She also testified as to the fear she and her family felt\n\nduring riots and strained interactions between her family and ethnic Indonesians.\n\nWhile these incidents certainly amount to harassment and discrimination, the\n\nrecord does not compel a finding that they meet the “extreme” threshold level of\n\npersecution. See id. at 1231.\n\n      The record also does not compel a finding that Ge has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution if she returns to Indonesia. While Ge’s statements support a\n\nwell-founded fear for future harassment of the type previously experienced, she\n\nhas not carried her burden to show that she would be singled out for “extreme”\n\nincidents that constitute persecution. See id. The U.S. State Department’s Country\n\nReport from Indonesia states that the ethnic Chinese population plays a major role\n\nin the Indonesian economy and is increasingly participating in politics, an\n\nindication that any future threat is diminishing. Accordingly, the record does not\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f              Case: 12-15277      Date Filed: 05/20/2013   Page: 5 of 5\n\n\ncompel us to determine that Ge demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.\n\n      To qualify for withholding of removal and CAT relief, an applicant must\n\nestablish standards more stringent than those for asylum eligibility. Zheng v. U.S.\n\nAtt’y Gen., 451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam). Because Ge could\n\nnot prove her entitlement to asylum relief, she necessarily failed to demonstrate\n\nthat it was more likely than not that she would be persecuted or that she would be\n\nsubjected to severe pain or suffering by, or with the acquiescence of, government\n\nofficials in Indonesia. See id.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we deny Ge’s petition.\n\n      PETITION DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f",
