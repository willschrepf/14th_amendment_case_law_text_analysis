Plaintiff Charles Murphy was an\ninmate in the Vandalia Correctional Center in Illinois. On July\n25, 2011, correctional officers hit Murphy, fracturing part of\nhis eye socket, and left him in a cell without medical attention.\nMurphy sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state-law theories.\nA jury awarded him damages on some of those claims, includ-\ning some state-law claims, and the district court awarded at-\ntorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Two of the defendants now\n\f2                                                   No. 15-3384\n\nappeal and challenge two aspects of the judgment. They argue\nthat state-law sovereign immunity bars the state-law claims\nand that the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires that 25 per-\ncent of the damage award be used to pay the attorney fee\naward.\n    We affirm on the sovereign immunity defense. The Illinois\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply to state-law\nclaims against a state official or employee who has violated\nstatutory or constitutional law. See Leetaru v. Board of Trustees\nof University of Illinois, 32 N.E.3d 583 (Ill. 2015). Murphy al-\nleged and ultimately proved such violations here. On the at-\ntorney fee issue, however, we reverse. Under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(d), the attorney fee award must first be satisfied from\nup to 25 percent of the damage award, and the district court\ndoes not have discretion to reduce that maximum percentage.\nWe remand for entry of a modified judgment.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n     We recount the facts in the light reasonably most favorable\nto the verdict, which defendants do not challenge on the mer-\nits. On July 25, 2011, plaintiff Charles Murphy was a prisoner\nat the Vandalia Correctional Center. His assigned seat at\nmealtime that day had food and water on it. When he re­\nported the mess, Correctional Officer Robert Smith first told\nhim to clean it up himself and later told Murphy to leave the\ndining area. A different officer handcuffed Murphy, and Of-\nficer Smith escorted him to a segregation building. When they\ngot there, a third officer asked Murphy what unit he normally\nstayed in, but Murphy ignored him. Officer Smith began mov-\ning his finger in and out of Murphy’s ear, while asking Mur-\nphy if he was deaf and repeating the phrase “you can’t hear,\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                     3\n\nyou can’t hear.” While this was happening, Lieutenant Greg-\nory Fulk entered the building and saw what was happening.\n    Now escorted by three officers, Murphy was taken further\ninto the segregation unit. Murphy did not struggle with the\nofficers as they walked, although he taunted Officer Smith,\npromising what would happen the next time he “ain’t got no\nhandcuffs on.” Hearing that, Officer Smith hit Murphy in the\neye and then applied a choke hold with his arm around Mur-\nphy’s throat. Murphy lost consciousness. When he came to,\nLieutenant Fulk and Officer Smith were pushing him into a\ncell. With his hands still cuffed behind his back, Murphy fell\nface-first into the cell and hit his head on its metal toilet. The\nofficers took off his clothes and handcuffs and left without\nhaving checked his condition.\n    Thirty or forty minutes later, a nurse came to see Murphy,\nwho was ultimately sent to a hospital. His orbital rim—part\nof his eye socket—had been crushed and needed surgery. He\nhad that surgery but did not recover completely. As of Janu-\nary 2015, his vision remained doubled and blurred.\n     In July 2012, Murphy filed suit in the Southern District of\nIllinois. After two rounds of complaint amendments and a\npartial grant of summary judgment for defendants, the case\nwas tried to a jury. The jury found for plaintiff Murphy on\nfour claims against two defendants—Lieutenant Fulk and Of-\nficer Smith, the appellants here. The jury found Officer Smith\nliable on two claims of state-law battery and one federal claim\nof unconstitutional use of force under the Eighth Amend-\nment. The jury also found Lieutenant Fulk liable on a federal\nEighth Amendment claim of deliberate indifference to a seri-\nous medical need. All told, the jury awarded $241,001 in com-\npensatory and punitive damages against Officer Smith and\n\f4                                                     No. 15-3384\n\n$168,750 against Lieutenant Fulk. The district court reduced\nthe combined award to a total of $307,733.82. That reduction\nis not at issue in this appeal. The district court also awarded\nattorney fees and ordered that 10 percent of the damages\nawarded be put toward paying those fees. Officer Smith and\nLieutenant Fulk have appealed.\nII. Sovereign Immunity\n   The defendants argue first that state-law sovereign im-\nmunity bars Murphy’s state-law claims. The district court\nfound, and Murphy contends on appeal, that defendants\nwaived their state-law sovereign immunity defense. We find\nno waiver but find that state-law sovereign immunity does\nnot shield these defendants from liability.\n    A. Sovereign Immunity in Illinois\n    Illinois is protected against civil suits in federal court by\ntwo relevant doctrines. First, the “Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunizes unconsenting states from suit in federal court.” Ben-\nning v. Board of Regents of Regency Universities, 928 F.2d 775, 777\n(7th Cir. 1991); see also Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 712–13\n(1999) (explaining broader concept of sovereign immunity for\nwhich “‘Eleventh Amendment immunity ... is convenient\nshorthand”). Second, an Illinois statute provides, with excep-\ntions not relevant here, that “the State of Illinois shall not be\nmade a defendant or party in any court.” 745 Ill. Comp. Stat.\n5/1. Under the Erie Railroad doctrine, that statute governs\nclaims in federal court arising under state law. Benning, 928\nF.2d at 777, citing Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).\nWhile both doctrines are often referred to as “sovereign im-\nmunity,” they are not the same. See, e.g., Beaulieu v. Vermont,\n807 F.3d 478, 485–86 (2d Cir. 2015) (distinguishing between\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                                     5\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity and broader state sovereign\nimmunity under Vermont law). As we explain below, im-\nportant differences between the federal and state doctrines\nare decisive in this case.\n    B. Waiver\n    Before addressing the merits of the state-law sovereign im-\nmunity defense, we first address plaintiff Murphy’s argument\nthat defendants waived the defense. “[S]overeign immunity\nis a waivable affirmative defense.” Park v. Indiana University\nSchool of Dentistry, 692 F.3d 828, 830 (7th Cir. 2012) (Eleventh\nAmendment), citing Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin\nSystem v. Phoenix International Software, Inc., 653 F.3d 448, 463\n(7th Cir. 2011); see also Lapides v. Board of Regents of University\nSystem of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 624 (2002) (state’s voluntary re-\nmoval to federal court waived Eleventh Amendment immun-\nity). If a state does not raise the immunity defense, “a court\ncan ignore it.” Wisconsin Dep’t of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U.S.\n381, 389 (1998). Because the defendants never relied and still\ndo not rely on Eleventh Amendment immunity, they waived\nthat defense. See Park, 692 F.3d at 830 (finding waiver where\nthe state “never once raised the issue ... before the district\ncourt” and declined to raise the issue “even when prompted\nby this court at argument”). 1\n\n\n    1  Like the parties, we rely on Eleventh Amendment case law to ad­\ndress waiver. This is our usual approach under the Erie doctrine because\nprocedural issues are governed by federal law in federal courts, and\nwaiver is generally treated as procedural. See Herremans v. Carrera Designs,\nInc., 157 F.3d 1118, 1122–23 (7th Cir. 1998). Even if Illinois law governed\nthe waiver issue, there would be no waiver. Illinois appears to permit sov-\nereign immunity waivers only by statute, not by litigation conduct. See\nTownship of Jubilee v. State, 960 N.E.2d 550, 555 (Ill. 2011) (“[E]fforts by legal\n\f6                                                                No. 15-3384\n\n    State-law sovereign immunity, however, is a defense the\ndefendants raised at least five times: in their answer, in the\nfinal pre-trial conference, in the jury instruction conference, in\nthe defendants’ post-trial motion, and on appeal. Those refer-\nences were explicitly to state-law sovereign immunity. The an-\nswer, for example, claimed protection under “statutory sover-\neign immunity,” and in both the post-trial motion and the\nbriefs before this court, the defendants relied on the Illinois\nState Lawsuit Immunity Act.\n    Plaintiff Murphy has not cited nor have we found any\ncomparable case finding a waiver of a sovereign immunity\ndefense. Cf. Board of Regents, 653 F.3d at 467 (finding waiver\nwhere state filed suit in federal district court); Hill v. Blind In-\ndustries & Services of Maryland, 179 F.3d 754, 756 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(finding waiver when defendant “participat[ed] in extensive\npre-trial activities and wait[ed] until the first day of trial be-\nfore objecting ... on Eleventh Amendment grounds”). Other\ncircuits hold that equal or less robust efforts to raise the im-\nmunity defense do not waive it. See, e.g., Union Pacific Railroad\nCo. v. Louisiana Public Service Comm’n, 662 F.3d 336, 339–40 (5th\nCir. 2011) (no waiver when defendant raised issue for first\ntime on appeal, after prevailing on a motion for summary\njudgment on the merits); Ashker v. California Dep’t of Correc-\ntions, 112 F.3d 392, 394 (9th Cir. 1997) (no waiver when defend-\nants raised issue “in their answer and pretrial statement ...\n\n\n\ncounsel for the State to defend itself ... will not result in a waiver or forfei-\nture of the State’s statutory immunity. That is so because only the legisla-\nture itself can determine where and when claims against the state will be\nallowed.”), citing People ex rel. Manning v. Nickerson, 702 N.E.2d 1278, 1280\n(Ill. 1998).\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                      7\n\nand ... in their briefs filed in this court”). We reach the same\nconclusion here.\n    Plaintiff Murphy relies on the defendants’ apparent will-\ningness to defend this case on the merits. See Neinast v. Texas,\n217 F.3d 275, 279 (5th Cir. 2000) (“Courts have found waiver\n... where the state ... evidenced an intent to defend the suit\nagainst it on the merits.”). But in this case the significance of\nthat willingness is at best equivocal. Both the defendants and\nthe district court seemed at times to blend the state-law im-\nmunity question with the merits of plaintiff’s claims. For ex-\nample, the district court said that sovereign immunity did not\nshield the defendants because the jury, in ruling on the battery\nclaim, necessarily determined that they acted outside their au-\nthority. Murphy v. Smith, No. 3:12-cv-00841-SCW, slip op. at\n17–18 (S.D. Ill. Sept. 25, 2015).\n    That blending would be confusing under federal immun-\nity law, whether under the Eleventh Amendment or doctrines\nof absolute immunity. As we explain below, though, the\nblending of state-law immunity and the merits under Illinois\nlaw accurately reflects state law. When a plaintiff sues a state\nofficial or employee, the Illinois case law links state-law im-\nmunity to the merits. If a plaintiff adequately alleges and ul-\ntimately proves that an Illinois official violated a statute or the\nConstitution, Illinois courts hold that the immunity statute\ndoes not apply to claims against the individual official. Be-\ncause of that linkage of immunity to the merits, the defense of\nthe case on the merits is quite consistent with defendants’ as-\nsertion of state-law sovereign immunity.\n\f8                                                    No. 15-3384\n\n    C. Illinois Sovereign Immunity for Individual Employees\n     The Illinois sovereign immunity statute protects the State\nagainst being “made a defendant or party in any court.” 745\nIll. Comp. Stat. 5/1. Murphy argues that he has not sued the\nState of Illinois but only Illinois state employees. Whether the\nstatute covers such state-law claims is a matter of state law.\nOur role is to decide questions of state law as we predict the\nstate supreme court would decide them. E.g., Rodas v. Seidlin,\n656 F.3d 610, 626 (7th Cir. 2011) (“When interpreting state law,\na federal court’s task is to determine how the state’s highest\ncourt would rule.”); Barger v. State of Indiana, 991 F.2d 394, 396\n(7th Cir. 1993) (“State courts are the final arbiters of state\nlaw.”).\n    Naming state employees as defendants would be too sim-\nple an evasion of the statute, which “cannot be evaded by\nmaking an action nominally one against the servants or agents\nof the State when the real claim is against the State of Illinois\nitself and when the State of Illinois is the party vitally inter-\nested.” Sass v. Kramer, 381 N.E.2d 975, 977 (Ill. 1978). A sub-\nstantial body of Illinois case law addresses when and under\nwhat circumstances the immunity statute applies to claims\nagainst state employees. See Benning, 928 F.2d at 779–80.\n   A claim against a state official or employee is a claim\nagainst the state when\n       “there are (1) no allegations that an agent or em-\n       ployee of the State acted beyond the scope of his\n       authority through wrongful acts; (2) the duty al-\n       leged to have been breached was not owed to\n       the public generally independent of the fact of\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                        9\n\n       State employment; and (3) where the com-\n       plained-of actions involve matters ordinarily\n       within that employee’s normal and official func-\n       tions of the State.”\nHealy v. Vaupel, 549 N.E.2d 1240, 1247 (Ill. 1990), quoting Robb\nv. Sutton, 498 N.E.2d 267, 272 (Ill. App. 1986). That analysis\ncan be a difficult one, and the state cases guiding it have “not\nalways been consistent.” Leetaru v. Board of Trustees of Univer-\nsity of Illinois, 32 N.E.3d 583, 602 (Ill. 2015) (Burke, J., dissent-\ning). Compare Healy, 549 N.E.2d at 313 (applying immunity\nin part because the “relationship between the plaintiff and the\ndefendants would not have had a source outside the employ-\nment status of the defendants”), with Jinkins v. Lee, 807 N.E.2d\n411, 420 (Ill. 2004) (rejecting a “but-for” state employment im-\nmunity analysis).\n    This case is governed by an important exception to sover-\neign immunity in suits against state officials or employees. If\nthe plaintiff alleges that state officials or employees violated\n“statutory or constitutional law,” “[s]overeign immunity af-\nfords no protection.” Healy, 549 N.E.2d at 1247. “This excep-\ntion is premised on the principle that while legal official acts\nof state officers are regarded as acts of the State itself, illegal\nacts performed by the officers are not.” Leetaru, 32 N.E.3d at\n596. That exception distinguishes Illinois’s sovereign immun-\nity rule from federal law immunity doctrines, which usually\napply to bar claims regardless of their potential merit. See,\ne.g., Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n\f10                                                             No. 15-3384\n\n92–93, 120–21 (1984) (reversing on Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunity grounds a judgment on the merits for plaintiffs). 2\n    Fritz v. Johnston, 807 N.E.2d 461 (Ill. 2004), shows the Illi-\nnois exception in operation and shows how state-law immun-\nity depends on the merits of the plaintiff’s claims. In that case,\nthe plaintiff alleged that state employees conspired to force\nhim to retire from his own state job by falsely telling the police\nthat he had been making threats. Plaintiff alleged civil con-\nspiracy and intentional interference with employment. The Il-\nlinois Supreme Court reversed dismissal of the case, holding\nthat sovereign immunity did not apply because the plaintiff’s\nfactual allegations matched the criminal offense of disorderly\nconduct. Id. at 467, citing 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/26-l(a)(4) (West\n1998).\n    This court’s Illinois sovereign immunity cases have\nacknowledged this exception to sovereign immunity but most\noften have found that the exception did not apply. See, e.g.,\nTurpin v. Koropchak, 567 F.3d 880, 884 (7th Cir. 2009) (“Nothing\n\n     2 The Illinois exception for illegal acts by state officials resembles the\nfederal rule under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), but has much\nbroader effects. Ex parte Young allows federal suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief to require state officials to comply with federal law. The\nIllinois exception also allows suits for damages against state employees in\ntheir individual capacities. Compare MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Illi-\nnois Bell Telephone Co., 222 F.3d 323, 337 (7th Cir. 2000) (“the Ex parte Young\ndoctrine allows private parties to sue individual state officials for prospec-\ntive relief to enjoin ongoing violations of federal law”), with Fritz v. John-\nston, 807 N.E.2d at 468 (“Whenever a state employee performs illegally\n[or] unconstitutionally ... a suit may still be maintained against the em-\nployee in his individual capacity[.]”), quoting Wozniak v. Conry, 679\nN.E.2d 1255, 1259 (Ill. App. 1997).\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                      11\n\nin Turpin’s complaint alleges a violation of the State constitu-\ntion or a statute, so this exception is off the table.”). In partic-\nular, Richman v. Sheahan, 270 F.3d 430 (7th Cir. 2001), cabined\nthe exception. We noted that the plaintiff had alleged a con-\nstitutional violation, but we found that sovereign immunity\napplied nonetheless because the plaintiff’s state-law claims\nwere “not dependent on the alleged constitutional violation.”\nId. at 442. Richman, however, preceded Fritz, which permitted\nstate-law claims that did not depend on constitutional or stat­\nutory violations. Fritz, 807 N.E.2d at 467.\n    Richman also preceded Leetaru, which just last year reaf-\nfirmed the exception in broad terms, over a dissent that would\nhave narrowed it to a scope closer to the federal Ex parte Young\ndoctrine. Leetaru, 32 N.E.3d at 611–12 (Burke, J., dissenting).\nDespite the force of the dissent, our role under Erie is to take\nthe Leetaru majority opinion at its word: the exception applies\nwhenever “agents of the State have acted in violation of stat-\nutory or constitutional law.” Id. at 597 (majority opinion).\n    In this case, Murphy alleged and then proved that the de-\nfendants’ actions violated the United States Constitution. He\nalso alleged and proved the factual elements of the Illinois\ncriminal offense of aggravated battery. That statute requires\n(1) “a battery, other than by the discharge of a firearm,” and\n(2) that the defendant “knowingly ... [c]auses great bodily\nharm.” 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3.05(a)(l) (West Supp. 2016)\n(effective July 1, 2011). Murphy alleged and proved to the jury\nthat Officer Smith punched his face and head and choked\nhim, then threw him into a cell with such force that he hit his\nface on a metal toilet. Officer Smith did so “without justifica-\ntion.” Cf. 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3(a) (West 2002) (defining\n\f12                                                            No. 15-3384\n\ncriminal battery as contact “without legal justification”). Mur-\nphy suffered “serious and permanent injury” and required re-\nconstructive surgery. Since Murphy alleged and proved that\nSmith and Fulk acted “in violation of statutory or constitu-\ntional law,” sovereign immunity does not bar his state-law\nclaims. Fritz, 807 N.E.2d at 467, quoting Healy, 549 N.E.2d at\n1247. 3\nIII. Attorney Fee\n   The Prison Litigation Reform Act sets limits on attorney\nfees awarded to prisoners who prevail in civil rights cases. 42\nU.S.C. § 1997e(d). Whenever such a prisoner receives a mon-\netary judgment, “a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25\npercent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s\nfees awarded against the defendant.” § 1997e(d)(2).\n   The district court interpreted that language to permit it to\nexercise its discretion in choosing the percentage of the dam-\nage award that should go toward the attorney fee, so long as\nthe choice was no greater than 25 percent. The court allocated\n10 percent of the damage award to satisfy the attorney fee\naward. That interpretation is consistent with decisions of\n\n\n     3 We emphasize that Murphy both alleged and proved the violations in\n\nthis case. Most Illinois cases dealing with this exception to sovereign im-\nmunity focus on the plaintiff’s allegations because the appeals have arisen\nfrom motions to dismiss on the pleadings. We believe Illinois also requires\na plaintiff ultimately to prove the alleged violations. For example, Leetaru\nexplained that “sovereign immunity affords no protection when agents of\nthe State have acted in violation of statutory or constitutional law or in ex-\ncess of their authority,” and in reversing dismissal on the pleadings, the\ncourt allowed defendants on remand to show their conduct was not “in\nfact” unauthorized, illegal, or in violation of plaintiff’s rights. See 32\nN.E.3d at 597 (emphasis added).\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                    13\n\nother circuits, which allow such discretion. See Boesing v.\nSpiess, 540 F.3d 886, 892 (8th Cir. 2008) (“plain language of 42\nU.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2) does not require the district court to au-\ntomatically apply 25 percent of the judgment to pay attorney’s\nfees”); Parker v. Conway, 581 F.3d 198, 205 (3d Cir. 2009) (agree-\ning with Boesing).\n    We have read the statute differently. In Johnson v. Daley,\n339 F.3d 582, 585 (7th Cir. 2003) (en banc), we explained that\n§ 1997e(d)(2) required that “attorneys’ compensation come[]\nfirst from the damages.” “[O]nly if 25% of the award is inad-\nequate to compensate counsel fully” does the defendant con­\ntribute more to the fees. Id. We continue to believe that is the\nmost natural reading of the statutory text. We do not think the\nstatute contemplated a discretionary decision by the district\ncourt. The statute neither uses discretionary language nor\nprovides any guidance for such discretion.\n   Accordingly, we REMAND the case to the district court to\nmodify its judgment to require Murphy to pay from the judg-\nment the sum of $76,933.46 toward satisfying the attorney fee\nthe court awarded. In all other respects the judgment is\n                                                   AFFIRMED.\n\f14                                                  No. 15-3384\n\n   MANION, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join the court’s opin-\nion. I write separately to address the scope of Illinois’ sover-\neign immunity defense for state employees sued in their indi-\nvidual capacities, which has been a difficult issue for the Illi-\nnois state courts. Because the plaintiff in this case prevailed\non federal constitutional claims as well as state claims, only a\nsmall portion of the judgment is at stake in this appeal. Yet the\ncase still presents an important issue of state law: to what ex-\ntent Illinois’ State Lawsuit Immunity Act and the Court of\nClaims Act confines intentional tort claims against state em-\nployees to the Illinois Court of Claims.\n     The State Lawsuit Immunity Act prohibits the State of Illi-\nnois from being named as a defendant in any court, with lim-\nited exceptions. 745 ILCS 5/1. One of those exceptions is the\nCourt of Claims Act, which created that court as the “exclu-\nsive forum for resolving lawsuits against the state.” People ex\nrel. Manning v. Nickerson, 702 N.E.2d 1278, 1280 (Ill. 1998) (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). It provides in relevant part\nthat the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over “[a]ll\nclaims against the State for damages sounding in tort.” 705\nILCS 505/8(d). In effect, the State’s limited waiver of sovereign\nimmunity gives it home-court advantage when it defends tort\nclaims for damages. See Loman v. Freeman, 890 N.E.2d 446, 458\n(Ill. 2008) (no right to a jury trial in the Court of Claims);\nReichert v. Court of Claims, 786 N.E.2d 174, 177 (Ill. 2003) (no\nright to appeal the merits of a Court of Claims decision).\n    The dispositive question here is whether state-law por-\ntions of this suit (the battery claims) against the defendant\nprison guards are really “against the State” for the purposes\nof these statutes. The most natural reading of the statute\nseems to preclude any court other than the Illinois Court of\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                                 15\n\nClaims from exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s inten-\ntional tort claim. Battery is a tort and the defendants here were\nacting in the scope of their state employment when they (ac-\ncording to the jury) battered the plaintiff. Had they not been\ndoing so, the Illinois Attorney General’s office would not have\nappeared on their behalf, as it did in the district court and in\nthis court. 5 ILCS 350/2(a) & (e) (providing that the Illinois At-\ntorney General will appear on behalf of a state employee sued\nfor something “arising out of any act or omission occurring\nwithin the scope of the employee’s State employment” and in-\ndemnify upon judgment against the employee in such cases).\nIn every practical sense, this is a judgment that “could operate\nto control the actions of the State or subject it to liability.” Cur-\nrie v. Lao, 592 N.E.2d 977, 980 (Ill. 1992).\n   However, the Illinois Supreme Court has construed\n“against the State” more narrowly in suits against state em-\nployees. See, e.g., Leetaru v. Bd. of Trs., 32 N.E.3d 583, 596 (Ill.\n2015); Loman, 890 N.E.2d at 462. 1 That court would hold that\nthe defendants here acted outside their authority and there-\nfore that immunity does not apply. We are bound to follow\nthat court’s holdings and reasoning. Therefore, I join the opin-\nion of the court in full.\n\n\n\n\n    1  Several opinions of Illinois’ intermediate appellate court read the\nCourt of Claims Act more broadly; their reasoning would bring the plain-\ntiff’s battery claims within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of\nClaims. See, e.g., Grainger v. Harrah’s Casino, 18 N.E.3d 265, 273‒75 (Ill.\nApp. Ct. 2014); Sellers v. Rudert, 918 N.E.2d 586, 591‒92 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009);\nWelch v. Illinois Supreme Court, 751 N.E.2d 1187, 1194 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001);\nCampbell v. White, 566 N.E.2d 47, 53 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991). However, we are\nbound only by the opinions of Illinois’ highest court.\n\f",

Plaintiff Charles Murphy was an\ninmate in the Vandalia Correctional Center in Illinois. On July\n25, 2011, correctional officers hit Murphy, fracturing part of\nhis eye socket, and left him in a cell without medical attention.\nMurphy sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state-law theories.\nA jury awarded him damages on some of those claims, includ-\ning some state-law claims, and the district court awarded at-\ntorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Two of the defendants now\n\f2                                                   No. 15-3384\n\nappeal and challenge two aspects of the judgment. They argue\nthat state-law sovereign immunity bars the state-law claims\nand that the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires that 25 per-\ncent of the damage award be used to pay the attorney fee\naward.\n    We affirm on the sovereign immunity defense. The Illinois\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply to state-law\nclaims against a state official or employee who has violated\nstatutory or constitutional law. See Leetaru v. Board of Trustees\nof University of Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ill. 2015). Murphy al-\nleged and ultimately proved such violations here. On the at-\ntorney fee issue, however, we reverse. Under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(d), the attorney fee award must first be satisfied from\nup to 25 percent of the damage award, and the district court\ndoes not have discretion to reduce that maximum percentage.\nWe remand for entry of a modified judgment.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n     We recount the facts in the light reasonably most favorable\nto the verdict, which defendants do not challenge on the mer-\nits. On July 25, 2011, plaintiff Charles Murphy was a prisoner\nat the Vandalia Correctional Center. His assigned seat at\nmealtime that day had food and water on it. When he re­\nported the mess, Correctional Officer Robert Smith first told\nhim to clean it up himself and later told Murphy to leave the\ndining area. A different officer handcuffed Murphy, and Of-\nficer Smith escorted him to a segregation building. When they\ngot there, a third officer asked Murphy what unit he normally\nstayed in, but Murphy ignored him. Officer Smith began mov-\ning his finger in and out of Murphy’s ear, while asking Mur-\nphy if he was deaf and repeating the phrase “you can’t hear,\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                     3\n\nyou can’t hear.” While this was happening, Lieutenant Greg-\nory Fulk entered the building and saw what was happening.\n    Now escorted by three officers, Murphy was taken further\ninto the segregation unit. Murphy did not struggle with the\nofficers as they walked, although he taunted Officer Smith,\npromising what would happen the next time he “ain’t got no\nhandcuffs on.” Hearing that, Officer Smith hit Murphy in the\neye and then applied a choke hold with his arm around Mur-\nphy’s throat. Murphy lost consciousness. When he came to,\nLieutenant Fulk and Officer Smith were pushing him into a\ncell. With his hands still cuffed behind his back, Murphy fell\nface-first into the cell and hit his head on its metal toilet. The\nofficers took off his clothes and handcuffs and left without\nhaving checked his condition.\n    Thirty or forty minutes later, a nurse came to see Murphy,\nwho was ultimately sent to a hospital. His orbital rim—part\nof his eye socket—had been crushed and needed surgery. He\nhad that surgery but did not recover completely. As of Janu-\nary 2015, his vision remained doubled and blurred.\n     In July 2012, Murphy filed suit in the Southern District of\nIllinois. After two rounds of complaint amendments and a\npartial grant of summary judgment for defendants, the case\nwas tried to a jury. The jury found for plaintiff Murphy on\nfour claims against two defendants—Lieutenant Fulk and Of-\nficer Smith, the appellants here. The jury found Officer Smith\nliable on two claims of state-law battery and one federal claim\nof unconstitutional use of force under the Eighth Amend-\nment. The jury also found Lieutenant Fulk liable on a federal\nEighth Amendment claim of deliberate indifference to a seri-\nous medical need. All told, the jury awarded $241,001 in com-\npensatory and punitive damages against Officer Smith and\n\f4                                                     No. 15-3384\n\n$168,750 against Lieutenant Fulk. The district court reduced\nthe combined award to a total of $307,733.82. That reduction\nis not at issue in this appeal. The district court also awarded\nattorney fees and ordered that 10 percent of the damages\nawarded be put toward paying those fees. Officer Smith and\nLieutenant Fulk have appealed.\nII. Sovereign Immunity\n   The defendants argue first that state-law sovereign im-\nmunity bars Murphy’s state-law claims. The district court\nfound, and Murphy contends on appeal, that defendants\nwaived their state-law sovereign immunity defense. We find\nno waiver but find that state-law sovereign immunity does\nnot shield these defendants from liability.\n    A. Sovereign Immunity in Illinois\n    Illinois is protected against civil suits in federal court by\ntwo relevant doctrines. First, the “Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunizes unconsenting states from suit in federal court.” Ben-\nning v. Board of Regents of Regency Universities, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557829\"><a href=\"/opinion/557829/matthew-m-benning-and-lori-k-neumann-benning-v-board-of-regents-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777\n(7th Cir. 1991); see also Alden v. Maine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118318\"><a href=\"/opinion/118318/alden-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712–13\n(1999) (explaining broader concept of sovereign immunity for\nwhich “‘Eleventh Amendment immunity ... is convenient\nshorthand”). Second, an Illinois statute provides, with excep-\ntions not relevant here, that “the State of Illinois shall not be\nmade a defendant or party in any court.” 745 Ill. Comp. Stat.\n5/1. Under the Erie Railroad doctrine, that statute governs\nclaims in federal court arising under state law. Benning, 928\nF.2d at 777, citing Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1938).\nWhile both doctrines are often referred to as “sovereign im-\nmunity,” they are not the same. See, e.g., Beaulieu v. Vermont,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485–86 (2d Cir. 2015) (distinguishing between\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                                     5\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity and broader state sovereign\nimmunity under Vermont law). As we explain below, im-\nportant differences between the federal and state doctrines\nare decisive in this case.\n    B. Waiver\n    Before addressing the merits of the state-law sovereign im-\nmunity defense, we first address plaintiff Murphy’s argument\nthat defendants waived the defense. “[S]overeign immunity\nis a waivable affirmative defense.” Park v. Indiana University\nSchool of Dentistry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (7th Cir. 2012) (Eleventh\nAmendment), citing Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin\nSystem v.

Board of Regents of University\nSystem of Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (2002) (state’s voluntary re-\nmoval to federal court waived Eleventh Amendment immun-\nity). If a state does not raise the immunity defense, “a court\ncan ignore it.” Wisconsin Dep’t of Corrections v. Schacht, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118236\"><a href=\"/opinion/118236/wisconsin-dept-of-corrections-v-schacht/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (1998). Because the defendants never relied and still\ndo not rely on Eleventh Amendment immunity, they waived\nthat defense. See Park, 692 F.3d at 830 (finding waiver where\nthe state “never once raised the issue ... before the district\ncourt” and declined to raise the issue “even when prompted\nby this court at argument”). 1\n\n\n    1  Like the parties, we rely on Eleventh Amendment case law to ad­\ndress waiver. This is our usual approach under the Erie doctrine because\nprocedural issues are governed by federal law in federal courts, and\nwaiver is generally treated as procedural. See Herremans v. Carrera Designs,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758513\"><a href=\"/opinion/758513/timothy-herremans-v-carrera-designs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1122–23 (7th Cir. 1998). Even if Illinois law governed\nthe waiver issue, there would be no waiver. Illinois appears to permit sov-\nereign immunity waivers only by statute, not by litigation conduct. See\nTownship of Jubilee v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2523581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2523581/township-of-jubilee-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (Ill. 2011) (“[E]fforts by legal\n\f6                                                                No. 15-3384\n\n    State-law sovereign immunity, however, is a defense the\ndefendants raised at least five times: in their answer, in the\nfinal pre-trial conference, in the jury instruction conference, in\nthe defendants’ post-trial motion, and on appeal. Those refer-\nences were explicitly to state-law sovereign immunity. The an-\nswer, for example, claimed protection under “statutory sover-\neign immunity,” and in both the post-trial motion and the\nbriefs before this court, the defendants relied on the Illinois\nState Lawsuit Immunity Act.\n    Plaintiff Murphy has not cited nor have we found any\ncomparable case finding a waiver of a sovereign immunity\ndefense. Cf. Board of Regents, 653 F.3d at 467 (finding waiver\nwhere state filed suit in federal district court); Hill v. Blind In-\ndustries & Services of Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(finding waiver when defendant “participat[ed] in extensive\npre-trial activities and wait[ed] until the first day of trial be-\nfore objecting ... on Eleventh Amendment grounds”). Other\ncircuits hold that equal or less robust efforts to raise the im-\nmunity defense do not waive it. See, e.g., Union Pacific Railroad\nCo. v. Louisiana Public Service Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"616659\"><a href=\"/opinion/616659/union-pacific-v-louisiana-public-service-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339–40 (5th\nCir. 2011) (no waiver when defendant raised issue for first\ntime on appeal, after prevailing on a motion for summary\njudgment on the merits); Ashker v.

We reach the same\nconclusion here.\n    Plaintiff Murphy relies on the defendants’ apparent will-\ningness to defend this case on the merits. See Neinast v. Texas,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769249\"><a href=\"/opinion/769249/nell-neinast-v-state-of-texas-texas-department-of-transportation-david-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 279 (5th Cir. 2000) (“Courts have found waiver\n... where the state ... evidenced an intent to defend the suit\nagainst it on the merits.”). But in this case the significance of\nthat willingness is at best equivocal. Both the defendants and\nthe district court seemed at times to blend the state-law im-\nmunity question with the merits of plaintiff’s claims. For ex-\nample, the district court said that sovereign immunity did not\nshield the defendants because the jury, in ruling on the battery\nclaim, necessarily determined that they acted outside their au-\nthority. Murphy v. Smith, No. 3:12-cv-00841-SCW, slip op. at\n17–18 (S.D. Ill. Sept. 25, 2015).\n    That blending would be confusing under federal immun-\nity law, whether under the Eleventh Amendment or doctrines\nof absolute immunity. As we explain below, though, the\nblending of state-law immunity and the merits under Illinois\nlaw accurately reflects state law. When a plaintiff sues a state\nofficial or employee, the Illinois case law links state-law im-\nmunity to the merits. If a plaintiff adequately alleges and ul-\ntimately proves that an Illinois official violated a statute or the\nConstitution, Illinois courts hold that the immunity statute\ndoes not apply to claims against the individual official. Be-\ncause of that linkage of immunity to the merits, the defense of\nthe case on the merits is quite consistent with defendants’ as-\nsertion of state-law sovereign immunity.\n\f8                                                    No. 15-3384\n\n    C. Illinois Sovereign Immunity for Individual Employees\n     The Illinois sovereign immunity statute protects the State\nagainst being “made a defendant or party in any court.” 745\nIll. Comp. Stat. 5/1. Murphy argues that he has not sued the\nState of Illinois but only Illinois state employees. Whether the\nstatute covers such state-law claims is a matter of state law.\nOur role is to decide questions of state law as we predict the\nstate supreme court would decide them. E.g., Rodas v. Seidlin,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612913\"><a href=\"/opinion/612913/rodas-v-seidlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (7th Cir. 2011) (“When interpreting state law,\na federal court’s task is to determine how the state’s highest\ncourt would rule.”); Barger v.

A sub-\nstantial body of Illinois case law addresses when and under\nwhat circumstances the immunity statute applies to claims\nagainst state employees. See Benning, 928 F.2d at 779–80.\n   A claim against a state official or employee is a claim\nagainst the state when\n       “there are (1) no allegations that an agent or em-\n       ployee of the State acted beyond the scope of his\n       authority through wrongful acts; (2) the duty al-\n       leged to have been breached was not owed to\n       the public generally independent of the fact of\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                        9\n\n       State employment; and (3) where the com-\n       plained-of actions involve matters ordinarily\n       within that employee’s normal and official func-\n       tions of the State.”\nHealy v.

If\nthe plaintiff alleges that state officials or employees violated\n“statutory or constitutional law,” “[s]overeign immunity af-\nfords no protection.” Healy, 549 N.E.2d at 1247. “This excep-\ntion is premised on the principle that while legal official acts\nof state officers are regarded as acts of the State itself, illegal\nacts performed by the officers are not.” Leetaru, 32 N.E.3d at\n596. That exception distinguishes Illinois’s sovereign immun-\nity rule from federal law immunity doctrines, which usually\napply to bar claims regardless of their potential merit.

In that case,\nthe plaintiff alleged that state employees conspired to force\nhim to retire from his own state job by falsely telling the police\nthat he had been making threats. Plaintiff alleged civil con-\nspiracy and intentional interference with employment. The Il-\nlinois Supreme Court reversed dismissal of the case, holding\nthat sovereign immunity did not apply because the plaintiff’s\nfactual allegations matched the criminal offense of disorderly\nconduct. Id. at 467, citing 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/26-l(a)(4) (West\n1998).\n    This court’s Illinois sovereign immunity cases have\nacknowledged this exception to sovereign immunity but most\noften have found that the exception did not apply.

We noted that the plaintiff had alleged a con-\nstitutional violation, but we found that sovereign immunity\napplied nonetheless because the plaintiff’s state-law claims\nwere “not dependent on the alleged constitutional violation.”\nId. at 442. Richman, however, preceded Fritz, which permitted\nstate-law claims that did not depend on constitutional or stat­\nutory violations. Fritz, 807 N.E.2d at 467.\n    Richman also preceded Leetaru, which just last year reaf-\nfirmed the exception in broad terms, over a dissent that would\nhave narrowed it to a scope closer to the federal Ex parte Young\ndoctrine. Leetaru, 32 N.E.3d at 611–12 (Burke, J., dissenting).\nDespite the force of the dissent, our role under Erie is to take\nthe Leetaru majority opinion at its word: the exception applies\nwhenever “agents of the State have acted in violation of stat-\nutory or constitutional law.” Id. at 597 (majority opinion).\n    In this case, Murphy alleged and then proved that the de-\nfendants’ actions violated the United States Constitution. He\nalso alleged and proved the factual elements of the Illinois\ncriminal offense of aggravated battery. That statute requires\n(1) “a battery, other than by the discharge of a firearm,” and\n(2) that the defendant “knowingly ... [c]auses great bodily\nharm.” 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3.05(a)(l) (West Supp. 2016)\n(effective July 1, 2011). Murphy alleged and proved to the jury\nthat Officer Smith punched his face and head and choked\nhim, then threw him into a cell with such force that he hit his\nface on a metal toilet. Officer Smith did so “without justifica-\ntion.” Cf. 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3(a) (West 2002) (defining\n\f12                                                            No. 15-3384\n\ncriminal battery as contact “without legal justification”). Mur-\nphy suffered “serious and permanent injury” and required re-\nconstructive surgery. Since Murphy alleged and proved that\nSmith and Fulk acted “in violation of statutory or constitu-\ntional law,” sovereign immunity does not bar his state-law\nclaims. Fritz, 807 N.E.2d at 467, quoting Healy, 549 N.E.2d at\n1247. 3\nIII. Attorney Fee\n   The Prison Litigation Reform Act sets limits on attorney\nfees awarded to prisoners who prevail in civil rights cases. 42\nU.S.C. § 1997e(d). Whenever such a prisoner receives a mon-\netary judgment, “a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25\npercent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s\nfees awarded against the defendant.” § 1997e(d)(2).\n   The district court interpreted that language to permit it to\nexercise its discretion in choosing the percentage of the dam-\nage award that should go toward the attorney fee, so long as\nthe choice was no greater than 25 percent. The court allocated\n10 percent of the damage award to satisfy the attorney fee\naward. That interpretation is consistent with decisions of\n\n\n     3 We emphasize that Murphy both alleged and proved the violations in\n\nthis case. Most Illinois cases dealing with this exception to sovereign im-\nmunity focus on the plaintiff’s allegations because the appeals have arisen\nfrom motions to dismiss on the pleadings. We believe Illinois also requires\na plaintiff ultimately to prove the alleged violations. For example, Leetaru\nexplained that “sovereign immunity affords no protection when agents of\nthe State have acted in violation of statutory or constitutional law or in ex-\ncess of their authority,” and in reversing dismissal on the pleadings, the\ncourt allowed defendants on remand to show their conduct was not “in\nfact” unauthorized, illegal, or in violation of plaintiff’s rights. See 32\nN.E.3d at 597 (emphasis added).\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                    13\n\nother circuits, which allow such discretion.

Id. We continue to believe that is the\nmost natural reading of the statutory text. We do not think the\nstatute contemplated a discretionary decision by the district\ncourt. The statute neither uses discretionary language nor\nprovides any guidance for such discretion.\n   Accordingly, we REMAND the case to the district court to\nmodify its judgment to require Murphy to pay from the judg-\nment the sum of $76,933.46 toward satisfying the attorney fee\nthe court awarded. In all other respects the judgment is\n                                                   AFFIRMED.\n\f14                                                  No. 15-3384\n\n   MANION, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join the court’s opin-\nion. I write separately to address the scope of Illinois’ sover-\neign immunity defense for state employees sued in their indi-\nvidual capacities, which has been a difficult issue for the Illi-\nnois state courts. Because the plaintiff in this case prevailed\non federal constitutional claims as well as state claims, only a\nsmall portion of the judgment is at stake in this appeal. Yet the\ncase still presents an important issue of state law: to what ex-\ntent Illinois’ State Lawsuit Immunity Act and the Court of\nClaims Act confines intentional tort claims against state em-\nployees to the Illinois Court of Claims.\n     The State Lawsuit Immunity Act prohibits the State of Illi-\nnois from being named as a defendant in any court, with lim-\nited exceptions. 745 ILCS 5/1. One of those exceptions is the\nCourt of Claims Act, which created that court as the “exclu-\nsive forum for resolving lawsuits against the state.” People ex\nrel. Manning v.

The most natural reading of the statute\nseems to preclude any court other than the Illinois Court of\n\fNo. 15-3384                                                                 15\n\nClaims from exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s inten-\ntional tort claim.
