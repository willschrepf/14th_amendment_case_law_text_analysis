Review of Texas Rule of Disciplinary Procedure 2.16\n\n      Texas Rule of Disciplinary Procedure 2.16 does not prohibit Appellees from\n\nproviding Doe with the Chief Disciplinary Counsel’s recommendation to the\n\nsummary disposition panel regarding Doe’s grievance, which was summarily\n\ndismissed with no explanation to Doe. See Tex. R. Disciplinary P. 2.16.\n\n      For the Court’s convenience, the relevant text of Rule 2.16 is stated below:\n\n      2.16 Confidentiality\n      A. All members and staff of the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel,\n      Board of Disciplinary Appeals, Committees and Commission shall\n      maintain as confidential all Disciplinary Proceedings and associated\n      records, except that:\n      ...\n\nTex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.16, reprinted in Tex. Gov’t Code Ann., tit. 2,\n\nsubtit. G, app. A-1 (West 2013) (“Rule 2.16”).\n\n      This rule thus provides that “Disciplinary Proceedings and associated\n\nrecords” “shall [be] maintained as confidential,” with some specified exceptions.\n\nId.\n\n      Notably, Rule 2.16 does not expressly address from whom the proceedings\n\nare kept confidential. Id. The Rule does not expressly indicate that the\n\nproceedings must be kept confidential from the complainant himself. Id. Such a\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                       1\n\frule would seem misplaced, when it is the complainant himself who initiated the\n\ndisciplinary process, who knows the underlying facts, who knows the attorney\n\nunder investigation, and who knows the exact allegations raised against that\n\nattorney.\n\n      Admittedly, however, Rule 2.16 does not expressly state that its\n\nconfidentiality requirement does not apply to complainants. For this reason, Rule\n\n2.16 must be, and has been, interpreted. In this case, and presumably in all cases,\n\nthe Commission for Lawyer Discipline through the Chief Disciplinary Counsel\n\n(“CDC”) has interpreted Rule 2.16 as keeping the CDC’s recommendation to the\n\nsummary disposition panel confidential from complainants.\n\n      Doe disagrees with this interpretation of Rule 2.16 and instead, believes a\n\ncommon sense interpretation should prevail—pursuant to which the Disciplinary\n\nProceedings, and associated records, are indeed confidential as to all third-parties;\n\nbut not as to the complainant who initiated the proceeding and who already has\n\nknowledge of the underlying facts.\n\n      Doe’s interpretation is supported by existing Texas statutory law, as\n\ndiscussed below.\n\nB.    The Legislature expressly contemplated providing an explanation to a\n      complainant, upon dismissal of a complaint.\n\n      Section 81.072 of the Texas Government Code, in relevant part, states:\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                      2\n\f        Sec. 81.072. GENERAL DISCIPLINARY AND DISABILITY\n        PROCEDURES. (a) In furtherance of the supreme court’s powers to\n        supervise the conduct of attorneys, the court shall establish disciplinary and\n        disability procedures in addition to the procedures provided by this\n        subchapter.\n        (b) The supreme court shall establish minimum standards and procedures\n        for the attorney disciplinary and disability system. The standards and\n        procedures for processing grievances against attorneys must provide\n        for:\n        (1) classification of all grievances and investigation of all complaints;\n        (2) a full explanation to each complainant on dismissal of an inquiry or\n        a complaint; . . . .\n\nTex. Gov’t Code ¶ 81.072 (emphases added).\n\n        Section 81.072’s plain language requires the provision of “a full explanation\n\nto each complainant on dismissal of an inquiry or complaint.” Id. Clearly, the\n\nLegislature contemplated providing a complainant with a “full explanation” when\n\nhis complaint is dismissed. Id. Construing Rule 2.16 to prohibit a complainant\n\nfrom learning the reason his complaint was referred to a summary disposition\n\ncontradicts this requirement.\n\n        Accordingly, because Appellees’ interpretation of Rule 2.16 contradicts the\n\nLegislature’s intent in section 81.072, it cannot stand. See id.; Rule 2.16.\n\nC.      Exceptions to sovereign immunity apply in this case.\n\n        Appellees’ primary defense to Doe’s declaratory judgment action is\n\nsovereign immunity; but well-recognized exceptions to immunity apply in this\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                      3\n\f      Appellees have not disputed that 2 exceptions to sovereign immunity exist in\n\na declaratory judgment case: (1) the state is an appropriate party to a suit that\n\n“challenges the validity of a statute”; and (2) the state actor is an appropriate party\n\nto a suit that makes an ultra vires allegation. These exceptions were discussed in\n\nTex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d 618 (Tex. 2011) (the primary case\n\nupon which Appellees rely for their sovereign immunity argument) and City of El\n\nPaso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009), a predecessor case to Sefzik. Both\n\ncases are discussed below.\n\n      1. Doe’s challenge to Rule 2.16 falls within the exception for “challenging\n         a statute.”\n\n      Appellees argue Doe is not “challenging the validity of a statute,” and thus\n\nthis exception to sovereign immunity cannot apply in this case.\n\n      Appellees, however, misunderstand what it means to “challenge the validity\n\nof a statute,” as evidenced by the fact that at oral argument, they insisted that the\n\ncase at bar was just like Sefzik.\n\n      In Sefzik, the Texas Department of Transportation (“TxDOT”) denied\n\nSefzik’s application for a sign permit. 355 S.W.3d at 620. Sefzik appealed this\n\ndenial, but lost. Id. Sefzik then complained that he was entitled to a hearing on the\n\ndenial, because the APA’s procedures pertaining to contested cases applied. Id.\n\nTxDOT disagreed, refused to grant him a hearing, and Sefzik then sought a\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                          4\n\fdeclaratory judgment “that the APA’s ‘contested case’ procedures entitled him to a\n\nhearing.” Id.\n\n         Notably, Sefzik was not complaining about, or “challenging,” the underlying\n\nregulations pertaining to the sign permit. He was not complaining that the\n\nregulations applied to him, when they should not have. He was not complaining\n\nthat the regulations had been misconstrued, misinterpreted, or misapplied. Sefzik’s\n\nsole complaint before the trial court was that the APA’s contested-case procedures\n\napplied to his permit denial, so that he was entitled to a hearing. Id.\n\n         The Sefzik defendants sought to dismiss the case, based on sovereign\n\nimmunity. Id. at 620. Sefzik argued a declaratory judgment action did not\n\nimplicate sovereign immunity. Sefzik v. Tex. Dep’t of Transp., 267 S.W.3d 127,\n\n131 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2008) rev’d in part, 355 S.W.3d 618. Ultimately,\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court agreed in part with the Sefzik defendants, and found the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act itself does not waive immunity. In doing so, however,\n\nthe Court recognized exceptions to sovereign immunity in declaratory judgment\n\ncases:\n\n         Although the UDJA waives sovereign immunity in particular cases,\n         Sefzik’s claim does not fall within the scope of those express waivers.\n         For example, the state may be a proper party to a declaratory\n         judgment action that challenges the validity of a statute. Heinrich,\n         284 S.W.3d at 373 n. 6 (citing TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                     5\n\f       § 37.006(b)); Wichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 629,\n       697-98 (Tex. 2003); Tex. Educ. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432,\n       446 (Tex. 1994).\n\nId. at 622 (emphasis added).\n\n       By expressly citing Leeper as an example of when the state may be a\n\nproper party to a declaratory judgment action, the Court gave litigants clear\n\ndirection regarding what it means to “challenge the validity of a statute.”\n\nId., citing Tex. Educ. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432, 446 (Tex. 1994).\n\n        In Leeper, the plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment against State\n\nentities complaining that the defendants had misinterpreted the private school\n\nexemption to Texas’s compulsory attendance law. 893 S.W.2d at 433 (citing Tex.\n\nEduc. Code §§ 21.032 and 21.033(a)(1)).1 Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that\n\nhome-schooling should be interpreted as falling within the private school\n\nexemption. Id.\n\n        The case at bar is analogous to Leeper (and not to Sefzik), because like\n\nLeeper, there is a specific statute (or rule) at issue being “challenged.”\n\n        As in Leeper, Doe’s argument is that the particular provision at issue has\n\nbeen “misinterpreted.” Id. Specifically, in Leeper, the plaintiffs argued the State\n\nentities had misinterpreted the private school exemption as not applying to, or not\n\n\n1\n  Leeper did not expressly address sovereign immunity; but it is nonetheless instructive based on\nSefzik’s reference to that case. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d at 622, citing Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 446.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                                6\n\fincluding, home-schooled children. Id. In the case at bar, Doe makes an\n\nanalogous argument: the State entities have misinterpreted 2.16, so as to preclude\n\nDoe from obtaining the requested information.\n\n       Finally in Leeper, the plaintiffs challenged the State’s actions (prosecuting\n\nparents of home-schooled children), which were taken based on the State’s\n\n(mis)interpretation of the statute at issue. Id. at 433. In the case at bar, Doe has\n\nchallenged the CDC’s actions (refusing to provide information to Doe), which\n\nwere taken based on the CDC’s misinterpretation of Rule 2.16.\n\n       Thus, Doe has indeed “challenged the validity of a statute,” as did the\n\nplaintiffs in Leeper, and in contrast to the plaintiff in Sefzik. Compare id. with\n\nSefzik, 355 S.W.3d at 622. Accordingly, the exception to sovereign immunity\n\nexemplified by Leeper applies to make the State entities proper parties to this\n\nproceeding. See Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 438, 446; Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372.\n\n\n\n      2.     Linda Acevedo acted ultra vires when she refused to provide the\n             requested information without legal authority.\n\n      In the alternative, by refusing to provide the requested information without\n\nany legal authority for doing so, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, Linda Acevedo,\n\nhas acted ultra vires.\n\n      In Heinrich, the Texas Supreme Court discussed the contours of the ultra\n\nvires exception to sovereign immunity. 284 S.W.3d at 372-74. “To fall within this\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                         7\n\fultra vires exception, a suit must not complain of a government officer’s exercise\n\nof discretion, but rather must allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer acted\n\nwithout legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.” Id. at 372.\n\n      Heinrich complained that the City’s reduction of her pension benefits under\n\na municipal pension fund was “illegal or unauthorized.” Id. at 378. She argued\n\nthat the City had improperly and without legal authority made a retrospective\n\nreduction in her pension benefits. Id. The Court found some evidence to support\n\nher position, and thus affirmed the lower court’s denial of the plea to the\n\njurisdiction with respect to specific named state actors, under the ultra vires\n\ndoctrine. Id. at 379-80.\n\n      In the case at bar, Appellees focus on the “ministerial act” portion of the\n\nultra vires exception, and argue that there is no such act in this case. Appellees\n\nargue that because Rule 2.16 does expressly require them to provide a complainant\n\nwith the information Doe requested, there is no ministerial act to implicate the\n\nultra vires exception.\n\n      This argument is misplaced, because Doe is not complaining there was some\n\nfailure to perform a ministerial act (nor is a ministerial act required, to implicate\n\nthe ultra vires doctrine). Acting without legal authority is also a proper basis for\n\nan ultra vires finding. See id. And that is exactly what Doe has alleged in this\n\ncase: that the State actor, Linda Acevedo, acted without legal authority, when she\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                          8\n\frefused to give the requested information based solely on a misinterpretation of\n\nRule 2.16. As discussed above, Rule 2.16 does not expressly prohibit disclosure of\n\nthe information requested to a complainant.\n\n      Accordingly, the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity applies in this\n\ncase to render Linda Acevedo a required party to this action. Id.\n\n\nD.    There is a real controversy and a real injury, which will continue to\n      evade judicial review.\n\n      Appellees raised several additional arguments as to why the lower court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction. Examined individually, each argument fails.\n\n      1. Doe’s declaratory judgment action to interpret Rule 2.16 does not seek to\n         usurp control vested in the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n       Relying primarily on State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243 (Tex.\n\n1994), Appellees urge this court to find that Doe’s actions constitute an attempt to\n\nusurp power that is vested exclusively in the Texas Supreme Court: the power to\n\ninstitute Disciplinary Rules. This argument fails because its premise is incorrect.\n\nDoe is not seeking to “rewrite” Rule 2.16, or “change” Rule 2.16 as Appellees\n\nallege. Doe is simply asking for Rule 2.16 not to be misinterpreted as keeping\n\nrecommendations to summary dismissal panels confidential from complainants, for\n\nall the reasons described above.\n\n      Gomez is inapposite because in that case, the plaintiffs asked a state district\n\ncourt to create a mandatory duty for attorneys to undertake pro bono\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                        9\n\frepresentations. 891 S.W2d at 246. The supreme court held that creating duties\n\nfor attorneys is the sole province of the supreme court, and thus the district court\n\nlacked authority to grant the relief requested by the plaintiff. Because the district\n\ncourt could not grant the relief requested, the case before it was not justiciable, and\n\nthat court lacked jurisdiction. Id.\n\n         But in the case at bar, Doe is not asking the trial court to create a new rule,\n\ninstitute a new program, insert a new requirement, or promulgate a new policy or\n\nregulation. All the trial court is asked to do is declare that Rule 2.16 does not\n\nprohibit the CDC from disclosing its recommendation to a summary disposition\n\npanel.\n\n\n\n         2. This case meets the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\n\n         Because the questions involved in this case are of considerable public\n\nimportance, are capable of arising again between the same parties or other\n\nmembers of the public, and will continue to evade judicial review, this case meets\n\nthe “public interest” exception to the mootness doctrine. See Univ. Scholastic\n\nLeague v. Buchanan, 848 S.W.2d 298, 304 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, no writ).\n\n         Appellees have argued that this court should not apply the public interest\n\ndoctrine in this instance, because there is another way of obtaining what Doe\n\nwants: a petition to the Texas Supreme Court. Again, though, Appellees\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                             10\n\fmischaracterize Doe’s request. Doe is not asking for a rule re-write, a new rule, or\n\nnew policy. Doe is simply asking for an interpretation of Rule 2.16.\n\n      In addition, Doe has suffered a real harm and injury because he could bring\n\nanother grievance, and preventing him from understanding why his prior grievance\n\nwas dismissed, hamstrings him in preparing another complaint. The Appellees\n\nhave taken the position that, because the Commission only makes\n\n“recommendations” to a summary disposition panel (“SDP”), and the SDP\n\nultimately makes the decision to dismiss, Doe cannot possibly stand to gain from\n\nknowledge of the Commission’s recommendation. This is simply false and\n\nmischaracterizes the process.\n\n      The Commission decides whether any filing constitutes an “inquiry” or a\n\n“grievance.” Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.12. If a filing is classified as a\n\n“grievance,” the Commission then decides, after investigation, whether or not Just\n\nCause exists. Id. (providing that “the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall investigate\n\nthe Complaint and determine whether there is Just Cause.”). Id. Only after the\n\nCDC has determined that no Just Cause exists, is the matter referred to a summary\n\ndisposition panel. Id.\n\n      If the CDC determines Just Cause exists, then the grievance bypasses the\n\nsummary disposition panel, and the matter is either decided by an evidentiary panel\n\nor district court. Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.13 and 2.14.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                     11\n\f       In the case at bar, based solely on the fact that Doe’s grievance landed\n\nbefore a summary disposition panel, we know that the CDC made a “no just cause”\n\ndetermination. See Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.13. Thus, when Doe asks for\n\nthe CDC’s recommendation regarding his grievance, he wants to know why his\n\ngrievance did not meet the very low “Just Cause” threshold.2 That information\n\nwould absolutely help him in determining whether he would file an additional\n\ngrievance based on the same underlying facts.\n\n       Appellees’ insistence that they should not have to to “show their hand” by\n\ngiving Doe this information demonstrates a lack of appreciation for who is asking.\n\nDoe is not the opposing party. Doe is the CDC’s ally and potentially best witness\n\nin any case against the respondent. It does not jeopardize the CDC’s position in\n\nfuture proceedings if it explains to Doe, or allows Doe to see, why it made a “no\n\njust cause” determination.\n\n                                           PRAYER\n\n       Appellant John Doe prays that this Court reverse the trial court’s dismissal\n\nand remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n2\n  The Rules of Disciplinary Procedure define “Just Cause” as “such cause as is found to exist\nupon a reasonable inquiry that would induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to\nbelieve that an attorney either has committed an act or acts of Professional Misconduct requiring\nthat a Sanction be imposed, or suffers from a Disability that requires either suspension as an\nattorney licensed to practice law in the State of Texas or probation.” Tex. Rules Disciplinary P.\nR. 1.06(u). This is a low threshold. It focuses on what a reasonable “person” would believe (not\na reasonable attorney), which is in keeping with the overall purposes of the Rules: to protect the\npublic.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                                  12\n\f                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 WEST, WEBB, ALLBRITTON & GENTRY, P.C.\n                                 1515 Emerald Plaza\n                                 College Station, Texas 77845-1515\n                                 Telephone: (979) 694-7000\n                                 Facsimile: (979) 694-8000\n\n                                 By:________________________\n                                     /s/ Gaines West\n                                   GAINES WEST\n                                   State Bar No. 21197500\n                                   gaines.west@westwebblaw.com\n\n                                    JENNIFER D.

See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 160 (Brister, J.,\n        concurring) (“A different case might be presented if the plaintiffs alleged the board was clearly violating some provision\n        of the statute.

Here,\n       Heinrich is not challenging the validity of the bylaws or the governing statute, but rather petitioners' actions under them.\n7      State officials may, of course, be sued in both their official and individual capacities. Judgments against state officials in\n       their individual capacities will not bind the state. See Alden v.

Heinrich does not\n       argue that her claims fall within these provisions, and we express no opinion on that subject.\n10     Because the mayor of El Paso, who is also a Board member, was named as a defendant in his official capacity, Heinrich\n       may seek liability from the City through that officer, although her claims against the City itself must be dismissed.\n11     The Fund, the Board, and the Board members objected to this evidence. The trial court did not explicitly rule on the\n       objections, and the petitioners do not raise any evidentiary issues on appeal.\n12     The court of appeals failed to draw this distinction, instead discussing the protections available to officials from\n       governmental immunity. 198 S.W.3d at 407.

BACKGROUND\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Sefzik filed an application with TxDot for a permit to erect an outdoor-advertising sign at a designated\nlocation on the north side of Interstate 30 in Greenville, Texas. Sefzik sought to advertise on behalf of two businesses at the\nspecific location: T–Bar Fence, Inc. and Gym’s Star Gymnastics. As part of the *130 application process, Sefzik was\nrequired to demonstrate that the two businesses had been operating for at least 90 days (the “90–day waiting period”).1 TxDot\nreceived Sefzik’s application at its Paris, Texas office on March 21, 2005.\n\n1\n       43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 21.142(2)(K), 21.150(b)(4).\n\n\n\nApparently, Gym’s Star Gymnastics had not been operating for the requisite 90 days at the time TxDot received Sefzik’s\napplication. Rather, the 90–day waiting period did not end until April 2, 2005. TxDot did not immediately notify Sefzik of\nthe defect in his application. On April 4, 2005, Daum Advertising applied for a permit to erect an advertising sign at the same\nlocation on behalf of the same businesses.\n\nOn June 15, 2005, TxDot denied Sefzik’s application for a permit. In its denial letter, TxDot informed Sefzik that his\napplication to advertise for Gym Star Gymnastics did not satisfy the 90–day waiting period at the time that TxDot received\nhis application. Additionally, TxDot informed Sefzik that Daum Advertising’s permit had been received on April 4, 2005,\nwhich was 92 days after Gym’s Star Gymnastics opened for business. It told Sefzik that because Daum Advertising’s\napplication satisfied the 90–day waiting period, Daum Advertising was awarded the permit.\n\nOn June 20, 2005, Sefzik resubmitted his permit application,2 and on June 29, 2005, he appealed the previous denial of his\napplication.3 Sefzik filed his appeal with Michael Behrens, TxDot’s Executive Director. He argued that his application was\nthe only one on file on April 2, 2005 when the 90–day waiting period expired. Sefzik argued that TxDot should have notified\nhim of the deficiency in his permit application so that he could resubmit his application. He requested an oral, contested-case\nhearing, which he asserted was required under Texas Government Code section 2001.051.4\n\n2\n       The Texas Administrative Code appears to contemplate that if a permit application is filed with errors, TxDot will notify the\n       applicant and allow him or her to correct any deficiencies and resubmit the application. Id. § 21.150(c).\n\n\n\n3\n       Id. § 21.162(a) (“An applicant may file a petition with the executive director to appeal a denied permit.”).\n\n\n\n4\n       “In a contested case, each party is entitled to an opportunity: (1) for hearing after reasonable notice of not less than 10 days; and (2)\n       to respond and to present evidence and argument on each issue involved in the case.” TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 2001.051\n       (Vernon 2000).\n\n\n\nOn October 7, 2005, Behrens denied Sefzik’s appeal without holding a hearing. Behrens opined that TxDot acted reasonably\nin denying Sefzik’s permit application because the initial application did not meet the 90–day waiting period. Behrens cited\nto the administrative code, which states that applications are considered on a first-come, first-serve basis.5 Sefzik filed a\nmotion for rehearing,6 arguing that TxDot failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)’s7 contested case\n*131 procedures by refusing to provide him with a contested-case hearing under government code section 2001.051.

Sefzik also alleged that by denying him a contested-case proceeding, TxDot\nviolated his due process rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions.12 Finally, he sought attorney’s fees under the\nUDJA.13\n\n9\n       Id. § 2001.171 (Vernon 2000) (“A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within a State agency and who\n       is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter.”).

It argued that Sefzik did not have a property\ninterest in the permit but, rather, only had an expectation of a permit. TxDot reasoned that because Sefzik did not have a\nproperty interest, he could not establish that the APA’s declaratory relief provision waived sovereign immunity. For the same\nreason, TxDot argued that sovereign immunity barred his constitutional claims. Furthermore, TxDot argued that the UDJA is\nmerely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a trial court’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the UDJA claim was also\nbarred by sovereign immunity.\n\nSefzik argued in response that sovereign immunity is not implicated by actions for declaratory relief or for violations of\nconstitutional rights; therefore, he was not required to establish a waiver of immunity. The trial court agreed with TxDot and\ngranted its plea to the jurisdiction, and this appeal ensued.14\n\n14\n           The case was transferred to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals pursuant to a docket equalization order issued by the Supreme Court\n           of Texas.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n[1] [2]\n     We review a trial court’s ruling on subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. Tex. Natural Resource Comm’n v. IT–Davy, 74\nS.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex.2002). When reviewing a trial court’s order on a plea to the jurisdiction, a court of appeals should\nconsider only the “pleadings and evidence pertinent to the jurisdictional question.” Jenkins v. Entergy Corp., 187 S.W.3d\n785, 795 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2006, pet. denied) (citing County of Cameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555 (Tex.2002)).\n[3] [4] [5] [6]\n           “A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea, the purpose of which is to defeat a cause of action without regard to\nwhether the claims asserted have merit.” Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex.2000). Although the\nclaims form the context of the jurisdictional inquiry, the plea should be decided “without delving into the merits of the case.”\nId. In some circumstances, a court will be unable to determine the jurisdictional question without some development of the\nevidence in the case; in those circumstances, the trial court has discretion to refuse to decide the jurisdictional question until\nafter the case has progressed past the preliminary hearing stages. Id. But a party should not be required to put on their entire\ncase in order to establish that they are entitled to be in court in the first place. Id. (“The purpose of a dilatory plea is not to\nforce the plaintiffs to preview their case on the merits but to establish a reason why the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims should\nnever be reached.”).\n\n\n\n\n                       III. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND ACTIONS FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF\n\nIn this appeal, we must examine the effect of sovereign immunity on a claim for declaratory relief. The principal\ndisagreement between the parties involves the logical construct of the sovereign immunity doctrine. TxDot argues that\nsovereign immunity, as a general rule, bars claims for declaratory relief and that a plaintiff must therefore establish a waiver\nof sovereign immunity to proceed with a claim for declaratory relief. We believe, however, that TxDot’s analysis ignores the\ntheoretical underpinnings of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the substantial precedent holding that suits for\ndeclaratory relief are not suits against the State, and it requires a plaintiff to establish his or her right to declaratory relief in\norder to establish jurisdiction. Accordingly, we refuse to require Sefzik to establish that he is entitled to declaratory relief\nbefore the trial court can even consider his request for that relief. Rather, we hold, as many other courts have held, that a\nclaim for declaratory relief generally does not implicate the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the first place.\n\n\n\nA. Suits for declaratory relief do not implicate sovereign immunity\n[7] [8]\n        “Sovereign immunity, unless waived, protects the State from lawsuits for damages.” Gen. Serv. Comm’n v. Little–Tex\nInsulation Co., 39 S.W.3d 591, 594 (Tex.2001) (emphasis added); see also IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 853;\n\n                   © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                 4\n\fSefzik v. Texas Dept. of Transp., 267 S.W.3d 127 (2008)\n\n\n\nFirst Health Plans, Inc., 214 S.W.3d 709, 716–18 (Tex.App.–Austin 2007, pet. filed) (holding that suit for declaratory relief\nwas not a suit against the State because it did not seek to impose liability or seek money damages). The doctrine is based on\nthe premise that the legislature’s policy-making function deserves protection. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854. As the Texas\nSupreme Court has explained,\n\n             [s]ubjecting the government to liability may hamper governmental functions by shifting tax resources\n             away from their intended purposes toward defending *133 lawsuits and paying judgments.\n             Accordingly, the Legislature is better suited than the courts to weigh the conflicting public policies\n             associated with waiving immunity and exposing the government to increased liability, the burden of\n             which the general public must ultimately bear.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\nFor example, sovereign immunity bars a claim for damages arising out of a breach of contract unless a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity can be established or consent is obtained from the legislature. Id. This ensures that current policymakers are not\nbound by their predecessors’ long-term contracts and can respond to changing conditions in the public’s best interest. Id.\n[9]\n   Certain types of actions, however, do not implicate these concerns and, therefore, do not implicate the sovereign immunity\ndoctrine. Nueces County v. Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d 205, 217 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.). For example, Texas\ncourts have consistently distinguished suits against the State for money damages from suits for declaratory relief-the latter\ndoes not implicate the sovereign immunity doctrine. See IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855; Hawkins, 214 S.W.3d at 716; City of\nDallas v. Blanton, 200 S.W.3d 266, 279 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2006, no pet.); Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d at 218. “[N]o consent is\nrequired when suit is filed seeking only a declaration or enforcement of rights.” Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d at 217.15 In fact, just\nrecently, this Court specifically held as much. See Powell v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice, 251 S.W.3d 783, 790–91\n(Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2008, pet. filed).\n\n15\n        This is not to say that a party can escape the doctrine of sovereign immunity by artfully pleading a claim for damages as an action\n        for declaratory relief. Tex. Natural Resource Comm’n v. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855–56 (Tex.2002). For example, declaratory\n        judgment actions against State officials seeking to declare a contract’s validity, enforce a contract, or impose contractual liabilities\n        implicate the doctrine of sovereign immunity because they seek to impose liability on the State. Id.\n\n\n\nThe reason for this distinction is that “suits to compel state officers to act within their official capacity do not attempt to\nsubject the State to liability.” IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855; Hawkins, 214 S.W.3d at 716–18; Blanton, 200 S.W.3d at 279 (“A\nparty generally can maintain a suit to determine its rights without legislative permission because such suits are not considered\n‘suits against the State’ for purposes of sovereign immunity.”). In other words, suits for declaratory relief do not hamper\ncurrent policymakers’ ability to perform their job in the public interest by binding them to outdated or expired policies. If a\nstatute sought to be construed through a declaratory judgment is outdated, and thus a declaration of rights under that statute\ncauses problems for the general public, it is the policymakers’ job to change the statute, not to ignore it or violate it with\nimpunity.\n\nOn more than one occasion, this Court has rejected the idea that the State is immune from declaratory judgment actions\nseeking to determine a party’s rights under a statute. See Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d at 218; Dewhurst v. Gulf Marine Inst. of\nTech., 55 S.W.3d 91, 97 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied) (“[W]e distinguish suits to determine a party’s rights\nagainst the State from suits seeking damages. A party can maintain a suit to determine its rights without legislative\npermission.”); see also Nueces County v. Hoff, 105 S.W.3d 208, 211 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2003) (noting that sovereign\nimmunity is not implicated when the suit “does not seek to impose liability on the State, seek money damages against the\n*134 State, or seek to control state action, as in a declaratory judgment suit”), rev’d on other grounds, 153 S.W.3d 45\n(Tex.2004). It is, therefore, well established that when a private plaintiff merely seeks a declaration of his or her rights under\na statute, such an action is not subject to a sovereign immunity defense, and a waiver or consent to suit is unnecessary.\nHawkins, 214 S.W.3d at 716–17; Blanton, 200 S.W.3d at 279; Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d at 217.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By characterizing the APA’s declaratory relief provision as a “waiver” of immunity, TxDot asks this Court to\nimproperly reach the merits of Sefzik’s claims\nTxDot argues that because Sefzik has not demonstrated compliance with the requirements of the APA’s declaratory relief\nprovisions, he has not demonstrated a waiver of immunity. The dissent extends this reasoning to TxDot’s UDJA claim,\nasserting that Sefzik has to demonstrate he is entitled to declaratory relief in order to establish jurisdiction. TxDot’s and the\ndissent’s view of sovereign immunity would skew the Court’s jurisdictional analysis because it would require the Court to\ndecide the merits of Sefzik’s declaratory judgment action.\n[10] [11]\n        When a statutory waiver of immunity is involved, it is axiomatic that the plaintiff’s failure to plead the statutory\nelements means that sovereign immunity bars the suit. For example, the Texas Tort Claims Act provides a waiver of\nsovereign immunity in limited circumstances. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice v. Miller, 51 S.W.3d 583, 587 (Tex.2001). If a\nplaintiff suing under the Texas Tort Claims Act does not satisfy the specific requirements of the statute, sovereign immunity\nis not waived. Id. Because the Tort Claims Act also provides the cause of action for recovery against the State, a plaintiff\nsuing under the Tort Claims Act must also satisfy the Tort Claims Act’s requirements in order to recover. Such is not the case\nhere, where sovereign immunity is not implicated.\n\nBy characterizing the APA’s declaratory relief provision as a waiver of immunity, TxDot sets up additional hurdles for a\nplaintiff to cross before ever reaching the merits of his or her claim. For example, TxDot argues that the legislature has\nimposed strict limits on the scope of a trial court’s ability to review agency decisions, and for that reason, a party seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment under Texas Government Code section 2001.038 is limited to challenging a rule as invalid or\ninapplicable. TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 2001.038 (Vernon 2000). TxDot argues that Sefzik merely challenges whether\nTxDot correctly applied a rule and, in turn, whether TxDot’s actions comply with the APA’s provisions governing its\noperation. It argues that under these circumstances, Sefzik is not entitled to a declaratory judgment under section 2001.038.\nAdditionally, TxDot argues that Sefzik does not have a legal right or privilege within the meaning of section 2001.038. Id.\n(“The validity or applicability of a rule, including an emergency rule adopted under Section 2001.034, may be determined in\nan action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged that the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or\nthreatens to interfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the plaintiff.”) (emphasis added). Finally, TxDot argues that\npermit denial appeals are not contested cases under the APA. For all these reasons, TxDot asserts that the trial court lacks\njurisdiction. The dissent goes a step further and applies this logic to the UDJA claim: it asserts that because Sefzik cannot\nestablish that *135 his rights, status, or legal relations have been affected, there is no jurisdiction.\n\nThese arguments go to the merits of Sefzik’s claims for declaratory relief, not to jurisdiction. It may be that Sefzik’s claims\nfor declaratory relief are not contemplated by the UDJA or the APA. But that is for the trial court to decide on the merits. By\ncharacterizing the APA as a waiver of sovereign immunity, TxDot asks this Court to delve into the merits of Sefzik’s claim,\nwhich is improper at this stage of the proceedings. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist., 34 S.W.3d at 554.\n\n\n\nC. Exercising jurisdiction does not violate separation of powers\n[12] [13]\n          TxDot further argues that by exercising jurisdiction over a UDJA claim based on the interpretation of a constitutional\nor statutory provision, the trial court would violate separation of powers concerns. Specifically, TxDot argues that “if the\ncourts could review any and all statutes and constitutional provisions without reliance on a separate basis of jurisdiction, the\ncourts would in essence exercise unmitigated control over the other branches of government.” Br. of Appellee at 9, Sefzik v.\nTex. Dep’t of Transp., No. 13–06–550–CV (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi Feb. 12, 2007). We do not perceive any violation of the\nseparation of powers doctrine by our holding that a suit for declaratory relief does not invoke the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity. TxDot fails to recognize that sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine, and it is the courts’ province to\ndefine the scope of that doctrine and whether it exists in the first place. Reata Constr. Corp. v. City of Dallas, 197 S.W.3d\n371, 375 (Tex.2006).\n\nMoreover, under TxDot’s analysis, a suit to test the construction of the statute that applies to an administrative agency could\nnot be entertained. The net effect of such an analysis is that administrative agencies can ignore the APA with impunity,\nleaving a party entitled to procedures under the APA without any method of enforcing those procedures. In short, an agency\ncan deny that the APA applies and claim sovereign immunity from an action seeking to test that determination. Because\nTxDot’s analysis makes the APA a meaningless exercise of legislative power, we decline to adopt it.\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Dept. of Transp., 267 S.W.3d 127 (2008)\n\n\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, we focus only on the type of relief Sefzik seeks—declaratory relief—and hold that a suit\nseeking to determine his rights under the UDJA or the APA does not invoke the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\nAccordingly, the trial court erred in granting TxDot’s plea to the jurisdiction as to his claims for declaratory relief.\n\n\n\n\n                     IV. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND SEFZIK’S CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n\nSefzik brought claims against TxDot for violations of his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and under Article I, section 19 of the Texas Constitution. U.S. CONST. amends. V, XIV; TEX. CONST.\nart. I, § 19 (“No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner\ndisenfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land.”). He alleged that TxDot failed to afford him due process\nand due course of law by refusing to grant him a hearing in his appeal of TxDot’s denial of his permit application. TxDot\nargues that Sefzik failed to allege the existence of a right protected by these constitutional provisions; therefore, sovereign\nimmunity bars Sefzik’s claim.16 Sefzik argues that it *136 is not necessary to demonstrate a waiver of immunity when a party\nseeks relief for constitutional violations. We agree with TxDot.\n\n16\n       The Texas Supreme Court has held that the Texas Constitution’s due course of law provision, Article I section 19, protects\n       essentially the same interests as the due process provisions in the United States Constitution. NCAA v. Yeo, 171 S.W.3d 863,\n       867–68 & n. 14 (Tex.2005).\n\n\n\nSefzik’s claim for constitutional violations sought damages from TxDot. TxDot’s argument against this claim was raised in a\njurisdictional plea based solely on sovereign immunity—TxDot did not argue, and we do not decide, whether any cause of\naction for damages actually exists for the alleged constitutional violations. Perry v. Texas A & I Univ., 737 S.W.2d 106, 108\n(Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 1987, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (“[T]he issues before us are restricted to the question of the application of\nthe principles of governmental immunity to these defendants and not whether any cause of action for damages arises from the\nallegations of constitutional violations.”).\n[14]\n    As we have previously stated, “[i]n addressing the issue of immunity from suit, it is critical to recognize that the action is\none for damages and not one seeking injunctive relief.” Id. As such, Sefzik’s claim for damages for constitutional violations\nis a “suit against the State” that invokes the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Id. This Court’s prior holdings treat the\nconstitutional provisions as waivers of immunity and require that the plaintiff plead a valid cause of action thereunder in\norder to establish immunity. Id. at 109; see also State Dep’t of Pub. Safety v. Petta, 44 S.W.3d 575, 581 (Tex.2001) (holding\nthat suit against department of public safety under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was suit against the State, and plaintiff’s failure to\nproperly plead claim under that provision meant that claim was barred by sovereign immunity); Univ. of Tex. Sys. v.\nCourtney, 946 S.W.2d 464, 469 (Tex.App.–Fort Worth 1997, writ denied) (on reh’g) (holding that university had sovereign\nimmunity from suit for federal due process claims because plaintiff did not properly plead a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim).\n\nFor example, in Perry v. Texas A & I University, a counselor at Texas A & I University sued the university alleging the\ndeprivation of property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 19\nof the Texas Constitution. 737 S.W.2d at 107. The counselor sought damages from the University. Id. We referenced the\ngeneral rule that a suit that seeks to impose liability on the State invokes the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Id. at 109. The\ncounselor argued that “when a violation of constitutional or property rights is alleged, the courts have a right to review the\nacts of legislative and administrative bodies.” Id. We rejected this argument, noting that the counselor was not seeking review\nof administrative or legislative acts but, rather, was seeking monetary damages. Id. We then held that the counselor had not\nalleged that she had a vested property right that was denied. Id. We held that “because there was no pleading by the plaintiff\nto take her out of the general rule that the courts of the State of Texas have no jurisdiction to impose liability on the State\nwithout legislative consent, we sustain the judgment [dismissing her claims for lack of jurisdiction].” Id.17\n\n17\n       In dicta in Nueces County v. Ferguson, we stated that “[a]lthough a request for money damages does not affect the jurisdiction of\n       the trial court over a claim of a violation of article I, section 19, even when the State is a defendant, there is no right to a money\n       judgment for such a violation.” 97 S.W.3d 205, 221–22 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.). In a footnote, we stated that “[a]\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                       7\n\fSefzik v. Texas Dept. of Transp., 267 S.W.3d 127 (2008)\n\n\n\n            suit brought for a violation of article I, section 19 of the constitution that seeks money damages would not be barred by sovereign\n            immunity as the constitution itself provides a waiver of sovereign immunity for violations of this provision.” Id. at 222 n. 23.\n            However, we noted that nowhere in Ferguson’s pleading had she alleged a violation of Article I, section 19. Id. at 221. These\n            statements were dicta. In fact, two of the cases cited therein demonstrate that a waiver of immunity is, in fact, necessary when a\n            plaintiff seeks damages for alleged violations of Article I, section 19. See Univ. of Tex. Sys. v. Courtney, 946 S.W.2d 464, 469\n            (Tex.App.–Fort Worth 1997, writ denied) (op. on reh’g) (court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claim for damages under Article\n            I, section 19); Alcorn v. Vaksman, 877 S.W.2d 390, 404 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied) (“However, consent is\n            not needed when, as here, the breach of contract (or other government action) constitutes a state constitutional violation and the\n            plaintiff seeks a remedy other than money damages.... We conclude that consent is required to bring suit for a money judgment that\n            would be paid from the state treasury.”). The rest of the cases cited either did not address immunity or are factually distinguishable.\n            Steele v. City of Houston, 603 S.W.2d 786, 791 (Tex.1980) (takings clause of Texas Constitution expressly authorizes award of\n            damages for violation; therefore, the clause provides a waiver of immunity for claims for damages); Tex. A. & M. Sys. v.\n            Luxemburg, 93 S.W.3d 410, 425 (Tex.App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (holding that violation of Article I, section 19\n            does not give rise to an action for damages without addressing sovereign immunity); Tex. State Employees’ Union/CWA Local\n            6184 v. Tex. Workforce Comm’n, 16 S.W.3d 61, 67 (Tex.App.–Austin 2000, no pet.) (holding that plaintiff’s claim was not subject\n            to sovereign immunity doctrine because plaintiff sought only equitable relief as opposed to monetary damages). To the extent that\n            Ferguson can be read to imply that a suit for damages under Article I, section 19 is not subject to a sovereign immunity defense,\n            we disapprove of that implication.\n\n\n\n*137 The Perry decision correctly held that constitutional provisions operate as a waiver of immunity that is coextensive with\nthe cause of action provided, if any. Id.; see also Tex. Parks & Wildlife Dep’t v. Callaway, 971 S.W.2d 145, 149\n(Tex.App.–Austin 1998, no writ) (“When the state or its agency takes, damages, or destroys public property for public use,\n‘the Constitution itself is the authorization for compensation for the destruction of property and is a waiver of governmental\nimmunity ...’ Thus, if Callaway alleged a valid claim for inverse condemnation ..., sovereign immunity does not bar the\nclaim.”). In other words, to demonstrate a waiver of immunity and to recover on such a claim, Sefzik must allege facts that, if\nproven, would satisfy the elements of the claim. Here, as we explain next, Sefzik has not alleged a recognized property right\nthat is deserving of due process protections. Accordingly, he has not demonstrated a waiver of immunity for his claim for due\nprocess violations. Perry, 737 S.W.2d at 109; cf. Callaway, 971 S.W.2d at 151 (“Callaway has a property interest that is\nentitled to due-process protection.... The trial court therefore did not err in denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction\nas to Callaway’s due-process claim.”).\n[15] [16]\n       To state a valid due process or due course of law claim, a plaintiff must first allege the existence of a protected right.\nNCAA v. Yeo, 171 S.W.3d 863, 867–68 (Tex.2005). If the plaintiff has a protected right, the court must determine what\namount of process is due. Univ. of Tex. Med. Sch. v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930–31 (Tex.1995). To have a property interest\nin a governmental benefit, a person must have more than a unilateral expectation of that benefit. Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408\nU.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); Smith v. Travis County Bail Bond Bd., 559 S.W.2d 693, 694\n(Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1977, no writ) (holding plaintiff had no property interest in expired license); see also *138 Shrieve v.\nTex. Parks & Wildlife Dep’t, No. 03–04–00640–CV, 2005 WL 1034086, at *5–6 (Tex.App.–Austin May 5, 2005, no pet.)\n(mem. op.) (holding that Shrieve’s expectation of a permit was not a protected property interest). Rather, the plaintiff must\nhave a legitimate claim of entitlement to the benefit. Smith, 559 S.W.2d at 694.\n[17]\n    Sefzik’s permit application merely sought a governmental benefit to which he was not already entitled. As such, Sefzik\nmerely had an expectation of the governmental benefit—his expectation is not a protected property right. Smith, 559 S.W.2d\nat 694; Shrieve, 2005 WL 1034086, at *5–6. This is not a case where a permit has been granted but has later been taken away\nby the State without cause. See, e.g., House of Tobacco, Inc. v. Calvert, 394 S.W.2d 654, 657–58 (Tex.1965); Richardson v.\nAlsup, 380 S.W.2d 923, 923 (Tex.App.–Eastland 1964, writ ref’d). Accordingly, we hold that Sefzik has failed to\ndemonstrate that sovereign immunity is waived for his due process and due course of law claims. Thus, the trial court did not\nerr in sustaining TxDot’s plea to the jurisdiction as to these claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                               V.

Texas Dept. of Transp., 267 S.W.3d 127 (2008)\n\n\n\nunder the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act and under the Administrative Procedure Act. We reverse and remand those\nrequests for further proceedings. Finding that Sefzik’s due process and due course of law claims are barred by sovereign\nimmunity, we affirm the trial court’s order sustaining TxDot’s plea to the jurisdiction as to these claims.\n\n\n\n\nDissenting Opinion by Justice VELA.\n\n\n\n\nVELA, Justice, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the majority’s opinion with respect to its holding that the trial court did not err in sustaining TxDOT’s plea to the\njurisdiction as to Sefzik’s due process and due course of law claims. I, too, would hold that the trial court did not err in\nsustaining TxDOT’s plea to the jurisdiction as to these claims. I would also hold that the trial court did not err in granting\nTxDOT’s plea to the jurisdiction with respect to Sefzik’s claims under the UJDA and the APA.\n\n\n\nI. The Texas Administrative Procedure Act\n\nFirst, Sefzik urges that the trial court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Texas Administrative Procedure Act. TEX. GOV’T\nCODE ANN. § 2001.038 (Vernon 2000). The statute provides that the validity or applicability of a rule ... may be determined\nin an action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged that the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or\nthreatens to interfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the plaintiff. Id. While Sefzik urges that he is seeking to\ndetermine the “applicability” of a rule, in fact, the entire APA is the “rule” he seeks to be “applied” to TxDOT’s\npermit-application process.\n\nBy its plain language, section 2001.038 allows a plaintiff to challenge either the validity or applicability of agency rules. Star\nHouston, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Transp., 957 S.W.2d 102, 111 (Tex.App.–Austin 1997, writ denied). To qualify for a\ndeclaratory judgment, one must seek validation or application of a rule. That same rule must interfere with or impair a legal\nright or privilege before it can be applied. Sefzik’s claim is that it is the permit application process, as addressed in the\nadministrative code, that interferes with or impairs his legal right or privilege. The APA does not. Rather, the APA, if\napplied, would expand rather than interfere or impair Sefzik’s right to judicial review. *139 Because Sefzik seeks to apply\nthe APA to his claim even though he claims that it is the administrative code that impairs his purported legal right or\nprivilege, he misapplies the explicit language of section 2001.038. I would hold that Sefzik is not entitled to relief under\nsection 2001.038.\n\n\n\nII. Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA)\n\nThe UDJA enables a person whose “rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance,\ncontract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute,\nordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.004(a) (Vernon 1997) (UDJA). At the very least, it is Sefzik’s burden to establish his right\nto declaratory relief in order to establish jurisdiction. In other words, Sefzik must show that his rights, status or legal relations\nhave been affected.\n\nSection 21.159 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) explicitly denies a permit or license holder contractual or property\nrights from the issuance of a permit or license. It states, “Issuance of a permit or license shall not be deemed to create a\ncontract or property right in the permit holder or license holder.” 43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 21.159 (2008) (Tex. Dep’t of\nTransp., Property Right Not Created). Thus, to conclude that Sefzik, as an applicant for a permit, has a property or\ncontractual right when the statute denies those rights to an actual permit holder is not logical. Because section 21.159 of the\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               9\n\fSefzik v. Texas Dept. of Transp., 267 S.W.3d 127 (2008)\n\n\n\nadministrative code precludes Sefzik from claiming any contractual right, he has no right, status or “legal relation” as defined\nby case law. See 43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 21.159. Thus, Sefzik does not have a status or legal relation as required by\nsection 37.004 of the UDJA sufficient to bring his complaint within the court’s power to declare rights, status, and other legal\nrelations. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.003(a) (Vernon 1999).\n\nIf the UDJA were construed as Sefzik insists it should be, any suit brought affecting a governmental entity would require its\nparticipation as a party and would effectively waive the State’s immunity. This would defeat the legislative intent that\nstatutes be construed as written and would destroy “the legislature’s interest in managing state fiscal matters through the\nappropriations process.” TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 311.034 (Vernon Supp.2007).\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, I would hold that the trial court is without subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n267 S.W.3d 127\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The dispute in this class\naction centers on whether the private school exemption includes children who are taught at home, in a bona fide manner, a\ncurriculum designed to meet certain basic education goals, including a study of good citizenship. The district court construed\nthe exemption to include such children and permanently enjoined all school districts and their attendance officers from\nenforcing the compulsory attendance law based upon any other reading of § 21.033(a)(1).

No more than ten percent of\nschool-age children attended public schools, according *434 to the uncontradicted evidence at trial, and as there were few\nprivate and parochial schools in the State, many children were taught at home.\n\nPublic school attendance was not mandatory in Texas until 1916. The first compulsory attendance law, enacted the prior year,\nrequired children between eight and fourteen years of age to attend public school for 60 days during the 1916–1917 school\nyear, 80 days the following year, and 100 days each year afterward. Act of March 8, 1915, 34th Leg., R.S., ch. 49, § 1, 1915\nTex.Gen.Laws 92, 93. Parents (and persons acting as parents) were responsible for assuring that children complied. Id. § 9, at\n96–97. Failure to discharge this responsibility was a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, unless the person in the parental role\ncould not control the child. Id. A child who refused to attend school could be disciplined by the juvenile court as a habitual\ntruant. Id. The statute authorized appointment of attendance officers to enforce its provisions. Id. §§ 6–7, at 94–95.\n\nOver the years the details of these statutory provisions have changed, but the basic structure remains in place.1 Now children\nfrom about six to seventeen years of age must attend public school at least 170 days each school term. TEX.EDUC.CODE §\n21.032(a).2 A parent or person in that role who has been warned in writing to require a child to comply with the compulsory\nattendance law, and who fails to do so, may be fined, and a child’s refusal to attend school may be sanctioned by the juvenile\ncourt.

See Act of May 18, 1993,\n         73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 358, § 2, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 1528, 1629–30; Act of May 28, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 347, § 6.01, 1993\n         Tex.Gen.Laws 1479, 1527–28; Act of May 29, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 930, § 1, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 3949, 3950. None of\n         these amendments are important to the issues in this case.\n\n\n\n4\n       “Conduct indicating a need for supervision is ... the unexcused voluntary absence of a child on 10 or more days or parts of days\n       within a six-month period or three or more days or parts of days within a four-week period from school without the consent of his\n       parents....”\n\n\n\n5\n       “[A] petition requesting termination of the parent-child relationship with respect to a parent who is not the petitioner may be\n       granted if the court finds that ... the parent has ... been the major cause of ... the failure of the child to be enrolled in school as\n       required by the Texas Education Code....”\n\n\n\nThe first compulsory attendance statute exempted several classes of children from compliance, including “[a]ny child in\nattendance upon a private or parochial school or who is being properly instructed by a private tutor.” Act of March 8, 1915,\n34th Leg., R.S., ch. 49, § 2(a), 1915 Tex.Gen.Laws 92, 93. This provision was amended in 1923 to add two requirements for\nprivate and parochial schools and to remove the reference to private tutors, so that the statute was changed to exempt:\n\n            Any child in attendance upon a private or parochial school which shall include in its course a study of\n            good citizenship, and shall make the English language the basis of instruction in all subjects....\n\nAct approved March 23, 1923, 38th Leg., R.S., ch. 121, § 2, 1923 Tex.Gen.Laws 255, 255. At the time, according to all the\nevidence presented in this case, a child pursuing a bona fide course of study at home designed to meet the basic education\ngoals of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and good citizenship was considered to be attending a private school. Thus,\nthe 1923 amendment to the exemption, omitting the reference to private tutors, did not affect children schooled at home. The\nonly other times the exemption was amended was in 1969 and 1971, when the English language restriction was first moved\nand then dropped. See Act of May 7, 1969, 61st Leg., R.S., ch. 289, § 1–3, 1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 871, 871; Act of May 20,\n1971, 62nd Leg., R.S., ch. 405, § 40, 1971 Tex.Gen.Laws 1449, 1513. The exemption, as we noted at the outset, is now\ncodified as § 21.033(a)(1), TEX.EDUC.CODE.\n\nEnactment of the compulsory attendance law in 1915 did not end home schooling; some children continued to be educated at\nhome just as they had before. The important fact, for purposes of analysis of the legal issues before us, is that some\nschool-age children have been educated at home since before the compulsory attendance law was passed in 1915, and the\nState never attempted to prohibit or even restrict home schooling, or to allege a violation of the compulsory attendance law\nbased solely on a child’s being taught at home, until 1981.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 390\n\nThat year, a staff attorney for the Texas Education Agency advised an assistant superintendent for one school district that\n“home instruction is not one of the enumerated exemptions” to the compulsory attendance law.6 He added:\n\n6\n        The Texas Education Agency is actually the Central Education Agency, which is composed of the State Board of Education, the\n        State Board for Vocational Education, the commissioner of education, and the State Department of Education. TEX.EDUC.CODE\n        § 11.01. The State Board of Education and the State Board for Vocational Education are identical. Id. § 11.24. The SBOE, which\n        has fifteen members elected from districts in the state, is responsible for implementing legislative policy for the public school\n        system. Id. §§ 11.2101, 11.24. The commissioner of education is the executive officer of the TEA and the SBOE. Id. §§ 11.25,\n        11.52. The State Department of Education is the professional, technical and clerical staff of the TEA. Id. § 11.61.\n\n\n\n\n    In order to avoid the sanctions of compulsory attendance, home instruction would, *436 most likely, have to be qualified\n    as a private school. Unfortunately, there are no provisions in the law which define a private school for these purposes.\n\n      ... [A]s a result of the present status of the law and as a result of the general absence of legislative guidance in this area,\n      school districts and parents alike would be well advised to proceed with caution in this area. In light of all this\n      confusion, it would appear that the courts would be the proper forms [sic] in which to evaluate any particular home\n      study situation as a prospective exemption from compulsory attendance.\n\n    The following year the TEA’s assistant general counsel expressed an even stronger position in response to an inquiry by\n    parents considering home schooling:\n\n      The compulsory student attendance laws of the State of Texas do not permit students to be taught at home.... The\n      exemption statute provides that a child in attendance upon a private or parochial school which shall include in its course\n      a study of good citizenship is exempt from the requirements of compulsory attendance. There is no exemption for home\n      tutorial programs.\n\n      ... A school, whether private, public, or parochial, must include retained and qualified teachers; a collection of students\n      from different families; a curriculum that includes the basic academics as are taught in public schools; and some\n      organizational structure that assures that instruction does, in fact, occur.\n\n       The continuous policy of this office is based upon much more than a cursory review of the statutes. All of our legal\n       research concludes that a person may not teach their children at home simply by calling their home a private school. If\n       educational programs conducted in a home environment are to be allowed as exemption to the compulsory attendance\n       law, action of the Legislature will be required.\nThe Legislature took no action, although a number of bills were introduced in 1985.7 That same year, the Texas Education\nAgency issued a publication entitled HOUSE BILL 72 AND SUBSEQUENT EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION:\nCOMPREHENSIVE REFERENCES AND EXPLANATIONS, which included a section devoted to the compulsory\nattendance law, even though that law was not affected by House Bill 72 or any subsequent educational legislation. For the\nfirst time, the TEA published its interpretation of the private school exemption:\n\n7\n        Tex.H.B. 29, 69th Leg., R.S. (1985) (requiring home educators to register, provide at least 170 days of instruction, and maintain\n        attendance and immunization records, and requiring students not to score below the district average on annual tests); Tex.H.B. 431,\n        69th Leg., R.S. (1985) (exempting persons from compulsory attendance law based upon sincerely held religious belief); Tex.H.B.\n        673, 69th Leg., R.S. (1985) (exempting children schooled by parents from compulsory attendance law). None of these bills were\n        reported out of committee. House Bill 317, which attempted to amend § 4.25(a) of the Education Code by removing parents and\n        guardians of home schooled students from the class of individuals subject to criminal sanctions for violating the compulsory\n        attendance law, was reported out of committee but defeated on the House floor, apparently for fear that the provision would\n        establish a precedent for regulation of home schools. Tex.H.B. 317, 69th Leg., R.S. (1985).\n\n\n\n\n    It is the agency’s interpretation that under this compulsory attendance law, private school attendance is an acceptable\n    substitute for public school attendance. However, educating a child at home is not the same as private school instruction\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 390\n\n    and, therefore, not an acceptable substitute.\n\n      If a school district knows of a situation in which a school age student is not being educated in compliance with\n      compulsory attendance statutes, the district should file charges against the parent under the compulsory attendance law.\n\n      *437 Correspondence courses are not a legal substitute for attendance at a public or private school.\n\n   TEX.EDUC.AGENCY, House Bill 72 and Subsequent Educational Legislation: COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCES\n   AND EXPLANATIONS 213 (1985).\nAlthough the Commissioner of Education testified that the TEA never changed its policy refusing to exempt home schooled\nstudents from the compulsory attendance law, the fact remains that there is no evidence of such policy prior to 1981. Nor\nwere the policy statements from 1981–1985 made after hearings or other proceedings before the TEA. Most importantly, the\nTEA itself now concedes in its briefs and oral argument before this Court that its interpretation of the private school\nexemption, beginning in 1981 and restated in its 1985 publication, was “anomalous”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   B\n\nBased upon the TEA’s policy statements from 1981–1985, school districts and their attendance officers began prosecuting\nviolations of the compulsory attendance law based upon nothing other than the fact that a child was being schooled at home.\nIn all, some 150 prosecutions were initiated, and about 80 of them were actually tried. The State’s position in those\nprosecutions was that a home school was never a private school within the meaning of the statutory exemption, §\n21.033(a)(1), and never exempt from the compulsory attendance law.\n\nTo halt the State’s enforcement of this policy, this class action was filed in March 1985. The district court certified three\nplaintiff classes: one comprised of parents, another of private schools who furnish curricula for home schools, and the third of\nother providers of home school curricula. Specifically, the district court defined the first class as those parents—\n\n              who either [a] have enrolled their school-age children in private or parochial schools outside their\n              homes receiving the curricula and instruction of these schools in their homes which includes in the\n              course a study of good citizenship or [b] have established a private school in their homes which\n              involves in its course a study of good citizenship.\n\nNine married couples with school-age children were named as representatives of the class.8 Two of the couples had been\nprosecuted for violating the compulsory attendance law, based upon the TEA’s 1981 policy, and two others had been\nthreatened with prosecution.9 The second class included the Calvert School, Inc., the First Baptist Academy of Dallas,\nChristian Liberty Academy Satellite Schools, and others “who have established private or parochial schools where the\nstudents receive their curricula including a study of good citizenship and instruction in their homes.” The third class consisted\nof Reform Publications, Inc. d/b/a Basic Education, American Christian Schools, Inc., and others “who provide curricula\nincluding in their courses a study of good citizenship and instruction for private schools in homes.” The Home School Legal\nDefense Association was named as an individual plaintiff.\n\n8\n         The class representatives were Gary W. and Cheryl Leeper, Bruce and Patricia Smythe, Calvin E. and Wanda Minkler, Quinten T.\n         and Sandra Parten Jr., Tony and Suzanne Martinez, Charles and Corlee Kent, John W. and Helen Jackson Jr., Michael R. and Sally\n         K. Galbraith, and Richard and Kay Wells.\n\n\n\n9\n         The Galbraiths and Wells were actually prosecuted; the Leepers and Minklers received letters from school officials threatening\n         prosecution.\n\n\n\nThe district court also certified a defendant class comprised of all “public school districts and their school attendance\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hart.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs contended that defendants had misinterpreted the private school exemption and sought a declaration to that effect\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011. Plaintiffs also claimed that\ndefendants’ enforcement of the compulsory attendance law infringed upon their constitutional rights, in violation of the\nfederal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs sought an injunction prohibiting all school districts and attendance\nofficers from enforcing the compulsory attendance law against bona fide home schools. Plaintiffs also claimed attorney fees.\n\nConsistent with the TEA’s 1985 statement of policy, the Attorney General in his original answer in this suit specifically\ndenied that a home school could be a private school within the meaning of § 21.033(a)(1). No other defendant adopted this\nposition, however, and the Attorney General himself abandoned it in later pleadings. About a year after the suit was filed, on\nApril 12, 1986, the State Board of Education issued a resolution calling upon the Legislature to define the private and\nparochial school exemption and recommending that school districts follow new standards in applying the exemption pending\nlegislative action.11 That resolution stated:\n\n11\n         As noted above, supra n. 6, the SBOE is the component of the TEA charged with implementing legislative policy.\n\n\n\n\n     WHEREAS the State Board of Education has been requested by various parties to define the terms “private or parochial\n     school” as contained in Article 21.033 of the Texas Education Code; and\n\n       WHEREAS the legal authority of the State Board of Education to make such definition has been questioned by various\n       entities, including, we are advised, the Texas Legislative Council;\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, the State Board of Education urges the Texas Legislature either to define such terms or\n       specifically to authorize the State Board of Education to do so at its regular session in 1987.\n\n       The State Board of Education further recommends to the various school districts of Texas that the following guidelines\n       may be utilized in determining whether an entity is a private or parochial school for the purposes of Article 21.033\n       pending the action of the Texas legislature:\n\n         (1) An entity that is accredited by an accrediting organization recognized by the Commissioner of Education, or\n\n         (2) An entity that meets the following criteria:\n\n            a. It instructs students in facilities that comply with applicable local fire and sanitation codes;\n\n            b. It has a written regular plan of instruction sufficient to meet basic student educational goals;\n\n            c. Its students shall annually be administered a recognized nationally norm-referenced standard achievement test.\n            Evidence of such administration and the results thereof shall be furnished upon request to the attendance officer for\n            the public school district in which the private or parochial school is located. The local school district may require\n            that the next administration of such achievement test be by qualified test administrator, or\n\n         (3) An entity that furnishes evidence satisfactory to the attendance officer of the school district in which the private or\n         parochial school is located, that it meets the criteria required by the Commissioner of Education for an entity to be\n         accredited by a recognized accrediting organization under (1) of this section.\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 390\n\n     The above guidelines will not be interpreted in such a manner as to interfere with the exercise of religious freedom\n     guaranteed by the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n\n   *439 Defendants contended that the 1986 resolution—to which the Legislature chose not to respond—mooted plaintiffs’\n   complaints, for reasons we consider in detail below. The district court rejected this contention.\nShortly after the SBOE issued the 1986 resolution, the parties to this action notified the members of the various classes that\nthey had reached agreement concerning the proper construction of § 21.033(a)(1). That construction was to be effectuated by\nan agreed interlocutory judgment of the district court which provided in part as follows:\n\n            Accordingly, the Court declares that a school-aged child residing in the State of Texas who is regularly\n            and diligently pursuing in the child’s home a written curriculum of either a private or parochial school\n            in which the child is enrolled which exists apart from the child’s home or which has been obtained\n            from other sources, said curriculum following a regular plan of instruction designed to meet basic\n            educational goals of reading, language arts, mathematics and a study of good citizenship, is considered\n            to be in attendance upon a private or parochial school within the meaning of [§ 21.033(a)(1) ]. The\n            Court further finds that the current curricula of [the named representatives of the second and third\n            plaintiff classes] are written curricula following a regular plan of instruction designed to meet basic\n            educational goals of reading, language arts, mathematics and a study of good citizenship. This finding\n            is made so that the school attendance officers of the public school districts in the State of Texas will be\n            able to identify a curriculum for a school-aged child at home who is considered to be in attendance\n            upon a private or parochial school. The Court also finds that if parents or those standing in the parental\n            relationship to such a child furnish to any public school attendance officer upon his written request the\n            results of a nationally normed standard achievement test which was given in accordance with the\n            instructions accompanying the test and was taken within the preceding twelve (12) months of the\n            written request showing that the child is making reasonable academic progress for that child, then this\n            furnishing shall establish that the child is regularly and diligently pursuing the curriculum being taken.\n\nThe agreement did not encompass plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief, damages and attorney fees. In response to the notice\nto the classes, a number of members of the first class of plaintiffs appeared before the district court and objected to the\nproposed agreed judgment. Consequently, the named plaintiffs withdrew from the agreement, and the proposed judgment was\nnever presented to the district court.\n\nFollowing trial before the bench, the district court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. One portion of that judgment\ndeclared the proper construction of the private school exemption in § 21.033(a)(1). We quote the district court’s declaration,\ninserting divisions among its components:\n\na school-age child\n\n     • residing in the State of Texas who is pursuing under the direction of a parent or parents or one standing in parental\n     authority in or through the child’s home\n\n     • in a bona fide (good faith, not a sham or subterfuge) manner\n\n     • a curriculum consisting of books, workbooks, other written materials, including that which appears on an electronic\n     screen of either a computer or video tape monitor, or any combination of the preceding from either (1) of a private or\n     parochial school which exists apart from the child’s home or (2) which has been developed or obtained from any source,\n\n     • said curriculum designed to meet basic education goals of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and a study of\n     good citizenship,\n\n  is in attendance upon a private or parochial school within the meaning of Section 21.033(a)(1) of the Texas Education\n  Code and exempt from the requirements of compulsory attendance at a public school.\n\nThe court’s judgment further provided:\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The lawful powers of investigation by\n            public school attendance officers and the constitutional rights of persons subject to such investigations\n            are not affected by this judgment.\n\nThis construction of § 21.033(a)(1), and the use of standardized tests as one indicia of compliance, are essentially the same\nprovisions to which the parties agreed prior to trial before plaintiffs withdrew their consent.\n\nThe district court also held that children of the named representatives of the parent class and children studying materials\nprovided by the named plaintiff institutions at home in a bona fide manner were exempt from the compulsory attendance law.\nThe district court determined that any enforcement of the policy in the 1985 publication or the recommendation in the 1986\nresolution would violate plaintiffs’ due process and equal protection rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions.\nThe court permanently enjoined all school districts and attendance officers from initiating charges of violations of the\ncompulsory attendance law based upon any construction of § 21.033(a)(1) other than that contained in the court’s declaratory\njudgment. Finally, the court awarded plaintiffs attorney fees against the school districts, but not against any of the other\ndefendants.\n\nThe court of appeals concluded that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under the state declaratory judgments act because the\ncompulsory attendance law is penal. 843 S.W.2d at 48. The court based this conclusion on the rule that the constitutionality\nof a criminal statute cannot be determined, and its enforcement enjoined, in a civil proceeding absent a showing of irreparable\ninjury to plaintiffs’ property rights, which has not been attempted in this case. Id.; see State v. Morales, 869 S.W.2d 941\n(Tex.1994). The court did not explain why this rule should apply to the private school exemption in § 21.033(a)(1), which is\na civil statute distinct from the enforcement provisions of § 4.25, or why the rule should preclude a construction of §\n21.033(a)(1) without reference to its constitutionality. The court of appeals did hold, however, that plaintiffs had\ndemonstrated a violation of their constitutional rights to equal protection, and were therefore entitled to all the relief awarded\nby the district court under the federal Civil Rights Act. 843 S.W.2d at 48–51. In the course of its analysis the court concluded\nthat the district court properly construed the private school exemption. Id. at 51–52.\n\nWe granted writ of error to review the correctness of the district court’s construction of the private school exemption, the\npropriety of injunctive relief, and the award of attorney fees to plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                               II\n\nBefore we turn to the central issues in the case, we must address three jurisdictional issues raised by defendants: whether\nplaintiffs’ action was mooted by the SBOE’s 1986 resolution; whether plaintiffs seek to construe and enjoin enforcement of a\ncriminal statute over which a civil district court lacked jurisdiction; and whether the TEA’s 1986 resolution regarding the\nprivate school exemption is an administrative rulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                A\n[1]\n  Defendants contend that plaintiffs’ complaints are directed against the TEA’s 1985 policy statement which defendants now\nadmit was “anomalous” and which the TEA has abandoned. Defendants argue that plaintiffs meet the standard the SBOE\nadopted in its 1986 resolution and thus can no longer complain of the TEA’s enforcement of the compulsory attendance law.\n\n*441 Although there is language in the court of appeals’ opinion to suggest that the named individual plaintiffs in the action\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 390\n\nwould meet the standard adopted in the 1986 resolution, 843 S.W.2d at 51–52, the evidence does not bear this out. The first\nrequirement of the 1986 resolution is that the facilities where students are instructed—i.e., plaintiffs’ homes—comply with\napplicable local fire and sanitation codes. There is no evidence that the nine couples named in the action instruct their\nchildren in homes that comply with applicable local fire and sanitation codes (or, for that matter, of what those codes require\nof homes). The third requirement of the 1986 resolution is that students be given nationally norm-referenced standard\nachievement tests annually. According to the evidence at trial, only one of the nine plaintiff couples met this requirement.\nEight of the plaintiff parents testified that they had tested their children at least once, but two testified that they would not do\nso again because they know without tests how their children are progressing. There is no evidence whether one of the nine\ncouples did or did not give their children achievement tests. Plaintiffs oppose making either of these factors—compliance\nwith building codes or administration of achievement tests—essential to qualification for the private school exemption. With\nrespect to the second requirement of the 1986 resolution—a written plan of instruction sufficient to meet basic student\neducational goals—plaintiffs agreed that some plan was important but that it did not always need to be written. Moreover, it\nis not clear whether plaintiffs and the TEA would agree on what are basic student educational goals.\n\nIn sum, plaintiffs and defendants do not agree on when home schooled children should be exempt from the compulsory\nattendance law. Plaintiffs contend that the 1986 resolution does not correctly construe § 21.033(a)(1); defendants disagree. A\ncase is moot when there is no actual controversy between the parties. City of West University Place v. Martin, 132 Tex. 354,\n123 S.W.2d 638, 639 (1939). The disagreement among the parties in this case is not academic or abstract; it is real and affects\nthe rights and interests of all parties. The case is clearly not moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 B\n[2] [3]\n     Defendants argue, and the court of appeals concluded, that the district court had no jurisdiction to construe and enjoin\nenforcement of § 21.033(a)(1) in a civil proceeding because it is a criminal statute. Defendants and the appeals court are\ncorrect that, as a rule, a party cannot seek to construe or enjoin enforcement of a criminal statute in a civil proceeding without\na showing of irreparable injury to the party’s vested property rights, which showing is absent here. See State v. Morales, 869\nS.W.2d 941 (Tex.1994). However, the rule does not apply in this case because § 21.033(a)(1) is not a criminal statute.\n\nIt clearly is not a criminal statute on its face, and defendants do not argue that it is; rather, they argue that it is in effect a\ndefense to prosecution under § 4.25, which clearly is a criminal statute, and that the general compulsory attendance provision,\n§ 21.032(a), the exemptions, § 21.033, and the enforcement provision, § 4.25, should all be read together as parts of a penal\nprovision. That the three statutes must be read together cannot be denied: it is impossible to determine whether a fine should\nbe imposed under § 4.25 without determining whether the subject child is exempt from attending public schools under §\n21.033. That fact alone, however, does not dictate that a statute which is not criminal on its face must be considered part of\none that is, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of civil courts to construe.\n\nIf the sole function of § 21.033 were to define the elements of the offense proscribed by § 4.25, or the elements of a defense\nto prosecution, the question whether § 21.033 is penal would be much closer. As it is, § 21.033 serves a function unrelated to\nprosecution under § 4.25. It is part of the basis for determining whether a child who is not in attendance in public school is\nsubject to supervision under § 51.03 of the Family Code, *442 and whether a parent of the child may have his or her parental\nrights terminated for failing to enroll the child in school under § 15.02 of the Family Code. Not only is § 21.033 on its face a\ncivil statute, it also has civil consequences. Defendants cite no authority for treating a statute like § 21.033 as a criminal\nstatute.\n[4]\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs have foregone any claim to relief under the declaratory judgment statutes because they did\nnot perfect an appeal to this Court from the court of appeals’ adverse ruling on this issue. Such an appeal, however, was\nunnecessary. The appellate court’s judgment upheld plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, albeit on the basis\nof § 1983 and not state law. Since plaintiffs prevailed in the court of appeals, they are entitled to support that court’s\njudgment by any argument, including those that the appellate court rejected. They need not perfect a separate application for\nwrit of error unless they wish to obtain from this Court a different and more favorable judgment. See Donwerth v.

J. 390\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to construe § 21.033(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      C\n[5]\n   Defendants argue that the SBOE’s 1986 resolution is an administrative rulemaking which, under the Administrative\nProcedure Act [“the APA”], can be challenged only by appeal to a district court in Travis County. TEX.GOV’T CODE §\n2001.038.12 The recommendation contained in the resolution, defendants argue, fits squarely within the statutory definition of\nan administrative rule: “a state agency statement of general applicability that ... implements, interprets, or prescribes law or\npolicy....” Id. § 2001.003(6)(A)(i). Plaintiffs respond that the Legislature has not authorized the SBOE to make rules\nconstruing private schools generally or § 21.033(a)(1) in particular. Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that the 1986 resolution\ncannot be a rule because it does not say it is a rule and the SBOE made no attempt in issuing it to comply with the notice and\nhearing requirements for rulemaking proceedings. Defendants answer that plaintiffs’ arguments are precisely the sort of\ncomplaints that § 2001.038 of the APA requires to be raised in a district court in Travis County. Defendants also argue that\nplaintiffs were required to raise their complaints within two years of the issuance of the 1986 resolution under § 2001.035 of\nthe APA.13\n\n12\n       The law governing administrative rulemaking in 1986, TEX.REV.CIV.STAt.Ann. ART. 6252–13A, HAS SINCE BEEN\n       RECODIFIED AS CHAPTER 2001 OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CASE THE REPEALED\n       PROVISIONS ARE IDENTICAL TO THE RECODIFIED PROVISIONS, AND WE REFER TO THE LATTER.\n         Section 2001.038 provides in pertinent part:\n         “(a) The validity or applicability of a rule ... may be determined in an action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged that the rule\n         or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the\n         plaintiff.\n         “(b) The action may be brought only in a Travis County district court.”\n\n\n\n13\n       “(a) A rule adopted after January 1, 1976, is not valid unless a state agency adopts it in substantial compliance with Sections\n       2001.023 through 2001.034 [prescribing notice, hearing, and other requirements].\n                    “(b) A person must initiate a proceeding to contest a rule on the ground of noncompliance with the\n                    procedural requirements of Sections 2001.023 through 2001.034 not later than the second anniversary of\n                    the effective date of the rule.”\n\n\n\nIn effect, defendants argue that although the SBOE did not treat the 1986 resolution as a rule at the time, and did not follow\nany of the procedures prescribed by statute for adopting rules, the resolution is a rule which can be challenged only in a\nTravis County District Court, and the time for complaining about the total lack of any rulemaking procedures has passed. At\nbest, this argument is disingenuous. On its face, the resolution is little more than an urging to the Legislature to further define\nthe private and parochial *443 school exemption in § 21.033(a)(1). It goes no further than to “recommend[ ] to the various\nschool districts ... guidelines ... pending the action of the Texas legislature”. It even recites that the SBOE’s authority to\ndefine “private or parochial school” has been challenged by various entities, among them the Texas Legislative Council. As\nthe SBOE is charged with implementing legislative policy, an opinion of the Legislative Council that the SBOE lacked\nauthority to clarify § 21.033(a)(1) would appear to be entitled to considerable weight.14 The SBOE offers no explanation why,\nif it thought the resolution was an agency rule in 1986, it made no effort to comply with the requirements of the APA before\nthe resolution issued.\n\n14\n       The Texas Legislative Council is a legislative agency composed of the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of\n       Representatives, the chairs of the Senate and House administration committees, four other senators, and nine other representatives.\n       TEX.GOV’T CODE § 323.001(a)-(b). Among the powers of the Council are to “study and investigate the functions and problems\n       of state departments, agencies, and officers”.

As noted above, the APA applies only to statements of general applicability that implement, interpret or\nprescribe law or policy. The 1986 resolution was not such a statement. It urged action by the Legislature and recommended\nguidelines to school districts. The guidelines were only recommended, not prescriptive, and they did not purport to\nimplement or interpret § 21.033(a)(1) or agency policy, but only to provide direction pending action by the Legislature. In\nthese circumstances, defendants’ argument that the 1986 resolution constitutes a rule is plainly incorrect.15\n\n15\n       Cf. 1 KENNETH CULP DAVIS & RICHARD J. PIERCE, JR., ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE § 6.2 (3d ed. 1994)\n       (distinguishing statements to which federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, does and does not apply); 3 BASIL J.\n       MEZINES, JACOB A.

Defendants acknowledge, contrary to their position from 1981–1986, that a\nhome school can be a private school within the meaning of § 21.033(a)(1). Plaintiffs do not contend that every home school\nfalls within the exemption, but only, as the district court held, homes in which children are taught in a bona fide manner from\na curriculum designed to meet basic education goals. Plaintiffs also do not contend that the use of standard achievement tests\ncannot be considered in ascertaining whether a home school is being taught in a bona fide manner; they argue only, again as\nthe district court held, that the use of such tests cannot be the determining factor.\n\nThe evidence in support of the district court’s construction of § 21.033(a)(1) is virtually undisputed. Defendants do not deny\nthat from 1916 to 1981 students in bona fide home schools were not prosecuted for violation of the compulsory attendance\nlaw. Defendants also concede that the TEA’s policy from 1981–1986, that no home school could be a private school within\nthe meaning of § 21.033(a)(1), was wrong. Defendants acknowledge the right of parents to teach their children at home and\nthe efficacy of that means of education when it is conducted in a bona fide manner. Defendants were willing to agree before\ntrial to essentially the same construction of § 21.033(a)(1) as the district court eventually reached. Defendants argue even\nnow that the nine plaintiff couples come within the “private school” exemption from the compulsory attendance law, even\nthough there is no evidence that they have met two of the elements prescribed by the 1986 resolution. From the record before\nus, we conclude that the district court’s declaration of the meaning of “private school” in *444 § 21.033(a)(1), as it relates to\nhome schools, is clearly correct.\n\nDefendants argue that the district court’s judgment deprives the SBOE of its proper role in developing policies for the public\nschools. We do not believe that it does. The SBOE has the power and duty to “take actions necessary to implement legislative\npolicy for the public school system of the state.” TEX.EDUC.CODE § 11.24(a). Legislative policy regarding the exemption\nof students in private schools from attendance in public schools is expressed in § 21.033(a)(1). The district court has\nconstrued that provision as it has been understood and applied for most of this century. The SBOE continues to have\nresponsibility for implementing the statutory policy. The SBOE is not authorized, however, to change legislative policy; that\nis the sole province of the Legislature. The Legislature has not accepted the SBOE’s invitation in its 1986 resolution to\nclarify the private school exemption. The Legislature has indicated, however, that it considers home schools to fall within the\nexemption. In amending § 4.25 and other provisions of the Education Code in 1989, the Legislature stated:\n\n            Nothing in this Act applies to students in attendance upon a private or parochial school, which includes\n            home schools, in accordance with Section 21.033, Education Code.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\ndecision we reach does not require that we address this argument today. On the other hand, nothing in our opinion precludes\nthe TEA from setting such guidelines for enforcement of the compulsory attendance law as are within its authority.\nSpecifically, the TEA is not precluded from requesting evidence of achievement test results in determining whether children\nare being taught in a bona fide manner. While administration of such tests cannot be a prerequisite to exemption from the\ncompulsory attendance law, we do not preclude the TEA from giving this factor heavy weight. Should the SBOE choose to\npromulgate additional rules under the Administrative Procedure Act, its authority to do so and the propriety of such rules will\nbe subject to judicial review.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    IV\n\nThe district court awarded plaintiffs costs and attorney fees to be paid by the defendant school districts, but not by any of the\nother defendants.16 The court based its award on a provision of the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act [“the DJA”],\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009, which authorizes the award of such reasonable and necessary attorney fees as are\njust and equitable, and 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The court of appeals affirmed, but only on the basis of § 1988. We conclude that\nthe award of attorney fees was proper under the DJA and do not address § 1988.\n\n16\n       The trial court also concluded that the representative school district fees should not have to bear their attorney fees and expenses\n       alone, and awarded these districts fees from the other districts in the defendant class. The representative districts do not argue that\n       governmental immunity would bar their awards from the other districts.\n\n\n\nThe school districts argue that as a rule they have governmental immunity from liability for attorney fees, and that this\nimmunity is not waived by the DJA. A number of decisions from the courts of appeals have concluded that the DJA does not\nwaive governmental immunity for attorneys fees.17 At *445 least one appellate court has concluded that the Act does waive\ngovernmental immunity from an award of attorney fees and costs for a municipality, insofar as the Act defines “person” as\nincluding municipalities, requires municipalities to be joined in actions involving the validity of an ordinance, and allows\nawards of attorney fees and costs without any indication of an intent to exempt municipalities.18 Several other cases affirm\nattorney fee awards against governmental entities without any discussion of sovereign immunity.19\n\n17\n       See Dallas Area Rapid Transit v.

Collin County, 692 S.W.2d 454\n(Tex.1985), a declaratory judgment action involving a property tax dispute, we considered whether the trial court had abused\nits discretion in refusing to award attorney fees against various governmental entities and concluded that it had not. We did\nnot suggest that the taxing units and counties in that case were immune from liability for attorney fees under the DJA. In\nDuncan v. Pogue, 759 S.W.2d 435 (Tex.1988), rev’g 753 S.W.2d 255 (Tex.App.—Tyler 1988), without mentioning\ngovernmental immunity, we concluded that the trial court acted within its discretion in awarding attorney fees against the\ncounty commissioners’ court. The court of appeals had held that the DJA does not authorize an award of attorney fees against\na county.\n\nIn other cases we have awarded attorney fees against governmental entities based upon other statutes. In Texas State\nEmployees Union v. Texas Dep’t of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, 746 S.W.2d 203 (Tex.1987), the award of fees\nwas based on provisions covering damages, costs, and fees adjudged in a cause of action for the deprivation of a right,\nprivilege or immunity secured by the constitution or laws of this State or the United States, against state employees, officers\nor governing board members who acted in the course or scope of their employment. TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§\n104.001–.003 (now providing for indemnification up to specified amounts).20 In Camarena v.

TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 106.001–.002. In Lee v.\nCity of Houston, 807 S.W.2d 290 (Tex.1991), the district court granted declaratory relief and attorney fees, and the court of\nappeals reversed. We reversed the appellate court’s holding on the merits and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of\njudgment consistent with our opinion, without addressing the availability of attorney fees. In a subsequent original\nproceeding to enforce the Court’s judgment, Lee v. Downey, 842 S.W.2d 646, 649 (Tex.1992), the Court directed the trial\ncourt to award attorney fees and indicated that the award was authorized by TEX.LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 143.015, which\nallows attorney fees in appeals from decisions of the Fire Fighters’ and Police Officers’ Civil Service Commission.21\n\n20\n       We note that although the trial court found that the TEA had acted in bad faith, it did not find that any individual acted in bad faith,\n       and concluded that no attorney fees, expenses or costs shall be borne by any school attendance officer or individual defendant.\n\n\n\n21\n       A dissenting opinion on rehearing, in which the author of this opinion joined, expressed the view that the DJA does not waive\n       governmental immunity for an award of attorney fees. 842 S.W.2d at 654 n. 4 (Gonzalez, J., dissenting on rehearing).\n\n\n\nThe DJA is a remedial enactment which allows courts to declare relief, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed, to\n“settle and afford relief with respects to rights, status, and other legal relations”. Id. §§ 37.002, .003(a). A person “whose\nrights, *446 status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have\ndetermined any question of construction or validity arising under the statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a\ndeclaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Id. § 37.004(a). All persons who have or claim any interest\nthat would be affected by the declaration must be made parties; those not made a party are not prejudiced by any declaration.\nId. § 37.006(a). If the validity of a municipal ordinance or franchise is involved, a municipality must be made a party, and if a\nstatute, ordinance, or franchise is alleged to be unconstitutional, the attorney general must be served with a copy of the\nproceeding and is entitled to be heard. Id. § 37.006(b). The Act specifically authorizes an award of “costs and reasonable and\nnecessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.” Id. § 37.009.\n[7]\n   The DJA expressly provides that persons may challenge ordinances or statutes, and that governmental entities must be\njoined or notified. Governmental entities joined as parties may be bound by a court’s declaration on their ordinances or\nstatutes. The Act thus contemplates that governmental entities may be—indeed, must be—joined in suits to construe their\nlegislative pronouncements. These provisions provide the context for the Act’s authorization, in § 37.009, of attorney fee\nawards. We conclude that by authorizing declaratory judgment actions to construe the legislative enactments of governmental\nentities and authorizing awards of attorney fees, the DJA necessarily waives governmental immunity for such awards.\n\nThe school districts complain that the award of fees was not properly adjudicated against them, in that plaintiffs’ claims were\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 390\n\nprimarily directed against the state defendants. We note, however, that the district court directed the award to be paid by the\nTEA from funds designated for public school districts. The school districts also complain about the inclusion of various items\nin the district court’s award. They argue that plaintiffs were required to segregate time spent on temporary injunctive relief\nand the non-federal claims on which plaintiffs did not prevail. The record reflects that all plaintiffs’ attorneys’ time was spent\non issues related to the declaratory relief which was granted. The school districts also argue that some items of expenses and\ncosts were not recoverable. We conclude, however, that the districts have failed to show reversible error.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the district court’s award of attorney fees was authorized by the DJA and was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 V\n[8]\n   The district court enjoined defendants from enforcing the compulsory attendance law contrary to the construction set out in\nthe court’s judgment. There is no indication, however, that defendants will attempt to contravene the district court’s\njudgment, or ours. On the contrary, we are confident that defendants will abide by our decision in carrying out their duties.\nAccordingly, we conclude that issuance of a permanent injunction was unnecessary and should be reversed.22\n\n22\n       The school district defendants argue that the classes of plaintiffs and defendants were improperly certified for an award of\n       injunctive relief. Defendants do not make the same argument with respect to the award of declaratory relief. As we have reversed\n       the district court’s injunction, we need not consider whether the classes were properly certified.\n\n\n\nThe lower courts held that defendants had violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and § 1983 of the federal Civil Rights Act.\nAs we have accorded plaintiffs all the relief to which they are entitled under the Declaratory Judgments Act, we do not reach\ntheir constitutional arguments under § 1983. The 1986 resolution acknowledged that home schooling may involve\nconstitutional claims of religious freedom. Our decision today need not, and does not, address such claims.\n\n******\n\nThe judgment of the court of appeals is reversed insofar as it affirms the district court’s permanent injunction. In all other\nrespects the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n*447 GONZALEZ, Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part on motion for rehearing.\n\nMy opinion of June 15, 1994 is withdrawn and this one is substituted in its place. With the exception of the discussion of\nattorneys’ fees and court costs, I join the Court’s opinion and judgment. I dissent, however, from Part IV of the Court’s\nopinion, from the order denying a motion for rehearing, and from that part of the judgment which orders that the plaintiffs\nrecover attorneys’ fees and court costs from the defendants. In this case, the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes an\naward of attorneys’ fees against the defendants in the absence of an express waiver of immunity by the Legislature. The\nCourt errs in ruling that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (DJA), TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011,\nimplicitly waives sovereign immunity so that defendants may be held liable for attorneys’ fees. 893 S.W.2d 432, 445–46\n(Tex.1994). The Court gives the DJA a curious construction that is not supported by logic or well-established precedent and a\nconstruction which has the potential for disastrous effects on school districts and other governmental agencies. I would grant\nthe motion for rehearing and hold that the school districts are not liable for attorneys’ fees under the DJA, but would consider\nwhether they are available under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nI continue to adhere to the principles expressed in my opinion in Lee v. Downey, 842 S.W.2d 646, 655 n. 4 (Tex.1992)\n(Gonzalez, J., dissenting on motion for rehearing). To recover attorneys’ fees in this case, the plaintiffs must show that their\nsuit is an exception to two broad rules. The first rule is that subdivisions of the sovereign are immune from suit. See W.D.\nHaden Co. v. Dodgen, 158 Tex. 74, 308 S.W.2d 838, 839 (1958) (approving the court of appeals’ statement that a suit against\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 390\n\nthe state should be abated “because of the State’s immunity from suits brought without its consent,” 303 S.W.2d 443, 445\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1957)). Only the Legislature may waive sovereign immunity. Guillory v. Port of Houston Auth.,\n845 S.W.2d 812, 813 (Tex.1993); see Barr v. Bernhard, 562 S.W.2d 844, 846 (Tex.1978) (citing Lowe v. Texas Tech Univ.,\n540 S.W.2d 297, 298 (Tex.1976)) (stating, “any waiver of governmental immunity is a matter to be addressed by the\nLegislature.”); Hosner v. DeYoung, 1 Tex. 764, 769 (1847) (holding “No State can be sued in her own Courts without her\nconsent and then only in a manner indicated by that consent.”). Furthermore, the Legislature must use clear and unambiguous\nlanguage to waive immunity. See Guillory, 845 S.W.2d at 813–14 (explaining that waiver exposes the government to\nincreased liability that ultimately the state’s taxpayers bear); Texas Prison Bd. v. Cabeen, 159 S.W.2d 523, 525–28\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Beaumont 1942, writ ref’d) (examining a statute to determine if the Legislature had expressly waived\nsovereign immunity). The second rule is that attorneys’ fees may not be awarded unless prescribed by statute for the\nparticular kind of case. First City Bank v. Guex, 677 S.W.2d 25, 30 (Tex.1984); see Texas Employment Comm’n v.\nCamarena, 710 S.W.2d 665, 670 (Tex.App.—Austin 1986), rev’d on other grounds, 754 S.W.2d 149 (Tex.1988). These rules\nprohibit a court from awarding attorneys’ fees merely because it deems them appropriate. Camarena, 710 S.W.2d at 670.\nThus, in this case, an award of attorneys’ fees would be permissible only if a statute expressly waived sovereign immunity\nand authorized the recovery of attorneys’ fees from the defendant governmental agencies.\n\nThe DJA does not. The DJA waives sovereign immunity insofar as it permits plaintiffs to bring actions in order to construe\nlegislative enactments of governmental entities; it also requires that interested parties, including governmental agencies, be\njoined in these suits. See TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 37.004(a), 37.006. However, the Court confuses this waiver of\nthe government’s immunity from suit with waiver of immunity from liability. See Missouri Pac. R.R. v. Brownsville\nNavigation Dist., 453 S.W.2d 812, 813 (Tex.1970); accord Couch v. Ector County, 860 S.W.2d 659, 661 (Tex.App.—El\nPaso 1993, no writ); Avmanco, Inc. v. City of Grand Prairie, 835 S.W.2d 160, 164–65 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1992, appeal\ndism’d as moot); Dillard v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 806 S.W.2d 589, 592 (Tex.App.—Austin 1991, writ denied). Nowhere\ndoes the DJA expressly *448 authorize this Court to hold a governmental entity liable for attorneys’ fees in a declaratory\njudgment action. See Lee, 842 S.W.2d at 655 n. 4 (Gonzalez, J., dissenting on motion for rehearing); Dallas Area Rapid\nTransit v. Plummer, 841 S.W.2d 870, 875 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1992, writ denied); Waugh v. City of Dallas, 814 S.W.2d 492,\n496–97 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, writ denied); Rodeheaver v. Steigerwald, 807 S.W.2d 790, 793 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 1991, writ denied), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1093, 112 S.Ct. 1167, 117 L.Ed.2d 414 (1992); City of Houston v. De\nTrapani, 771 S.W.2d 703, 708 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1989, writ denied); Texas Dep’t of Human Servs. v.\nMethodist Retirement Servs., Inc., 763 S.W.2d 613, 614 (Tex.App.—Austin 1989, no writ); City of Houston v. Lee, 762\nS.W.2d 180, 188 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988), rev’d on other grounds, 807 S.W.2d 290 (Tex.1991); Camarena,\n710 S.W.2d at 670. For this reason alone, the order that the defendants pay attorneys’ fees is erroneous.\n\nThe Court compounds its error by determining that the DJA implicitly authorizes the plaintiffs’ recovery of attorneys’ fees in\nthis declaratory judgment suit. 893 S.W.2d at 445–46. This holding conflicts with the legislative admonishment that a\n“resolution granting permission to sue does not waive to any extent immunity from liability.” TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE § 107.002(b) (Supp.1995) (emphasis added). When the Legislature was considering the House Bill it later\nenacted as the attorney fee provision of the DJA, the director of the Legislative Budget Board sent a fiscal note to the\nCommittee on Judiciary of the House of Representatives which stated:\n\n            No fiscal implication or additional cost to the State or units of local government attributable to the bill,\n            should it be enacted, is anticipated.\n\nFISCAL NOTE, Tex.H.B. 375, 67th Leg., R.S., ch. 190, § 1, 1981 Tex.Gen.Laws 455, 455 (amending TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.\nart. 2524–1 § 10, now codified at TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009). The Legislature did not intend or foresee that\nit was authorizing the award of attorneys’ fees and court costs against state entities when it amended the DJA.\n\nOnly through a feat of statutory sleight of hand does the Court achieve its holding that attorneys’ fees can be awarded under\nthe DJA. The result is a disappearing act for the rule requiring a clear and unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity. As\nstated, the DJA simply does not contain a clear and unambiguous statement that a governmental entity may be held liable for\nattorneys’ fees. See TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009. The Legislature certainly has the power to place this burden\non taxpayers. However, in my opinion, it has not done so in the clear and unambiguous language that this Court has\npreviously required.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                         15\n\fTexas Educ. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432 (1994)\n98 Ed. Law Rep. 491, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 390\n\nI would retain the rule that the Legislature must expressly waive sovereign immunity. By finding an implied waiver of\nsovereign immunity in this case, the Court disturbs an important principle in the law of sovereign immunity. Presumably a\nplaintiff may now recover whatever costs, fees, or damages which he or she can persuade a trial court that a statute impliedly\nallows. By its ruling today, the Court turns the law of sovereign immunity on its head. Now a governmental entity will have\nto identify statutes that expressly bar recovery of costs, fees, or damages before it will be excused from such liability. Thus,\nthe Court’s implied waiver ruling introduces a grave threat to the state’s financial resources.\n\nFurthermore, the Legislature is perfectly capable of drafting statutes which expressly waive sovereign immunity, without\nassistance from us or any other court. For example, the Texas Tort Claims Act has a clear and unambiguous waiver of\nsovereign immunity, thereby allowing a plaintiff to bring suit against a governmental entity in certain circumstances. See\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 101.025(a) (“Sovereign immunity to suit is waived and abolished to the extent of liability\ncreated by this chapter.”). However, the Texas Tort Claims Act does not expressly provide for the recovery of fees and costs,\nand no court has awarded them to a plaintiff under the Act. See id. § 101.021(1) (allowing a governmental unit to be liable\nsolely for “property damage, personal injury, and *449 death”); id. § 101.023 (capping liability for bodily injury or death).\nSimilarly, the Open Government Act expressly authorizes actions against otherwise immune governmental entities in order to\nprevent violations of the Act. TEX.GOV’T CODE § 551.142. In contrast to the Texas Tort Claims Act, the Open\nGovernment Act unambiguously states that a court “may assess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a\nplaintiff ... who substantially prevails in an action” against members of “a governmental body.” Id. Finally, the\nWhistleblower Act expressly provides for waiver of immunity and for recovery of attorneys’ fees. See id. §§ 554.001–.009. If\na state agency or local government suspends, terminates, or discriminates against a public employee who has reported a law\nviolation, the employee is entitled to sue for injunctive relief, actual and exemplary damages, court costs, and “reasonable\nattorneys’ fees.”1 Id. §§ 554.002, 554.003(a). There are other examples in which the Legislature has expressly authorized the\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees or costs from a governmental entity. See, e.g., TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 105.002; id. §\n106.002(b). The Legislature’s specificity of language in the Open Government Act and the Whistleblower Act sharply\ncontrasts with the general provisions the Court relies on in this case for awarding attorneys’ fees under the DJA.\n\n1\n       Even then, it may take a legislative appropriation to collect a judgment from the state. See Green v. Sharp, 37 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. 1227\n       (Sept. 29, 1994) (orig. proceeding) (overruling motion for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the Comptroller\n       of Public Accounts to issue a check from the state treasury to satisfy a judgment against the Texas Department of Human\n       Services); Texas Dep’t of Human Servs. v. Green, 855 S.W.2d 136, 145 (Tex.App.—Austin 1993, writ denied) (stating that the\n       prevailing plaintiff must request a legislative appropriation to collect damages awarded him under the Whistleblower Act).\n\n\n\nAnother flaw with the Court’s reasoning regarding attorneys’ fees is the possible result: the imposition of a $400,000 burden\non Texas taxpayers which the Legislature never envisioned when it passed the DJA. Holding that the DJA waives sovereign\nimmunity to the extent of allowing an award of attorneys’ fees in this case could “divert money from the schools and would\nthereby impair the quality and availability of public education.” Duson v. Midland County Indep. Sch. Dist., 627 S.W.2d 428,\n429 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1981, no writ) (affirming the nonapplicability of the Texas Tort Claims Act to public school\ndistricts). Unless the plaintiffs are required to obtain a legislative appropriation to collect the $400,000 judgment, the\npotential drain of tax dollars to pay attorneys’ fees from funds earmarked for education cannot be minimized.2 In today’s\nlitigious society, suits against school districts over dress codes, school prayer, sex education, cheerleader selections, and the\nlike are not uncommon. Such litigation drains scarce funds and diverts the energies of school officials from the task of\neducation. Because of the tremendous costs associated with litigating these issues, some school districts will decide to\ncompromise on matters of principle rather than go to court and defend them. Unless the Legislature revisits the issue of\ngovernmental immunity from attorneys’ fees and court costs, to correct the Court’s holding in this case, there is the potential\nof a further drain on scarce educational dollars.\n\n2\n       For example, besides the $400,000 award for attorneys’ fees and court costs from public school funds in this case, a trial court in\n       another case recently awarded $48,000 to the attorneys of an elementary school student who challenged the hair grooming\n       regulations of the school district he was attending. See Gamboa, Judge Rules in Favor of Bastrop Student and His Ponytail,\n       AUSTIN AM. STATESMAN, Feb. 11, 1995, at B1.\n\n\n\nThe Court’s opinion (although not its judgment) approves the trial court’s order that the Texas Education Agency exclusively\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This reasoning is consistent with the requirement that the Legislature\n       expressly waive immunity with “clear and unambiguous” language. TEX.

Validity\n\nParents who did not enroll their children in public school as required under compulsory attendance law [V.T.C.A. Education\nCode § 21.032] failed to establish that law substantially burdened their exercise of their religious beliefs in violation of free\nexercise clauses [U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1; Vernon’s Anno. Const. Art. 1, § 26], thus exempting them from compliance,\nwhere parents failed to show that their violation of attendance law was based on anything except their subjective views and\nwhere parents did not make any showing of religious or cultural tradition, notwithstanding parents’ claim that word of God\nconstituted law that exempted them from compliance with this section. Howell v. State (App. 6 Dist.1986) 723 S.W.2d 755.\n\nUnder Texas law, trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant equitable relief or enter declaratory judgment construing or\ninterpreting criminal compulsory school attendance statute, where parties challenging statute did not plead or prove that it\nwas unconstitutional or otherwise void, or show that enforcement of statute had or would result in irreparable injury to their\nvested property rights. Texas Educ. Agency v. Leeper (App. 2 Dist.1991) 843 S.W.2d 41, rehearing denied, writ granted.\n\nTexas Education Agency (TEA) guidelines under which parents of children being educated in private or parochial home\nschools were subject to prosecution under compulsory attendance statute, while parents of children being educated in private\nor parochial campus schools were not, was not rationally related to state objective of compelling education of school-aged\nchildren in private or parochial schools if they did not attend public schools, in violation of equal protection.

Op.Atty.Gen.1939, No. 0-1388.\n\nA child who attained age of 16 or over before beginning of public free schools in his district was not subject to provisions of\ncompulsory attendance law whether or not child had completed work of 9th grade, but child who attained age of 16 after\nbeginning of public free schools was subject to compulsory attendance law for that school year unless child was exempt from\nlaw. Op.Atty.Gen.1949, No. V-954.\n\nA child under 16 years of age who had completed the 9th grade was subject to the provisions of Vernon’s Ann.Civ.St. art.\n2892 (repealed; now, this section) and Vernon’s Ann.P.C.

Transportation of students\n\nIt is legal duty of parents to require their children of 16 years of age or under to attend school, and the way and manner such\nchildren are to be conveyed to school is a business problem to be solved by the parents. Cotterly v. Nuirhead (Civ.App.1952)\n244 S.W.2d 920, ref. n.r.e.\n\nWhere second school district voluntarily taught students in question, although students were nonresidents and had not been\nlawfully transferred to this district, their attendance was not unlawful, and district of student’s residence could not prevent\nprivate persons from transporting the students to the schools. Palmer v. District Trustees of Dist. No. 21 (Civ.App.1956) 289\nS.W.2d 344, ref. n.r.e.\n\n\n 4. Married students\n\nSchool board was without authority to adopt rule that students who marry during school term must withdraw from school for\nremainder of school year and board could not deny admission to student, because of fact she was married. Anderson v.\nCanyon Independent School Dist. (Civ.App.1967) 412 S.W.2d 387.\n\nA girl attending school who attained the age of sixteen years and subsequently married in accordance with State laws was not\nsubject to compulsory school attendance law.

McKinney Independent School Dist. (Civ.App.1931) 35 S.W.2d 780.\n\n\n 6. Criminal proceedings\n\nThe compulsory education law required school attendance for a minimum of 120 days a year and the failure to file a\ncomplaint within the first 120 days of the school year would not preclude a criminal action against the parent or the person\nstanding in parental relation to the child. Op.Atty.Gen.1960, No. WW-862.\n\n\n 6.5. Attorney fees\n\nSchool districts could be held liable for attorneys’ fees under federal civil rights attorney fees statute in action in which\nparents who taught their children at home successfully challenged Texas Education Agency (TEA) guidelines subjecting\nthem to prosecution under compulsory attendance statute, where school districts implemented TEA’s unconstitutional policy\nby requesting criminal prosecution of parents. Texas Educ. Agency v. Leeper (App. 2 Dist.1991) 843 S.W.2d 41, rehearing\ndenied, writ granted.\n\nRequiring school districts to pay home school parents’ attorneys’ fees and costs in action in which parents successfully\nchallenged Texas Education Association (TEA) guidelines subjecting them to criminal prosecution under compulsory\nattendance statutes was equitable and just, as required by attorney fee statute, although TEA was not required to pay fees.\nTexas Educ. Agency v. Leeper (App. 2 Dist.1991) 843 S.W.2d 41, rehearing denied, writ granted.\n\nAttorneys’ failure to segregate their fees and expenses as to claims and parties in class action challenging state guidelines for\napplication of compulsory school attendance statute did not preclude award of attorneys’ fees, where all claims arose out of\nsame fact situation and were all interrelated.

Taylor was\ndischarged four days later, after being treated by Dr. Peter Fadow, a psychiatrist at the Hospital. Taylor returned home and\ncommitted suicide that same day. Taylor’s wife, Deborah Taylor, sued the Hospital and Dr. Fadow under Texas Health and\nSafety Code section 321.003, asserting claims for wrongful death and survival. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 71.002,\n.021. She alleged that Taylor’s death was proximately caused by the negligence of the doctor and Hospital in failing to\nproperly diagnose and treat his mental illness, and that the defendants’ acts and omissions violated the patient’s bill of rights.\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CODEE §§ 133.42, 404.154–.159.\n\nThe Hospital moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity.1 In her response, Deborah Taylor\nargued that the Legislature unambiguously waived the Hospital’s immunity by enacting Texas Health and Safety Code\nsection 321.003, which provides that a person who has been harmed by a violation of the patient’s bill of rights “may sue” for\ndamages. The trial court denied the Hospital’s jurisdictional plea and the Hospital appealed. A divided court of appeals\naffirmed, holding that the Legislature clearly and unambiguously waived immunity from suit against state mental health\nfacilities for violations of the patient’s bill of rights. 48 S.W.3d 782.

Sovereign Immunity3\n3\n              Courts often use the terms sovereign immunity and governmental immunity interchangeably. However, they involve two distinct\n              concepts. Sovereign immunity refers to the State’s immunity from suit and liability. Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401,\n              405 (Tex.1997). In addition to protecting the State from liability, it also protects the various divisions of state government,\n              including agencies, boards, hospitals, and universities. Lowe v. Tex. Tech Univ., 540 S.W.2d 297, 298 (Tex.1976). Governmental\n              immunity, on the other hand, protects political subdivisions of the State, including counties, cities, and school districts. City of\n              LaPorte v. Barfield, 898 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex.1995); Guillory v. Port of Houston Auth., 845 S.W.2d 812, 813 (Tex.1993); see\n              also Renna Rhodes, Principles of Governmental Immunity in Texas: The Texas Government Waives Sovereign Immunity When it\n              Contracts—Or Does It?, 27 ST. MARY’S L.J. 679, 693–96 (1996).\n\n\n[1] [2] [3]\n         In 1847, this Court held that “no State can be sued in her own courts without her consent, and then only in the manner\nindicated by that consent.” Hosner v. De Young, 1 Tex. 764, 769 (1847). The Court did not cite the origin of that declaration,\nbut it appears to be rooted in an early understanding of sovereignty:\n\n                   *695 It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without\n                   its consent. This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of\n                   the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union.\n\nTHE FEDERALIST No. 81, at 487 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (dismissing fears that adopting the\nnew Constitution would abrogate states’ sovereign immunity). Although sometimes associated in the United States with the\nfeudal fiction that “the King can do no wrong,” sovereign immunity “is an established principle of jurisprudence in all\ncivilized nations.” Beers v. Arkansas, 61 U.S. 527, 529, 20 How. 527, 15 L.Ed. 991 (1857).\n\nMost sovereigns have long since abandoned the fiction that governments and their officials can “do no wrong.” To varying\n\n                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                     2\n\fWichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692 (2003)\n46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 494\n\ndegrees, states and the federal government have voluntarily relinquished the privilege of absolute immunity by waiving\nimmunity in certain contexts. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 101.021. Invariably,\nhowever, they have retained a significant measure of immunity to protect the public treasury. See Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ.,\n951 S.W.2d 401, 417 (Tex.1997) (Enoch, J., dissenting); Elizabeth K. Hocking, Federal Facility Violations of the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act and the Questionable Role of Sovereign Immunity, 5 ADMIN. L.J. 203, 211 (1991); Louis L.\nJaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 HARV. L.REV.. 1, 1 (1963); Glen A. Majure et al.,\nThe Governmental Immunity Doctrine in Texas—An Analysis and Some Proposed Changes, 23 SW. L.J. 341, 341 (1969).\n\n\n\nB. Waiver of Immunity\n[4]\n   Because consent is pivotal to a waiver of sovereign immunity, it is important to consider the manner in which a sovereign\nconveys its consent to be sued. Under our form of government, the state derives its authority from “the people.” E.g., TEX.\nCONST. art. I, § 2 (stating that “[a]ll political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their\nauthority, and instituted for their benefit”); see also Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 759, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636\n(1999) (noting that the federal Constitution began “with the principle that sovereignty rests with the people”). In Texas, the\npeople’s will is expressed in the Constitution and laws of the State. See Cramer v. Sheppard, 140 Tex. 271, 167 S.W.2d 147,\n153–54 (1943); Tex. Boll Weevil Eradication Found., Inc. v. Lewellen, 952 S.W.2d 454, 465–66 (Tex.1997). Consequently,\nto waive immunity, consent to suit must ordinarily be found in a constitutional provision or legislative enactment.\n\nCourts in other jurisdictions have occasionally abrogated sovereign immunity by judicial decree.4 We have held, however,\nthat the Legislature is better suited to balance the conflicting policy issues associated with waiving immunity. See Tex.\nNatural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 854 (Tex.2002); Guillory v. Port of Houston Auth., 845\nS.W.2d 812, 813 (Tex.1993); Duhart v. State, 610 S.W.2d 740, 741 (Tex.1980); *696 Lowe v. Tex. Tech Univ., 540 S.W.2d\n297, 298 (Tex.1976). But see Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice v. Miller, 51 S.W.3d 583, 593 (Tex.2001), (Hecht, J.,\nconcurring) (noting that judicial abolition of immunity may be necessary to prompt Legislature to enact reasoned system for\ndetermining government’s responsibility for its torts). Although we have not absolutely foreclosed the possibility that the\njudiciary may abrogate immunity by modifying the common law, we have no occasion to consider that possibility today.\n\n4\n           See, e.g., Evans v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 174 Colo. 97, 482 P.2d 968, 972 (1971); Molitor v. Kaneland Cmty. Unit Dist. No. 302,\n           18 Ill.2d 11, 163 N.E.2d 89, 95 (1959); Nieting v. Blondell, 306 Minn. 122, 235 N.W.2d 597, 603 (1975); Pruett v. City of\n           Rosedale, 421 So.2d 1046, 1052 (Miss.1982); Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632, 639–40 (N.D.1994); Mayle v.\n           Pa. Dep’t of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709, 709–10 (1978); McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741, 742–43\n           (1985).\n\n\n[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]\n                  When considering immunity in Texas, we address not only whether the State has consented to suit, but also\nwhether the State has accepted liability. Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 405. Immunity from suit prohibits suits against the State\nunless the State expressly consents to the suit. Id. Thus, even if the State acknowledges liability on a claim, immunity from\nsuit bars a remedy until the Legislature consents to suit. Id. Immunity from liability protects the State from judgments even\nafter the State has consented to suit. Id. Accordingly, even if the Legislature has authorized a claimant to sue, the State’s\nimmunity is retained until it acknowledges liability. Id. Unlike immunity from suit, immunity from liability does not affect a\ncourt’s jurisdiction to hear a case and cannot be raised in a plea to the jurisdiction. See Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Jones, 8\nS.W.3d 636, 638–39 (Tex.1999).\n[11]\n    It is settled in Texas that for the Legislature to waive the State’s sovereign immunity, a statute or resolution must contain a\nclear and unambiguous expression of the Legislature’s waiver of immunity. Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 405; Univ. of Tex. Med.\nBranch at Galveston v. York, 871 S.W.2d 175, 177 (Tex.1994); Duhart, 610 S.W.2d at 742. In 2001, the Legislature ratified\nthis approach by adding section 311.034 to the Code Construction Act. That section provides: “In order to preserve the\nlegislature’s interest in managing state fiscal matters through the appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.” TEX. GOV’T CODE §\n311.034.\n\nSome statutes leave no doubt about the Legislature’s intent to waive immunity. When the Legislature pronounces, for\n\n                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 494\n\nexample, that “[s]overeign immunity to ... liability is waived and abolished to the extent of liability created by this chapter,”\nwe have had little difficulty recognizing a waiver of immunity from liability.5 But this case presents no such explicit language\nwaiving immunity from liability. And because the State cannot properly assert immunity from liability in a plea to the\njurisdiction, we have no occasion to decide the extent to which immunity from liability is implicated here. Jones, 8 S.W.3d at\n638.\n\n5\n            See, e.g., TEX. GOV’T CODE § 554.0035 (“Sovereign immunity is waived and abolished to the extent of liability for the relief\n            allowed under this chapter for a violation of this chapter.”); Id. § 2007.004(a) ( “Sovereign immunity to ... liability is waived and\n            abolished to the extent of liability created by this chapter.”); Id. § 2007.024(c) ( “Sovereign immunity to liability is waived to the\n            extent the governmental entity elects to pay compensation under this subsection.”); TEX. NAT. RES.CODE § 52.035(c) (“The\n            state waives its right to claim sovereign immunity in any action commenced against the state....”); TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\n            REM.CODE § 110.008 (“Subject to Section 110.006, sovereign immunity ... from liability is waived and abolished to the extent of\n            liability created by Section 110.005....”); Id. § 101.021 (expressly imposing liability on a governmental unit for property damage\n            and personal injury).\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we have little difficulty recognizing the Legislature’s intent to waive *697 immunity from suit when a statute\nprovides that a state entity may be sued or that “sovereign immunity to suit is waived.”6 This case, however, does not contain\nthe sort of language the Legislature generally uses to confirm its intent to waive immunity from suit. Accordingly, we\nexamine factors we have employed to determine whether a statute that is less explicit may nevertheless waive the State’s\nimmunity from suit.\n\n6\n            See, e.g., TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 101.025(a) ( “Sovereign immunity to suit is waived and abolished to the extent of\n            liability created by this chapter.”); Id. § 63.007(b) (“The state’s sovereign immunity to suit is waived only to the extent necessary\n            to authorize a garnishment action in accordance with this section.”); Id. § 81.010(d) (“Governmental immunity to suit is waived\n            and abolished only to the extent of the liability created by Subsection (b).”); Id. § 101.025(b) (“A person having a claim under this\n            chapter may sue a governmental unit for damages allowed by this chapter.”); Id. § 103.002(a) (“A person may bring a suit against\n            the state under this chapter, and the state’s immunity from suit is waived.”); TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2007.004(a) (“Sovereign\n            immunity to suit ... is waived and abolished to the extent of liability created by this chapter.”); Id. § 554.0035 (“A public employee\n            who alleges a violation of this chapter may sue the employing state or local governmental entity for the relief provided by this\n            chapter.”); TEX. PROP.CODE § 74.506(c) (“The state’s immunity from suit without consent is abolished with respect to suits\n            brought under this section.”); see also TEX. GOV’T CODE § 554.0035 (“A public employee whose employment is suspended or\n            terminated or who is discriminated against in violation of Section 554.002 is entitled to sue ....”) amended by Acts 1995, 74th Leg.,\n            ch. 721, § 3, eff. June 15, 1995.\n\n\n[12]\n    We have on rare occasions found waiver of sovereign immunity absent “magic words,” such as the State’s “sovereign\nimmunity to suit and liability is waived.” Although it is more difficult to discern legislative consent under those\ncircumstances, we have employed several aids to help guide our analysis in determining whether the Legislature has clearly\nand unambiguously waived sovereign immunity. First, a statute that waives the State’s immunity must do so beyond doubt,\neven though we do not insist that the statute be a model of “perfect clarity.” City of LaPorte v. Barfield, 898 S.W.2d 288,\n291–92 (Tex.1995). For example, we have found waiver when the provision in question would be meaningless unless\nimmunity were waived. Kerrville State Hosp. v. Fernandez, 28 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex.2000) (holding that the anti-retaliation\nstatute had no meaning absent waiver of sovereign immunity).\n[13] [14]\n        Second, when construing a statute that purportedly waives sovereign immunity, we generally resolve ambiguities by\nretaining immunity. See, e.g., Travis County v. Pelzel & Assocs., Inc., 77 S.W.3d 246, 249–50 (Tex.2002); IT–Davy, 74\nS.W.3d at 853–54; Guillory, 845 S.W.2d at 813–14; Duhart, 610 S.W.2d at 742–43; see also Magnolia Petroleum Co. v.\nWalker, 125 Tex. 430, 83 S.W.2d 929, 934 (1935) (ambiguities in the terms of a legislative grant of a right or a privilege\nmust be construed in favor of the State). In this respect, our methodology resembles that of the United States Supreme Court\nwhen it considers a purported waiver of the federal government’s sovereign immunity. See United States v. Williams, 514\nU.S. 527, 531, 115 S.Ct. 1611, 131 L.Ed.2d 608 (1995) (when confronted with purported waiver of federal government’s\nsovereign immunity, Court will “constru[e] ambiguities in favor of immunity”). If the text and history of the statute leave\nroom to doubt whether the Legislature intended to waive sovereign immunity, we are less likely to find a waiver.\n\n\n                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                       4\n\fWichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692 (2003)\n46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 494\n\n[15]\n   Third, if the Legislature requires that the State be joined in a lawsuit for *698 which immunity would otherwise attach, the\nLegislature has intentionally waived the State’s sovereign immunity. Tex. Educ. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432, 446\n(Tex.1994) (holding that, “by authorizing declaratory judgment actions to construe the legislative enactments of\ngovernmental entities and authorizing awards of attorneys fees, the [Declaratory Judgments Act] necessarily waives\ngovernmental immunity for such awards”).\n[16]\n    Finally, we are cognizant that, when waiving immunity by explicit language, the Legislature often enacts simultaneous\nmeasures to insulate public resources from the reach of judgment creditors. See, e.g., TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§\n101.023–.024; TEX. GOV’T CODE §§ 554.003, 2007.023. Therefore, when deciding whether the Legislature intended to\nwaive sovereign immunity and permit monetary damages against the State, one factor to consider is whether the statute also\nprovides an objective limitation on the State’s potential liability. See IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854 (noting that “[s]ubjecting\nthe government to liability may hamper governmental functions by shifting tax resources away from their intended purposes\ntoward defending lawsuits and paying judgments”); Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 413–16 (Hecht, J., concurring) (noting that\n“even if the Court were to abolish governmental immunity from contract suits, successful plaintiffs still could not be paid\nwithout legislative appropriation”); see also Barfield, 898 S.W.2d at 297 (stating that the rules for waiver of sovereign\nimmunity apply to both the existence and extent of the waiver).\n\nWith these principles in mind, we will examine the statute to determine whether the Legislature waived immunity by\nadopting section 321 of the patient’s bill of rights.\n\n\n\nC. The Patient’s Bill of Rights\nIn 1993, Texas enacted a patient’s bill of rights. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 321.002. Section 321.002 requires that\nthe Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse\n“protect the health, safety, and rights of a patient receiving voluntary or involuntary mental health, chemical dependency, or\ncomprehensive medical rehabilitation services in an inpatient facility.” Id. § 321.002. Section 321.003 permits a person\nharmed by a mental health facility’s violation of the patient’s bill of rights to sue for injunctive relief, damages, or both. Id. §\n321.003(b). A plaintiff who prevails under section 321.003 may recover actual damages, exemplary damages, and attorney’s\nfees. Id. § 321.003(c), (d)\n\nTaylor contends that the Legislature expressly waived the Hospital’s sovereign immunity by providing that a patient “may\nsue” a “mental health facility” for damages and other relief caused by those violations. Section 321.003 provides in part:\n\n       (a) A treatment facility or mental health facility that violates a provision of, or a rule adopted under, this chapter ... is\n       liable to a person receiving care or treatment in or from the facility who is harmed as a result of the violation.\n\n       (b) A person who has been harmed by a violation may sue for injunctive relief, damages, or both.\n\nId. § 321.003(a), (b) (emphasis added). Nowhere does this section expressly authorize suit against the State of Texas.\nTherefore, we must examine whether the statute waives the State’s immunity by necessary implication.\n[17]\n    Taylor argues that immunity is waived because the term “mental health facility” includes the Texas Department of *699\nMental Health and Mental Retardation. Taylor acknowledges that the term “mental health facility” is not expressly defined in\nthe statute. She observes, however, that section 321.001—the definitional section of chapter 321—provides that “mental\nhealth facility” has the meaning assigned by section 571.003. See id. § 321.001(4). Accordingly, we turn to section 571.003\nto determine if it contains an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nSection 571.003, enacted as part of the Texas Mental Health Code two years before chapter 321’s enactment, refers expressly\nto governmental agencies or facilities. Specifically, section 571.003(12) defines “mental health facility” as:\n\n       (A) an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility operated by the department, a federal agency, a political\n       subdivision, or any person;\n\n       (B) a community center or a facility operated by a community center; or\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 494\n\n     (C) that identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis, treatment, and care for persons with mental illness is\n     provided.\n\nId. § 571.003(12)(a)-(c) (emphasis added). “Department” is defined as the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation. Id. § 571.003(5). Taylor argues that, by incorporating the prior definition of mental health facility into the\nliability-creating provision of section 321, the Legislature clearly and unambiguously meant to waive the State’s immunity\nfrom suit.\n\nWhile the definition of “mental health facility” includes state-operated facilities, it does not contain the sort of explicit\nlanguage the Legislature generally uses to confirm its intent to waive sovereign immunity.7 Thus, we must determine whether\nthis incorporated definition is the functional equivalent of an explicit legislative directive waiving the State’s immunity.\n\n7\n       See statutes cited supra notes 5 and 6.\n\n\n\nLower courts have split on whether section 571.003(12)’s definition, read in conjunction with section 321.003(b), is a “clear\nand unambiguous” statement of the Legislature’s intent to waive sovereign immunity.8 In refusing to find a waiver of\nsovereign immunity, one court of appeals noted that, although the statute authorizes actions against private facilities licensed\nby state health care regulatory agencies, it does not “clearly express an intent to waive immunity by authorizing actions\nagainst governmental entities.” Tex. Dep’t of Mental Health & Mental Retardation v. Lee, 38 S.W.3d 862, 871\n(Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2001, pet. filed). The court applied our decisions in City of LaPorte v. Barfield and Duhart v. State to\nhold that mere incorporation of section 571.003’s definition of “mental health facility,” which includes public facilities, into\nthe patient’s bill of rights does not by itself manifest a clear legislative intent to waive immunity. Lee, 38 S.W.3d at 870–71;\naccord Barfield, 898 S.W.2d at 295; Duhart, 610 S.W.2d at 742.\n\n8\n       See, e.g., Beaumont State Ctr. v. Kozlowski, 70 S.W.3d 345, 349 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2002, pet. filed) (holding that section\n       321.003(b) is a waiver of sovereign immunity); Cent. Counties Ctr. for Mental Health & Mental Retardation Servs. v. Rodriguez,\n       45 S.W.3d 707, 713 (Tex.App.-Austin 2001, pet. filed) (holding that section 321.003(b) is a waiver of sovereign immunity);\n       Spindletop MHMR v. Doe, 54 S.W.3d 893, 897 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2001, pet. filed) (holding that section 321.003(b) is a waiver\n       of sovereign immunity); Tex. Dep’t of Mental Health & Mental Retardation v. Lee, 38 S.W.3d 862, 871 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth\n       2001, pet. filed) (holding that section 321.003(b) is not a clear and unambiguous waiver of immunity).\n\n\n\nThe court of appeals here, however, followed another court of appeals, which held that “ ‘[b]ecause the [State-operated care\n*700 facilities] are mental health facilities as defined in section 571.003, the legislature has consented in section 321.003(b)\nto their being sued for alleged violations of section 321.003(a).’ ” 48 S.W.3d at 785 (quoting Cent. Counties Ctr. for Mental\nHealth & Mental Retardation Servs. v. Rodriguez, 45 S.W.3d 707, 711 (Tex.App.-Austin 2001, pet. filed)). The court of\nappeals reasoned that the statutory scheme at issue in Barfield was not comparable to chapter 321 because it dealt with\nincorporation of subsequently enacted legislation, while chapter 321’s incorporation of “mental health facility” occurred\nsimultaneously with passage of that statute. Rodriguez, 45 S.W.3d at 712. Concluding that Barfield did not control, the court\nof appeals held that the Legislature waived sovereign immunity and that any other interpretation would render the statute’s\nlanguage meaningless. Id. at 711–12.\n\nThe interpretation adopted by the court of appeals in this case, however, overlooks the fact that section 321.003 creates a\nmeaningful cause of action against private mental health care facilities, a claim that remains viable even if suit against the\ngovernment is barred. As noted above, the fact that the Act remains viable despite the retention of immunity is one indication\nthat the Legislature did not intend to waive immunity by implication. None of the authorities cited by the court of appeals\npersuades us otherwise.\n\nIn Barfield, we found a clear and unambiguous waiver of immunity for claims of wrongful discharge against municipalities\nbecause the statute had no purpose if immunity had not been waived. 898 S.W.2d at 296–97. Unlike the statute in Barfield,\nthe patient’s bill of rights undoubtedly applies to private mental health facilities, so it is neither without meaning nor purpose\nif it is construed against waiver. Indeed, the Act’s legislative history indicates that it was designed to curb abuse in private\nmental health facilities. See SENATE COMM. ON HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS., BILL ANALYSIS, Tex.

Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692 (2003)\n46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 494\n\nLeg., R.S. (1993) (noting that a study of private psychiatric and substance abuse facilities “revealed surprising and somewhat\nshocking activities taking place in certain private treatment facilities ”) (emphasis added); see also TEX. GOV’T CODE §\n311.023(1),(3) (in construing statutes, courts may consider the legislative history and the object sought to be obtained). As\none court of appeals noted, “[t]here is nothing in the statute’s history to suggest that the legislature was even aware of the\nexistence of similar abuse in public facilities.” Lee, 38 S.W.3d at 871. Thus, the patient’s bill of rights achieves its stated\nobjective of regulating private treatment facilities even if suit against the State is barred by sovereign immunity. Cf. Kerrville,\n28 S.W.3d at 6 (holding that the anti-retaliation statute had no meaning absent waiver of sovereign immunity). Accordingly,\nthe patient’s bill of rights does not waive the State’s immunity beyond doubt.\n\nCarried to its logical conclusion, Taylor’s argument would require us to hold that the Legislature intended to waive immunity\nnot only for the State of Texas, but also for the United States. Section 571.003 includes in its definition of “mental health\nfacilities” hospitals or clinics operated by a federal agency. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 571.003(12). Because a\nstate legislature has no authority to waive federal immunity, the Legislature could not have intended a wholesale\nincorporation of section 571.003 into section 321.001(1). See U.S. CONST. art. VI; United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584,\n587–88, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941) (holding that only Congress can consent to suit against the United States); see\nalso TEX. GOV’T CODE § 311.021 (“In enacting a statute, it is presumed that: (1) compliance with the *701 constitution of\nthis state and the United States is intended....”). Instead, had the Legislature intended state agencies to be included, it would\nhave either stated that intention expressly or incorporated only that part of section 571.003 applicable to state agencies.\n\nAt best, the incorporation of section 571.003 into section 321.001 sewed ambiguity into the statute. But in cases like this, we\nrequire the Legislature to express its intent beyond doubt and will construe ambiguities in a manner that retains the State’s\nimmunity. See Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Walker, 125 Tex. 430, 83 S.W.2d 929, 934 (1935) (“Legislative grants of\nproperty, rights, or privileges must be construed strictly in favor of the State ... and whatever is not unequivocally granted in\nclear and explicit terms is withheld. Any ambiguity or obscurity in the terms of the statute must operate in favor of the\nstate.”). The statute’s ambiguity precludes our finding an unmistakable Legislative intent to waive sovereign immunity.\n\nAnother factor we have examined is whether the statute requires the State to be joined in litigation involving the patient’s bill\nof rights. Unlike the statute at issue in Texas Education Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 446, which required that the State\nbe sued, nothing in the patient’s bill of rights requires joinder of the State or its agencies. Compare TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM.CODE § 37.006, with TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 321.002. This is yet another indication that the Legislature\ndid not intend to waive immunity simply by incorporating section 571.003’s pre-existing definition of “mental health\nfacility” into the patient’s bill of rights.\n[18]\n    Finally, by examining attributes of waiver that exist when the Legislature expressly waives immunity, we have a reliable\nguidepost to determine if the Legislature intended to waive immunity when its intent is less clear. In particular, we note that\nin many statutes waiving sovereign immunity explicitly, the Legislature appends a measure designed to protect the public\ntreasury from the consequences of that waiver.9 Our decisions recognizing a waiver of immunity have generally left\nundisturbed the Legislature’s interest in protecting the State’s financial resources. See, e.g., Barfield, 898 S.W.2d at 299\n(limiting damages to those authorized by the Texas Tort Claims Act); Kerrville, 28 S.W.3d at 9–10 (limiting damages to\nthose authorized by the Texas Tort Claims Act); Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 446 (waiving governmental liability for attorney’s\nfees only).\n\n9\n       See, e.g., TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 101.023(a) ( “Liability of the state government under this chapter is limited to\n       money damages in a maximum amount of $250,000 for each person and $500,000 for each single occurrence for bodily injury or\n       death and $100,000 for each single occurrence for injury to or destruction of property.”); Id. § 81.010(b) (patient may only obtain\n       an order requiring the governmental unit to discharge the mental health services provider who committed the conduct, court costs,\n       and reasonable attorney’s fees, as determined by the court); TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2007.023 (“The governmental entity is only\n       liable for, invalidation of the governmental action or the part of the governmental action resulting in the taking.”); Id. § 554.003\n       (“A public employee may not recover compensatory damages for future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering,\n       inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses in an amount that exceeds....”).\n\n\n\nUnlike the statutes in Barfield, Kerrville, and Leeper, the patient’s bill of rights would, under Taylor’s construction, subject\nthe State to indeterminate damage awards. The Act expressly permits recovery of actual damages for mental anguish, as well\nas for exemplary damages and attorneys fees. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 321.003(c), (d).

Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692 (2003)\n46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 494\n\nexpressly *702 permits suit against the State for exemplary damages. Although not dispositive, the fact that Taylor’s\nconstruction of the Act would subject the State to exemplary damage awards reinforces our skepticism that the Legislature\nintended to waive sovereign immunity by mere implication.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             III\n\n\n\n                                                         Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and dismiss Taylor’s claims for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n106 S.W.3d 692, 46 Tex.

See Tex. R. Disciplinary P. 2.16.\n\n      For the Court’s convenience, the relevant text of Rule 2.16 is stated below:\n\n      2.16 Confidentiality\n      A. All members and staff of the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel,\n      Board of Disciplinary Appeals, Committees and Commission shall\n      maintain as confidential all Disciplinary Proceedings and associated\n      records, except that:\n      ...\n\nTex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.16, reprinted in Tex. Gov’t Code Ann., tit. 2,\n\nsubtit. G, app. A-1 (West 2013) (“Rule 2.16”).\n\n      This rule thus provides that “Disciplinary Proceedings and associated\n\nrecords” “shall [be] maintained as confidential,” with some specified exceptions.\n\nId.\n\n      Notably, Rule 2.16 does not expressly address from whom the proceedings\n\nare kept confidential. Id. The Rule does not expressly indicate that the\n\nproceedings must be kept confidential from the complainant himself. Id. Such a\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                       1\n\frule would seem misplaced, when it is the complainant himself who initiated the\n\ndisciplinary process, who knows the underlying facts, who knows the attorney\n\nunder investigation, and who knows the exact allegations raised against that\n\nattorney.\n\n      Admittedly, however, Rule 2.16 does not expressly state that its\n\nconfidentiality requirement does not apply to complainants. For this reason, Rule\n\n2.16 must be, and has been, interpreted. In this case, and presumably in all cases,\n\nthe Commission for Lawyer Discipline through the Chief Disciplinary Counsel\n\n(“CDC”) has interpreted Rule 2.16 as keeping the CDC’s recommendation to the\n\nsummary disposition panel confidential from complainants.\n\n      Doe disagrees with this interpretation of Rule 2.16 and instead, believes a\n\ncommon sense interpretation should prevail—pursuant to which the Disciplinary\n\nProceedings, and associated records, are indeed confidential as to all third-parties;\n\nbut not as to the complainant who initiated the proceeding and who already has\n\nknowledge of the underlying facts.\n\n      Doe’s interpretation is supported by existing Texas statutory law, as\n\ndiscussed below.\n\nB.    The Legislature expressly contemplated providing an explanation to a\n      complainant, upon dismissal of a complaint.\n\n      Section 81.072 of the Texas Government Code, in relevant part, states:\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                      2\n\f        Sec. 81.072. GENERAL DISCIPLINARY AND DISABILITY\n        PROCEDURES. (a) In furtherance of the supreme court’s powers to\n        supervise the conduct of attorneys, the court shall establish disciplinary and\n        disability procedures in addition to the procedures provided by this\n        subchapter.\n        (b) The supreme court shall establish minimum standards and procedures\n        for the attorney disciplinary and disability system. The standards and\n        procedures for processing grievances against attorneys must provide\n        for:\n        (1) classification of all grievances and investigation of all complaints;\n        (2) a full explanation to each complainant on dismissal of an inquiry or\n        a complaint; . . . .\n\nTex. Gov’t Code ¶ 81.072 (emphases added).\n\n        Section 81.072’s plain language requires the provision of “a full explanation\n\nto each complainant on dismissal of an inquiry or complaint.” Id. Clearly, the\n\nLegislature contemplated providing a complainant with a “full explanation” when\n\nhis complaint is dismissed. Id. Construing Rule 2.16 to prohibit a complainant\n\nfrom learning the reason his complaint was referred to a summary disposition\n\ncontradicts this requirement.\n\n        Accordingly, because Appellees’ interpretation of Rule 2.16 contradicts the\n\nLegislature’s intent in section 81.072, it cannot stand. See id.; Rule 2.16.\n\nC.      Exceptions to sovereign immunity apply in this case.\n\n        Appellees’ primary defense to Doe’s declaratory judgment action is\n\nsovereign immunity; but well-recognized exceptions to immunity apply in this\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                      3\n\f      Appellees have not disputed that 2 exceptions to sovereign immunity exist in\n\na declaratory judgment case: (1) the state is an appropriate party to a suit that\n\n“challenges the validity of a statute”; and (2) the state actor is an appropriate party\n\nto a suit that makes an ultra vires allegation. These exceptions were discussed in\n\nTex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Sefzik, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011) (the primary case\n\nupon which Appellees rely for their sovereign immunity argument) and City of El\n\nPaso v.

Both\n\ncases are discussed below.\n\n      1. Doe’s challenge to Rule 2.16 falls within the exception for “challenging\n         a statute.”\n\n      Appellees argue Doe is not “challenging the validity of a statute,” and thus\n\nthis exception to sovereign immunity cannot apply in this case.\n\n      Appellees, however, misunderstand what it means to “challenge the validity\n\nof a statute,” as evidenced by the fact that at oral argument, they insisted that the\n\ncase at bar was just like Sefzik.\n\n      In Sefzik, the Texas Department of Transportation (“TxDOT”) denied\n\nSefzik’s application for a sign permit. 355 S.W.3d at 620. Sefzik appealed this\n\ndenial, but lost. Id. Sefzik then complained that he was entitled to a hearing on the\n\ndenial, because the APA’s procedures pertaining to contested cases applied. Id.\n\nTxDOT disagreed, refused to grant him a hearing, and Sefzik then sought a\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                          4\n\fdeclaratory judgment “that the APA’s ‘contested case’ procedures entitled him to a\n\nhearing.” Id.\n\n         Notably, Sefzik was not complaining about, or “challenging,” the underlying\n\nregulations pertaining to the sign permit. He was not complaining that the\n\nregulations applied to him, when they should not have. He was not complaining\n\nthat the regulations had been misconstrued, misinterpreted, or misapplied. Sefzik’s\n\nsole complaint before the trial court was that the APA’s contested-case procedures\n\napplied to his permit denial, so that he was entitled to a hearing. Id.\n\n         The Sefzik defendants sought to dismiss the case, based on sovereign\n\nimmunity. Id. at 620. Sefzik argued a declaratory judgment action did not\n\nimplicate sovereign immunity.

Dep’t of Transp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1794422\"><a href=\"/opinion/1794422/sefzik-v-texas-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n131 (Tex.

Ultimately,\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court agreed in part with the Sefzik defendants, and found the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act itself does not waive immunity. In doing so, however,\n\nthe Court recognized exceptions to sovereign immunity in declaratory judgment\n\ncases:\n\n         Although the UDJA waives sovereign immunity in particular cases,\n         Sefzik’s claim does not fall within the scope of those express waivers.\n         For example, the state may be a proper party to a declaratory\n         judgment action that challenges the validity of a statute. Heinrich,\n         284 S.W.3d at 373 n. 6 (citing TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                     5\n\f       § 37.006(b)); Wichita Falls State Hosp. v.

Educ. Agency v. Leeper, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 446 (Tex. 1994).\n\n        In Leeper, the plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment against State\n\nentities complaining that the defendants had misinterpreted the private school\n\nexemption to Texas’s compulsory attendance law. 893 S.W.2d at 433 (citing Tex.\n\nEduc. Code §§ 21.032 and 21.033(a)(1)).1 Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that\n\nhome-schooling should be interpreted as falling within the private school\n\nexemption. Id.\n\n        The case at bar is analogous to Leeper (and not to Sefzik), because like\n\nLeeper, there is a specific statute (or rule) at issue being “challenged.”\n\n        As in Leeper, Doe’s argument is that the particular provision at issue has\n\nbeen “misinterpreted.” Id. Specifically, in Leeper, the plaintiffs argued the State\n\nentities had misinterpreted the private school exemption as not applying to, or not\n\n\n1\n  Leeper did not expressly address sovereign immunity; but it is nonetheless instructive based on\nSefzik’s reference to that case. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d at 622, citing Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 446.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                                6\n\fincluding, home-schooled children. Id. In the case at bar, Doe makes an\n\nanalogous argument: the State entities have misinterpreted 2.16, so as to preclude\n\nDoe from obtaining the requested information.\n\n       Finally in Leeper, the plaintiffs challenged the State’s actions (prosecuting\n\nparents of home-schooled children), which were taken based on the State’s\n\n(mis)interpretation of the statute at issue. Id. at 433. In the case at bar, Doe has\n\nchallenged the CDC’s actions (refusing to provide information to Doe), which\n\nwere taken based on the CDC’s misinterpretation of Rule 2.16.\n\n       Thus, Doe has indeed “challenged the validity of a statute,” as did the\n\nplaintiffs in Leeper, and in contrast to the plaintiff in Sefzik. Compare id. with\n\nSefzik, 355 S.W.3d at 622. Accordingly, the exception to sovereign immunity\n\nexemplified by Leeper applies to make the State entities proper parties to this\n\nproceeding. See Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 438, 446; Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372.\n\n\n\n      2.     Linda Acevedo acted ultra vires when she refused to provide the\n             requested information without legal authority.\n\n      In the alternative, by refusing to provide the requested information without\n\nany legal authority for doing so, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, Linda Acevedo,\n\nhas acted ultra vires.\n\n      In Heinrich, the Texas Supreme Court discussed the contours of the ultra\n\nvires exception to sovereign immunity. 284 S.W.3d at 372-74. “To fall within this\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                         7\n\fultra vires exception, a suit must not complain of a government officer’s exercise\n\nof discretion, but rather must allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer acted\n\nwithout legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.” Id. at 372.\n\n      Heinrich complained that the City’s reduction of her pension benefits under\n\na municipal pension fund was “illegal or unauthorized.” Id. at 378. She argued\n\nthat the City had improperly and without legal authority made a retrospective\n\nreduction in her pension benefits. Id. The Court found some evidence to support\n\nher position, and thus affirmed the lower court’s denial of the plea to the\n\njurisdiction with respect to specific named state actors, under the ultra vires\n\ndoctrine. Id. at 379-80.\n\n      In the case at bar, Appellees focus on the “ministerial act” portion of the\n\nultra vires exception, and argue that there is no such act in this case. Appellees\n\nargue that because Rule 2.16 does expressly require them to provide a complainant\n\nwith the information Doe requested, there is no ministerial act to implicate the\n\nultra vires exception.\n\n      This argument is misplaced, because Doe is not complaining there was some\n\nfailure to perform a ministerial act (nor is a ministerial act required, to implicate\n\nthe ultra vires doctrine). Acting without legal authority is also a proper basis for\n\nan ultra vires finding. See id. And that is exactly what Doe has alleged in this\n\ncase: that the State actor, Linda Acevedo, acted without legal authority, when she\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                          8\n\frefused to give the requested information based solely on a misinterpretation of\n\nRule 2.16. As discussed above, Rule 2.16 does not expressly prohibit disclosure of\n\nthe information requested to a complainant.\n\n      Accordingly, the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity applies in this\n\ncase to render Linda Acevedo a required party to this action. Id.\n\n\nD.    There is a real controversy and a real injury, which will continue to\n      evade judicial review.\n\n      Appellees raised several additional arguments as to why the lower court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction. Examined individually, each argument fails.\n\n      1. Doe’s declaratory judgment action to interpret Rule 2.16 does not seek to\n         usurp control vested in the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n       Relying primarily on State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1504474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1504474/the-state-bar-of-texas-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\n1994), Appellees urge this court to find that Doe’s actions constitute an attempt to\n\nusurp power that is vested exclusively in the Texas Supreme Court: the power to\n\ninstitute Disciplinary Rules. This argument fails because its premise is incorrect.\n\nDoe is not seeking to “rewrite” Rule 2.16, or “change” Rule 2.16 as Appellees\n\nallege. Doe is simply asking for Rule 2.16 not to be misinterpreted as keeping\n\nrecommendations to summary dismissal panels confidential from complainants, for\n\nall the reasons described above.\n\n      Gomez is inapposite because in that case, the plaintiffs asked a state district\n\ncourt to create a mandatory duty for attorneys to undertake pro bono\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                        9\n\frepresentations. 891 S.W2d at 246. The supreme court held that creating duties\n\nfor attorneys is the sole province of the supreme court, and thus the district court\n\nlacked authority to grant the relief requested by the plaintiff. Because the district\n\ncourt could not grant the relief requested, the case before it was not justiciable, and\n\nthat court lacked jurisdiction. Id.\n\n         But in the case at bar, Doe is not asking the trial court to create a new rule,\n\ninstitute a new program, insert a new requirement, or promulgate a new policy or\n\nregulation. All the trial court is asked to do is declare that Rule 2.16 does not\n\nprohibit the CDC from disclosing its recommendation to a summary disposition\n\npanel.\n\n\n\n         2. This case meets the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\n\n         Because the questions involved in this case are of considerable public\n\nimportance, are capable of arising again between the same parties or other\n\nmembers of the public, and will continue to evade judicial review, this case meets\n\nthe “public interest” exception to the mootness doctrine. See Univ. Scholastic\n\nLeague v. Buchanan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1517644\"><a href=\"/opinion/1517644/univ-interscholastic-league-v-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, no writ).\n\n         Appellees have argued that this court should not apply the public interest\n\ndoctrine in this instance, because there is another way of obtaining what Doe\n\nwants: a petition to the Texas Supreme Court. Again, though, Appellees\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                             10\n\fmischaracterize Doe’s request. Doe is not asking for a rule re-write, a new rule, or\n\nnew policy. Doe is simply asking for an interpretation of Rule 2.16.\n\n      In addition, Doe has suffered a real harm and injury because he could bring\n\nanother grievance, and preventing him from understanding why his prior grievance\n\nwas dismissed, hamstrings him in preparing another complaint. The Appellees\n\nhave taken the position that, because the Commission only makes\n\n“recommendations” to a summary disposition panel (“SDP”), and the SDP\n\nultimately makes the decision to dismiss, Doe cannot possibly stand to gain from\n\nknowledge of the Commission’s recommendation. This is simply false and\n\nmischaracterizes the process.\n\n      The Commission decides whether any filing constitutes an “inquiry” or a\n\n“grievance.” Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.12. If a filing is classified as a\n\n“grievance,” the Commission then decides, after investigation, whether or not Just\n\nCause exists. Id. (providing that “the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall investigate\n\nthe Complaint and determine whether there is Just Cause.”). Id. Only after the\n\nCDC has determined that no Just Cause exists, is the matter referred to a summary\n\ndisposition panel. Id.\n\n      If the CDC determines Just Cause exists, then the grievance bypasses the\n\nsummary disposition panel, and the matter is either decided by an evidentiary panel\n\nor district court. Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.13 and 2.14.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                     11\n\f       In the case at bar, based solely on the fact that Doe’s grievance landed\n\nbefore a summary disposition panel, we know that the CDC made a “no just cause”\n\ndetermination. See Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 2.13. Thus, when Doe asks for\n\nthe CDC’s recommendation regarding his grievance, he wants to know why his\n\ngrievance did not meet the very low “Just Cause” threshold.2 That information\n\nwould absolutely help him in determining whether he would file an additional\n\ngrievance based on the same underlying facts.\n\n       Appellees’ insistence that they should not have to to “show their hand” by\n\ngiving Doe this information demonstrates a lack of appreciation for who is asking.\n\nDoe is not the opposing party. Doe is the CDC’s ally and potentially best witness\n\nin any case against the respondent. It does not jeopardize the CDC’s position in\n\nfuture proceedings if it explains to Doe, or allows Doe to see, why it made a “no\n\njust cause” determination.\n\n                                           PRAYER\n\n       Appellant John Doe prays that this Court reverse the trial court’s dismissal\n\nand remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n2\n  The Rules of Disciplinary Procedure define “Just Cause” as “such cause as is found to exist\nupon a reasonable inquiry that would induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to\nbelieve that an attorney either has committed an act or acts of Professional Misconduct requiring\nthat a Sanction be imposed, or suffers from a Disability that requires either suspension as an\nattorney licensed to practice law in the State of Texas or probation.” Tex. Rules Disciplinary P.\nR. 1.06(u). This is a low threshold. It focuses on what a reasonable “person” would believe (not\na reasonable attorney), which is in keeping with the overall purposes of the Rules: to protect the\npublic.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF                                                                  12\n\f                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 WEST, WEBB, ALLBRITTON & GENTRY, P.C.\n                                 1515 Emerald Plaza\n                                 College Station, Texas 77845-1515\n                                 Telephone: (979) 694-7000\n                                 Facsimile: (979) 694-8000\n\n                                 By:________________________\n                                     /s/ Gaines West\n                                   GAINES WEST\n                                   State Bar No. 21197500\n                                   gaines.west@westwebblaw.com\n\n                                    JENNIFER D.

Heinrich does not\n       argue that her claims fall within these provisions, and we express no opinion on that subject.\n10     Because the mayor of El Paso, who is also a Board member, was named as a defendant in his official capacity, Heinrich\n       may seek liability from the City through that officer, although her claims against the City itself must be dismissed.\n11     The Fund, the Board, and the Board members objected to this evidence.

BACKGROUND\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Sefzik filed an application with TxDot for a permit to erect an outdoor-advertising sign at a designated\nlocation on the north side of Interstate 30 in Greenville, Texas. Sefzik sought to advertise on behalf of two businesses at the\nspecific location: T–Bar Fence, Inc. and Gym’s Star Gymnastics. As part of the *130 application process, Sefzik was\nrequired to demonstrate that the two businesses had been operating for at least 90 days (the “90–day waiting period”).1 TxDot\nreceived Sefzik’s application at its Paris, Texas office on March 21, 2005.\n\n1\n       43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 21.142(2)(K), 21.150(b)(4).\n\n\n\nApparently, Gym’s Star Gymnastics had not been operating for the requisite 90 days at the time TxDot received Sefzik’s\napplication. Rather, the 90–day waiting period did not end until April 2, 2005. TxDot did not immediately notify Sefzik of\nthe defect in his application. On April 4, 2005, Daum Advertising applied for a permit to erect an advertising sign at the same\nlocation on behalf of the same businesses.\n\nOn June 15, 2005, TxDot denied Sefzik’s application for a permit. In its denial letter, TxDot informed Sefzik that his\napplication to advertise for Gym Star Gymnastics did not satisfy the 90–day waiting period at the time that TxDot received\nhis application. Additionally, TxDot informed Sefzik that Daum Advertising’s permit had been received on April 4, 2005,\nwhich was 92 days after Gym’s Star Gymnastics opened for business. It told Sefzik that because Daum Advertising’s\napplication satisfied the 90–day waiting period, Daum Advertising was awarded the permit.\n\nOn June 20, 2005, Sefzik resubmitted his permit application,2 and on June 29, 2005, he appealed the previous denial of his\napplication.3 Sefzik filed his appeal with Michael Behrens, TxDot’s Executive Director. He argued that his application was\nthe only one on file on April 2, 2005 when the 90–day waiting period expired. Sefzik argued that TxDot should have notified\nhim of the deficiency in his permit application so that he could resubmit his application. He requested an oral, contested-case\nhearing, which he asserted was required under Texas Government Code section 2001.051.4\n\n2\n       The Texas Administrative Code appears to contemplate that if a permit application is filed with errors, TxDot will notify the\n       applicant and allow him or her to correct any deficiencies and resubmit the application. Id. § 21.150(c).\n\n\n\n3\n       Id. § 21.162(a) (“An applicant may file a petition with the executive director to appeal a denied permit.”).\n\n\n\n4\n       “In a contested case, each party is entitled to an opportunity: (1) for hearing after reasonable notice of not less than 10 days; and (2)\n       to respond and to present evidence and argument on each issue involved in the case.” TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 2001.051\n       (Vernon 2000).\n\n\n\nOn October 7, 2005, Behrens denied Sefzik’s appeal without holding a hearing. Behrens opined that TxDot acted reasonably\nin denying Sefzik’s permit application because the initial application did not meet the 90–day waiting period. Behrens cited\nto the administrative code, which states that applications are considered on a first-come, first-serve basis.5 Sefzik filed a\nmotion for rehearing,6 arguing that TxDot failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)’s7 contested case\n*131 procedures by refusing to provide him with a contested-case hearing under government code section 2001.051.

Sefzik also alleged that by denying him a contested-case proceeding, TxDot\nviolated his due process rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions.12 Finally, he sought attorney’s fees under the\nUDJA.13\n\n9\n       Id. § 2001.171 (Vernon 2000) (“A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within a State agency and who\n       is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter.”).

It argued that Sefzik did not have a property\ninterest in the permit but, rather, only had an expectation of a permit. TxDot reasoned that because Sefzik did not have a\nproperty interest, he could not establish that the APA’s declaratory relief provision waived sovereign immunity. For the same\nreason, TxDot argued that sovereign immunity barred his constitutional claims. Furthermore, TxDot argued that the UDJA is\nmerely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a trial court’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the UDJA claim was also\nbarred by sovereign immunity.\n\nSefzik argued in response that sovereign immunity is not implicated by actions for declaratory relief or for violations of\nconstitutional rights; therefore, he was not required to establish a waiver of immunity. The trial court agreed with TxDot and\ngranted its plea to the jurisdiction, and this appeal ensued.14\n\n14\n           The case was transferred to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals pursuant to a docket equalization order issued by the Supreme Court\n           of Texas.

SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND ACTIONS FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF\n\nIn this appeal, we must examine the effect of sovereign immunity on a claim for declaratory relief. The principal\ndisagreement between the parties involves the logical construct of the sovereign immunity doctrine. TxDot argues that\nsovereign immunity, as a general rule, bars claims for declaratory relief and that a plaintiff must therefore establish a waiver\nof sovereign immunity to proceed with a claim for declaratory relief. We believe, however, that TxDot’s analysis ignores the\ntheoretical underpinnings of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the substantial precedent holding that suits for\ndeclaratory relief are not suits against the State, and it requires a plaintiff to establish his or her right to declaratory relief in\norder to establish jurisdiction. Accordingly, we refuse to require Sefzik to establish that he is entitled to declaratory relief\nbefore the trial court can even consider his request for that relief. Rather, we hold, as many other courts have held, that a\nclaim for declaratory relief generally does not implicate the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the first place.\n\n\n\nA.

The doctrine is based on\nthe premise that the legislature’s policy-making function deserves protection. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854. As the Texas\nSupreme Court has explained,\n\n             [s]ubjecting the government to liability may hamper governmental functions by shifting tax resources\n             away from their intended purposes toward defending *133 lawsuits and paying judgments.\n             Accordingly, the Legislature is better suited than the courts to weigh the conflicting public policies\n             associated with waiving immunity and exposing the government to increased liability, the burden of\n             which the general public must ultimately bear.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\nFor example, sovereign immunity bars a claim for damages arising out of a breach of contract unless a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity can be established or consent is obtained from the legislature. Id. This ensures that current policymakers are not\nbound by their predecessors’ long-term contracts and can respond to changing conditions in the public’s best interest. Id.\n[9]\n   Certain types of actions, however, do not implicate these concerns and, therefore, do not implicate the sovereign immunity\ndoctrine. Nueces County v.

For example, Texas\ncourts have consistently distinguished suits against the State for money damages from suits for declaratory relief-the latter\ndoes not implicate the sovereign immunity doctrine.

For example, declaratory\n        judgment actions against State officials seeking to declare a contract’s validity, enforce a contract, or impose contractual liabilities\n        implicate the doctrine of sovereign immunity because they seek to impose liability on the State. Id.\n\n\n\nThe reason for this distinction is that “suits to compel state officers to act within their official capacity do not attempt to\nsubject the State to liability.” IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855; Hawkins, 214 S.W.3d at 716–18; Blanton, 200 S.W.3d at 279 (“A\nparty generally can maintain a suit to determine its rights without legislative permission because such suits are not considered\n‘suits against the State’ for purposes of sovereign immunity.”). In other words, suits for declaratory relief do not hamper\ncurrent policymakers’ ability to perform their job in the public interest by binding them to outdated or expired policies. If a\nstatute sought to be construed through a declaratory judgment is outdated, and thus a declaration of rights under that statute\ncauses problems for the general public, it is the policymakers’ job to change the statute, not to ignore it or violate it with\nimpunity.\n\nOn more than one occasion, this Court has rejected the idea that the State is immune from declaratory judgment actions\nseeking to determine a party’s rights under a statute. See Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d at 218; Dewhurst v. Gulf Marine Inst. of\nTech., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2336151\"><a href=\"/opinion/2336151/dewhurst-v-gulf-marine-institute-of-tech/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied) (“[W]e distinguish suits to determine a party’s rights\nagainst the State from suits seeking damages.

By characterizing the APA’s declaratory relief provision as a “waiver” of immunity, TxDot asks this Court to\nimproperly reach the merits of Sefzik’s claims\nTxDot argues that because Sefzik has not demonstrated compliance with the requirements of the APA’s declaratory relief\nprovisions, he has not demonstrated a waiver of immunity. The dissent extends this reasoning to TxDot’s UDJA claim,\nasserting that Sefzik has to demonstrate he is entitled to declaratory relief in order to establish jurisdiction. TxDot’s and the\ndissent’s view of sovereign immunity would skew the Court’s jurisdictional analysis because it would require the Court to\ndecide the merits of Sefzik’s declaratory judgment action.\n[10] [11]\n        When a statutory waiver of immunity is involved, it is axiomatic that the plaintiff’s failure to plead the statutory\nelements means that sovereign immunity bars the suit. For example, the Texas Tort Claims Act provides a waiver of\nsovereign immunity in limited circumstances. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1579143\"><a href=\"/opinion/1579143/texas-dept-of-criminal-justice-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587 (Tex.2001). If a\nplaintiff suing under the Texas Tort Claims Act does not satisfy the specific requirements of the statute, sovereign immunity\nis not waived. Id. Because the Tort Claims Act also provides the cause of action for recovery against the State, a plaintiff\nsuing under the Tort Claims Act must also satisfy the Tort Claims Act’s requirements in order to recover. Such is not the case\nhere, where sovereign immunity is not implicated.\n\nBy characterizing the APA’s declaratory relief provision as a waiver of immunity, TxDot sets up additional hurdles for a\nplaintiff to cross before ever reaching the merits of his or her claim. For example, TxDot argues that the legislature has\nimposed strict limits on the scope of a trial court’s ability to review agency decisions, and for that reason, a party seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment under Texas Government Code section 2001.038 is limited to challenging a rule as invalid or\ninapplicable. TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 2001.038 (Vernon 2000). TxDot argues that Sefzik merely challenges whether\nTxDot correctly applied a rule and, in turn, whether TxDot’s actions comply with the APA’s provisions governing its\noperation. It argues that under these circumstances, Sefzik is not entitled to a declaratory judgment under section 2001.038.\nAdditionally, TxDot argues that Sefzik does not have a legal right or privilege within the meaning of section 2001.038. Id.\n(“The validity or applicability of a rule, including an emergency rule adopted under Section 2001.034, may be determined in\nan action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged that the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or\nthreatens to interfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the plaintiff.”) (emphasis added). Finally, TxDot argues that\npermit denial appeals are not contested cases under the APA. For all these reasons, TxDot asserts that the trial court lacks\njurisdiction. The dissent goes a step further and applies this logic to the UDJA claim: it asserts that because Sefzik cannot\nestablish that *135 his rights, status, or legal relations have been affected, there is no jurisdiction.\n\nThese arguments go to the merits of Sefzik’s claims for declaratory relief, not to jurisdiction. It may be that Sefzik’s claims\nfor declaratory relief are not contemplated by the UDJA or the APA. But that is for the trial court to decide on the merits. By\ncharacterizing the APA as a waiver of sovereign immunity, TxDot asks this Court to delve into the merits of Sefzik’s claim,\nwhich is improper at this stage of the proceedings. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist., 34 S.W.3d at 554.\n\n\n\nC. Exercising jurisdiction does not violate separation of powers\n[12] [13]\n          TxDot further argues that by exercising jurisdiction over a UDJA claim based on the interpretation of a constitutional\nor statutory provision, the trial court would violate separation of powers concerns. Specifically, TxDot argues that “if the\ncourts could review any and all statutes and constitutional provisions without reliance on a separate basis of jurisdiction, the\ncourts would in essence exercise unmitigated control over the other branches of government.” Br. of Appellee at 9, Sefzik v.\nTex. Dep’t of Transp., No. 13–06–550–CV (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi Feb. 12, 2007). We do not perceive any violation of the\nseparation of powers doctrine by our holding that a suit for declaratory relief does not invoke the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity. TxDot fails to recognize that sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine, and it is the courts’ province to\ndefine the scope of that doctrine and whether it exists in the first place. Reata Constr. Corp. v. City of Dallas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399904\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399904/reata-const-corp-v-city-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (Tex.2006).\n\nMoreover, under TxDot’s analysis, a suit to test the construction of the statute that applies to an administrative agency could\nnot be entertained. The net effect of such an analysis is that administrative agencies can ignore the APA with impunity,\nleaving a party entitled to procedures under the APA without any method of enforcing those procedures. In short, an agency\ncan deny that the APA applies and claim sovereign immunity from an action seeking to test that determination. Because\nTxDot’s analysis makes the APA a meaningless exercise of legislative power, we decline to adopt it.\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND SEFZIK’S CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n\nSefzik brought claims against TxDot for violations of his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and under Article I, section 19 of the Texas Constitution. U.S. CONST. amends. V, XIV; TEX. CONST.\nart. I, § 19 (“No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner\ndisenfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land.”). He alleged that TxDot failed to afford him due process\nand due course of law by refusing to grant him a hearing in his appeal of TxDot’s denial of his permit application. TxDot\nargues that Sefzik failed to allege the existence of a right protected by these constitutional provisions; therefore, sovereign\nimmunity bars Sefzik’s claim.16 Sefzik argues that it *136 is not necessary to demonstrate a waiver of immunity when a party\nseeks relief for constitutional violations. We agree with TxDot.\n\n16\n       The Texas Supreme Court has held that the Texas Constitution’s due course of law provision, Article I section 19, protects\n       essentially the same interests as the due process provisions in the United States Constitution.

I, too, would hold that the trial court did not err in\nsustaining TxDOT’s plea to the jurisdiction as to these claims. I would also hold that the trial court did not err in granting\nTxDOT’s plea to the jurisdiction with respect to Sefzik’s claims under the UJDA and the APA.\n\n\n\nI. The Texas Administrative Procedure Act\n\nFirst, Sefzik urges that the trial court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Texas Administrative Procedure Act. TEX. GOV’T\nCODE ANN. § 2001.038 (Vernon 2000). The statute provides that the validity or applicability of a rule ... may be determined\nin an action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged that the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or\nthreatens to interfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the plaintiff. Id. While Sefzik urges that he is seeking to\ndetermine the “applicability” of a rule, in fact, the entire APA is the “rule” he seeks to be “applied” to TxDOT’s\npermit-application process.\n\nBy its plain language, section 2001.038 allows a plaintiff to challenge either the validity or applicability of agency rules. Star\nHouston, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Transp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460072\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460072/star-houston-inc-v-texas-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (Tex.App.–Austin 1997, writ denied). To qualify for a\ndeclaratory judgment, one must seek validation or application of a rule. That same rule must interfere with or impair a legal\nright or privilege before it can be applied. Sefzik’s claim is that it is the permit application process, as addressed in the\nadministrative code, that interferes with or impairs his legal right or privilege. The APA does not. Rather, the APA, if\napplied, would expand rather than interfere or impair Sefzik’s right to judicial review. *139 Because Sefzik seeks to apply\nthe APA to his claim even though he claims that it is the administrative code that impairs his purported legal right or\nprivilege, he misapplies the explicit language of section 2001.038. I would hold that Sefzik is not entitled to relief under\nsection 2001.038.\n\n\n\nII. Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA)\n\nThe UDJA enables a person whose “rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance,\ncontract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute,\nordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.004(a) (Vernon 1997) (UDJA). At the very least, it is Sefzik’s burden to establish his right\nto declaratory relief in order to establish jurisdiction. In other words, Sefzik must show that his rights, status or legal relations\nhave been affected.\n\nSection 21.159 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) explicitly denies a permit or license holder contractual or property\nrights from the issuance of a permit or license. It states, “Issuance of a permit or license shall not be deemed to create a\ncontract or property right in the permit holder or license holder.” 43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 21.159 (2008) (Tex. Dep’t of\nTransp., Property Right Not Created). Thus, to conclude that Sefzik, as an applicant for a permit, has a property or\ncontractual right when the statute denies those rights to an actual permit holder is not logical. Because section 21.159 of the\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               9\n\fSefzik v. Texas Dept. of Transp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1794422\"><a href=\"/opinion/1794422/sefzik-v-texas-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008)\n\n\n\nadministrative code precludes Sefzik from claiming any contractual right, he has no right, status or “legal relation” as defined\nby case law. See 43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 21.159. Thus, Sefzik does not have a status or legal relation as required by\nsection 37.004 of the UDJA sufficient to bring his complaint within the court’s power to declare rights, status, and other legal\nrelations. TEX. CIV.

Accordingly, we reverse the injunctive portion of the lower courts’ judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     I\n\n\n\n                                                                     A\n\nThe important features of the historical backdrop to this litigation are not among the issues in dispute and may be described\nas follows.\n\nAt the beginning of this century the public school system of Texas was not well developed. No more than ten percent of\nschool-age children attended public schools, according *434 to the uncontradicted evidence at trial, and as there were few\nprivate and parochial schools in the State, many children were taught at home.\n\nPublic school attendance was not mandatory in Texas until 1916. The first compulsory attendance law, enacted the prior year,\nrequired children between eight and fourteen years of age to attend public school for 60 days during the 1916–1917 school\nyear, 80 days the following year, and 100 days each year afterward. Act of March 8, 1915, 34th Leg., R.S., ch. 49, § 1, 1915\nTex.Gen.Laws 92, 93. Parents (and persons acting as parents) were responsible for assuring that children complied. Id. § 9, at\n96–97. Failure to discharge this responsibility was a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, unless the person in the parental role\ncould not control the child. Id. A child who refused to attend school could be disciplined by the juvenile court as a habitual\ntruant. Id. The statute authorized appointment of attendance officers to enforce its provisions. Id. §§ 6–7, at 94–95.\n\nOver the years the details of these statutory provisions have changed, but the basic structure remains in place.1 Now children\nfrom about six to seventeen years of age must attend public school at least 170 days each school term. TEX.EDUC.CODE §\n21.032(a).2 A parent or person in that role who has been warned in writing to require a child to comply with the compulsory\nattendance law, and who fails to do so, may be fined, and a child’s refusal to attend school may be sanctioned by the juvenile\ncourt. Id. § 4.25(a)-(b);3 *435 TEX.FAM.CODE § 51.03(b)(2).4 Each day a child is absent after warning is given or\nattendance is ordered is a separate offense. TEX.EDUC.CODE § 4.25(a). Also, a parent’s rights in a child may be terminated\nif the parent fails to enroll a child in public school as required by law. TEX.FAM.CODE § 15.02(a)(1)(J)(i).5\n\n1\n       Present statutes omit one significant provision of the 1915 law: “Any child within the compulsory school attendance ages who\n       shall be insubodinate [sic], disorderly, vicious or immoral in conduct, or who persistently violates the reasonable rules and\n       regulations of the school which he attends, or who otherwise persistently misbehaves therein so as to render himself an\n       incorrigible, shall be reported to the person exercising the duties of attendance officer of said school, who shall proceed against\n       such child in the juvenile court as herein provided.” Act of March 8, 1915, 34th Leg., R.S., ch. 49, § 9, 1915 Tex.Gen.Laws 92, 97.\n\n\n\n2\n       “Unless specifically exempted by Section 21.033 of this code or under other laws or unless a child is at least 17 years of age and\n       has been issued a high school equivalency certificate, every child in the state who is as much as six years of age, or who is less than\n       seven years of age and has previously been enrolled in first grade, and who has not completed the academic year in which his 17th\n       birthday occurred shall be required to attend the public schools in the district of his residence or in some other district to which he\n       may be transferred as provided or authorized by law a minimum of 170 days of the regular school term of the district in which the\n       child resides or to which he has been transferred.”\n\n\n\n3\n       Until 1993, § 4.25 provided as follows:\n            (a) If any parent or person standing in parental relation to a child, within the compulsory school attendance ages and not\n            lawfully exempt or properly excused from school attendance, fails to require such child to attend school for such periods as\n            required by law, it shall be the duty of the proper attendance officer to warn, in writing, the parent or person standing in\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

If after this warning the parent or person standing in parental\n            relation intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence fails to require the child to attend school as required\n            by law, the parent or person standing in parental relation commits an offense. The attendance officer shall file a complaint\n            against him in the county court, in the justice court of his resident precinct, or in the municipal court of the municipality in\n            which he resides or in the municipality or justice of the peace precinct in which the school is located. In addition, if the child\n            has been voluntarily absent from school for 10 or more days or parts of days within a six-month period or three or more days\n            or parts of days within a four-week period without the consent of his parents, the attendance officer shall refer the child to the\n            county juvenile probation department for action as conduct indicating a need for supervision under Section 51.03(b), Family\n            Code. A court in which a complaint is filed under this subsection shall give preference to a hearing on the complaint over\n            other cases before the court. An offense under this section is punishable by a fine of not less than $5 nor more than $25 for the\n            first offense, not less than $10 nor more than $50 for the second offense, and not less than $25 nor more than $100 for a\n            subsequent offense. Each day the child remains out of school after the warning has been given or the child ordered to school\n            by the juvenile court may constitute a separate offense. If the court probates the sentence, the court may require the defendant\n            to render personal services to a charitable or educational institution as a condition of probation.\n            (b) It is a defense to prosecution under Subsection (a) of this section that the parent or person standing in parental relation to\n            the child is unable to compel the child to attend school.\n         In 1993, there were three amendments, each without reference to the others, to this version of § 4.25. See Act of May 18, 1993,\n         73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 358, § 2, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 1528, 1629–30; Act of May 28, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 347, § 6.01, 1993\n         Tex.Gen.Laws 1479, 1527–28; Act of May 29, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 930, § 1, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 3949, 3950. None of\n         these amendments are important to the issues in this case.\n\n\n\n4\n       “Conduct indicating a need for supervision is ... the unexcused voluntary absence of a child on 10 or more days or parts of days\n       within a six-month period or three or more days or parts of days within a four-week period from school without the consent of his\n       parents....”\n\n\n\n5\n       “[A] petition requesting termination of the parent-child relationship with respect to a parent who is not the petitioner may be\n       granted if the court finds that ... the parent has ... been the major cause of ... the failure of the child to be enrolled in school as\n       required by the Texas Education Code....”\n\n\n\nThe first compulsory attendance statute exempted several classes of children from compliance, including “[a]ny child in\nattendance upon a private or parochial school or who is being properly instructed by a private tutor.” Act of March 8, 1915,\n34th Leg., R.S., ch. 49, § 2(a), 1915 Tex.Gen.Laws 92, 93. This provision was amended in 1923 to add two requirements for\nprivate and parochial schools and to remove the reference to private tutors, so that the statute was changed to exempt:\n\n            Any child in attendance upon a private or parochial school which shall include in its course a study of\n            good citizenship, and shall make the English language the basis of instruction in all subjects....\n\nAct approved March 23, 1923, 38th Leg., R.S., ch. 121, § 2, 1923 Tex.Gen.Laws 255, 255. At the time, according to all the\nevidence presented in this case, a child pursuing a bona fide course of study at home designed to meet the basic education\ngoals of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and good citizenship was considered to be attending a private school. Thus,\nthe 1923 amendment to the exemption, omitting the reference to private tutors, did not affect children schooled at home. The\nonly other times the exemption was amended was in 1969 and 1971, when the English language restriction was first moved\nand then dropped. See Act of May 7, 1969, 61st Leg., R.S., ch. 289, § 1–3, 1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 871, 871; Act of May 20,\n1971, 62nd Leg., R.S., ch. 405, § 40, 1971 Tex.Gen.Laws 1449, 1513. The exemption, as we noted at the outset, is now\ncodified as § 21.033(a)(1), TEX.EDUC.CODE.\n\nEnactment of the compulsory attendance law in 1915 did not end home schooling; some children continued to be educated at\nhome just as they had before. The important fact, for purposes of analysis of the legal issues before us, is that some\nschool-age children have been educated at home since before the compulsory attendance law was passed in 1915, and the\nState never attempted to prohibit or even restrict home schooling, or to allege a violation of the compulsory attendance law\nbased solely on a child’s being taught at home, until 1981.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

TEX.EDUC.CODE\n        § 11.01. The State Board of Education and the State Board for Vocational Education are identical. Id. § 11.24. The SBOE, which\n        has fifteen members elected from districts in the state, is responsible for implementing legislative policy for the public school\n        system. Id. §§ 11.2101, 11.24. The commissioner of education is the executive officer of the TEA and the SBOE. Id. §§ 11.25,\n        11.52. The State Department of Education is the professional, technical and clerical staff of the TEA. Id. § 11.61.\n\n\n\n\n    In order to avoid the sanctions of compulsory attendance, home instruction would, *436 most likely, have to be qualified\n    as a private school. Unfortunately, there are no provisions in the law which define a private school for these purposes.\n\n      ... [A]s a result of the present status of the law and as a result of the general absence of legislative guidance in this area,\n      school districts and parents alike would be well advised to proceed with caution in this area. In light of all this\n      confusion, it would appear that the courts would be the proper forms [sic] in which to evaluate any particular home\n      study situation as a prospective exemption from compulsory attendance.\n\n    The following year the TEA’s assistant general counsel expressed an even stronger position in response to an inquiry by\n    parents considering home schooling:\n\n      The compulsory student attendance laws of the State of Texas do not permit students to be taught at home.... The\n      exemption statute provides that a child in attendance upon a private or parochial school which shall include in its course\n      a study of good citizenship is exempt from the requirements of compulsory attendance. There is no exemption for home\n      tutorial programs.\n\n      ... A school, whether private, public, or parochial, must include retained and qualified teachers; a collection of students\n      from different families; a curriculum that includes the basic academics as are taught in public schools; and some\n      organizational structure that assures that instruction does, in fact, occur.\n\n       The continuous policy of this office is based upon much more than a cursory review of the statutes. All of our legal\n       research concludes that a person may not teach their children at home simply by calling their home a private school. If\n       educational programs conducted in a home environment are to be allowed as exemption to the compulsory attendance\n       law, action of the Legislature will be required.\nThe Legislature took no action, although a number of bills were introduced in 1985.7 That same year, the Texas Education\nAgency issued a publication entitled HOUSE BILL 72 AND SUBSEQUENT EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION:\nCOMPREHENSIVE REFERENCES AND EXPLANATIONS, which included a section devoted to the compulsory\nattendance law, even though that law was not affected by House Bill 72 or any subsequent educational legislation. For the\nfirst time, the TEA published its interpretation of the private school exemption:\n\n7\n        Tex.H.B. 29, 69th Leg., R.S. (1985) (requiring home educators to register, provide at least 170 days of instruction, and maintain\n        attendance and immunization records, and requiring students not to score below the district average on annual tests); Tex.H.B. 431,\n        69th Leg., R.S. (1985) (exempting persons from compulsory attendance law based upon sincerely held religious belief); Tex.H.B.\n        673, 69th Leg., R.S. (1985) (exempting children schooled by parents from compulsory attendance law). None of these bills were\n        reported out of committee. House Bill 317, which attempted to amend § 4.25(a) of the Education Code by removing parents and\n        guardians of home schooled students from the class of individuals subject to criminal sanctions for violating the compulsory\n        attendance law, was reported out of committee but defeated on the House floor, apparently for fear that the provision would\n        establish a precedent for regulation of home schools. Tex.H.B. 317, 69th Leg., R.S. (1985).\n\n\n\n\n    It is the agency’s interpretation that under this compulsory attendance law, private school attendance is an acceptable\n    substitute for public school attendance. However, educating a child at home is not the same as private school instruction\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Nor\nwere the policy statements from 1981–1985 made after hearings or other proceedings before the TEA. Most importantly, the\nTEA itself now concedes in its briefs and oral argument before this Court that its interpretation of the private school\nexemption, beginning in 1981 and restated in its 1985 publication, was “anomalous”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   B\n\nBased upon the TEA’s policy statements from 1981–1985, school districts and their attendance officers began prosecuting\nviolations of the compulsory attendance law based upon nothing other than the fact that a child was being schooled at home.\nIn all, some 150 prosecutions were initiated, and about 80 of them were actually tried. The State’s position in those\nprosecutions was that a home school was never a private school within the meaning of the statutory exemption, §\n21.033(a)(1), and never exempt from the compulsory attendance law.\n\nTo halt the State’s enforcement of this policy, this class action was filed in March 1985. The district court certified three\nplaintiff classes: one comprised of parents, another of private schools who furnish curricula for home schools, and the third of\nother providers of home school curricula. Specifically, the district court defined the first class as those parents—\n\n              who either [a] have enrolled their school-age children in private or parochial schools outside their\n              homes receiving the curricula and instruction of these schools in their homes which includes in the\n              course a study of good citizenship or [b] have established a private school in their homes which\n              involves in its course a study of good citizenship.\n\nNine married couples with school-age children were named as representatives of the class.8 Two of the couples had been\nprosecuted for violating the compulsory attendance law, based upon the TEA’s 1981 policy, and two others had been\nthreatened with prosecution.9 The second class included the Calvert School, Inc., the First Baptist Academy of Dallas,\nChristian Liberty Academy Satellite Schools, and others “who have established private or parochial schools where the\nstudents receive their curricula including a study of good citizenship and instruction in their homes.” The third class consisted\nof Reform Publications, Inc. d/b/a Basic Education, American Christian Schools, Inc., and others “who provide curricula\nincluding in their courses a study of good citizenship and instruction for private schools in homes.” The Home School Legal\nDefense Association was named as an individual plaintiff.\n\n8\n         The class representatives were Gary W. and Cheryl Leeper, Bruce and Patricia Smythe, Calvin E. and Wanda Minkler, Quinten T.\n         and Sandra Parten Jr., Tony and Suzanne Martinez, Charles and Corlee Kent, John W. and Helen Jackson Jr., Michael R. and Sally\n         K. Galbraith, and Richard and Kay Wells.\n\n\n\n9\n         The Galbraiths and Wells were actually prosecuted; the Leepers and Minklers received letters from school officials threatening\n         prosecution.\n\n\n\nThe district court also certified a defendant class comprised of all “public school districts and their school attendance\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hart.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs contended that defendants had misinterpreted the private school exemption and sought a declaration to that effect\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011. Plaintiffs also claimed that\ndefendants’ enforcement of the compulsory attendance law infringed upon their constitutional rights, in violation of the\nfederal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs sought an injunction prohibiting all school districts and attendance\nofficers from enforcing the compulsory attendance law against bona fide home schools. Plaintiffs also claimed attorney fees.\n\nConsistent with the TEA’s 1985 statement of policy, the Attorney General in his original answer in this suit specifically\ndenied that a home school could be a private school within the meaning of § 21.033(a)(1). No other defendant adopted this\nposition, however, and the Attorney General himself abandoned it in later pleadings. About a year after the suit was filed, on\nApril 12, 1986, the State Board of Education issued a resolution calling upon the Legislature to define the private and\nparochial school exemption and recommending that school districts follow new standards in applying the exemption pending\nlegislative action.11 That resolution stated:\n\n11\n         As noted above, supra n. 6, the SBOE is the component of the TEA charged with implementing legislative policy.\n\n\n\n\n     WHEREAS the State Board of Education has been requested by various parties to define the terms “private or parochial\n     school” as contained in Article 21.033 of the Texas Education Code; and\n\n       WHEREAS the legal authority of the State Board of Education to make such definition has been questioned by various\n       entities, including, we are advised, the Texas Legislative Council;\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, the State Board of Education urges the Texas Legislature either to define such terms or\n       specifically to authorize the State Board of Education to do so at its regular session in 1987.\n\n       The State Board of Education further recommends to the various school districts of Texas that the following guidelines\n       may be utilized in determining whether an entity is a private or parochial school for the purposes of Article 21.033\n       pending the action of the Texas legislature:\n\n         (1) An entity that is accredited by an accrediting organization recognized by the Commissioner of Education, or\n\n         (2) An entity that meets the following criteria:\n\n            a. It instructs students in facilities that comply with applicable local fire and sanitation codes;\n\n            b. It has a written regular plan of instruction sufficient to meet basic student educational goals;\n\n            c. Its students shall annually be administered a recognized nationally norm-referenced standard achievement test.\n            Evidence of such administration and the results thereof shall be furnished upon request to the attendance officer for\n            the public school district in which the private or parochial school is located. The local school district may require\n            that the next administration of such achievement test be by qualified test administrator, or\n\n         (3) An entity that furnishes evidence satisfactory to the attendance officer of the school district in which the private or\n         parochial school is located, that it meets the criteria required by the Commissioner of Education for an entity to be\n         accredited by a recognized accrediting organization under (1) of this section.\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The district court rejected this contention.\nShortly after the SBOE issued the 1986 resolution, the parties to this action notified the members of the various classes that\nthey had reached agreement concerning the proper construction of § 21.033(a)(1). That construction was to be effectuated by\nan agreed interlocutory judgment of the district court which provided in part as follows:\n\n            Accordingly, the Court declares that a school-aged child residing in the State of Texas who is regularly\n            and diligently pursuing in the child’s home a written curriculum of either a private or parochial school\n            in which the child is enrolled which exists apart from the child’s home or which has been obtained\n            from other sources, said curriculum following a regular plan of instruction designed to meet basic\n            educational goals of reading, language arts, mathematics and a study of good citizenship, is considered\n            to be in attendance upon a private or parochial school within the meaning of [§ 21.033(a)(1) ]. The\n            Court further finds that the current curricula of [the named representatives of the second and third\n            plaintiff classes] are written curricula following a regular plan of instruction designed to meet basic\n            educational goals of reading, language arts, mathematics and a study of good citizenship. This finding\n            is made so that the school attendance officers of the public school districts in the State of Texas will be\n            able to identify a curriculum for a school-aged child at home who is considered to be in attendance\n            upon a private or parochial school. The Court also finds that if parents or those standing in the parental\n            relationship to such a child furnish to any public school attendance officer upon his written request the\n            results of a nationally normed standard achievement test which was given in accordance with the\n            instructions accompanying the test and was taken within the preceding twelve (12) months of the\n            written request showing that the child is making reasonable academic progress for that child, then this\n            furnishing shall establish that the child is regularly and diligently pursuing the curriculum being taken.\n\nThe agreement did not encompass plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief, damages and attorney fees. In response to the notice\nto the classes, a number of members of the first class of plaintiffs appeared before the district court and objected to the\nproposed agreed judgment. Consequently, the named plaintiffs withdrew from the agreement, and the proposed judgment was\nnever presented to the district court.\n\nFollowing trial before the bench, the district court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. One portion of that judgment\ndeclared the proper construction of the private school exemption in § 21.033(a)(1). We quote the district court’s declaration,\ninserting divisions among its components:\n\na school-age child\n\n     • residing in the State of Texas who is pursuing under the direction of a parent or parents or one standing in parental\n     authority in or through the child’s home\n\n     • in a bona fide (good faith, not a sham or subterfuge) manner\n\n     • a curriculum consisting of books, workbooks, other written materials, including that which appears on an electronic\n     screen of either a computer or video tape monitor, or any combination of the preceding from either (1) of a private or\n     parochial school which exists apart from the child’s home or (2) which has been developed or obtained from any source,\n\n     • said curriculum designed to meet basic education goals of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and a study of\n     good citizenship,\n\n  is in attendance upon a private or parochial school within the meaning of Section 21.033(a)(1) of the Texas Education\n  Code and exempt from the requirements of compulsory attendance at a public school.\n\nThe court’s judgment further provided:\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, this\n            judgment is not to be interpreted as requiring standardized tests in order for there to be compliance\n            with the interpretation made by the court of [§ 21.033(a)(1) ]. The lawful powers of investigation by\n            public school attendance officers and the constitutional rights of persons subject to such investigations\n            are not affected by this judgment.\n\nThis construction of § 21.033(a)(1), and the use of standardized tests as one indicia of compliance, are essentially the same\nprovisions to which the parties agreed prior to trial before plaintiffs withdrew their consent.\n\nThe district court also held that children of the named representatives of the parent class and children studying materials\nprovided by the named plaintiff institutions at home in a bona fide manner were exempt from the compulsory attendance law.\nThe district court determined that any enforcement of the policy in the 1985 publication or the recommendation in the 1986\nresolution would violate plaintiffs’ due process and equal protection rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions.\nThe court permanently enjoined all school districts and attendance officers from initiating charges of violations of the\ncompulsory attendance law based upon any construction of § 21.033(a)(1) other than that contained in the court’s declaratory\njudgment. Finally, the court awarded plaintiffs attorney fees against the school districts, but not against any of the other\ndefendants.\n\nThe court of appeals concluded that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under the state declaratory judgments act because the\ncompulsory attendance law is penal. 843 S.W.2d at 48. The court based this conclusion on the rule that the constitutionality\nof a criminal statute cannot be determined, and its enforcement enjoined, in a civil proceeding absent a showing of irreparable\ninjury to plaintiffs’ property rights, which has not been attempted in this case.

The court did not explain why this rule should apply to the private school exemption in § 21.033(a)(1), which is\na civil statute distinct from the enforcement provisions of § 4.25, or why the rule should preclude a construction of §\n21.033(a)(1) without reference to its constitutionality. The court of appeals did hold, however, that plaintiffs had\ndemonstrated a violation of their constitutional rights to equal protection, and were therefore entitled to all the relief awarded\nby the district court under the federal Civil Rights Act. 843 S.W.2d at 48–51. In the course of its analysis the court concluded\nthat the district court properly construed the private school exemption. Id. at 51–52.\n\nWe granted writ of error to review the correctness of the district court’s construction of the private school exemption, the\npropriety of injunctive relief, and the award of attorney fees to plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                               II\n\nBefore we turn to the central issues in the case, we must address three jurisdictional issues raised by defendants: whether\nplaintiffs’ action was mooted by the SBOE’s 1986 resolution; whether plaintiffs seek to construe and enjoin enforcement of a\ncriminal statute over which a civil district court lacked jurisdiction; and whether the TEA’s 1986 resolution regarding the\nprivate school exemption is an administrative rulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                A\n[1]\n  Defendants contend that plaintiffs’ complaints are directed against the TEA’s 1985 policy statement which defendants now\nadmit was “anomalous” and which the TEA has abandoned. Defendants argue that plaintiffs meet the standard the SBOE\nadopted in its 1986 resolution and thus can no longer complain of the TEA’s enforcement of the compulsory attendance law.\n\n*441 Although there is language in the court of appeals’ opinion to suggest that the named individual plaintiffs in the action\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The first\nrequirement of the 1986 resolution is that the facilities where students are instructed—i.e., plaintiffs’ homes—comply with\napplicable local fire and sanitation codes. There is no evidence that the nine couples named in the action instruct their\nchildren in homes that comply with applicable local fire and sanitation codes (or, for that matter, of what those codes require\nof homes). The third requirement of the 1986 resolution is that students be given nationally norm-referenced standard\nachievement tests annually. According to the evidence at trial, only one of the nine plaintiff couples met this requirement.\nEight of the plaintiff parents testified that they had tested their children at least once, but two testified that they would not do\nso again because they know without tests how their children are progressing. There is no evidence whether one of the nine\ncouples did or did not give their children achievement tests. Plaintiffs oppose making either of these factors—compliance\nwith building codes or administration of achievement tests—essential to qualification for the private school exemption. With\nrespect to the second requirement of the 1986 resolution—a written plan of instruction sufficient to meet basic student\neducational goals—plaintiffs agreed that some plan was important but that it did not always need to be written. Moreover, it\nis not clear whether plaintiffs and the TEA would agree on what are basic student educational goals.\n\nIn sum, plaintiffs and defendants do not agree on when home schooled children should be exempt from the compulsory\nattendance law. Plaintiffs contend that the 1986 resolution does not correctly construe § 21.033(a)(1); defendants disagree. A\ncase is moot when there is no actual controversy between the parties.

The disagreement among the parties in this case is not academic or abstract; it is real and affects\nthe rights and interests of all parties. The case is clearly not moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 B\n[2] [3]\n     Defendants argue, and the court of appeals concluded, that the district court had no jurisdiction to construe and enjoin\nenforcement of § 21.033(a)(1) in a civil proceeding because it is a criminal statute. Defendants and the appeals court are\ncorrect that, as a rule, a party cannot seek to construe or enjoin enforcement of a criminal statute in a civil proceeding without\na showing of irreparable injury to the party’s vested property rights, which showing is absent here. See State v. Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2444286\"><a href=\"/opinion/2444286/state-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1994). However, the rule does not apply in this case because § 21.033(a)(1) is not a criminal statute.\n\nIt clearly is not a criminal statute on its face, and defendants do not argue that it is; rather, they argue that it is in effect a\ndefense to prosecution under § 4.25, which clearly is a criminal statute, and that the general compulsory attendance provision,\n§ 21.032(a), the exemptions, § 21.033, and the enforcement provision, § 4.25, should all be read together as parts of a penal\nprovision. That the three statutes must be read together cannot be denied: it is impossible to determine whether a fine should\nbe imposed under § 4.25 without determining whether the subject child is exempt from attending public schools under §\n21.033. That fact alone, however, does not dictate that a statute which is not criminal on its face must be considered part of\none that is, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of civil courts to construe.\n\nIf the sole function of § 21.033 were to define the elements of the offense proscribed by § 4.25, or the elements of a defense\nto prosecution, the question whether § 21.033 is penal would be much closer. As it is, § 21.033 serves a function unrelated to\nprosecution under § 4.25. It is part of the basis for determining whether a child who is not in attendance in public school is\nsubject to supervision under § 51.03 of the Family Code, *442 and whether a parent of the child may have his or her parental\nrights terminated for failing to enroll the child in school under § 15.02 of the Family Code. Not only is § 21.033 on its face a\ncivil statute, it also has civil consequences. Defendants cite no authority for treating a statute like § 21.033 as a criminal\nstatute.\n[4]\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs have foregone any claim to relief under the declaratory judgment statutes because they did\nnot perfect an appeal to this Court from the court of appeals’ adverse ruling on this issue. Such an appeal, however, was\nunnecessary. The appellate court’s judgment upheld plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, albeit on the basis\nof § 1983 and not state law. Since plaintiffs prevailed in the court of appeals, they are entitled to support that court’s\njudgment by any argument, including those that the appellate court rejected. They need not perfect a separate application for\nwrit of error unless they wish to obtain from this Court a different and more favorable judgment. See Donwerth v.

TEX.GOV’T CODE §\n2001.038.12 The recommendation contained in the resolution, defendants argue, fits squarely within the statutory definition of\nan administrative rule: “a state agency statement of general applicability that ... implements, interprets, or prescribes law or\npolicy....” Id. § 2001.003(6)(A)(i). Plaintiffs respond that the Legislature has not authorized the SBOE to make rules\nconstruing private schools generally or § 21.033(a)(1) in particular. Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that the 1986 resolution\ncannot be a rule because it does not say it is a rule and the SBOE made no attempt in issuing it to comply with the notice and\nhearing requirements for rulemaking proceedings. Defendants answer that plaintiffs’ arguments are precisely the sort of\ncomplaints that § 2001.038 of the APA requires to be raised in a district court in Travis County. Defendants also argue that\nplaintiffs were required to raise their complaints within two years of the issuance of the 1986 resolution under § 2001.035 of\nthe APA.13\n\n12\n       The law governing administrative rulemaking in 1986, TEX.REV.CIV.STAt.Ann. ART. 6252–13A, HAS SINCE BEEN\n       RECODIFIED AS CHAPTER 2001 OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CASE THE REPEALED\n       PROVISIONS ARE IDENTICAL TO THE RECODIFIED PROVISIONS, AND WE REFER TO THE LATTER.\n         Section 2001.038 provides in pertinent part:\n         “(a) The validity or applicability of a rule ... may be determined in an action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged that the rule\n         or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the\n         plaintiff.\n         “(b) The action may be brought only in a Travis County district court.”\n\n\n\n13\n       “(a) A rule adopted after January 1, 1976, is not valid unless a state agency adopts it in substantial compliance with Sections\n       2001.023 through 2001.034 [prescribing notice, hearing, and other requirements].\n                    “(b) A person must initiate a proceeding to contest a rule on the ground of noncompliance with the\n                    procedural requirements of Sections 2001.023 through 2001.034 not later than the second anniversary of\n                    the effective date of the rule.”\n\n\n\nIn effect, defendants argue that although the SBOE did not treat the 1986 resolution as a rule at the time, and did not follow\nany of the procedures prescribed by statute for adopting rules, the resolution is a rule which can be challenged only in a\nTravis County District Court, and the time for complaining about the total lack of any rulemaking procedures has passed. At\nbest, this argument is disingenuous. On its face, the resolution is little more than an urging to the Legislature to further define\nthe private and parochial *443 school exemption in § 21.033(a)(1). It goes no further than to “recommend[ ] to the various\nschool districts ... guidelines ... pending the action of the Texas legislature”. It even recites that the SBOE’s authority to\ndefine “private or parochial school” has been challenged by various entities, among them the Texas Legislative Council. As\nthe SBOE is charged with implementing legislative policy, an opinion of the Legislative Council that the SBOE lacked\nauthority to clarify § 21.033(a)(1) would appear to be entitled to considerable weight.14 The SBOE offers no explanation why,\nif it thought the resolution was an agency rule in 1986, it made no effort to comply with the requirements of the APA before\nthe resolution issued.\n\n14\n       The Texas Legislative Council is a legislative agency composed of the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of\n       Representatives, the chairs of the Senate and House administration committees, four other senators, and nine other representatives.\n       TEX.GOV’T CODE § 323.001(a)-(b).

PIERCE, JR., ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE § 6.2 (3d ed. 1994)\n       (distinguishing statements to which federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, does and does not apply); 3 BASIL J.\n       MEZINES, JACOB A. STEIN & JULES GRUFF, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW § 15.07[4] (1990, Supp.1991) (distinguishing\n       statements to which federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, does and does not apply).\n\n\n\nSince plaintiffs’ challenge to the 1986 resolution is not governed by the APA, the district court had jurisdiction of this case.\nHaving reached this conclusion, we need not address plaintiffs’ contention that the SBOE has no authority to make rules\nconstruing § 21.033(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                III\n[6]\n   We come now to the central issue in the case. Defendants acknowledge, contrary to their position from 1981–1986, that a\nhome school can be a private school within the meaning of § 21.033(a)(1). Plaintiffs do not contend that every home school\nfalls within the exemption, but only, as the district court held, homes in which children are taught in a bona fide manner from\na curriculum designed to meet basic education goals. Plaintiffs also do not contend that the use of standard achievement tests\ncannot be considered in ascertaining whether a home school is being taught in a bona fide manner; they argue only, again as\nthe district court held, that the use of such tests cannot be the determining factor.\n\nThe evidence in support of the district court’s construction of § 21.033(a)(1) is virtually undisputed. Defendants do not deny\nthat from 1916 to 1981 students in bona fide home schools were not prosecuted for violation of the compulsory attendance\nlaw. Defendants also concede that the TEA’s policy from 1981–1986, that no home school could be a private school within\nthe meaning of § 21.033(a)(1), was wrong. Defendants acknowledge the right of parents to teach their children at home and\nthe efficacy of that means of education when it is conducted in a bona fide manner. Defendants were willing to agree before\ntrial to essentially the same construction of § 21.033(a)(1) as the district court eventually reached. Defendants argue even\nnow that the nine plaintiff couples come within the “private school” exemption from the compulsory attendance law, even\nthough there is no evidence that they have met two of the elements prescribed by the 1986 resolution. From the record before\nus, we conclude that the district court’s declaration of the meaning of “private school” in *444 § 21.033(a)(1), as it relates to\nhome schools, is clearly correct.\n\nDefendants argue that the district court’s judgment deprives the SBOE of its proper role in developing policies for the public\nschools. We do not believe that it does. The SBOE has the power and duty to “take actions necessary to implement legislative\npolicy for the public school system of the state.” TEX.EDUC.CODE § 11.24(a). Legislative policy regarding the exemption\nof students in private schools from attendance in public schools is expressed in § 21.033(a)(1). The district court has\nconstrued that provision as it has been understood and applied for most of this century. The SBOE continues to have\nresponsibility for implementing the statutory policy. The SBOE is not authorized, however, to change legislative policy; that\nis the sole province of the Legislature. The Legislature has not accepted the SBOE’s invitation in its 1986 resolution to\nclarify the private school exemption. The Legislature has indicated, however, that it considers home schools to fall within the\nexemption. In amending § 4.25 and other provisions of the Education Code in 1989, the Legislature stated:\n\n            Nothing in this Act applies to students in attendance upon a private or parochial school, which includes\n            home schools, in accordance with Section 21.033, Education Code.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\ndecision we reach does not require that we address this argument today. On the other hand, nothing in our opinion precludes\nthe TEA from setting such guidelines for enforcement of the compulsory attendance law as are within its authority.\nSpecifically, the TEA is not precluded from requesting evidence of achievement test results in determining whether children\nare being taught in a bona fide manner. While administration of such tests cannot be a prerequisite to exemption from the\ncompulsory attendance law, we do not preclude the TEA from giving this factor heavy weight. Should the SBOE choose to\npromulgate additional rules under the Administrative Procedure Act, its authority to do so and the propriety of such rules will\nbe subject to judicial review.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    IV\n\nThe district court awarded plaintiffs costs and attorney fees to be paid by the defendant school districts, but not by any of the\nother defendants.16 The court based its award on a provision of the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act [“the DJA”],\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009, which authorizes the award of such reasonable and necessary attorney fees as are\njust and equitable, and 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The court of appeals affirmed, but only on the basis of § 1988. We conclude that\nthe award of attorney fees was proper under the DJA and do not address § 1988.\n\n16\n       The trial court also concluded that the representative school district fees should not have to bear their attorney fees and expenses\n       alone, and awarded these districts fees from the other districts in the defendant class. The representative districts do not argue that\n       governmental immunity would bar their awards from the other districts.\n\n\n\nThe school districts argue that as a rule they have governmental immunity from liability for attorney fees, and that this\nimmunity is not waived by the DJA. A number of decisions from the courts of appeals have concluded that the DJA does not\nwaive governmental immunity for attorneys fees.17 At *445 least one appellate court has concluded that the Act does waive\ngovernmental immunity from an award of attorney fees and costs for a municipality, insofar as the Act defines “person” as\nincluding municipalities, requires municipalities to be joined in actions involving the validity of an ordinance, and allows\nawards of attorney fees and costs without any indication of an intent to exempt municipalities.18 Several other cases affirm\nattorney fee awards against governmental entities without any discussion of sovereign immunity.19\n\n17\n       See Dallas Area Rapid Transit v.

Id. §§ 37.002, .003(a). A person “whose\nrights, *446 status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have\ndetermined any question of construction or validity arising under the statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a\ndeclaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Id. § 37.004(a). All persons who have or claim any interest\nthat would be affected by the declaration must be made parties; those not made a party are not prejudiced by any declaration.\nId. § 37.006(a). If the validity of a municipal ordinance or franchise is involved, a municipality must be made a party, and if a\nstatute, ordinance, or franchise is alleged to be unconstitutional, the attorney general must be served with a copy of the\nproceeding and is entitled to be heard. Id. § 37.006(b). The Act specifically authorizes an award of “costs and reasonable and\nnecessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.” Id. § 37.009.\n[7]\n   The DJA expressly provides that persons may challenge ordinances or statutes, and that governmental entities must be\njoined or notified. Governmental entities joined as parties may be bound by a court’s declaration on their ordinances or\nstatutes. The Act thus contemplates that governmental entities may be—indeed, must be—joined in suits to construe their\nlegislative pronouncements. These provisions provide the context for the Act’s authorization, in § 37.009, of attorney fee\nawards. We conclude that by authorizing declaratory judgment actions to construe the legislative enactments of governmental\nentities and authorizing awards of attorney fees, the DJA necessarily waives governmental immunity for such awards.\n\nThe school districts complain that the award of fees was not properly adjudicated against them, in that plaintiffs’ claims were\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We note, however, that the district court directed the award to be paid by the\nTEA from funds designated for public school districts. The school districts also complain about the inclusion of various items\nin the district court’s award. They argue that plaintiffs were required to segregate time spent on temporary injunctive relief\nand the non-federal claims on which plaintiffs did not prevail. The record reflects that all plaintiffs’ attorneys’ time was spent\non issues related to the declaratory relief which was granted. The school districts also argue that some items of expenses and\ncosts were not recoverable.

There is no indication, however, that defendants will attempt to contravene the district court’s\njudgment, or ours. On the contrary, we are confident that defendants will abide by our decision in carrying out their duties.\nAccordingly, we conclude that issuance of a permanent injunction was unnecessary and should be reversed.22\n\n22\n       The school district defendants argue that the classes of plaintiffs and defendants were improperly certified for an award of\n       injunctive relief. Defendants do not make the same argument with respect to the award of declaratory relief. As we have reversed\n       the district court’s injunction, we need not consider whether the classes were properly certified.\n\n\n\nThe lower courts held that defendants had violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and § 1983 of the federal Civil Rights Act.\nAs we have accorded plaintiffs all the relief to which they are entitled under the Declaratory Judgments Act, we do not reach\ntheir constitutional arguments under § 1983. The 1986 resolution acknowledged that home schooling may involve\nconstitutional claims of religious freedom. Our decision today need not, and does not, address such claims.\n\n******\n\nThe judgment of the court of appeals is reversed insofar as it affirms the district court’s permanent injunction.

For this reason alone, the order that the defendants pay attorneys’ fees is erroneous.\n\nThe Court compounds its error by determining that the DJA implicitly authorizes the plaintiffs’ recovery of attorneys’ fees in\nthis declaratory judgment suit. 893 S.W.2d at 445–46. This holding conflicts with the legislative admonishment that a\n“resolution granting permission to sue does not waive to any extent immunity from liability.” TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE § 107.002(b) (Supp.1995) (emphasis added). When the Legislature was considering the House Bill it later\nenacted as the attorney fee provision of the DJA, the director of the Legislative Budget Board sent a fiscal note to the\nCommittee on Judiciary of the House of Representatives which stated:\n\n            No fiscal implication or additional cost to the State or units of local government attributable to the bill,\n            should it be enacted, is anticipated.\n\nFISCAL NOTE, Tex.H.B. 375, 67th Leg., R.S., ch. 190, § 1, 1981 Tex.Gen.Laws 455, 455 (amending TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.\nart. 2524–1 § 10, now codified at TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009). The Legislature did not intend or foresee that\nit was authorizing the award of attorneys’ fees and court costs against state entities when it amended the DJA.\n\nOnly through a feat of statutory sleight of hand does the Court achieve its holding that attorneys’ fees can be awarded under\nthe DJA. The result is a disappearing act for the rule requiring a clear and unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity. As\nstated, the DJA simply does not contain a clear and unambiguous statement that a governmental entity may be held liable for\nattorneys’ fees. See TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009. The Legislature certainly has the power to place this burden\non taxpayers. However, in my opinion, it has not done so in the clear and unambiguous language that this Court has\npreviously required.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nI would retain the rule that the Legislature must expressly waive sovereign immunity. By finding an implied waiver of\nsovereign immunity in this case, the Court disturbs an important principle in the law of sovereign immunity. Presumably a\nplaintiff may now recover whatever costs, fees, or damages which he or she can persuade a trial court that a statute impliedly\nallows. By its ruling today, the Court turns the law of sovereign immunity on its head. Now a governmental entity will have\nto identify statutes that expressly bar recovery of costs, fees, or damages before it will be excused from such liability. Thus,\nthe Court’s implied waiver ruling introduces a grave threat to the state’s financial resources.\n\nFurthermore, the Legislature is perfectly capable of drafting statutes which expressly waive sovereign immunity, without\nassistance from us or any other court. For example, the Texas Tort Claims Act has a clear and unambiguous waiver of\nsovereign immunity, thereby allowing a plaintiff to bring suit against a governmental entity in certain circumstances. See\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 101.025(a) (“Sovereign immunity to suit is waived and abolished to the extent of liability\ncreated by this chapter.”). However, the Texas Tort Claims Act does not expressly provide for the recovery of fees and costs,\nand no court has awarded them to a plaintiff under the Act. See id. § 101.021(1) (allowing a governmental unit to be liable\nsolely for “property damage, personal injury, and *449 death”); id. § 101.023 (capping liability for bodily injury or death).\nSimilarly, the Open Government Act expressly authorizes actions against otherwise immune governmental entities in order to\nprevent violations of the Act. TEX.GOV’T CODE § 551.142. In contrast to the Texas Tort Claims Act, the Open\nGovernment Act unambiguously states that a court “may assess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a\nplaintiff ... who substantially prevails in an action” against members of “a governmental body.” Id. Finally, the\nWhistleblower Act expressly provides for waiver of immunity and for recovery of attorneys’ fees. See id. §§ 554.001–.009. If\na state agency or local government suspends, terminates, or discriminates against a public employee who has reported a law\nviolation, the employee is entitled to sue for injunctive relief, actual and exemplary damages, court costs, and “reasonable\nattorneys’ fees.”1 Id. §§ 554.002, 554.003(a). There are other examples in which the Legislature has expressly authorized the\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees or costs from a governmental entity. See, e.g., TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE § 105.002; id. §\n106.002(b). The Legislature’s specificity of language in the Open Government Act and the Whistleblower Act sharply\ncontrasts with the general provisions the Court relies on in this case for awarding attorneys’ fees under the DJA.\n\n1\n       Even then, it may take a legislative appropriation to collect a judgment from the state. See Green v. Sharp, 37 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. 1227\n       (Sept. 29, 1994) (orig. proceeding) (overruling motion for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the Comptroller\n       of Public Accounts to issue a check from the state treasury to satisfy a judgment against the Texas Department of Human\n       Services); Texas Dep’t of Human Servs. v.

Holding that the DJA waives sovereign\nimmunity to the extent of allowing an award of attorneys’ fees in this case could “divert money from the schools and would\nthereby impair the quality and availability of public education.” Duson v. Midland County Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1669700\"><a href=\"/opinion/1669700/duson-v-midland-cty-ind-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n429 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1981, no writ) (affirming the nonapplicability of the Texas Tort Claims Act to public school\ndistricts). Unless the plaintiffs are required to obtain a legislative appropriation to collect the $400,000 judgment, the\npotential drain of tax dollars to pay attorneys’ fees from funds earmarked for education cannot be minimized.2 In today’s\nlitigious society, suits against school districts over dress codes, school prayer, sex education, cheerleader selections, and the\nlike are not uncommon. Such litigation drains scarce funds and diverts the energies of school officials from the task of\neducation. Because of the tremendous costs associated with litigating these issues, some school districts will decide to\ncompromise on matters of principle rather than go to court and defend them. Unless the Legislature revisits the issue of\ngovernmental immunity from attorneys’ fees and court costs, to correct the Court’s holding in this case, there is the potential\nof a further drain on scarce educational dollars.\n\n2\n       For example, besides the $400,000 award for attorneys’ fees and court costs from public school funds in this case, a trial court in\n       another case recently awarded $48,000 to the attorneys of an elementary school student who challenged the hair grooming\n       regulations of the school district he was attending.

The relief he seeks\n       —a declaration that he is entitled to a hearing—is directly related to whether Behrens acted outside the scope of his authority in\n       denying a hearing. That is, Sefzik ultimately wishes to compel a government official (Behrens) to perform some act that he considers\n       to be nondiscretionary (holding a hearing).

Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 405. Immunity from suit prohibits suits against the State\nunless the State expressly consents to the suit. Id. Thus, even if the State acknowledges liability on a claim, immunity from\nsuit bars a remedy until the Legislature consents to suit. Id. Immunity from liability protects the State from judgments even\nafter the State has consented to suit. Id. Accordingly, even if the Legislature has authorized a claimant to sue, the State’s\nimmunity is retained until it acknowledges liability. Id.

Accordingly, we\nexamine factors we have employed to determine whether a statute that is less explicit may nevertheless waive the State’s\nimmunity from suit.\n\n6\n            See, e.g., TEX. CIV.

June 15, 1995.\n\n\n[12]\n    We have on rare occasions found waiver of sovereign immunity absent “magic words,” such as the State’s “sovereign\nimmunity to suit and liability is waived.” Although it is more difficult to discern legislative consent under those\ncircumstances, we have employed several aids to help guide our analysis in determining whether the Legislature has clearly\nand unambiguously waived sovereign immunity. First, a statute that waives the State’s immunity must do so beyond doubt,\neven though we do not insist that the statute be a model of “perfect clarity.” City of LaPorte v. Barfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432530\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432530/city-of-laporte-v-barfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n291–92 (Tex.1995).

See, e.g., TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§\n101.023–.024; TEX. GOV’T CODE §§ 554.003, 2007.023. Therefore, when deciding whether the Legislature intended to\nwaive sovereign immunity and permit monetary damages against the State, one factor to consider is whether the statute also\nprovides an objective limitation on the State’s potential liability. See IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854 (noting that “[s]ubjecting\nthe government to liability may hamper governmental functions by shifting tax resources away from their intended purposes\ntoward defending lawsuits and paying judgments”); Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 413–16 (Hecht, J., concurring) (noting that\n“even if the Court were to abolish governmental immunity from contract suits, successful plaintiffs still could not be paid\nwithout legislative appropriation”); see also Barfield, 898 S.W.2d at 297 (stating that the rules for waiver of sovereign\nimmunity apply to both the existence and extent of the waiver).\n\nWith these principles in mind, we will examine the statute to determine whether the Legislature waived immunity by\nadopting section 321 of the patient’s bill of rights.\n\n\n\nC. The Patient’s Bill of Rights\nIn 1993, Texas enacted a patient’s bill of rights. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 321.002. Section 321.002 requires that\nthe Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse\n“protect the health, safety, and rights of a patient receiving voluntary or involuntary mental health, chemical dependency, or\ncomprehensive medical rehabilitation services in an inpatient facility.” Id. § 321.002. Section 321.003 permits a person\nharmed by a mental health facility’s violation of the patient’s bill of rights to sue for injunctive relief, damages, or both. Id. §\n321.003(b). A plaintiff who prevails under section 321.003 may recover actual damages, exemplary damages, and attorney’s\nfees. Id. § 321.003(c), (d)\n\nTaylor contends that the Legislature expressly waived the Hospital’s sovereign immunity by providing that a patient “may\nsue” a “mental health facility” for damages and other relief caused by those violations. Section 321.003 provides in part:\n\n       (a) A treatment facility or mental health facility that violates a provision of, or a rule adopted under, this chapter ... is\n       liable to a person receiving care or treatment in or from the facility who is harmed as a result of the violation.\n\n       (b) A person who has been harmed by a violation may sue for injunctive relief, damages, or both.\n\nId. § 321.003(a), (b) (emphasis added). Nowhere does this section expressly authorize suit against the State of Texas.\nTherefore, we must examine whether the statute waives the State’s immunity by necessary implication.\n[17]\n    Taylor argues that immunity is waived because the term “mental health facility” includes the Texas Department of *699\nMental Health and Mental Retardation. Taylor acknowledges that the term “mental health facility” is not expressly defined in\nthe statute. She observes, however, that section 321.001—the definitional section of chapter 321—provides that “mental\nhealth facility” has the meaning assigned by section 571.003. See id. § 321.001(4). Accordingly, we turn to section 571.003\nto determine if it contains an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nSection 571.003, enacted as part of the Texas Mental Health Code two years before chapter 321’s enactment, refers expressly\nto governmental agencies or facilities. Specifically, section 571.003(12) defines “mental health facility” as:\n\n       (A) an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility operated by the department, a federal agency, a political\n       subdivision, or any person;\n\n       (B) a community center or a facility operated by a community center; or\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id. § 571.003(5). Taylor argues that, by incorporating the prior definition of mental health facility into the\nliability-creating provision of section 321, the Legislature clearly and unambiguously meant to waive the State’s immunity\nfrom suit.\n\nWhile the definition of “mental health facility” includes state-operated facilities, it does not contain the sort of explicit\nlanguage the Legislature generally uses to confirm its intent to waive sovereign immunity.7 Thus, we must determine whether\nthis incorporated definition is the functional equivalent of an explicit legislative directive waiving the State’s immunity.\n\n7\n       See statutes cited supra notes 5 and 6.\n\n\n\nLower courts have split on whether section 571.003(12)’s definition, read in conjunction with section 321.003(b), is a “clear\nand unambiguous” statement of the Legislature’s intent to waive sovereign immunity.8 In refusing to find a waiver of\nsovereign immunity, one court of appeals noted that, although the statute authorizes actions against private facilities licensed\nby state health care regulatory agencies, it does not “clearly express an intent to waive immunity by authorizing actions\nagainst governmental entities.” Tex.

The court of\nappeals reasoned that the statutory scheme at issue in Barfield was not comparable to chapter 321 because it dealt with\nincorporation of subsequently enacted legislation, while chapter 321’s incorporation of “mental health facility” occurred\nsimultaneously with passage of that statute. Rodriguez, 45 S.W.3d at 712. Concluding that Barfield did not control, the court\nof appeals held that the Legislature waived sovereign immunity and that any other interpretation would render the statute’s\nlanguage meaningless. Id. at 711–12.\n\nThe interpretation adopted by the court of appeals in this case, however, overlooks the fact that section 321.003 creates a\nmeaningful cause of action against private mental health care facilities, a claim that remains viable even if suit against the\ngovernment is barred. As noted above, the fact that the Act remains viable despite the retention of immunity is one indication\nthat the Legislature did not intend to waive immunity by implication. None of the authorities cited by the court of appeals\npersuades us otherwise.\n\nIn Barfield, we found a clear and unambiguous waiver of immunity for claims of wrongful discharge against municipalities\nbecause the statute had no purpose if immunity had not been waived. 898 S.W.2d at 296–97. Unlike the statute in Barfield,\nthe patient’s bill of rights undoubtedly applies to private mental health facilities, so it is neither without meaning nor purpose\nif it is construed against waiver. Indeed, the Act’s legislative history indicates that it was designed to curb abuse in private\nmental health facilities. See SENATE COMM. ON HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS., BILL ANALYSIS, Tex.

(1993) (noting that a study of private psychiatric and substance abuse facilities “revealed surprising and somewhat\nshocking activities taking place in certain private treatment facilities ”) (emphasis added); see also TEX. GOV’T CODE §\n311.023(1),(3) (in construing statutes, courts may consider the legislative history and the object sought to be obtained). As\none court of appeals noted, “[t]here is nothing in the statute’s history to suggest that the legislature was even aware of the\nexistence of similar abuse in public facilities.” Lee, 38 S.W.3d at 871. Thus, the patient’s bill of rights achieves its stated\nobjective of regulating private treatment facilities even if suit against the State is barred by sovereign immunity. Cf. Kerrville,\n28 S.W.3d at 6 (holding that the anti-retaliation statute had no meaning absent waiver of sovereign immunity). Accordingly,\nthe patient’s bill of rights does not waive the State’s immunity beyond doubt.\n\nCarried to its logical conclusion, Taylor’s argument would require us to hold that the Legislature intended to waive immunity\nnot only for the State of Texas, but also for the United States. Section 571.003 includes in its definition of “mental health\nfacilities” hospitals or clinics operated by a federal agency. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 571.003(12). Because a\nstate legislature has no authority to waive federal immunity, the Legislature could not have intended a wholesale\nincorporation of section 571.003 into section 321.001(1).

Instead, had the Legislature intended state agencies to be included, it would\nhave either stated that intention expressly or incorporated only that part of section 571.003 applicable to state agencies.\n\nAt best, the incorporation of section 571.003 into section 321.001 sewed ambiguity into the statute. But in cases like this, we\nrequire the Legislature to express its intent beyond doubt and will construe ambiguities in a manner that retains the State’s\nimmunity. See Magnolia Petroleum Co. v.

Any ambiguity or obscurity in the terms of the statute must operate in favor of the\nstate.”). The statute’s ambiguity precludes our finding an unmistakable Legislative intent to waive sovereign immunity.\n\nAnother factor we have examined is whether the statute requires the State to be joined in litigation involving the patient’s bill\nof rights. Unlike the statute at issue in Texas Education Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 446, which required that the State\nbe sued, nothing in the patient’s bill of rights requires joinder of the State or its agencies. Compare TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM.CODE § 37.006, with TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 321.002. This is yet another indication that the Legislature\ndid not intend to waive immunity simply by incorporating section 571.003’s pre-existing definition of “mental health\nfacility” into the patient’s bill of rights.\n[18]\n    Finally, by examining attributes of waiver that exist when the Legislature expressly waives immunity, we have a reliable\nguidepost to determine if the Legislature intended to waive immunity when its intent is less clear. In particular, we note that\nin many statutes waiving sovereign immunity explicitly, the Legislature appends a measure designed to protect the public\ntreasury from the consequences of that waiver.9 Our decisions recognizing a waiver of immunity have generally left\nundisturbed the Legislature’s interest in protecting the State’s financial resources. See, e.g., Barfield, 898 S.W.2d at 299\n(limiting damages to those authorized by the Texas Tort Claims Act); Kerrville, 28 S.W.3d at 9–10 (limiting damages to\nthose authorized by the Texas Tort Claims Act); Leeper, 893 S.W.2d at 446 (waiving governmental liability for attorney’s\nfees only).\n\n9\n       See, e.g., TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 101.023(a) ( “Liability of the state government under this chapter is limited to\n       money damages in a maximum amount of $250,000 for each person and $500,000 for each single occurrence for bodily injury or\n       death and $100,000 for each single occurrence for injury to or destruction of property.”); Id. § 81.010(b) (patient may only obtain\n       an order requiring the governmental unit to discharge the mental health services provider who committed the conduct, court costs,\n       and reasonable attorney’s fees, as determined by the court); TEX.
