Pollak, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation. Judge Pollak died on May 8,\n2012; this opinion is filed by a quorum of the court. 28 U.S.C. § 46 and Third Circuit\nIOP 12.1(b).\n\fSLOVITER, Circuit Judge.\n\n       The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et\n\nseq., mandates that states establish procedures by which, “[t]o the maximum extent\n\nappropriate,” children with disabilities are educated together with nondisabled children.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). Appellants E.G. and L.G. are the parents of E.G. (“L.”), 1\n\nwho has been diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder and autism spectrum\n\ndisorder. At the heart of the present dispute is a proposed individualized education\n\nprogram (“IEP”) written for L. by the Fair Lawn Board of Education (“Fair Lawn”) that\n\ndid not specifically provide for interaction with typically developing peers. L.’s parents\n\npetition this court for review of a decision of the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Jersey granting summary judgment to Fair Lawn on L.’s parents’ claim\n\nfor reimbursement of the costs associated with their placement of L., contrary to the\n\nprovisions of Fair Lawn’s proposed IEP, in an “inclusive” preschool, attended both by\n\nchildren with disabilities and those without. For the reasons given below, the District\n\nCourt’s decision will be affirmed.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       Because we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we will\n\nprovide only a brief summary of its extensive background here.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Although the caption refers to the child as “E.G.” we refer to her as “L.” because that is\nhow she is referred to in the District Court’s decision.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Shortly before L.’s third birthday, Fair Lawn determined that L. qualified for\n\nspecial education and related services as a preschooler with a disability. 2 Fair Lawn’s\n\nchild study team prepared an IEP for L. that provided for placement in Fair Lawn’s\n\nStepping Stones program, which is exclusively for preschoolers with autism spectrum\n\ndisorders. L.’s IEP did not provide for any interaction with children without disabilities.\n\n       L.’s mother approved the IEP, and L. began to attend Stepping Stones on January\n\n22, 2007, her third birthday. At Stepping Stones, L. received approximately three hours\n\nper day of one-on-one discreet trial instruction based on Applied Behavioral Analysis\n\n(“ABA”), a research-based system of educating children with autism. Along with a\n\nvariety of other strategies, ABA includes a “mainstreaming” component that “occurs only\n\nwhen the child has adequate skills to enable a meaningful interaction with a more typical\n\npeer.” J.A. at 41.\n\n       For the remainder of the school day, L. participated in group activities with other\n\nchildren who had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders including some\n\nchildren who were higher functioning than L., who was “one of the lower functioning\n\nstudents” in the class. J.A. at 42.\n\n       In the fall of 2007, L.’s parents requested that Fair Lawn consider an alternative\n\neducational placement for L. that would provide her with opportunities to interact with\n\n\n\n\n2\n Children between the ages of three and twenty-one who have disabilities, as defined at\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(3), are eligible for special education and related services under the\nIDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A).\n\n                                             3\n\ftypically developing peers. By letter dated November 15, 2007, Fair Lawn denied the\n\nrequest. J.A. at 578.\n\n       At the request of L.’s parents, a meeting was convened on December 20, 2007 to\n\ndiscuss L.’s IEP for the coming year and, in particular, a request by L.’s parents that L. be\n\nplaced at the Children’s Center, an inclusive preschool at Montclair State University,\n\nrather than at Stepping Stones. In support of their placement request, L.’s parents\n\nprovided Fair Lawn with reports of assessments of L. they had obtained at their own\n\nexpense. The parents also provided Fair Lawn with a video of L. in an environment that\n\nincluded typically developing peers, which they believed showed that L. was ready for,\n\nand would benefit from, interaction with typically developing peers.\n\n       Prior to the December 20, 2007 meeting, Fair Lawn Staff met to develop a\n\nproposed IEP. The proposed IEP, which was presented to L.’s parents at the December\n\n20, 2007 IEP team meeting, continued to provide for L.’s placement at Stepping Stones\n\nwithout specifically providing for any interaction with nondisabled children. According\n\nto Fair Lawn, L. did not have the requisite skills to benefit from placement in an inclusion\n\nprogram or from any interaction with typically developing peers. L.’s case manager later\n\nexplained that “before children are integrated into a program like [the Children’s Center]\n\nthey would need to show some social-interaction skills, some awareness of other\n\nchildren, some modeling of other children, and some interest in engaging with other\n\nchildren,” which L. had not shown. J.A. at 49. The IEP thus provided that Fair Lawn\n\nstaff would “continue to monitor [L.’s] progress to ensure she has opportunities to\n\ninteract with nondisabled peers when she is able to benefit from them.” J.A. at 617. In\n\n                                             4\n\fearly 2008, Fair Lawn began to include “reverse-inclusion component,” which “allowed a\n\nchild from outside the classroom, either typical or preschool disabled, to come in to play\n\nwith the group in order to demonstrate social skills, providing students with the\n\nopportunity to emulate.” J.A. at 42. 3\n\n       On March 3, 2008, L.’s parents transferred her from Stepping Stones to the\n\nChildren’s Center, where she would be placed in a class that included both typically\n\ndeveloping children and children with disabilities. That day, they initiated administrative\n\nproceedings against Fair Lawn, seeking reimbursement of the expenses they incurred in\n\nplacing L. at the Children’s Center and in privately obtaining other services for L.\n\n       On May 6, 2008, the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law began a due\n\nprocess hearing. On the eleventh day of the hearing, having first solicited briefing from\n\nboth parties and heard argument, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) determined that\n\nthe proceedings should be bifurcated: the ALJ first would decide whether Fair Lawn’s\n\nplacement of L. complied with the IDEA, and if he determined that it did not, he would\n\nthen move on to consider whether the Children’s Center was an appropriate placement.\n\nThe ALJ subsequently ruled that, in the first part of the bifurcated proceedings, he would\n\nexclude evidence not relevant to the question whether Fair Lawn had offered L. a free\n\nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment as of March 2008, when\n\nL.’s parents transferred her to the Children’s Center.\n\n\n3\n Reverse inclusion began in L.’s assigned classroom on February 25, 2008, “as\npreviously planned.” J.A. at 56. L.’s last day at Fair Lawn was March 3, 2008. See\nAppellant’s Br. at 19.\n\n                                             5\n\f       In a decision dated October 5, 2009, the ALJ determined that Fair Lawn had\n\ncomplied with the IDEA. Based on the expert testimony and his independent review of\n\nthe video of L. that her parents had provided to Fair Lawn, the ALJ found that L.’s\n\ndisability “renders her incapable of being satisfactorily educated in a regular classroom,\n\nand she wouldn’t benefit from the modeling behavior of her peers if she were educated\n\nwith them.” J.A. at 74. On this basis, the ALJ concluded that Fair Lawn had proven that\n\nit had met the least restrictive environment requirement.\n\n       Seeking independent review of the ALJ’s decision, L.’s parents brought a civil\n\naction under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2) in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nNew Jersey. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and L.’s parents\n\nrequested that the District Court admit the evidence that the ALJ had excluded. The\n\nDistrict Court, on June 27, 2011, granted summary judgment to Fair Lawn. In the same\n\nopinion, the Court denied L.’s request that it admit additional evidence relating to the\n\nChildren’s Center, determining that the evidence was not relevant to the legal issues\n\nbefore the Court. L’s parents appeal.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       A. Jurisdiction & Standard of Review\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review over the District\n\nCourt’s legal conclusions is plenary, and the District Court’s factual findings are\n\nreviewed for clear error. Shore Reg’l High Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. P.S. ex rel. P.S., 381 F.3d\n\n194, 199 (3d Cir. 2004). In reviewing the District Court’s evidentiary rulings, we apply\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthe abuse of discretion standard. Susan N. v. Wilson Sch. Dist., 70 F.3d 751, 760 (3d Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n         Appellants contend that the District Court applied the incorrect standard of review\n\nto the ALJ’s decision. In IDEA cases, a district court is required to “hear additional\n\nevidence at the request of a party” and to make its own findings by a “preponderance of\n\nthe evidence,” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C), while giving “due weight” to the ALJ’s factual\n\ndeterminations and “special weight” to the ALJ’s credibility determinations. L.E. v.\n\nRamsey Bd. of Educ., 435 F.3d 384, 389 & n.4 (3d Cir. 2006) (“[A] District Court must\n\naccept the state agency's credibility determinations unless the nontestimonial, extrinsic\n\nevidence in the record would justify a contrary conclusion [and i]n this context the word\n\n‘justify’ demands essentially the same standard of review given to a trial court's findings\n\nof fact by a federal appellate court.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nThis approach has been described as “modified de novo” review. Id. at 389.\n\n         The District Court’s opinion contains a detailed and accurate description of the\n\nmodified de novo standard of review. However, at the end of this description, the District\n\nCourt stated that it reviews the ALJ’s factual findings “under a clearly erroneous\n\nstandard.” L.G. & E.G. ex rel. E.G. v. Fair Lawn Bd. of Educ., No. 09-6456, 2011 WL\n\n2559547, at *5 (D.N.J. June 27, 2011). In the “Discussion” section that followed,\n\nhowever, the District Court explicitly stated, “the evidence as adduced by the ALJ proves\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that L. received that to which she was statutorily\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fentitled.” Id. at *4. The District Court thus appropriately applied the modified de novo\n\nstandard of review. 4\n\n       B. Reimbursement Claim\n\n       L.’s parents seek reimbursement of the costs they incurred as a result of their\n\nplacement of L. at the Children’s Center. Tuition reimbursement is an appropriate\n\nremedy if “the public placement violated [the] IDEA and . . . the private school\n\nplacement was proper under the Act.” Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S.\n\n7, 15 (1993). L.’s parents contend that Fair Lawn’s placement of L. violated the IDEA\n\nbecause (1) Fair Lawn excluded them from meaningful participation in the determination\n\nof L.’s placement; and (2) Fair Lawn did not provide L. with an education in the least\n\nrestrictive environment in which she could obtain a meaningful educational benefit. We\n\ndiscuss each contention in turn.\n\n4\n  Moreover, the lack of clarity caused by the District Court’s singular reference to the\n“clearly erroneous” standard does not necessitate remand if the result was proper under\nthe correct legal standard. See T.R & E.M.R. ex rel. N.R. v. Kingwood Twp. Bd. of Educ.,\n205 F.3d 572, 577 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nAppellants also argue that the District Court erroneously placed the burden of proof on\nthem, rather than Fair Lawn. In Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 57-58 (2005), the\nSupreme Court held that the burden of proof in a challenge to an IEP is on the party\nseeking relief. The Schaffer Court “declined to address the issue of whether a state could,\nby statute, place the burden exclusively on the school district.” Ramsey, 435 F.3d at 391.\nA few months before L.’s parents initiated the administrative proceedings in the present\ncase, New Jersey enacted legislation placing the burden of proof on the school district.\nSee P.L. 2007, c.331 (enacted January 13, 2008) (codified at N.J. Stat. Ann. § 18A:46-\n1.1). This court has yet to rule on whether a state may, as New Jersey has, shift the\nburden of proof to the school district by legislation. The ALJ, citing to N.J. Stat. Ann.\n§ 18A:46-1.1, determined that Fair Lawn had the burden of proof, J.A. at 74, but the\nDistrict Court, citing to Schaffer, appears to have placed the burden on L.’s parents. Fair\nLawn, 2011 WL 2559547, at *3. For the purposes of this opinion, we assume Fair Lawn\nhad the burden of proof because it is more favorable to the Appellants.\n                                             8\n\f       1. Predetermination of placement\n\n       L.’s parents argue that Fair Lawn violated the IDEA’s procedural requirements\n\nwhen, prior to the December 20, 2007 IEP team meeting, Fair Lawn staff met without\n\nL.’s parents present, determined that L. should be placed at Stepping Stones, and drafted\n\nan IEP for L. reflecting this determination. In enacting the IDEA, “Congress placed\n\nevery bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and\n\nguardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process . . .\n\nas it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard.” Bd.\n\nof Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205-06 (1982).\n\n       Although L.’s parents did not ultimately sign the IEP that was presented to them\n\non December 20, 2007, they were not excluded from the process of determining L.’s\n\nplacement, and they had an opportunity to participate in the formulation of her IEP in a\n\nmeaningful way. Federal and state regulations require that the parents of a child with a\n\ndisability be afforded the opportunity to participate in meetings about a child’s\n\nplacement; however, parents need not be included in “preparatory activities that public\n\nagency personnel engage in to develop a proposal or response to a parent proposal that\n\nwill be discussed at a later meeting.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.501(b); see also N.J.A.C. § 6A:14-\n\n2.3(l)(2). In this context, the fact that school district staff met without the child’s parents\n\nto develop a proposed IEP does not constitute a procedural violation of the IDEA. Cf.\n\nFuhrmann ex rel. Fuhrmann v. East Hanover Bd. of Educ., 993 F.2d 1031, 1036 (3d Cir.\n\n1993) (finding no procedural violation where parents were presented with draft IEP at\n\nteam meeting, discussed it, and suggested changes).\n\n                                               9\n\f        2. Least restrictive environment\n\n        The central question in the proceedings before the District Court and the ALJ was\n\nwhether Fair Lawn’s placement of L. in accordance with the December 20, 2007 IEP\n\nviolated the IDEA’s requirement that students with disabilities be educated in the least\n\nrestrictive environment. The IDEA mandates that states establish procedures that ensure\n\nthat:\n\n        [t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities . . . are\n        educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate\n        schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular\n        educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the\n        disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of\n        supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). This court has interpreted 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) to\n\nrequire that a disabled child be placed in the least restrictive environment that will\n\nprovide a “meaningful educational benefit.” Kingwood, 205 F.3d at 578. The\n\nrequirement applies with equal force to the placement of preschool-aged children. Id. at\n\n579; see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.116(a)(2). Courts deciding whether this requirement has\n\nbeen met must avoid “Monday Morning Quarterbacking” and must evaluate the\n\nreasonableness of a school district’s decision at the time that it was made. Susan N., 70\n\nF.3d at 762 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        Appellants argue that the District Court conflated the standard for determining\n\nwhether L.’s IEP provided for a free and appropriate education with the standard for\n\ndetermining whether she was being educated in the least restrictive environment.\n\nWhether an education is “appropriate” for the purposes of determining whether a school\n\n\n                                              10\n\fdistrict has offered a student a free and appropriate public education is, of course, a\n\ndistinct question from whether the student has been integrated “to the maximum extent\n\nappropriate.” Ramsey, 435 F.3d at 393. Although the District Court did not engage in a\n\nseparate analysis of the least restrictive environment requirement and did not make any\n\nfactual findings about Fair Lawn’s compliance with the requirement, it affirmed as\n\n“legally sufficient” the ALJ’s determination that Fair Lawn’s IEP met the requirement.\n\nOn review, we apply the legal standards that the District Court should have applied, and\n\nmay affirm the District Court’s decision if the result was proper and supported by the\n\nfactual findings of the ALJ. See Kingwood, 205 F.3d at 577; Bucks Cnty. Dep’t of Mental\n\nHealth/Mental Retardation v. Pennsylvania, 379 F.3d 61, 65 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       In determining compliance with the least restrictive environment requirement,\n\ncourts in the Third Circuit apply the two-part test adopted in Oberti ex rel. Oberti v.\n\nBoard of Education of Clementon School District, 995 F.2d 1204, 1215 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nFirst, a court inquires “whether education in the regular classroom, with the use of\n\nsupplementary aids and services, can be achieved satisfactorily.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). If a court finds that the child cannot be satisfactorily\n\neducated in a regular classroom with supplementary aids and services, it turns to the\n\nsecond part of the Oberti test: “whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the\n\nmaximum extent appropriate, i.e., whether the school has made efforts to include the\n\nchild in school programs with nondisabled children whenever possible.” Id. at 1215\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       In the present case, the ALJ’s findings of fact were sufficient to determine that\n\nFair Lawn reasonably concluded that the completely segregated environment provided\n\nfor in L.’s IEP was the least restrictive environment in which L. could obtain a\n\n“meaningful educational benefit.” See Kingwood, 205 F.3d at 578. 5 In particular, the\n\nALJ found that L. “did not have the prerequisite skills for a less restrictive environment”\n\nsuch as a regular classroom, that she “demonstrated inappropriate and stigmatizing\n\nbehaviors,” and that she “would wander aimlessly if not in a highly structured\n\nenvironment.” J.A. at 70-71.\n\n       The ALJ also concluded that L. “would not have benefited from a less restrictive\n\nenvironment . . . [because she] wouldn’t notice her peers, and, therefore, would not gain\n\nfrom their modeling appropriate behavior.” Id. at 71. The ALJ’s independent review of\n\nthe video provided by L.’s parents “generally confirmed” the interpretation offered by\n\nFair Lawn—that L. “is unable to engage with her peers”—rather than the opposite\n\nconclusion that was offered by an expert hired by L.’s parents. 6 J.A. at 54. Additionally,\n\nthe ALJ noted that “[t]he evidence that [L.] had any interest in peers came largely from\n\n[her mother], and was generally anecdotal.” J.A. at 67. The ALJ thus determined that\n\n\n5\n  As noted above, the District Court made no factual findings, but it implicitly adopted\nthose made by the ALJ.\n6\n The ALJ noted that the expert hired by the parents to testify “was quite evasive on\ncross-examination and exhibited an unusually strong bias in her testimony” such that the\nALJ was “unable to take much stock in her opinion.” J.A. at 67. By contrast, Fair\nLawn’s interpretation was offered by its behaviorist and coordinator for the Stepping\nStones program (Diane Ciaramella), who was “much more intimately familiar with [L.’s]\nabilities and limitations” and “betrayed no bias” such that the ALJ “attached greater\nweight to [her] testimony.” J.A. at 68.\n                                            12\n\fthe benefits of a less restrictive environment would not accrue to L. given her limited\n\nabilities. The ALJ also found that L. “learns best one-to-one,” and that she “made\n\nsignificant and meaningful progress” at Stepping Stones. J.A. at 70. Stepping Stones\n\nprovided L. with the opportunity to interact with peers who had higher skills than she,\n\nand the ABA program used at Stepping Stones provides for mainstreaming when a child\n\nhas developed the appropriate prerequisite skills. Moreover, L.’s IEPs provided that L.\n\nwould have “the same opportunities for participation in school social and extracurricular\n\nactivities as her non-disabled peers,” J.A. at 528, and that Fair Lawn would “continue to\n\nmonitor her progress to ensure she has opportunities to interact with nondisabled peers\n\nwhen she is able to benefit from them.” J.A. at 617. The addition of a reverse-inclusion\n\ncomponent to the Stepping Stones program also demonstrates Fair Lawn’s efforts to\n\nprovide L. with opportunities to interact with typically developing peers to the maximum\n\nextent appropriate. These facts demonstrate that the District Court properly adopted the\n\nALJ’s conclusion that Fair Lawn satisfied the least restrictive environment requirement.\n\n       C. Evidence Related to Children’s Center\n\n       L.’s parents also argue that the District Court erred in upholding the ALJ’s\n\nexclusion—pursuant to the bifurcation order—of evidence related to the Children’s\n\nCenter and L.’s progress there, and in denying their request to introduce the same\n\nevidence in the District Court. Under the New Jersey Administrative Code, a judge has\n\nthe authority to bifurcate a hearing when, “there are multiple parties, issues or claims, and\n\nthe nature of the case is such that a hearing of all issues in one proceeding may be\n\ncomplex and confusing, or whenever a substantial saving of time would result from\n\n                                             13\n\fconducting separate hearings or whenever bifurcation might eliminate the need for\n\nfurther hearings.” N.J. Admin. Code § 1:1-14.6(e). Furthermore, a judge is permitted to\n\nexclude evidence when the risk of it taking an undue amount of time to consider\n\nsubstantially outweighs its probative value. Id. § 1:1-15.1(c). Given the length of the\n\nhearing and the size of the record in this case, we agree with the District Court that “the\n\nALJ gave each side ample opportunity to present and examine evidence, and that his\n\nruling did not prejudice [Appellants].” Fair Lawn, 2011 WL 2559547, at *5.\n\n       IDEA provides that the district court “shall hear additional evidence at the request\n\nof a party.” 20 U.S.C.§ 1415(i)(2)(C)(ii). This court has interpreted the statutory\n\ndirective to mean that, while a district court may appropriately exclude some evidence, “a\n\ncourt must exercise particularized discretion in its rulings so that it will consider evidence\n\nrelevant, non-cumulative and useful in determining whether Congress’ goal has been\n\nreached for the child involved.” Susan N., 70 F.3d at 760. Evidence of a child’s\n\nprogress—or lack thereof—in an alternative placement may be relevant to the court’s\n\ndetermination whether a school district’s IEP was appropriate at the time it was drafted.\n\nSee id. at 762. In this case, however, the District Court accepted as fact L.’s parents’\n\ncontention that L. was demonstrating significant success at the Children’s Center. See\n\nFair Lawn, 2011 WL 2559547, at *6. Therefore, the evidence related to the Children’s\n\nCenter and L.’s progress there would have been merely cumulative, and the District\n\nCourt’s decision to exclude this evidence was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we will affirm the District Court’s decision.\n\n                                             14\n\f",

Pollak, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation. Judge Pollak died on May 8,\n2012; this opinion is filed by a quorum of the court. 28 U.S.C. § 46 and Third Circuit\nIOP 12.1(b).\n\fSLOVITER, Circuit Judge.\n\n       The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et\n\nseq., mandates that states establish procedures by which, “[t]o the maximum extent\n\nappropriate,” children with disabilities are educated together with nondisabled children.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). Appellants E.G. and L.G. are the parents of E.G. (“L.”), 1\n\nwho has been diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder and autism spectrum\n\ndisorder. At the heart of the present dispute is a proposed individualized education\n\nprogram (“IEP”) written for L. by the Fair Lawn Board of Education (“Fair Lawn”) that\n\ndid not specifically provide for interaction with typically developing peers. L.’s parents\n\npetition this court for review of a decision of the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Jersey granting summary judgment to Fair Lawn on L.’s parents’ claim\n\nfor reimbursement of the costs associated with their placement of L., contrary to the\n\nprovisions of Fair Lawn’s proposed IEP, in an “inclusive” preschool, attended both by\n\nchildren with disabilities and those without. For the reasons given below, the District\n\nCourt’s decision will be affirmed.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       Because we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we will\n\nprovide only a brief summary of its extensive background here.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Although the caption refers to the child as “E.G.” we refer to her as “L.” because that is\nhow she is referred to in the District Court’s decision.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Shortly before L.’s third birthday, Fair Lawn determined that L. qualified for\n\nspecial education and related services as a preschooler with a disability. 2 Fair Lawn’s\n\nchild study team prepared an IEP for L. that provided for placement in Fair Lawn’s\n\nStepping Stones program, which is exclusively for preschoolers with autism spectrum\n\ndisorders. L.’s IEP did not provide for any interaction with children without disabilities.\n\n       L.’s mother approved the IEP, and L. began to attend Stepping Stones on January\n\n22, 2007, her third birthday. At Stepping Stones, L. received approximately three hours\n\nper day of one-on-one discreet trial instruction based on Applied Behavioral Analysis\n\n(“ABA”), a research-based system of educating children with autism. Along with a\n\nvariety of other strategies, ABA includes a “mainstreaming” component that “occurs only\n\nwhen the child has adequate skills to enable a meaningful interaction with a more typical\n\npeer.” J.A. at 41.\n\n       For the remainder of the school day, L. participated in group activities with other\n\nchildren who had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders including some\n\nchildren who were higher functioning than L., who was “one of the lower functioning\n\nstudents” in the class. J.A. at 42.\n\n       In the fall of 2007, L.’s parents requested that Fair Lawn consider an alternative\n\neducational placement for L. that would provide her with opportunities to interact with\n\n\n\n\n2\n Children between the ages of three and twenty-one who have disabilities, as defined at\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(3), are eligible for special education and related services under the\nIDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A).\n\n                                             3\n\ftypically developing peers. By letter dated November 15, 2007, Fair Lawn denied the\n\nrequest. J.A. at 578.\n\n       At the request of L.’s parents, a meeting was convened on December 20, 2007 to\n\ndiscuss L.’s IEP for the coming year and, in particular, a request by L.’s parents that L. be\n\nplaced at the Children’s Center, an inclusive preschool at Montclair State University,\n\nrather than at Stepping Stones. In support of their placement request, L.’s parents\n\nprovided Fair Lawn with reports of assessments of L. they had obtained at their own\n\nexpense. The parents also provided Fair Lawn with a video of L. in an environment that\n\nincluded typically developing peers, which they believed showed that L. was ready for,\n\nand would benefit from, interaction with typically developing peers.\n\n       Prior to the December 20, 2007 meeting, Fair Lawn Staff met to develop a\n\nproposed IEP. The proposed IEP, which was presented to L.’s parents at the December\n\n20, 2007 IEP team meeting, continued to provide for L.’s placement at Stepping Stones\n\nwithout specifically providing for any interaction with nondisabled children. According\n\nto Fair Lawn, L. did not have the requisite skills to benefit from placement in an inclusion\n\nprogram or from any interaction with typically developing peers. L.’s case manager later\n\nexplained that “before children are integrated into a program like [the Children’s Center]\n\nthey would need to show some social-interaction skills, some awareness of other\n\nchildren, some modeling of other children, and some interest in engaging with other\n\nchildren,” which L. had not shown. J.A. at 49. The IEP thus provided that Fair Lawn\n\nstaff would “continue to monitor [L.’s] progress to ensure she has opportunities to\n\ninteract with nondisabled peers when she is able to benefit from them.” J.A. at 617. In\n\n                                             4\n\fearly 2008, Fair Lawn began to include “reverse-inclusion component,” which “allowed a\n\nchild from outside the classroom, either typical or preschool disabled, to come in to play\n\nwith the group in order to demonstrate social skills, providing students with the\n\nopportunity to emulate.” J.A. at 42. 3\n\n       On March 3, 2008, L.’s parents transferred her from Stepping Stones to the\n\nChildren’s Center, where she would be placed in a class that included both typically\n\ndeveloping children and children with disabilities. That day, they initiated administrative\n\nproceedings against Fair Lawn, seeking reimbursement of the expenses they incurred in\n\nplacing L. at the Children’s Center and in privately obtaining other services for L.\n\n       On May 6, 2008, the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law began a due\n\nprocess hearing. On the eleventh day of the hearing, having first solicited briefing from\n\nboth parties and heard argument, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) determined that\n\nthe proceedings should be bifurcated: the ALJ first would decide whether Fair Lawn’s\n\nplacement of L. complied with the IDEA, and if he determined that it did not, he would\n\nthen move on to consider whether the Children’s Center was an appropriate placement.\n\nThe ALJ subsequently ruled that, in the first part of the bifurcated proceedings, he would\n\nexclude evidence not relevant to the question whether Fair Lawn had offered L. a free\n\nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment as of March 2008, when\n\nL.’s parents transferred her to the Children’s Center.\n\n\n3\n Reverse inclusion began in L.’s assigned classroom on February 25, 2008, “as\npreviously planned.” J.A. at 56. L.’s last day at Fair Lawn was March 3, 2008. See\nAppellant’s Br. at 19.\n\n                                             5\n\f       In a decision dated October 5, 2009, the ALJ determined that Fair Lawn had\n\ncomplied with the IDEA. Based on the expert testimony and his independent review of\n\nthe video of L. that her parents had provided to Fair Lawn, the ALJ found that L.’s\n\ndisability “renders her incapable of being satisfactorily educated in a regular classroom,\n\nand she wouldn’t benefit from the modeling behavior of her peers if she were educated\n\nwith them.” J.A. at 74. On this basis, the ALJ concluded that Fair Lawn had proven that\n\nit had met the least restrictive environment requirement.\n\n       Seeking independent review of the ALJ’s decision, L.’s parents brought a civil\n\naction under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2) in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nNew Jersey. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and L.’s parents\n\nrequested that the District Court admit the evidence that the ALJ had excluded. The\n\nDistrict Court, on June 27, 2011, granted summary judgment to Fair Lawn. In the same\n\nopinion, the Court denied L.’s request that it admit additional evidence relating to the\n\nChildren’s Center, determining that the evidence was not relevant to the legal issues\n\nbefore the Court. L’s parents appeal.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       A. Jurisdiction & Standard of Review\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

Id. at 389.\n\n         The District Court’s opinion contains a detailed and accurate description of the\n\nmodified de novo standard of review. However, at the end of this description, the District\n\nCourt stated that it reviews the ALJ’s factual findings “under a clearly erroneous\n\nstandard.” L.G. & E.G. ex rel. E.G. v.

The District Court thus appropriately applied the modified de novo\n\nstandard of review. 4\n\n       B. Reimbursement Claim\n\n       L.’s parents seek reimbursement of the costs they incurred as a result of their\n\nplacement of L. at the Children’s Center. Tuition reimbursement is an appropriate\n\nremedy if “the public placement violated [the] IDEA and . . . the private school\n\nplacement was proper under the Act.” Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four v.

L.’s parents contend that Fair Lawn’s placement of L. violated the IDEA\n\nbecause (1) Fair Lawn excluded them from meaningful participation in the determination\n\nof L.’s placement; and (2) Fair Lawn did not provide L. with an education in the least\n\nrestrictive environment in which she could obtain a meaningful educational benefit. We\n\ndiscuss each contention in turn.\n\n4\n  Moreover, the lack of clarity caused by the District Court’s singular reference to the\n“clearly erroneous” standard does not necessitate remand if the result was proper under\nthe correct legal standard.

In Schaffer v. Weast, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1993216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1993216/schaffer-v-weast/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57-58 (2005), the\nSupreme Court held that the burden of proof in a challenge to an IEP is on the party\nseeking relief. The Schaffer Court “declined to address the issue of whether a state could,\nby statute, place the burden exclusively on the school district.” Ramsey, 435 F.3d at 391.\nA few months before L.’s parents initiated the administrative proceedings in the present\ncase, New Jersey enacted legislation placing the burden of proof on the school district.\nSee P.L. 2007, c.331 (enacted January 13, 2008) (codified at N.J. Stat. Ann. § 18A:46-\n1.1). This court has yet to rule on whether a state may, as New Jersey has, shift the\nburden of proof to the school district by legislation. The ALJ, citing to N.J. Stat. Ann.\n§ 18A:46-1.1, determined that Fair Lawn had the burden of proof, J.A. at 74, but the\nDistrict Court, citing to Schaffer, appears to have placed the burden on L.’s parents.

Predetermination of placement\n\n       L.’s parents argue that Fair Lawn violated the IDEA’s procedural requirements\n\nwhen, prior to the December 20, 2007 IEP team meeting, Fair Lawn staff met without\n\nL.’s parents present, determined that L. should be placed at Stepping Stones, and drafted\n\nan IEP for L. reflecting this determination. In enacting the IDEA, “Congress placed\n\nevery bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and\n\nguardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process . . .\n\nas it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard.” Bd.\n\nof Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205-06 (1982).\n\n       Although L.’s parents did not ultimately sign the IEP that was presented to them\n\non December 20, 2007, they were not excluded from the process of determining L.’s\n\nplacement, and they had an opportunity to participate in the formulation of her IEP in a\n\nmeaningful way. Federal and state regulations require that the parents of a child with a\n\ndisability be afforded the opportunity to participate in meetings about a child’s\n\nplacement; however, parents need not be included in “preparatory activities that public\n\nagency personnel engage in to develop a proposal or response to a parent proposal that\n\nwill be discussed at a later meeting.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.501(b); see also N.J.A.C. § 6A:14-\n\n2.3(l)(2). In this context, the fact that school district staff met without the child’s parents\n\nto develop a proposed IEP does not constitute a procedural violation of the IDEA. Cf.\n\nFuhrmann ex rel.

East Hanover Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607115\"><a href=\"/opinion/607115/myron-fuhrmann-perri-fuhrmann-on-behalf-of-their-minor-son-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1036 (3d Cir.\n\n1993) (finding no procedural violation where parents were presented with draft IEP at\n\nteam meeting, discussed it, and suggested changes).\n\n                                               9\n\f        2. Least restrictive environment\n\n        The central question in the proceedings before the District Court and the ALJ was\n\nwhether Fair Lawn’s placement of L. in accordance with the December 20, 2007 IEP\n\nviolated the IDEA’s requirement that students with disabilities be educated in the least\n\nrestrictive environment. The IDEA mandates that states establish procedures that ensure\n\nthat:\n\n        [t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities . . . are\n        educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate\n        schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular\n        educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the\n        disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of\n        supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). This court has interpreted 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) to\n\nrequire that a disabled child be placed in the least restrictive environment that will\n\nprovide a “meaningful educational benefit.” Kingwood, 205 F.3d at 578. The\n\nrequirement applies with equal force to the placement of preschool-aged children. Id. at\n\n579; see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.116(a)(2). Courts deciding whether this requirement has\n\nbeen met must avoid “Monday Morning Quarterbacking” and must evaluate the\n\nreasonableness of a school district’s decision at the time that it was made. Susan N., 70\n\nF.3d at 762 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        Appellants argue that the District Court conflated the standard for determining\n\nwhether L.’s IEP provided for a free and appropriate education with the standard for\n\ndetermining whether she was being educated in the least restrictive environment.\n\nWhether an education is “appropriate” for the purposes of determining whether a school\n\n\n                                              10\n\fdistrict has offered a student a free and appropriate public education is, of course, a\n\ndistinct question from whether the student has been integrated “to the maximum extent\n\nappropriate.” Ramsey, 435 F.3d at 393. Although the District Court did not engage in a\n\nseparate analysis of the least restrictive environment requirement and did not make any\n\nfactual findings about Fair Lawn’s compliance with the requirement, it affirmed as\n\n“legally sufficient” the ALJ’s determination that Fair Lawn’s IEP met the requirement.\n\nOn review, we apply the legal standards that the District Court should have applied, and\n\nmay affirm the District Court’s decision if the result was proper and supported by the\n\nfactual findings of the ALJ.

Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787304\"><a href=\"/opinion/787304/bucks-county-department-of-mental-healthmental-retardation-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       In determining compliance with the least restrictive environment requirement,\n\ncourts in the Third Circuit apply the two-part test adopted in Oberti ex rel. Oberti v.\n\nBoard of Education of Clementon School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609180\"><a href=\"/opinion/609180/rafael-oberti-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-carlos-and-jeanne-oberti/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1215 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nFirst, a court inquires “whether education in the regular classroom, with the use of\n\nsupplementary aids and services, can be achieved satisfactorily.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). If a court finds that the child cannot be satisfactorily\n\neducated in a regular classroom with supplementary aids and services, it turns to the\n\nsecond part of the Oberti test: “whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the\n\nmaximum extent appropriate, i.e., whether the school has made efforts to include the\n\nchild in school programs with nondisabled children whenever possible.” Id. at 1215\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       In the present case, the ALJ’s findings of fact were sufficient to determine that\n\nFair Lawn reasonably concluded that the completely segregated environment provided\n\nfor in L.’s IEP was the least restrictive environment in which L. could obtain a\n\n“meaningful educational benefit.” See Kingwood, 205 F.3d at 578. 5 In particular, the\n\nALJ found that L. “did not have the prerequisite skills for a less restrictive environment”\n\nsuch as a regular classroom, that she “demonstrated inappropriate and stigmatizing\n\nbehaviors,” and that she “would wander aimlessly if not in a highly structured\n\nenvironment.” J.A. at 70-71.\n\n       The ALJ also concluded that L. “would not have benefited from a less restrictive\n\nenvironment . . . [because she] wouldn’t notice her peers, and, therefore, would not gain\n\nfrom their modeling appropriate behavior.” Id. at 71. The ALJ’s independent review of\n\nthe video provided by L.’s parents “generally confirmed” the interpretation offered by\n\nFair Lawn—that L. “is unable to engage with her peers”—rather than the opposite\n\nconclusion that was offered by an expert hired by L.’s parents. 6 J.A. at 54. Additionally,\n\nthe ALJ noted that “[t]he evidence that [L.] had any interest in peers came largely from\n\n[her mother], and was generally anecdotal.” J.A. at 67. The ALJ thus determined that\n\n\n5\n  As noted above, the District Court made no factual findings, but it implicitly adopted\nthose made by the ALJ.\n6\n The ALJ noted that the expert hired by the parents to testify “was quite evasive on\ncross-examination and exhibited an unusually strong bias in her testimony” such that the\nALJ was “unable to take much stock in her opinion.” J.A. at 67. By contrast, Fair\nLawn’s interpretation was offered by its behaviorist and coordinator for the Stepping\nStones program (Diane Ciaramella), who was “much more intimately familiar with [L.’s]\nabilities and limitations” and “betrayed no bias” such that the ALJ “attached greater\nweight to [her] testimony.” J.A. at 68.\n                                            12\n\fthe benefits of a less restrictive environment would not accrue to L. given her limited\n\nabilities. The ALJ also found that L. “learns best one-to-one,” and that she “made\n\nsignificant and meaningful progress” at Stepping Stones. J.A. at 70. Stepping Stones\n\nprovided L. with the opportunity to interact with peers who had higher skills than she,\n\nand the ABA program used at Stepping Stones provides for mainstreaming when a child\n\nhas developed the appropriate prerequisite skills. Moreover, L.’s IEPs provided that L.\n\nwould have “the same opportunities for participation in school social and extracurricular\n\nactivities as her non-disabled peers,” J.A. at 528, and that Fair Lawn would “continue to\n\nmonitor her progress to ensure she has opportunities to interact with nondisabled peers\n\nwhen she is able to benefit from them.” J.A. at 617. The addition of a reverse-inclusion\n\ncomponent to the Stepping Stones program also demonstrates Fair Lawn’s efforts to\n\nprovide L. with opportunities to interact with typically developing peers to the maximum\n\nextent appropriate. These facts demonstrate that the District Court properly adopted the\n\nALJ’s conclusion that Fair Lawn satisfied the least restrictive environment requirement.\n\n       C. Evidence Related to Children’s Center\n\n       L.’s parents also argue that the District Court erred in upholding the ALJ’s\n\nexclusion—pursuant to the bifurcation order—of evidence related to the Children’s\n\nCenter and L.’s progress there, and in denying their request to introduce the same\n\nevidence in the District Court. Under the New Jersey Administrative Code, a judge has\n\nthe authority to bifurcate a hearing when, “there are multiple parties, issues or claims, and\n\nthe nature of the case is such that a hearing of all issues in one proceeding may be\n\ncomplex and confusing, or whenever a substantial saving of time would result from\n\n                                             13\n\fconducting separate hearings or whenever bifurcation might eliminate the need for\n\nfurther hearings.” N.J. Admin. Code § 1:1-14.6(e). Furthermore, a judge is permitted to\n\nexclude evidence when the risk of it taking an undue amount of time to consider\n\nsubstantially outweighs its probative value. Id. § 1:1-15.1(c). Given the length of the\n\nhearing and the size of the record in this case, we agree with the District Court that “the\n\nALJ gave each side ample opportunity to present and examine evidence, and that his\n\nruling did not prejudice [Appellants].” Fair Lawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2559547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.\n\n       IDEA provides that the district court “shall hear additional evidence at the request\n\nof a party.” 20 U.S.C.§ 1415(i)(2)(C)(ii). This court has interpreted the statutory\n\ndirective to mean that, while a district court may appropriately exclude some evidence, “a\n\ncourt must exercise particularized discretion in its rulings so that it will consider evidence\n\nrelevant, non-cumulative and useful in determining whether Congress’ goal has been\n\nreached for the child involved.” Susan N., 70 F.3d at 760. Evidence of a child’s\n\nprogress—or lack thereof—in an alternative placement may be relevant to the court’s\n\ndetermination whether a school district’s IEP was appropriate at the time it was drafted.\n\nSee id. at 762. In this case, however, the District Court accepted as fact L.’s parents’\n\ncontention that L. was demonstrating significant success at the Children’s Center. See\n\nFair Lawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2559547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. Therefore, the evidence related to the Children’s\n\nCenter and L.’s progress there would have been merely cumulative, and the District\n\nCourt’s decision to exclude this evidence was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we will affirm the District Court’s decision.\n\n                                             14\n\f</pre>",
