The parties married in New Rochelle, New York on May 23, 1982. They resided continuously in this state for at least twelve months before the date of filing the complaint; therefore, the court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>This is the only marriage for both parties. There are three minor children who are issue of this marriage, Sara Burns born February 19, 1985; Jennifer Burns born May 6, 1987; and Allison Burns born July 2, 1990.</p>\n<p><center>                                    I</center>\nFacts of the Case<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Amy and John Burns have known each other for twenty-five years. The plaintiff is a forty-five-year-old administrator in a health care facility operated by members of her family. She is a college graduate with a degree in psychology. Currently she is in good health. The defendant is a forty-seven-year old high school graduate.<sup id=\"ref-fn2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> He trained himself in the art of computer programming, becoming proficient in the field. Although he suffered from depression, the defendant's health was not a significant factor in this proceeding.</p>\n<p>At the time of their marriage in 1982, neither individual had any significant assets. Much of what they accumulated came from their earnings throughout the following years. However in 1991, as a result of her mother's death, the plaintiff inherited approximately $385,000, an amount that she received in installments during the following ten years. Some of the money was used as a portion of the down payment on the current marital residence. The rest was used for regular living expenses.<sup id=\"ref-fn3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>When this couple purchased their first marital home the down payment CT Page 4401 came from savings and from a $9,000 gift from the plaintiff's mother.<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup>\nFive years later the couple purchased the current marital residence, using a portion of the plaintiff's inheritance for some of the down payment.<sup id=\"ref-fn5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> That home is the only significant marital asset.</p>\n<p>Although he had little formal education, for twenty-five years the defendant held a series of positions that required detailed computer expertise. Many of the positions were in New York City where he applied his technical knowledge to the field of commodity trading. His highest annual salary was $110,000. As an example of his work, the defendant developed a foreign exchange application that his corporation used with new subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff worked as well, although for a majority of the marriage she earned less than the defendant did. Initially, the plaintiff worked part time outside the home while she provided the primary care for the family's three children. In the latter years of the marriage she became an administrator at the Brandywine nursing home, a facility owned by the plaintiff's family. Consequently, hers was a more secure employment.</p>\n<p>The defendant voluntarily left his last position at Brokerage Systems, Inc., in New York City. He complained that he was under excessive stress. He also complained that his employer was engaged in unethical conduct. Furthermore, the defendant desired an early retirement during which he could develop unique commodity accounts. Finally, he claimed that he wanted to spend more time with his children.</p>\n<p>When the defendant left his last computer-related position, he spent three years as a day trader. As a result of irresponsible trading, he lost all his severance pay and his entire retirement savings.<sup id=\"ref-fn6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup>\nEventually, the defendant secured a position at the Brandywine nursing home. He worked there from July 2000 to May 2002, earning $75,000 annually. Although the defendant was doing a good job at the facility and worked overtime on a regular basis, he failed to complete some required staff evaluations. As a result, the facility administrator, the plaintiff's uncle, deducted $165 from the defendant's pay. Enraged, the defendant resigned immediately. The plaintiff was aware of her uncle's action. Nevertheless, she was furious when her husband quit. She had already filed for divorce.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the plaintiff was able to provide the family's financial support. The plaintiff has a retirement fund worth approximately $20,000. There are some joint savings, monies that the plaintiff segregated from the funds available to the defendant for day trading. Additionally, there is an insurance policy current and available to these CT Page 4402 litigants.</p>\n<p>By the time of the dissolution hearing, the defendant had secured a position as a limousine driver for Executive Car Service. There he earns $10 per hour. Although searching in the field of computer technology, he has not secured any positions. He had few interviews.</p>\n<p>This marriage has deteriorated over the past six years. Part of the problem was that the defendant could not generate a steady income. As a result, the plaintiff was responsible for both the family financial security and the daily care of her daughters. Although the defendant was at times irresponsible, he also suffered from his lack of employment.<sup id=\"ref-fn7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup>\nMarriage counseling could not solve their problems.</p>\n<p><center>                               II.
