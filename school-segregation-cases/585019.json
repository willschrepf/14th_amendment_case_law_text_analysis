N.D. Okla.\n BOARD OF COUNTY                                    (D.C. No. 96-CV-87-B)\n COMMISSIONERS OF OSAGE\n COUNTY, DONNA KASTNING,\n RUSSELL COTTLE in his official\n capacity, and LARRY STUART in his\n individual capacity,\n\n               Defendants-Appellants.\n\n\n                            ORDER AND JUDGMENT\n\n\nBefore HENRY and BRISCOE , Circuit Judges, and         JENKINS , Senior District\nJudge. *\n\n\n\n\n      Mary Big Elk and Raymond Pollard, also known as Sam McClane, filed suit\n\nagainst various defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that their horses\n\nhad been illegally seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nFollowing a trial, the jury found two of the defendants liable, namely, the Board\n\n\n      *\n        The Honorable Bruce S. Jenkins, Senior District Judge for the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Utah, sitting by designation.\n\fof County Commissioners of Osage County (“Board”) and Donna Kastning, a\n\ndeputy sheriff for Osage County, and awarded the plaintiffs actual and punitive\n\ndamages. The district court later amended the judgment pursuant to a motion by\n\nthe defendants, reducing the actual damages award by three thousand dollars. In\n\naddition, the district court refused to grant the plaintiffs injunctive relief, holding\n\nthat the policy of the Osage County sheriff’s department, under which a deputy is\n\npermitted to attend a civil repossession in a stand-by capacity only, did not violate\n\nthe Constitution. The plaintiffs now appeal on various grounds. For the reasons\n\nset forth below, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.\n\n\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The facts of the case are well known to the parties and have been recounted\n\nin part in a prior appeal.   See Big Elk v. Kastning , No. 97-5012, 1998 WL 161053\n\n(10th Cir. Apr. 1, 1998). To summarize, this case arose out of a dispute between\n\nMr. McClane and Tina Kastning. Fearing that Mr. McClane would not pay a debt\n\nowed her, Tina Kastning seized several horses that were housed in stalls rented by\n\nMr. McClane. She was assisted in her efforts by several private citizens as well\n\nas several deputy sheriffs, including her sister-in-law Donna Kastning.     Under an\n\nunwritten policy in the sheriff’s department, a deputy is permitted to attend a civil\n\nrepossession but in a stand-by capacity only. That is, a private citizen can call a\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fdeputy and have the deputy accompany her to the site where the property is being\n\nheld. The deputy is not to take an active part in the repossession; rather, her sole\n\npurpose in attending is to ensure that no breach of peace takes place.\n\n\n\n                                  II. PROCEDURE\n\n      In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had illegally\n\nseized their horses in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The\n\nnamed defendants were: (1) Donna Kastning, Dan Hively, and Wes Penland, all\n\ndeputy sheriffs for Osage County; (2) Michael Kastning, Tina Kastning, Calvin\n\nKastning, and Jana Welch, all private citizens; and (3) Larry Stuart, district\n\nattorney for Osage County. Approximately six months later, the plaintiffs reached\n\na settlement agreement with Michael Kastning, Tina Kastning, and Calvin\n\nKastning. These defendants were subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit. A\n\ndefault judgment was later obtained against Ms. Welch, the remaining private\n\ncitizen defendant.\n\n      On July 26, 1996, the district court issued a scheduling order, which\n\nprovided in part that joinder of additional parties and/or amendment of pleadings\n\ntake place by July 29, 1996. Despite this order, the district court permitted the\n\nplaintiffs to amend their complaint several months later for the limited purpose of\n\n“add[ing] the Board of Commissioners of Osage County and Henry Bloomfield,\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f[s]heriff of Osage County, as parties to the case.”   1\n                                                          Aplts’ App. vol. V, at 001157\n\n(district court order, filed Nov. 5, 1996). The plaintiffs did so. However, in their\n\namended complaint, they did not simply name the Board and Sheriff Bloomfield\n\nas additional defendants; they also asked for the first time for injunctive relief,\n\nmore specifically, for a permanent injunction to enjoin the sheriff’s department\n\nfrom continuing its policy under which a deputy is permitted to attend a civil\n\nrepossession in a stand-by capacity. Furthermore, the plaintiffs stated their\n\nintention to proceed with the suit as a class action, at least with respect to the\n\nclaim for injunctive relief.\n\n       Almost a month later, the plaintiffs formally moved for class certification\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). The district court denied\n\nthe motion as untimely. Thereafter, the district court ruled on various summary\n\njudgment motions pending before it. Initially, it denied the motions but then\n\namended its order after reconsideration and granted summary judgment to Mr.\n\nStuart, the district attorney for Osage County.\n\n       The deputy sheriff defendants – Donna Kastning, Mr. Hively, and Mr.\n\nPenland – subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal, arguing that the district\n\n\n\n       1\n         Because Mr. Bloomfield died before trial and was being sued in his\nofficial capacity only, Russell Cottle, the new sheriff, was later substituted for\nhim. See Aplts’ App. vol. V, at 0001405 (district court order, filed Aug. 27,\n1998).\n\n                                             -4-\n\fcourt should have granted them summary judgment on the basis of qualified\n\nimmunity. This court dismissed the appeal. The trial began several months later,\n\nand, on October 6, 1998, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs\n\nagainst the Board and Donna Kastning, awarding $25,325 in actual damages and\n\n$10,000 in punitive damages. The remaining defendants were found not liable.\n\n      The next day, the district court entered judgment. Subsequently, both the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendants moved that it be altered or amended. The plaintiffs\n\nmoved (1) to include prejudgment interest in the award of actual damages; (2) to\n\nreconsider their request for class certification; and (3) to grant their request for\n\ninjunctive relief (i.e., to enjoin the sheriff’s department’s policy). The district\n\ncourt denied the motion. It granted, however, the defendants’ motion, reducing\n\nthe award of actual damages by three thousand dollars to reflect the amount the\n\nplaintiffs had received as part of the settlement agreement with Michael Kastning,\n\nTina Kastning, and Calvin Kastning.\n\n\n\n                                  III. DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiffs raise five arguments, namely, that the district court\n\nerred in (1) refusing to grant them injunctive relief; (2) rejecting their motion for\n\nclass certification; (3) granting summary judgment to Mr. Stuart, the district\n\nattorney for Osage County; (4) denying them prejudgment interest; and (5)\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\freducing their actual damages award by three thousand dollars. We address each\n\nof these arguments in turn.\n\n       A. Injunctive Relief\n\n       In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs included in their prayer for relief\n\na request for a permanent injunction to enjoin the sheriff’s department from\n\ncontinuing its policy under which a deputy is permitted to attend a civil\n\nrepossession in a stand-by capacity. The district court refused to grant this relief,\n\nholding that, because the policy only allowed the deputy to be present at the\n\nrepossession and nothing more, it did not violate either the Fourth or Fourteenth\n\nAmendments. We hold that the district court properly denied the plaintiffs\n\ninjunctive relief but on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing.        See Wilson v.\n\nGlenwood Intermountain Properties, Inc.        , 98 F.3d 590, 592-93 (10th Cir. 1996)\n\n(“Standing is a jurisdictional issue that may be raised by the court at any time.”).\n\n       Under City of Los Angeles v. Lyons , 461 U.S. 95 (1983), a plaintiff lacks\n\nstanding to seek prospective injunctive relief if he or she cannot show a real or\n\nimmediate threat of future harm.      See id. at 105-06; see also O’Shea v. Littleton ,\n\n414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974) (“Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself\n\nshow a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if\n\nunaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.”);              Buchwald v.\n\nUniversity of N.M. Sch. of Med.      , 159 F.3d 487, 493 (10th Cir. 1998)\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\f(“[P]laintiff’s standing to seek an injunction ordering her admission to the school\n\nbased solely on her allegations of past misconduct does not entail standing to seek\n\nan injunction prohibiting future use of the disputed preference.”). According to\n\nthe plaintiffs, they can demonstrate such a threat because they continued to be\n\ndebtors 2 after the seizure of the horses, thus making re-imposition of the policy a\n\nlikely recurrence.   See Aplts’ Reply Br. at 18. This argument, however, is not\n\npersuasive, especially in light of   Smith v. Colorado Department of Corrections   , 23\n\nF.3d 339 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n       In Smith , the plaintiff challenged a prison regulation under which an\n\ninmate’s property would no longer be held in storage if the inmate was placed in a\n\nhigher security facility such as maximum security or administrative segregation.\n\nAccording to the plaintiff, he had standing to challenge this regulation because\n\n“he ha[d] twice been regressed to higher security facilities” and so “it [was]\n\nforeseeable that it could recur,” especially since “he ha[d] twenty-seven years\n\n[remaining] to serve” and “being regressed is a common occurrence among\n\ninmates.” Id. at 341. This court rejected the argument, concluding that “[t]his\n\n\n\n       2\n         According to the plaintiffs, they were “debtors before, during, and after\nthe horsetaking [sic] incidents,” Aplts’ Reply Br. at 18. However, the plaintiffs\nmake only one citation to the record to support this claim, and that citation merely\nindicates that the two were in financial difficulty. See Aplts’ App., vol. I, at\n000139-40 (testimony of Ms. Big Elk). Still, for purposes of this opinion, we\nassume that the plaintiffs were in fact debtors.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fdoes not suffice for the concrete, actual[,] or imminent injury suffered by the\n\nplaintiff required for standing.”   Id. In short, neither the plaintiff’s past\n\nregressions nor his current status as inmate were, by themselves, sufficient to\n\nestablish a real or immediate threat of being subject to the prison regulation in the\n\nfuture.\n\n       Given Smith , we fail to see how the plaintiffs in the instant case had\n\nstanding: The fact that they were debtors does not demonstrate, without more,\n\nthat they stood a “good chance” of being subject once again to the policy.       Facio\n\nv. Jones , 929 F.2d 541, 544 (10th Cir. 1991) (noting that the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that, “while a plaintiff who has been constitutionally injured can bring a §\n\n1983 action to recover damages, that same plaintiff cannot maintain a declaratory\n\nor injunctive action unless he or she can demonstrate a good chance of being\n\nlikewise injured in the future”).   Arguably, the threat of future harm would have\n\nbeen more concrete if the plaintiffs had debts which were, with certainty, secured\n\nby personal property and past due; if one of their creditors expressed a desire to\n\nrepossess the property pledged as security; and if the creditor actually contacted\n\nthe sheriff’s department, seeking to have a deputy stand by during the\n\nrepossession. But again, nothing in the record suggests that this was the case;\n\ntherefore, the threat remained nothing more than speculation, ungrounded in\n\nreality.\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\f       B. Class Certification\n\n       Soon after filing their amended complaint with the district court, the\n\nplaintiffs formally moved for class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 23(b)(2). The relief sought was, once again, a permanent injunction to\n\nenjoin the sheriff’s department from continuing its policy. The district court\n\ndenied the motion on the basis that it was not timely filed in compliance with the\n\nscheduling order the district court had issued several months earlier.\n\n       We note first that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(f), “[i]f a party\n\nor party’s attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order, . . . the judge, upon\n\nmotion or the judge’s own initiative, may make such orders with regard thereto as\n\nare just . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f). However, we need not resolve the issue of\n\nwhether the district court acted properly pursuant to Rule 16(f) because there is a\n\nsimpler way to resolve the issue. Because the plaintiffs did not themselves have\n\nstanding to enjoin the sheriff’s department’s policy, they cannot bring a class\n\naction on behalf of others seeking that same relief.        See Fallick v. Nationwide\n\nMut. Ins. Co. , 162 F.3d 410, 423 (6th Cir. 1998) (“Threshold individual standing\n\nis a prerequisite for all actions, including class actions.”);    see also Simon v.\n\nEastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org.       , 426 U.S. 26, 40 n.20 (1976) (noting that the\n\nthreshold question when considering whether an action should be certified as\n\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fclass action must necessarily be whether the plaintiff has standing to sue on his\n\nown behalf).\n\n      C. Summary Judgment to Mr. Stuart\n\n      Mr. Stuart, the district attorney for Osage County, was named as a\n\ndefendant in the proceedings because of a conversation that had taken place\n\nbetween him and Tina Kastning’s attorney, Steve Lamirand, prior to the seizure of\n\nthe horses. Before Tina Kastning seized the horses, she contacted Mr. Lamirand,\n\nwho then called Mr. Stuart, asking him if a criminal matter was at stake given\n\ncertain facts. Mr. Stuart told Mr. Lamirand that the repossession of partnership\n\nassets was a civil matter and that if Tina Kastning took possession of the horses\n\nhe would not prosecute her.\n\n      During the proceedings below, the district court granted summary judgment\n\nto Mr. Stuart on the basis that he “did not participate in or condone the horse\n\nseizure.” Aplts’ App., Ex. D, at 2 (district court order, filed Jan. 30, 1997). The\n\ndistrict court also noted that summary judgment was proper because     Mr. Stuart\n\nwas “not an employee of Osage County or a policy maker for the purposes of a §\n\n1983 violation.”   Id. (district court order, filed Jan. 30, 1997). On appeal, the\n\nplaintiffs seek to reverse this order but only for purposes of injunctive relief –\n\ni.e., to enjoin the sheriff’s department’s policy. Once again, because the plaintiffs\n\ndid not have standing to seek this relief, they can sustain no such claim.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f       D. Prejudgment Interest\n\n       It is well established that “[t]he decision [of] whether or not to allow\n\nprejudgment interest rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n\nAccordingly, the standard of review on appeal is whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding – or in declining to award – prejudgment interest.”        Kleier\n\nAdver., Inc. v. Premier Pontiac, Inc.    , 921 F.2d 1036, 1040 (10th Cir. 1990)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “Under the abuse of discretion standard[,] a\n\ntrial court’s decision will not be disturbed unless the appellate court has a definite\n\nand firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or\n\nexceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.”         Towerridge,\n\nInc. v. T.A.O., Inc. , 111 F.3d 758, 763 (10th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       In its order, the district court began its analysis by explaining that “[t]he\n\nrationale underlying an award of prejudgment interest is ‘to compensate the\n\nwronged party for being deprived of the monetary value of his loss from the time\n\nof the loss to the payment of judgment.’” Aplts’ Br., Ex. A, at 2-3 (district court\n\norder, filed Apr. 16, 1999) (quoting     U.S. Indus., Inc. v. Touche Ross & Co.   , 854\n\nF.2d 1223, 1256 (10th Cir. 1988),       implied overruling on other grounds recognized\n\nby Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co.       , 77 F.3d 1215, 1231 (10th Cir. 1996)). It\n\nthen denied the plaintiffs prejudgment interest, concluding that such an award\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\fwould be enrichment and not compensation because the plaintiffs had unduly\n\ndelayed in filing suit after the horses were seized and then returned.     See id. at 4\n\n(district court order, filed Apr. 16, 1999) (“The suit was commenced some 17\n\nmonths after the return of the horses to Plaintiffs. Under these facts, awarding\n\ncompensation in the form of prejudgment interest would serve to enrich Plaintiffs\n\nfor a substantial period of time after the return of their horses and the Court\n\nconcludes it is not warranted.”).\n\n       A delay in filing may be taken into account in making a determination on\n\nprejudgment interest.     See Martin A. Schwartz & John E. Kirklin, 1C     Section\n\n1983 Litigation § 16.17 (1997) (noting that, in deciding whether and how much\n\nprejudgment interest should be granted, federal courts have considered various\n\nfactors, including delay in filing);   cf. Williamson v. Handy Button Mach. Co.      , 817\n\nF.2d 1290, 1298 (7th Cir. 1987) (discussing delay in filing in § 1981 context)       .\n\nHowever, as the plaintiffs note, they requested prejudgment interest only from the\n\ndate they filed the complaint, not from the date the horses were seized or\n\nreturned. We therefore must vacate and remand so that the district court may\n\nreconsider the denial in light of the fact that the plaintiffs seek prejudgment\n\ninterest only from the date the complaint was filed.     3\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         We note that the district court did award prejudgment interest to the\nplaintiffs with respect to their claim against Ms. Welch. Notably, prejudgment\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                            -12-\n\f       E. Reduction in Actual Damages Award\n\n       Following the jury verdict, the district court reduced the award of actual\n\ndamages by three thousand dollars to reflect the sum paid by Michael Kastning,\n\nTina Kastning, and Calvin Kastning as part of the settlement agreement with the\n\nplaintiffs. We review the method of calculation of damages de novo and the\n\nactual calculation of damages for clear error.       See Southern Colo. MRI, Ltd. v.\n\nMed-Alliance, Inc. , 166 F.3d 1094, 1100 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n       As a preliminary matter, we note that § 1983 does not contain any provision\n\nas to the propriety of offsetting an actual damages award because of a settlement.\n\nBecause § 1983 does not provide any substantive law on the matter, we are\n\nobligated to “fill [the] interstices” of this federal statutory scheme.   Miller v.\n\nApartment & Homes of N.J., Inc.       , 646 F.2d 101, 107 (3d Cir. 1981). Happily,\n\n“Congress [has] provided [us with] some modest guidance for resolving” this\n\nproblem through 42 U.S.C. § 1988.         Id. at 105. Section 1988 dictates that, where\n\nthere are gaps in a civil rights statute, we must first look to federal law to supply\n\nthe substantive law, but if federal law is somehow deficient then we apply state\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        (...continued)\ninterest began to accrue on the day the plaintiffs filed their complaint. See Aplts’\nApp. vol. V, at 001411 (district court order, filed Nov. 25, 1996) (awarding\nprejudgment interest “from the date of filing until the date of this Judgment”).\n\n                                              -13-\n\flaw, that is, assuming it is consistent with the Constitution and other federal law.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\n      For purposes of this case, whether we are guided by federal law or state\n\nlaw is not important because, under either, there would be a reduction in the\n\nplaintiffs’ actual damages award because of the money received as part of the\n\nsettlement agreement.   4\n                            See generally Miller , 646 F.2d at 101 (applying federal\n\ncommon law and reducing the damages award by the amount of settlement); 12\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. § 832(H)(1)     (“When a release, covenant not to sue, or a similar\n\nagreement is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for\n\nthe same injury . . . [i]t does not discharge any other tort-feasor from liability for\n\nthe injury . . . unless the other tort-feasor is specifically named; but it reduces the\n\nclaim against others to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the\n\ncovenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever is greater .\n\n. . .”). In any event, the plaintiffs do not seriously contend that there should be\n\nno offset whatsoever. The real issue for the plaintiffs is the amount of the offset.\n\n\n\n      4\n         The plaintiffs do not argue whether reduction should proceed on a dollar-\nfor-dollar basis or a proportionate share basis. See Dobson v. Camden, 705 F.2d\n759, 768 (5th Cir. 1983) (discussing the various possible methods of reducing),\nreh’g en banc, 725 F.3d 1003 (1984). Consequently, we do not address this\nmatter on appeal. See In re Walker, 959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir. 1992) (noting\nthe general rule that “a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not\npassed upon below”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fThe district court reduced the actual damages award by three thousand dollars –\n\ni.e., the entire settlement award. According to the plaintiffs, this was error\n\nbecause the settlement award was not simply compensation for the seizure of the\n\nhorses; rather, the settlement award also covered other injuries sustained by the\n\nplaintiffs for which only the settling defendants were responsible, including an\n\nassault of Mr. McClane and damage to a car as a result of the assault.\n\nConsequently, the plaintiffs assert that the offset should be less than three\n\nthousand dollars.\n\n       We disagree, concluding that the district court did not clearly err in\n\nreducing the actual damages award by the entire amount of the settlement.\n\nAdmittedly, there is some evidence in the record that suggests Mr. McClane was\n\nassaulted and that this assault led to property damage. Furthermore, the\n\nsettlement agreement specified that it covered not only actual claims raised in the\n\npleadings but potential claims as well.   See Aplts’ App. vol. V, at 001136-37\n\n(agreed journal entry of compromise, settlement and judgment dismissing claims\n\nwith prejudice, filed Aug. 26, 1996). However, even if the assault and property\n\ndamage were taken into account in negotiating the settlement, the settlement\n\nagreement on its face made no distinction as to which part of the award was\n\ncompensation for which injury. The district court therefore had no meaningful\n\nway of determining an appropriate set-off. Notably, the plaintiffs themselves\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\ffailed to provide any guidance on the matter, simply contending that the set-off\n\nshould be an unspecified amount less than three thousand dollars.\n\n      Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE and REMAND in part for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                               Entered for the Court,\n\n\n\n                                               Robert H.

Jenkins, Senior District Judge for the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Utah, sitting by designation.\n\fof County Commissioners of Osage County (“Board”) and Donna Kastning, a\n\ndeputy sheriff for Osage County, and awarded the plaintiffs actual and punitive\n\ndamages. The district court later amended the judgment pursuant to a motion by\n\nthe defendants, reducing the actual damages award by three thousand dollars. In\n\naddition, the district court refused to grant the plaintiffs injunctive relief, holding\n\nthat the policy of the Osage County sheriff’s department, under which a deputy is\n\npermitted to attend a civil repossession in a stand-by capacity only, did not violate\n\nthe Constitution. The plaintiffs now appeal on various grounds. For the reasons\n\nset forth below, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.\n\n\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The facts of the case are well known to the parties and have been recounted\n\nin part in a prior appeal.   See Big Elk v. Kastning , No. 97-5012, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">161053</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(10th Cir. Apr. 1, 1998). To summarize, this case arose out of a dispute between\n\nMr. McClane and Tina Kastning. Fearing that Mr. McClane would not pay a debt\n\nowed her, Tina Kastning seized several horses that were housed in stalls rented by\n\nMr. McClane. She was assisted in her efforts by several private citizens as well\n\nas several deputy sheriffs, including her sister-in-law Donna Kastning.     Under an\n\nunwritten policy in the sheriff’s department, a deputy is permitted to attend a civil\n\nrepossession but in a stand-by capacity only. That is, a private citizen can call a\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fdeputy and have the deputy accompany her to the site where the property is being\n\nheld. The deputy is not to take an active part in the repossession; rather, her sole\n\npurpose in attending is to ensure that no breach of peace takes place.\n\n\n\n                                  II. PROCEDURE\n\n      In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had illegally\n\nseized their horses in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The\n\nnamed defendants were: (1) Donna Kastning, Dan Hively, and Wes Penland, all\n\ndeputy sheriffs for Osage County; (2) Michael Kastning, Tina Kastning, Calvin\n\nKastning, and Jana Welch, all private citizens; and (3) Larry Stuart, district\n\nattorney for Osage County. Approximately six months later, the plaintiffs reached\n\na settlement agreement with Michael Kastning, Tina Kastning, and Calvin\n\nKastning. These defendants were subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit. A\n\ndefault judgment was later obtained against Ms. Welch, the remaining private\n\ncitizen defendant.\n\n      On July 26, 1996, the district court issued a scheduling order, which\n\nprovided in part that joinder of additional parties and/or amendment of pleadings\n\ntake place by July 29, 1996. Despite this order, the district court permitted the\n\nplaintiffs to amend their complaint several months later for the limited purpose of\n\n“add[ing] the Board of Commissioners of Osage County and Henry Bloomfield,\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f[s]heriff of Osage County, as parties to the case.”   1\n                                                          Aplts’ App. vol. V, at 001157\n\n(district court order, filed Nov. 5, 1996). The plaintiffs did so. However, in their\n\namended complaint, they did not simply name the Board and Sheriff Bloomfield\n\nas additional defendants; they also asked for the first time for injunctive relief,\n\nmore specifically, for a permanent injunction to enjoin the sheriff’s department\n\nfrom continuing its policy under which a deputy is permitted to attend a civil\n\nrepossession in a stand-by capacity. Furthermore, the plaintiffs stated their\n\nintention to proceed with the suit as a class action, at least with respect to the\n\nclaim for injunctive relief.\n\n       Almost a month later, the plaintiffs formally moved for class certification\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). The district court denied\n\nthe motion as untimely. Thereafter, the district court ruled on various summary\n\njudgment motions pending before it. Initially, it denied the motions but then\n\namended its order after reconsideration and granted summary judgment to Mr.\n\nStuart, the district attorney for Osage County.\n\n       The deputy sheriff defendants – Donna Kastning, Mr. Hively, and Mr.\n\nPenland – subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal, arguing that the district\n\n\n\n       1\n         Because Mr. Bloomfield died before trial and was being sued in his\nofficial capacity only, Russell Cottle, the new sheriff, was later substituted for\nhim. See Aplts’ App. vol. V, at 0001405 (district court order, filed Aug. 27,\n1998).\n\n                                             -4-\n\fcourt should have granted them summary judgment on the basis of qualified\n\nimmunity. This court dismissed the appeal. The trial began several months later,\n\nand, on October 6, 1998, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs\n\nagainst the Board and Donna Kastning, awarding $25,325 in actual damages and\n\n$10,000 in punitive damages. The remaining defendants were found not liable.\n\n      The next day, the district court entered judgment. Subsequently, both the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendants moved that it be altered or amended. The plaintiffs\n\nmoved (1) to include prejudgment interest in the award of actual damages; (2) to\n\nreconsider their request for class certification; and (3) to grant their request for\n\ninjunctive relief (i.e., to enjoin the sheriff’s department’s policy). The district\n\ncourt denied the motion. It granted, however, the defendants’ motion, reducing\n\nthe award of actual damages by three thousand dollars to reflect the amount the\n\nplaintiffs had received as part of the settlement agreement with Michael Kastning,\n\nTina Kastning, and Calvin Kastning.\n\n\n\n                                  III. DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiffs raise five arguments, namely, that the district court\n\nerred in (1) refusing to grant them injunctive relief; (2) rejecting their motion for\n\nclass certification; (3) granting summary judgment to Mr. Stuart, the district\n\nattorney for Osage County; (4) denying them prejudgment interest; and (5)\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\freducing their actual damages award by three thousand dollars. We address each\n\nof these arguments in turn.\n\n       A. Injunctive Relief\n\n       In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs included in their prayer for relief\n\na request for a permanent injunction to enjoin the sheriff’s department from\n\ncontinuing its policy under which a deputy is permitted to attend a civil\n\nrepossession in a stand-by capacity. The district court refused to grant this relief,\n\nholding that, because the policy only allowed the deputy to be present at the\n\nrepossession and nothing more, it did not violate either the Fourth or Fourteenth\n\nAmendments. We hold that the district court properly denied the plaintiffs\n\ninjunctive relief but on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing.

According to\n\nthe plaintiffs, they can demonstrate such a threat because they continued to be\n\ndebtors 2 after the seizure of the horses, thus making re-imposition of the policy a\n\nlikely recurrence.   See Aplts’ Reply Br. at 18. This argument, however, is not\n\npersuasive, especially in light of   Smith v. Colorado Department of Corrections   , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669160\"><a href=\"/opinion/669160/dale-r-smith-and-scott-kelly-janke-siyani-f-masamba-also-known-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n       In Smith , the plaintiff challenged a prison regulation under which an\n\ninmate’s property would no longer be held in storage if the inmate was placed in a\n\nhigher security facility such as maximum security or administrative segregation.\n\nAccording to the plaintiff, he had standing to challenge this regulation because\n\n“he ha[d] twice been regressed to higher security facilities” and so “it [was]\n\nforeseeable that it could recur,” especially since “he ha[d] twenty-seven years\n\n[remaining] to serve” and “being regressed is a common occurrence among\n\ninmates.” Id. at 341. This court rejected the argument, concluding that “[t]his\n\n\n\n       2\n         According to the plaintiffs, they were “debtors before, during, and after\nthe horsetaking [sic] incidents,” Aplts’ Reply Br. at 18. However, the plaintiffs\nmake only one citation to the record to support this claim, and that citation merely\nindicates that the two were in financial difficulty. See Aplts’ App., vol. I, at\n000139-40 (testimony of Ms. Big Elk). Still, for purposes of this opinion, we\nassume that the plaintiffs were in fact debtors.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fdoes not suffice for the concrete, actual[,] or imminent injury suffered by the\n\nplaintiff required for standing.”   Id. In short, neither the plaintiff’s past\n\nregressions nor his current status as inmate were, by themselves, sufficient to\n\nestablish a real or immediate threat of being subject to the prison regulation in the\n\nfuture.\n\n       Given Smith , we fail to see how the plaintiffs in the instant case had\n\nstanding: The fact that they were debtors does not demonstrate, without more,\n\nthat they stood a “good chance” of being subject once again to the policy.

Arguably, the threat of future harm would have\n\nbeen more concrete if the plaintiffs had debts which were, with certainty, secured\n\nby personal property and past due; if one of their creditors expressed a desire to\n\nrepossess the property pledged as security; and if the creditor actually contacted\n\nthe sheriff’s department, seeking to have a deputy stand by during the\n\nrepossession. But again, nothing in the record suggests that this was the case;\n\ntherefore, the threat remained nothing more than speculation, ungrounded in\n\nreality.\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\f       B. Class Certification\n\n       Soon after filing their amended complaint with the district court, the\n\nplaintiffs formally moved for class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 23(b)(2). The relief sought was, once again, a permanent injunction to\n\nenjoin the sheriff’s department from continuing its policy. The district court\n\ndenied the motion on the basis that it was not timely filed in compliance with the\n\nscheduling order the district court had issued several months earlier.\n\n       We note first that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(f), “[i]f a party\n\nor party’s attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order, . . . the judge, upon\n\nmotion or the judge’s own initiative, may make such orders with regard thereto as\n\nare just . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f). However, we need not resolve the issue of\n\nwhether the district court acted properly pursuant to Rule 16(f) because there is a\n\nsimpler way to resolve the issue. Because the plaintiffs did not themselves have\n\nstanding to enjoin the sheriff’s department’s policy, they cannot bring a class\n\naction on behalf of others seeking that same relief.

Summary Judgment to Mr. Stuart\n\n      Mr. Stuart, the district attorney for Osage County, was named as a\n\ndefendant in the proceedings because of a conversation that had taken place\n\nbetween him and Tina Kastning’s attorney, Steve Lamirand, prior to the seizure of\n\nthe horses. Before Tina Kastning seized the horses, she contacted Mr. Lamirand,\n\nwho then called Mr. Stuart, asking him if a criminal matter was at stake given\n\ncertain facts. Mr. Stuart told Mr. Lamirand that the repossession of partnership\n\nassets was a civil matter and that if Tina Kastning took possession of the horses\n\nhe would not prosecute her.\n\n      During the proceedings below, the district court granted summary judgment\n\nto Mr. Stuart on the basis that he “did not participate in or condone the horse\n\nseizure.” Aplts’ App., Ex. D, at 2 (district court order, filed Jan. 30, 1997).

Once again, because the plaintiffs\n\ndid not have standing to seek this relief, they can sustain no such claim.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f       D. Prejudgment Interest\n\n       It is well established that “[t]he decision [of] whether or not to allow\n\nprejudgment interest rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n\nAccordingly, the standard of review on appeal is whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding – or in declining to award – prejudgment interest.”        Kleier\n\nAdver., Inc. v.

It\n\nthen denied the plaintiffs prejudgment interest, concluding that such an award\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\fwould be enrichment and not compensation because the plaintiffs had unduly\n\ndelayed in filing suit after the horses were seized and then returned.     See id. at 4\n\n(district court order, filed Apr. 16, 1999) (“The suit was commenced some 17\n\nmonths after the return of the horses to Plaintiffs. Under these facts, awarding\n\ncompensation in the form of prejudgment interest would serve to enrich Plaintiffs\n\nfor a substantial period of time after the return of their horses and the Court\n\nconcludes it is not warranted.”).\n\n       A delay in filing may be taken into account in making a determination on\n\nprejudgment interest.     See Martin A. Schwartz & John E.

Happily,\n\n“Congress [has] provided [us with] some modest guidance for resolving” this\n\nproblem through 42 U.S.C. § 1988.         Id. at 105.

See Aplts’\nApp. vol. V, at 001411 (district court order, filed Nov. 25, 1996) (awarding\nprejudgment interest “from the date of filing until the date of this Judgment”).\n\n                                              -13-\n\flaw, that is, assuming it is consistent with the Constitution and other federal law.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\n      For purposes of this case, whether we are guided by federal law or state\n\nlaw is not important because, under either, there would be a reduction in the\n\nplaintiffs’ actual damages award because of the money received as part of the\n\nsettlement agreement.   4\n                            See generally Miller , 646 F.2d at 101 (applying federal\n\ncommon law and reducing the damages award by the amount of settlement); 12\n\nOkla. Stat. Ann. § 832(H)(1)     (“When a release, covenant not to sue, or a similar\n\nagreement is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for\n\nthe same injury . . .

In any event, the plaintiffs do not seriously contend that there should be\n\nno offset whatsoever. The real issue for the plaintiffs is the amount of the offset.\n\n\n\n      4\n         The plaintiffs do not argue whether reduction should proceed on a dollar-\nfor-dollar basis or a proportionate share basis. See Dobson v.

According to the plaintiffs, this was error\n\nbecause the settlement award was not simply compensation for the seizure of the\n\nhorses; rather, the settlement award also covered other injuries sustained by the\n\nplaintiffs for which only the settling defendants were responsible, including an\n\nassault of Mr. McClane and damage to a car as a result of the assault.\n\nConsequently, the plaintiffs assert that the offset should be less than three\n\nthousand dollars.\n\n       We disagree, concluding that the district court did not clearly err in\n\nreducing the actual damages award by the entire amount of the settlement.\n\nAdmittedly, there is some evidence in the record that suggests Mr. McClane was\n\nassaulted and that this assault led to property damage. Furthermore, the\n\nsettlement agreement specified that it covered not only actual claims raised in the\n\npleadings but potential claims as well.   See Aplts’ App. vol. V, at 001136-37\n\n(agreed journal entry of compromise, settlement and judgment dismissing claims\n\nwith prejudice, filed Aug. 26, 1996). However, even if the assault and property\n\ndamage were taken into account in negotiating the settlement, the settlement\n\nagreement on its face made no distinction as to which part of the award was\n\ncompensation for which injury. The district court therefore had no meaningful\n\nway of determining an appropriate set-off. Notably, the plaintiffs themselves\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\ffailed to provide any guidance on the matter, simply contending that the set-off\n\nshould be an unspecified amount less than three thousand dollars.\n\n      Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE and REMAND in part for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                               Entered for the Court,\n\n\n\n                                               Robert H.
