The Hartmanns alleged that the Board had\nfailed to ensure that Mark was educated with non-handicapped chil-\ndren \"to the maximum extent appropriate\" as required by the IDEA's\nmainstreaming provision, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(5)(B). The district court\nagreed, rejecting the findings of both the local hearing officer\nand the\nstate review officer. The Board appeals, contending that the\ncourt's\ndecision is contrary to the law and the evidence in the record. We\nagree. As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the IDEA does not\ngrant federal courts a license to substitute their own notions of\nsound\neducational policy for those of local school authorities, or to\ndisregard\nthe findings developed in state administrative proceedings. Upon\n\n                                 3\n\fcareful review of the record, however, we are forced to conclude\nthat\nthis is precisely what has occurred in this case. Accordingly, we\nreverse and remand with directions to dismiss.\n\nI.\n\nMark Hartmann is an eleven-year-old autistic child. Autism is a\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by significant deficiencies in\ncommunication skills, social interaction, and motor control. Mark\nis\nunable to speak and suffers severe problems with fine motor coordi-\nnation. Mark's writing ability is extremely limited; he does not\nwrite\nby hand and can consistently type only a few words such as \"is\" and\n\"at\" by himself on a keyboard device known as a Canon communica-\ntor. The parties agree that Mark's greatest need is to develop\ncommu-\nnication skills.\n\nMark spent his pre-school years in various programs for disabled\nchildren. In kindergarten, he spent half his time in a\nself-contained\nprogram for autistic children and half in a regular education\nclass-\nroom at Butterfield Elementary in Lombard, Illinois. Upon entering\nfirst grade, Mark received speech and occupational therapy one-on-\none, but was otherwise included in the regular classroom at Butter-\nfield full-time with an aide to assist him.\n\nAfter Mark's first-grade year, the Hartmanns moved to Loudoun\nCounty, Virginia, where they enrolled Mark at Ashburn Elementary\nfor the 1993-1994 school year. Based on Mark's individualized edu-\ncation program (IEP) from Illinois, the school placed Mark in a\nregu-\nlar education classroom. To facilitate Mark's inclusion, Loudoun\nofficials carefully selected his teacher, hired a full-time aide to\nassist\nhim, and put him in a smaller class with more independent children.\nMark's teacher, Diane Johnson, read extensively about autism, and\nboth Johnson and Mark's aide, Suz Leitner, received training in\nfacili-\ntated communication, a special communication technique used with\nautistic children. Mark received five hours per week of speech and\nlanguage therapy with a qualified specialist, Carolyn Clement.\nHalf-\nway through the year, Virginia McCullough, a special education\nteacher, was assigned to provide Mark with three hours of\ninstruction\na week and to advise Mark's teacher and aide.\n\n                                 4\n\fMary Kearney, the Loudoun County Director of Special Education,\npersonally worked with Mark's IEP team, which consisted of John-\nson, Leitner, Clement, and Laurie McDonald, the principal of Ash-\nburn. Kearney provided in-service training for the Ashburn staff on\nautism and inclusion of disabled children in the regular classroom.\nJohnson, Leitner, Clement, and McDonald also attended a seminar on\ninclusion held by the Virginia Council for Administrators of\nSpecial\nEducation. Mark's IEP team also received assistance from educa-\ntional consultants Jamie Ruppmann and Gail Mayfield, and Johnson\nconferred with additional specialists whose names were provided to\nher by the Hartmanns and the school. Mark's curriculum was continu-\nally modified to ensure that it was properly adapted to his needs\nand\nabilities.\n\nFrank Johnson, supervisor of the county's program for autistic\nchil-\ndren, formally joined the IEP team in January, but provided\nassistance\nthroughout the year in managing Mark's behavior. Mark engaged in\ndaily episodes of loud screeching and other disruptive conduct such\nas hitting, pinching, kicking, biting, and removing his clothing.\nThese\noutbursts not only required Diane Johnson and Leitner to calm Mark\nand redirect him, but also consumed the additional time necessary\nto\nget the rest of the children back on task after the distraction.\n\nDespite these efforts, by the end of the year Mark's IEP team con-\ncluded that he was making no academic progress in the regular\nclass-\nroom. In Mark's May 1994 IEP, the team therefore proposed to place\nMark in a class specifically structured for autistic children at\nLees-\nburg Elementary. Leesburg is a regular elementary school which\nhouses the autism class in order to facilitate interaction between\nthe\nautistic children and students who are not handicapped. The\nLeesburg\nclass would have included five autistic students working with a\nspe-\ncial education teacher and at least one full-time aide. Under the\nMay\nIEP, Mark would have received only academic instruction and speech\nin the self-contained classroom, while joining a regular class for\nart,\nmusic, physical education, library, and recess. The Leesburg\nprogram\nalso would have permitted Mark to increase the portion of his\ninstruc-\ntion received in a regular education setting as he demonstrated an\nimproved ability to handle it.\n\fThe Hartmanns refused to approve the IEP, claiming that it failed\nto comply with the mainstreaming provision of the IDEA, which\n\n                               5\n\fstates that \"to the maximum extent appropriate,\" disabled children\nshould be educated with children who are not handicapped. 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B). The county initiated due process proceedings, see 20\nU.S.C. ยง 1415(b), and on December 14, 1994, the local hearing offi-\ncer upheld the May 1994 IEP. She found that Mark's behavior was\ndisruptive and that despite the \"enthusiastic\" efforts of the\ncounty, he\nhad obtained no academic benefit from the regular education class-\nroom. On May 3, 1995, the state review officer affirmed the\ndecision,\nadopting both the hearing officer's findings and her legal\nanalysis.\nThe Hartmanns then challenged the hearing officer's decision in\nfed-\neral court.\nWhile the administrative process continued, Mark entered third\ngrade in the regular education classroom at Ashburn. In December of\nthat year, the Hartmanns withdrew Mark from Ashburn. Mark and his\nmother moved to Montgomery County, Virginia, to permit the Hart-\nmanns to enroll Mark in public school there. Mark was placed in the\nregular third-grade classroom for the remainder of that year as\nwell\nas the next.1\n\nThe district court reversed the hearing officer's decision. The\ncourt\nrejected the administrative findings and concluded that Mark could\nreceive significant educational benefit in a regular classroom and\nthat\n\"the Board simply did not take enough appropriate steps to try to\ninclude Mark in a regular class.\" The court made little of the\ntesti-\nmony of Mark's Loudoun County instructors, and instead relied heav-\nily on its reading of Mark's experience in Illinois and Montgomery\nCounty. While the hearing officer had addressed Mark's conduct in\ndetail, the court stated that \"[g]iven the strong presumption for\ninclu-\nsion under the IDEA, disruptive behavior should not be a\nsignificant\nfactor in determining the appropriate educational placement for a\ndis-\nabled child.\" Loudoun County now appeals.\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Loudoun County contends that the Hartmanns do not present a valid\ncase or controversy because Mark is currently in an educational\nplace-\nment which the Hartmanns find appropriate. Under the unusual\ncircum-\nstances of this case, this conclusion is not correct. There is no\nquestion\nthat the Hartmanns would re-enroll Mark in Loudoun County if their\nsuit\n\fis successful. Specifically, the Hartmanns' expressed intent to\nreturn\nMark to school there is corroborated by the fact that Mark's father\nand\nsister continue to occupy the family's home in Loudoun County.\n\n                                 6\n\fII.\n\nThe IDEA embodies important principles governing the relation-\nship between local school authorities and a reviewing district\ncourt.\nAlthough section 1415(e)(2) provides district courts with authority\nto\ngrant \"appropriate\" relief based on a preponderance of the\nevidence,\n20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(e)(2), that section \"is by no means an invitation\nto\nthe courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational\npolicy\nfor those of the school authorities which they review.\" Board of\nEdu-\ncation of Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v. Rowley , 458 U.S.\n176, 206 (1982). Absent some statutory infraction, the task of\neduca-\ntion belongs to the educators who have been charged by society with\nthat critical task. Likewise, federal courts must accord \"due\nweight\"\nto state administrative proceedings. Id. Administrative findings in\nan\nIDEA case \"are entitled to be considered prima facie correct,\" and\n\"the district court, if it is not going to follow them, is required\nto\nexplain why it does not.\" Doyle v. Arlington County Sch. Bd. , 953\nF.2d 100, 105 (4th Cir. 1991).\n\nThese principles reflect the IDEA's recognition that federal courts\ncannot run local schools. Local educators deserve latitude in\ndeter-\nmining the individualized education program most appropriate for a\ndisabled child. The IDEA does not deprive these educators of the\nright to apply their professional judgment. Rather it establishes\na\n\"basic floor of opportunity\" for every handicapped child. Rowley,\n458\nU.S. at 201. States must provide specialized instruction and\nrelated\nservices \"sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the\nhand-\nicapped child,\" id. at 200, but the Act does not require \"the\nfurnishing\nof every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped\nchild's potential,\" id. at 199.\nIn this same vein, the IDEA's mainstreaming provision establishes\na presumption, not an inflexible federal mandate. Under its terms,\ndis-\nabled children are to be educated with children who are not handi-\ncapped only \"to the maximum extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B). Section 1412(5)(B) explicitly          states that\n\fmainstreaming\nis not appropriate \"when the nature or severity of the disability\nis such\nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplementary\naids\nand services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B); see also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181 n.4.\n                                7\n\fIII.\n\nThe district court's ruling strayed generally from the aforemen-\ntioned principles. It diverged in particular from our decision in\nDeVries v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., 882 F.2d 876 (4th Cir. 1989).\nIn\nDeVries, we held that mainstreaming is not required where (1) the\ndisabled child would not receive an educational benefit from main-\nstreaming into a regular class; (2) any marginal benefit from main-\nstreaming would be significantly outweighed by benefits which could\nfeasibly be obtained only in a separate instructional setting; or,\n(3) the\ndisabled child is a disruptive force in a regular classroom\nsetting. Id.\nat 879. Although the district court failed to mention DeVries, its\nopin-\nion suggests that none of these three categories describes Mark's\nsitu-\nation. The district court found that Mark could receive substantial\neducational benefit in a regular classroom, that his disruptive\nbehavior\nwas not sufficient to justify a more segregated instructional\nsetting,\nand that the Leesburg program would not have been an appropriate\nplacement. After careful examination of the record, however, we are\nforced to conclude that the district court's decision fails to\naccount for\nthe administrative findings and is not supported by the evidence\nbased\non a correct application of the law. In effect, the court simply\nsubsti-\ntuted its own judgment regarding Mark's proper educational program\nfor that of local school officials.\n\nA.\n\nIn finding that Mark could receive an educational benefit in a\nregu-\nlar classroom, the district court disregarded both the hearing\nofficer's\nfinding and the overwhelming evidence that Mark made no academic\nprogress in the regular second grade classroom at Ashburn. Mark's\nteacher testified, for example, that he was unable to retain\nskills:\n\"once we thought he mastered [a math skill] and we left it alone\nand\nwent onto another concept, if we went back to review, it seemed\nthat\nhe had forgotten.\" She confessed, \"I felt like he lost a year in my\nclassroom.\" Other Loudoun County personnel testified to the same\neffect. His speech therapist, for instance, stated that \"[t]he only\ngain\nthat I saw him make was in the one to one setting.\" The supervisor\n\ffor the county's program for autistic students likewise concluded,\n\"I\nthink there has been no progress academically in the inclusive set-\ntings;\" \"I think we're wasting his time.\" The hearing officer\naccord-\n\n                                 8\n\fingly found that \"Mark made no measurable academic progress\nattributable to his placement in the regular classroom.\"\n\nMark's situation is similar to the one we faced in DeVries, 882\nF.2d 876. In upholding Fairfax County's decision not to place\nMichael DeVries in Annandale High School, the court observed not\nonly that Michael would derive virtually no academic benefit from\nthe\nregular classroom, but also that his work would be at a much lower\nlevel than his classmates and that he would in effect \"simply be\nmoni-\ntoring classes.\" Id. at 879. Here the hearing officer made an\nidentical\nfinding, concluding that Mark \"did not participate in the regular\ncur-\nriculum, but was provided his own curriculum.\" Mark's special edu-\ncation teacher in Loudoun County explained, \"Mark needs a\ncompletely different program . . . . His skills have to be taught\nin a\ndifferent way, in a different sequence, and even a different group\nof\nskills . . . from what his typical functioning peers are learning.\"\n\nThe district court acknowledged the testimony of Mark's second\ngrade teacher regarding his lack of progress, but asserted that the\nhearing officer's conclusions were erroneous because the officer\nfailed to give due weight to the testimony of Cathy Thornton,\nMark's\nprivate tutor during second grade, and to Mark's first grade\nexperi-\nence in Illinois. To the contrary, the administrative decisions\ntook\ncareful note of both. The hearing officer fully credited Thornton's\ntes-\ntimony, finding that Mark made progress with both her and his\nspeech\ntherapist. The officer went further, however, and observed that\nboth\nthe tutoring and speech instruction occurred in a one-to-one\nsetting\noutside of the regular class. In light of Mark's failure to\nprogress in\nthe regular classroom, the officer drew the only reasonable\ninference\nfrom this evidence, namely that separate instruction was precisely\nwhat Mark needed to make educational progress. As to Mark's expe-\nrience in Illinois, the state review officer explained that the\nIllinois\nassessment of Mark's capabilities was flawed:\n\n     [I]t became clear during the course of the second grade that\n     Mark's academic skills were not as advanced as the Illinois\n     school system thought. Mark cannot read and cannot add,\n\fyet the Illinois teachers thought he was reading at first\ngrade\nlevel and progressing in the first grade math workbook. . . .\nMark apparently did not make the academic progress in first\n\n                           9\n\f     grade the records forwarded to Loudoun County from Illi-\n     nois indicated . . . .\n\nWhile the district court opinion references the hearing officer's\ndeci-\nsion, its failure to address the administrative findings noted\nabove\nsimply does not reflect the teachings of Rowley and Doyle that\nstate\nproceedings must command considerable deference in federal courts.\n\nThe district court also relied heavily on Mark's subsequent perfor-\nmance in the Montgomery County schools during fourth grade. While\nMontgomery County personnel did make some conclusory statements\nasserting that Mark made progress, the evidence is inconclusive at\nbest. The district court pointed to math skills Mark demonstrated\nat\nthe end of fourth grade, for example, but Mark was pulled out of\nthe\nregular class for math instruction, just as Loudoun County had\nrecom-\nmended. Any progress he made in math therefore simply supports the\nconclusion that separate, one-on-one instruction is appropriate for\nMark. Mark also continued to receive speech therapy one-on-one, and\nhis special education teacher in Montgomery County admitted that\nthe\ncounty had no reliable method for assessing Mark's reading ability.\n\nFinally, the district court pointed to perceived improvement in\nMark's social skills due to interaction with his non-disabled\npeers.\nAny such benefits, however, cannot outweigh his failure to progress\nacademically in the regular classroom. The mainstreaming provision\nrepresents recognition of the value of having disabled children\ninter-\nact with non-handicapped students. The fact that the provision only\ncreates a presumption, however, reflects a congressional judgment\nthat receipt of such social benefits is ultimately a goal\nsubordinate to\nthe requirement that disabled children receive educational benefit.\nHere the evidence clearly supports the judgment of the local educa-\ntion officials and the administrative hearing officers that Mark's\nedu-\ncational progress required significant instruction outside of the\nregular\nclassroom setting.\n\nB.\n\nThe district court attributed Mark's lack of progress in Loudoun\nCounty to the county's alleged failure to make reasonable efforts\nto\naccommodate him in the regular classroom. We interpret this as a\n\frul-\n\n       10\n\fing that the county failed to provide the supplementary aids and\nser-\nvices contemplated by the IDEA's mainstreaming provision. 20\nU.S.C. ยง 1412(5)(B).\n\nThe district court's conclusion is remarkable in light of the\nexten-\nsive measures taken on Mark's behalf. The hearing officer found\nthat\nLoudoun personnel were \"enthusiastic\" about including Mark at Ash-\nburn, a description fully supported by the record. The Ashburn\nprinci-\npal deliberately reduced the size of Mark's class and ensured that\nit\nwas composed of students who were more independent and had\nhigher level skills. Mark's teacher was selected because of her\nexcel-\nlent teaching abilities, and the county hired a full-time,\none-on-one\naide for Mark. Mark received a full hour of speech and language\ninstruction daily. Frank Johnson, the supervisor of the county's\npro-\ngram for autistic children, provided assistance in behavior manage-\nment throughout the year. Halfway through the year, the school's\nefforts increased when Virginia McCullough began providing special\neducation services directly to Mark as well as advising Mark's\nteacher\nand aide. Inclusion specialists Gail Mayfield and Jamie Ruppmann\nconsulted with the school during the fall, and Mark's teacher\nsought\nadvice from other experts whose names were provided to her by the\nschool or the Hartmanns. The teacher testified that she met\nconstantly\nwith Mark's aide, his speech therapist, the IEP team, and others to\nwork on Mark's program -- daily at the beginning of the year and at\nleast twice a week throughout.\nThe district court nonetheless found the county's efforts insuffi-\ncient. The court relied primarily on its conclusion that the\nLoudoun\neducators involved with Mark had inadequate training and experience\nto work with an autistic child.2 The court found the credentials of\ntwo\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 The court also concluded that Loudoun County's commitment to\nmainstreaming Mark lapsed at mid-year. Such a conclusion again does\nnot take proper account of the administrative record as required by\nRowley and Doyle. The hearing officer pointed out, for example,\nthat the\ncounty actually added services for Mark in the second half of the\nyear,\nwhen McCullough began providing special education instruction to\nMark. Moreover, the hearing officer noted that the IEP prepared by\n\fMark's team in March -- three months after the county allegedly\ngave\nup on mainstreaming him -- called for retaining him in the regular\nclass-\nroom.\n\n                                11\n\fgroups to be lacking. Neither the special education professionals\nnor\nthe regular education instructors were deemed properly qualified.\nThe\nconclusion that Mark had inadequately trained personnel developing\nand implementing his program, however, is irreconcilable with\neither\nthe law or the record.\n\nAs to special education personnel, the district court concedes that\nthe individuals working with Mark during the first half of the\nyear,\nMary Kearney and Jamie Ruppmann, were fully competent to assist\nhim. Kearney led Mark's IEP team, while Ruppmann provided con-\nsultation services. In addition to serving as the county Director\nof\nSpecial Education, Kearney had participated in the Virginia Systems\nChange Project, a two-year state program on mainstreaming which\ninvolved selected schools from across the state. Ruppmann is an\nexperienced, highly qualified consultant.\n\nDuring the second half of the year, Frank Johnson led the IEP\nteam, and Virginia McCullough provided Mark with special educa-\ntion services. The district court rejected their qualifications,\nasserting,\nfor example, that Johnson's credentials were clearly inadequate\nbecause they were inferior to those of Kearney and Ruppmann. How-\never, in addition to serving as the supervisor of Loudoun County's\nprogram for autistic children, Johnson had a special education\nmasters\ndegree, did graduate work with an autistic child, worked directly\nwith\napproximately ten autistic children as a teacher, and had attended\nspe-\ncial education courses and seminars relating to autism throughout\nhis\nprofessional career. Both McCullough`s early childhood degree pro-\ngram and her work in Loudoun County focused specifically on inte-\ngrating children with disabilities into the regular classroom.\n\nTo dismiss Johnson's and McCullough's qualifications is to adopt\nexactly the sort of potential-maximizing standard rejected by the\nSupreme Court in Rowley. We think the Court's admonition that the\nIDEA does not require \"the furnishing of every special service\nneces-\nsary to maximize each handicapped child's potential,\" Rowley, 458\nU.S. at 199, encompasses the notion that the IDEA likewise does not\nrequire special education service providers to have every\nconceivable\ncredential relevant to every child's disability. Not all school\nsystems\nwill have the resources to hire top-notch consultants, nor will\nevery\n\fschool have the good fortune to have personnel who were involved\n\n                               12\n\fin a major state program related to the needs of every disabled\nchild.\nWe note that in Virginia, there is no certification for autism.\nFurther-\nmore, at the time of the trial, Loudoun County had eleven autistic\nchildren in a total school population of approximately 20,000 stu-\ndents. In this light, Johnson's experience teaching ten autistic\nchildren\nwas substantial. Johnson and McCullough were clearly qualified to\nwork with Mark as special educators, even accepting the district\ncourt's assertion that Ruppmann and Kearney had better credentials.\n\nThe suggestion that the regular education instructors, Mark's\nteacher and aide, were not adequately qualified also does not\nsurvive\nclose scrutiny. Diane Johnson was an experienced professional prop-\nerly certified under state law, and Virginia law does not require\nteach-\ning assistants to be certified. Furthermore, Johnson and Leitner\nboth\nobtained special training to work with Mark. Both received\nin-service\ninstruction and attended an outside seminar on inclusion of\ndisabled\nchildren in the regular classroom. They also were trained in\nfacilitated\ncommunication, a special communication method used with Mark in\nIllinois.\n\nTo demand more than this from regular education personnel would\nessentially require them to become special education teachers\ntrained\nin the full panoply of disabilities that their students might have.\nVir-\nginia law does not require this, nor does the IDEA. First, such a\nrequirement would fall afoul of Rowley's admonition that the IDEA\ndoes not guarantee the ideal educational opportunity for every dis-\nabled child. Furthermore, when the IDEA was passed,\"Congress'\nintention was not that the Act displace the primacy of States in\nthe\nfield of education, but that States receive funds to assist them in\nextending their educational systems to the handicapped.\" Rowley,\n458\nU.S. at 208. The IDEA \"expressly incorporates State educational\nstan-\ndards.\" Schimmel v. Spillane, 819 F.2d 477, 484 (4th Cir. 1987). We\ncan think of few steps that would do more to usurp state\neducational\nstandards and policy than to have federal courts re-write state\nteach-\ning certification requirements in the guise of applying the IDEA.\n\nIn sum, we conclude that Loudoun County's efforts on behalf of\n\fMark were sufficient to satisfy the IDEA's mainstreaming directive.\n\n                                 13\n\fC.\n\nThe district court also gave little or no weight to the disruptive\neffects of Mark's behavior in the classroom, stating that \"[g]iven\nthe\nstrong presumption for inclusion under the IDEA, disruptive\nbehavior\nshould not be a significant factor in determining the appropriate\nedu-\ncational placement for a disabled child.\" This statement simply\nignores DeVries, where we specifically held that mainstreaming is\ninappropriate when \"the handicapped child is a disruptive force in\nthe\nnon-segregated setting.\" 882 F.2d at 879 (quoting Roncker v.\nWalter,\n700 F.2d 1058, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983)). In this case, disruptive\nbehavior\nwas clearly an issue. The hearing officer summarized:\n\n     [Mark's] misbehaviors include continual vocalization, espe-\n     cially whining, screeching and crying when unhappy or\n     frustrated, hitting, pinching, kicking, biting, sucking the\n     leg\n     of a chair, rolling on the floor, and removing his shoes and\n     clothing. Mark is a big strong child who cannot be easily\n     restrained when he engages in injurious behaviors such as\n     hitting, kicking, pinching and biting. His continual vocaliza-\n     tions are distracting and make it difficult for other children\n     to stay on task. When Jamie Ruppmann observed Mark in\n     his classroom, she observed two instances of significant dis-\n     ruption, in which he threw himself on the floor. She noted\n     that in each instance it took about five to eight minutes to\n     get Mark settled down. His loud screeching outbursts, which\n     occur daily, take the attention of the teacher and the aide to\n     redirect him; these outbursts also take the other children off\n     task and they then have to be redirected. Mark hits and\n     pinches others several times a day.\n\nWhile the hearing officer did not find Mark's disruptive behavior\nby\nitself to be dispositive, the attention she gave to Mark's conduct\nwas\nentirely appropriate, indeed required, under DeVries.\nD.\n\nThe district court also found that Leesburg would not have been an\nappropriate placement. This conclusion generally derived from the\nsame analysis that led to the court's determination that Mark\nshould\n\n                                14\n\fremain in the regular classroom. To the contrary, we hold that the\npro-\nposed Leesburg placement was carefully tailored to ensure that he\nwas mainstreamed \"to the maximum extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B). Leesburg was a regular elementary school. Responding\nto Mark's lack of academic progress in the regular classroom, the\nMay IEP would have placed Mark in the self-contained class for his\nacademic subjects, while including him with his non-disabled peers\nfor all other school activities such as art, music, and physical\neduca-\ntion. To promote the success of this partial mainstreaming, the\nhear-\ning officer required the school to have an aide or teacher\naccompany\nMark whenever he was in the regular classroom environment and to\nplace Mark with the same regular education class for all his non-\nacademic activities.\n\nIV.\n\nThis is not a case which either the local educational authorities\nor\nthe reviewing administrative officers took lightly. We have\nsketched\nin great detail the efforts that Loudoun County made to provide\nMark\nHartmann with a suitable education. Furthermore, the administrative\nreview process could not have been more thorough. The hearing offi-\ncer heard testimony from eighteen witnesses over a two month period\nand made detailed factual findings regarding all aspects of Mark's\neducational   experience.    The   officer's   analysis   carefully\nincorporated\nthose findings and specifically addressed the evidence the\nHartmanns\npresented in support of their position. The district court,\nhowever, set\nall this extensive effort and review at nought. The court failed to\nmen-\ntion, let alone discuss, critical administrative findings\ninconsistent\nwith its conclusions. While making much of the credentials and\ncredi-\nbility of witnesses endorsing full inclusion, the court gave little\nor no\nattention to the testimony of Loudoun professionals. In some\ninstances the court, without listening to local educators,\ndiscounted\ntheir views despite the fact that the hearing officer had found\nthem\ncredible. One Loudoun official was dismissed outright as \"a philo-\nsophical opponent of inclusion\" for daring to state that he saw no\nevi-\ndence that Mark had progressed in the regular classroom.\n\fThe IDEA encourages mainstreaming, but only to the extent that\nit does not prevent a child from receiving educational benefit. The\nevidence in this case demonstrates that Mark Hartmann was not mak-\n\n                                 15\n\fing academic progress in a regular education classroom despite the\nprovision of adequate supplementary aids and services. Loudoun\nCounty properly proposed to place Mark in a partially mainstreamed\nprogram which would have addressed the academic deficiencies of\nhis full inclusion program while permitting him to interact with\nnon-\nhandicapped students to the greatest extent possible. This\nprofessional\njudgment by local educators was deserving of respect. The approval\nof this educational approach by the local and state administrative\noffi-\ncers likewise deserved a deference from the district court which it\nfailed to receive. In rejecting reasonable pedagogical choices and\ndis-\nregarding well-supported administrative findings, the district\ncourt\nassumed an educational mantle which the IDEA did not confer.\nAccordingly, the judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded\nwith directions to dismiss it.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n                                16\n\f",

The Hartmanns alleged that the Board had\nfailed to ensure that Mark was educated with non-handicapped chil-\ndren \"to the maximum extent appropriate\" as required by the IDEA's\nmainstreaming provision, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(5)(B). The district court\nagreed, rejecting the findings of both the local hearing officer\nand the\nstate review officer. The Board appeals, contending that the\ncourt's\ndecision is contrary to the law and the evidence in the record. We\nagree. As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the IDEA does not\ngrant federal courts a license to substitute their own notions of\nsound\neducational policy for those of local school authorities, or to\ndisregard\nthe findings developed in state administrative proceedings. Upon\n\n                                 3\n\fcareful review of the record, however, we are forced to conclude\nthat\nthis is precisely what has occurred in this case. Accordingly, we\nreverse and remand with directions to dismiss.\n\nI.\n\nMark Hartmann is an eleven-year-old autistic child. Autism is a\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by significant deficiencies in\ncommunication skills, social interaction, and motor control. Mark\nis\nunable to speak and suffers severe problems with fine motor coordi-\nnation. Mark's writing ability is extremely limited; he does not\nwrite\nby hand and can consistently type only a few words such as \"is\" and\n\"at\" by himself on a keyboard device known as a Canon communica-\ntor. The parties agree that Mark's greatest need is to develop\ncommu-\nnication skills.\n\nMark spent his pre-school years in various programs for disabled\nchildren. In kindergarten, he spent half his time in a\nself-contained\nprogram for autistic children and half in a regular education\nclass-\nroom at Butterfield Elementary in Lombard, Illinois. Upon entering\nfirst grade, Mark received speech and occupational therapy one-on-\none, but was otherwise included in the regular classroom at Butter-\nfield full-time with an aide to assist him.\n\nAfter Mark's first-grade year, the Hartmanns moved to Loudoun\nCounty, Virginia, where they enrolled Mark at Ashburn Elementary\nfor the 1993-1994 school year. Based on Mark's individualized edu-\ncation program (IEP) from Illinois, the school placed Mark in a\nregu-\nlar education classroom. To facilitate Mark's inclusion, Loudoun\nofficials carefully selected his teacher, hired a full-time aide to\nassist\nhim, and put him in a smaller class with more independent children.\nMark's teacher, Diane Johnson, read extensively about autism, and\nboth Johnson and Mark's aide, Suz Leitner, received training in\nfacili-\ntated communication, a special communication technique used with\nautistic children. Mark received five hours per week of speech and\nlanguage therapy with a qualified specialist, Carolyn Clement.\nHalf-\nway through the year, Virginia McCullough, a special education\nteacher, was assigned to provide Mark with three hours of\ninstruction\na week and to advise Mark's teacher and aide.\n\n                                 4\n\fMary Kearney, the Loudoun County Director of Special Education,\npersonally worked with Mark's IEP team, which consisted of John-\nson, Leitner, Clement, and Laurie McDonald, the principal of Ash-\nburn. Kearney provided in-service training for the Ashburn staff on\nautism and inclusion of disabled children in the regular classroom.\nJohnson, Leitner, Clement, and McDonald also attended a seminar on\ninclusion held by the Virginia Council for Administrators of\nSpecial\nEducation. Mark's IEP team also received assistance from educa-\ntional consultants Jamie Ruppmann and Gail Mayfield, and Johnson\nconferred with additional specialists whose names were provided to\nher by the Hartmanns and the school. Mark's curriculum was continu-\nally modified to ensure that it was properly adapted to his needs\nand\nabilities.\n\nFrank Johnson, supervisor of the county's program for autistic\nchil-\ndren, formally joined the IEP team in January, but provided\nassistance\nthroughout the year in managing Mark's behavior. Mark engaged in\ndaily episodes of loud screeching and other disruptive conduct such\nas hitting, pinching, kicking, biting, and removing his clothing.\nThese\noutbursts not only required Diane Johnson and Leitner to calm Mark\nand redirect him, but also consumed the additional time necessary\nto\nget the rest of the children back on task after the distraction.\n\nDespite these efforts, by the end of the year Mark's IEP team con-\ncluded that he was making no academic progress in the regular\nclass-\nroom. In Mark's May 1994 IEP, the team therefore proposed to place\nMark in a class specifically structured for autistic children at\nLees-\nburg Elementary. Leesburg is a regular elementary school which\nhouses the autism class in order to facilitate interaction between\nthe\nautistic children and students who are not handicapped. The\nLeesburg\nclass would have included five autistic students working with a\nspe-\ncial education teacher and at least one full-time aide. Under the\nMay\nIEP, Mark would have received only academic instruction and speech\nin the self-contained classroom, while joining a regular class for\nart,\nmusic, physical education, library, and recess. The Leesburg\nprogram\nalso would have permitted Mark to increase the portion of his\ninstruc-\ntion received in a regular education setting as he demonstrated an\nimproved ability to handle it.\n\fThe Hartmanns refused to approve the IEP, claiming that it failed\nto comply with the mainstreaming provision of the IDEA, which\n\n                               5\n\fstates that \"to the maximum extent appropriate,\" disabled children\nshould be educated with children who are not handicapped. 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B). The county initiated due process proceedings, see 20\nU.S.C. ยง 1415(b), and on December 14, 1994, the local hearing offi-\ncer upheld the May 1994 IEP. She found that Mark's behavior was\ndisruptive and that despite the \"enthusiastic\" efforts of the\ncounty, he\nhad obtained no academic benefit from the regular education class-\nroom. On May 3, 1995, the state review officer affirmed the\ndecision,\nadopting both the hearing officer's findings and her legal\nanalysis.\nThe Hartmanns then challenged the hearing officer's decision in\nfed-\neral court.\nWhile the administrative process continued, Mark entered third\ngrade in the regular education classroom at Ashburn. In December of\nthat year, the Hartmanns withdrew Mark from Ashburn. Mark and his\nmother moved to Montgomery County, Virginia, to permit the Hart-\nmanns to enroll Mark in public school there. Mark was placed in the\nregular third-grade classroom for the remainder of that year as\nwell\nas the next.1\n\nThe district court reversed the hearing officer's decision. The\ncourt\nrejected the administrative findings and concluded that Mark could\nreceive significant educational benefit in a regular classroom and\nthat\n\"the Board simply did not take enough appropriate steps to try to\ninclude Mark in a regular class.\" The court made little of the\ntesti-\nmony of Mark's Loudoun County instructors, and instead relied heav-\nily on its reading of Mark's experience in Illinois and Montgomery\nCounty. While the hearing officer had addressed Mark's conduct in\ndetail, the court stated that \"[g]iven the strong presumption for\ninclu-\nsion under the IDEA, disruptive behavior should not be a\nsignificant\nfactor in determining the appropriate educational placement for a\ndis-\nabled child.\" Loudoun County now appeals.\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Loudoun County contends that the Hartmanns do not present a valid\ncase or controversy because Mark is currently in an educational\nplace-\nment which the Hartmanns find appropriate. Under the unusual\ncircum-\nstances of this case, this conclusion is not correct. There is no\nquestion\nthat the Hartmanns would re-enroll Mark in Loudoun County if their\nsuit\n\fis successful. Specifically, the Hartmanns' expressed intent to\nreturn\nMark to school there is corroborated by the fact that Mark's father\nand\nsister continue to occupy the family's home in Loudoun County.\n\n                                 6\n\fII.\n\nThe IDEA embodies important principles governing the relation-\nship between local school authorities and a reviewing district\ncourt.\nAlthough section 1415(e)(2) provides district courts with authority\nto\ngrant \"appropriate\" relief based on a preponderance of the\nevidence,\n20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(e)(2), that section \"is by no means an invitation\nto\nthe courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational\npolicy\nfor those of the school authorities which they review.\" Board of\nEdu-\ncation of Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v. Rowley , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (1982). Absent some statutory infraction, the task of\neduca-\ntion belongs to the educators who have been charged by society with\nthat critical task. Likewise, federal courts must accord \"due\nweight\"\nto state administrative proceedings. Id. Administrative findings in\nan\nIDEA case \"are entitled to be considered prima facie correct,\" and\n\"the district court, if it is not going to follow them, is required\nto\nexplain why it does not.\" Doyle v. Arlington County Sch. Bd. , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (4th Cir. 1991).\n\nThese principles reflect the IDEA's recognition that federal courts\ncannot run local schools. Local educators deserve latitude in\ndeter-\nmining the individualized education program most appropriate for a\ndisabled child. The IDEA does not deprive these educators of the\nright to apply their professional judgment. Rather it establishes\na\n\"basic floor of opportunity\" for every handicapped child. Rowley,\n458\nU.S. at 201. States must provide specialized instruction and\nrelated\nservices \"sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the\nhand-\nicapped child,\" id. at 200, but the Act does not require \"the\nfurnishing\nof every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped\nchild's potential,\" id. at 199.\nIn this same vein, the IDEA's mainstreaming provision establishes\na presumption, not an inflexible federal mandate. Under its terms,\ndis-\nabled children are to be educated with children who are not handi-\ncapped only \"to the maximum extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B). Section 1412(5)(B) explicitly          states that\n\fmainstreaming\nis not appropriate \"when the nature or severity of the disability\nis such\nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplementary\naids\nand services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B); see also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181 n.4.\n                                7\n\fIII.\n\nThe district court's ruling strayed generally from the aforemen-\ntioned principles. It diverged in particular from our decision in\nDeVries v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527818\"><a href=\"/opinion/527818/michael-devries-by-his-parent-and-next-friend-marjorie-ann-deblaay/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1989).\nIn\nDeVries, we held that mainstreaming is not required where (1) the\ndisabled child would not receive an educational benefit from main-\nstreaming into a regular class; (2) any marginal benefit from main-\nstreaming would be significantly outweighed by benefits which could\nfeasibly be obtained only in a separate instructional setting; or,\n(3) the\ndisabled child is a disruptive force in a regular classroom\nsetting. Id.\nat 879. Although the district court failed to mention DeVries, its\nopin-\nion suggests that none of these three categories describes Mark's\nsitu-\nation. The district court found that Mark could receive substantial\neducational benefit in a regular classroom, that his disruptive\nbehavior\nwas not sufficient to justify a more segregated instructional\nsetting,\nand that the Leesburg program would not have been an appropriate\nplacement. After careful examination of the record, however, we are\nforced to conclude that the district court's decision fails to\naccount for\nthe administrative findings and is not supported by the evidence\nbased\non a correct application of the law. In effect, the court simply\nsubsti-\ntuted its own judgment regarding Mark's proper educational program\nfor that of local school officials.\n\nA.\n\nIn finding that Mark could receive an educational benefit in a\nregu-\nlar classroom, the district court disregarded both the hearing\nofficer's\nfinding and the overwhelming evidence that Mark made no academic\nprogress in the regular second grade classroom at Ashburn. Mark's\nteacher testified, for example, that he was unable to retain\nskills:\n\"once we thought he mastered [a math skill] and we left it alone\nand\nwent onto another concept, if we went back to review, it seemed\nthat\nhe had forgotten.\" She confessed, \"I felt like he lost a year in my\nclassroom.\" Other Loudoun County personnel testified to the same\neffect. His speech therapist, for instance, stated that \"[t]he only\ngain\nthat I saw him make was in the one to one setting.\" The supervisor\n\ffor the county's program for autistic students likewise concluded,\n\"I\nthink there has been no progress academically in the inclusive set-\ntings;\" \"I think we're wasting his time.\" The hearing officer\naccord-\n\n                                 8\n\fingly found that \"Mark made no measurable academic progress\nattributable to his placement in the regular classroom.\"\n\nMark's situation is similar to the one we faced in DeVries, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527818\"><a href=\"/opinion/527818/michael-devries-by-his-parent-and-next-friend-marjorie-ann-deblaay/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In upholding Fairfax County's decision not to place\nMichael DeVries in Annandale High School, the court observed not\nonly that Michael would derive virtually no academic benefit from\nthe\nregular classroom, but also that his work would be at a much lower\nlevel than his classmates and that he would in effect \"simply be\nmoni-\ntoring classes.\" Id. at 879. Here the hearing officer made an\nidentical\nfinding, concluding that Mark \"did not participate in the regular\ncur-\nriculum, but was provided his own curriculum.\" Mark's special edu-\ncation teacher in Loudoun County explained, \"Mark needs a\ncompletely different program . . . . His skills have to be taught\nin a\ndifferent way, in a different sequence, and even a different group\nof\nskills . . . from what his typical functioning peers are learning.\"\n\nThe district court acknowledged the testimony of Mark's second\ngrade teacher regarding his lack of progress, but asserted that the\nhearing officer's conclusions were erroneous because the officer\nfailed to give due weight to the testimony of Cathy Thornton,\nMark's\nprivate tutor during second grade, and to Mark's first grade\nexperi-\nence in Illinois. To the contrary, the administrative decisions\ntook\ncareful note of both. The hearing officer fully credited Thornton's\ntes-\ntimony, finding that Mark made progress with both her and his\nspeech\ntherapist. The officer went further, however, and observed that\nboth\nthe tutoring and speech instruction occurred in a one-to-one\nsetting\noutside of the regular class. In light of Mark's failure to\nprogress in\nthe regular classroom, the officer drew the only reasonable\ninference\nfrom this evidence, namely that separate instruction was precisely\nwhat Mark needed to make educational progress. As to Mark's expe-\nrience in Illinois, the state review officer explained that the\nIllinois\nassessment of Mark's capabilities was flawed:\n\n     [I]t became clear during the course of the second grade that\n     Mark's academic skills were not as advanced as the Illinois\n     school system thought. Mark cannot read and cannot add,\n\fyet the Illinois teachers thought he was reading at first\ngrade\nlevel and progressing in the first grade math workbook. . . .\nMark apparently did not make the academic progress in first\n\n                           9\n\f     grade the records forwarded to Loudoun County from Illi-\n     nois indicated . . . .\n\nWhile the district court opinion references the hearing officer's\ndeci-\nsion, its failure to address the administrative findings noted\nabove\nsimply does not reflect the teachings of Rowley and Doyle that\nstate\nproceedings must command considerable deference in federal courts.\n\nThe district court also relied heavily on Mark's subsequent perfor-\nmance in the Montgomery County schools during fourth grade. While\nMontgomery County personnel did make some conclusory statements\nasserting that Mark made progress, the evidence is inconclusive at\nbest. The district court pointed to math skills Mark demonstrated\nat\nthe end of fourth grade, for example, but Mark was pulled out of\nthe\nregular class for math instruction, just as Loudoun County had\nrecom-\nmended. Any progress he made in math therefore simply supports the\nconclusion that separate, one-on-one instruction is appropriate for\nMark. Mark also continued to receive speech therapy one-on-one, and\nhis special education teacher in Montgomery County admitted that\nthe\ncounty had no reliable method for assessing Mark's reading ability.\n\nFinally, the district court pointed to perceived improvement in\nMark's social skills due to interaction with his non-disabled\npeers.\nAny such benefits, however, cannot outweigh his failure to progress\nacademically in the regular classroom. The mainstreaming provision\nrepresents recognition of the value of having disabled children\ninter-\nact with non-handicapped students. The fact that the provision only\ncreates a presumption, however, reflects a congressional judgment\nthat receipt of such social benefits is ultimately a goal\nsubordinate to\nthe requirement that disabled children receive educational benefit.\nHere the evidence clearly supports the judgment of the local educa-\ntion officials and the administrative hearing officers that Mark's\nedu-\ncational progress required significant instruction outside of the\nregular\nclassroom setting.\n\nB.\n\nThe district court attributed Mark's lack of progress in Loudoun\nCounty to the county's alleged failure to make reasonable efforts\nto\naccommodate him in the regular classroom. We interpret this as a\n\frul-\n\n       10\n\fing that the county failed to provide the supplementary aids and\nser-\nvices contemplated by the IDEA's mainstreaming provision. 20\nU.S.C. ยง 1412(5)(B).\n\nThe district court's conclusion is remarkable in light of the\nexten-\nsive measures taken on Mark's behalf. The hearing officer found\nthat\nLoudoun personnel were \"enthusiastic\" about including Mark at Ash-\nburn, a description fully supported by the record. The Ashburn\nprinci-\npal deliberately reduced the size of Mark's class and ensured that\nit\nwas composed of students who were more independent and had\nhigher level skills. Mark's teacher was selected because of her\nexcel-\nlent teaching abilities, and the county hired a full-time,\none-on-one\naide for Mark. Mark received a full hour of speech and language\ninstruction daily. Frank Johnson, the supervisor of the county's\npro-\ngram for autistic children, provided assistance in behavior manage-\nment throughout the year. Halfway through the year, the school's\nefforts increased when Virginia McCullough began providing special\neducation services directly to Mark as well as advising Mark's\nteacher\nand aide. Inclusion specialists Gail Mayfield and Jamie Ruppmann\nconsulted with the school during the fall, and Mark's teacher\nsought\nadvice from other experts whose names were provided to her by the\nschool or the Hartmanns. The teacher testified that she met\nconstantly\nwith Mark's aide, his speech therapist, the IEP team, and others to\nwork on Mark's program -- daily at the beginning of the year and at\nleast twice a week throughout.\nThe district court nonetheless found the county's efforts insuffi-\ncient. The court relied primarily on its conclusion that the\nLoudoun\neducators involved with Mark had inadequate training and experience\nto work with an autistic child.2 The court found the credentials of\ntwo\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 The court also concluded that Loudoun County's commitment to\nmainstreaming Mark lapsed at mid-year. Such a conclusion again does\nnot take proper account of the administrative record as required by\nRowley and Doyle. The hearing officer pointed out, for example,\nthat the\ncounty actually added services for Mark in the second half of the\nyear,\nwhen McCullough began providing special education instruction to\nMark. Moreover, the hearing officer noted that the IEP prepared by\n\fMark's team in March -- three months after the county allegedly\ngave\nup on mainstreaming him -- called for retaining him in the regular\nclass-\nroom.\n\n                                11\n\fgroups to be lacking. Neither the special education professionals\nnor\nthe regular education instructors were deemed properly qualified.\nThe\nconclusion that Mark had inadequately trained personnel developing\nand implementing his program, however, is irreconcilable with\neither\nthe law or the record.\n\nAs to special education personnel, the district court concedes that\nthe individuals working with Mark during the first half of the\nyear,\nMary Kearney and Jamie Ruppmann, were fully competent to assist\nhim. Kearney led Mark's IEP team, while Ruppmann provided con-\nsultation services. In addition to serving as the county Director\nof\nSpecial Education, Kearney had participated in the Virginia Systems\nChange Project, a two-year state program on mainstreaming which\ninvolved selected schools from across the state. Ruppmann is an\nexperienced, highly qualified consultant.\n\nDuring the second half of the year, Frank Johnson led the IEP\nteam, and Virginia McCullough provided Mark with special educa-\ntion services. The district court rejected their qualifications,\nasserting,\nfor example, that Johnson's credentials were clearly inadequate\nbecause they were inferior to those of Kearney and Ruppmann. How-\never, in addition to serving as the supervisor of Loudoun County's\nprogram for autistic children, Johnson had a special education\nmasters\ndegree, did graduate work with an autistic child, worked directly\nwith\napproximately ten autistic children as a teacher, and had attended\nspe-\ncial education courses and seminars relating to autism throughout\nhis\nprofessional career. Both McCullough`s early childhood degree pro-\ngram and her work in Loudoun County focused specifically on inte-\ngrating children with disabilities into the regular classroom.\n\nTo dismiss Johnson's and McCullough's qualifications is to adopt\nexactly the sort of potential-maximizing standard rejected by the\nSupreme Court in Rowley. We think the Court's admonition that the\nIDEA does not require \"the furnishing of every special service\nneces-\nsary to maximize each handicapped child's potential,\" Rowley, 458\nU.S. at 199, encompasses the notion that the IDEA likewise does not\nrequire special education service providers to have every\nconceivable\ncredential relevant to every child's disability. Not all school\nsystems\nwill have the resources to hire top-notch consultants, nor will\nevery\n\fschool have the good fortune to have personnel who were involved\n\n                               12\n\fin a major state program related to the needs of every disabled\nchild.\nWe note that in Virginia, there is no certification for autism.\nFurther-\nmore, at the time of the trial, Loudoun County had eleven autistic\nchildren in a total school population of approximately 20,000 stu-\ndents. In this light, Johnson's experience teaching ten autistic\nchildren\nwas substantial. Johnson and McCullough were clearly qualified to\nwork with Mark as special educators, even accepting the district\ncourt's assertion that Ruppmann and Kearney had better credentials.\n\nThe suggestion that the regular education instructors, Mark's\nteacher and aide, were not adequately qualified also does not\nsurvive\nclose scrutiny. Diane Johnson was an experienced professional prop-\nerly certified under state law, and Virginia law does not require\nteach-\ning assistants to be certified. Furthermore, Johnson and Leitner\nboth\nobtained special training to work with Mark. Both received\nin-service\ninstruction and attended an outside seminar on inclusion of\ndisabled\nchildren in the regular classroom. They also were trained in\nfacilitated\ncommunication, a special communication method used with Mark in\nIllinois.\n\nTo demand more than this from regular education personnel would\nessentially require them to become special education teachers\ntrained\nin the full panoply of disabilities that their students might have.\nVir-\nginia law does not require this, nor does the IDEA. First, such a\nrequirement would fall afoul of Rowley's admonition that the IDEA\ndoes not guarantee the ideal educational opportunity for every dis-\nabled child. Furthermore, when the IDEA was passed,\"Congress'\nintention was not that the Act displace the primacy of States in\nthe\nfield of education, but that States receive funds to assist them in\nextending their educational systems to the handicapped.\" Rowley,\n458\nU.S. at 208. The IDEA \"expressly incorporates State educational\nstan-\ndards.\" Schimmel v. Spillane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488749\"><a href=\"/opinion/488749/john-schimmel-a-minor-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-john-betty/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (4th Cir. 1987). We\ncan think of few steps that would do more to usurp state\neducational\nstandards and policy than to have federal courts re-write state\nteach-\ning certification requirements in the guise of applying the IDEA.\n\nIn sum, we conclude that Loudoun County's efforts on behalf of\n\fMark were sufficient to satisfy the IDEA's mainstreaming directive.\n\n                                 13\n\fC.\n\nThe district court also gave little or no weight to the disruptive\neffects of Mark's behavior in the classroom, stating that \"[g]iven\nthe\nstrong presumption for inclusion under the IDEA, disruptive\nbehavior\nshould not be a significant factor in determining the appropriate\nedu-\ncational placement for a disabled child.\" This statement simply\nignores DeVries, where we specifically held that mainstreaming is\ninappropriate when \"the handicapped child is a disruptive force in\nthe\nnon-segregated setting.\" 882 F.2d at 879 (quoting Roncker v.\nWalter,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414480\"><a href=\"/opinion/414480/mary-ann-roncker-on-behalf-of-neill-roncker-individually-and-on-behalf-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983)). In this case, disruptive\nbehavior\nwas clearly an issue. The hearing officer summarized:\n\n     [Mark's] misbehaviors include continual vocalization, espe-\n     cially whining, screeching and crying when unhappy or\n     frustrated, hitting, pinching, kicking, biting, sucking the\n     leg\n     of a chair, rolling on the floor, and removing his shoes and\n     clothing. Mark is a big strong child who cannot be easily\n     restrained when he engages in injurious behaviors such as\n     hitting, kicking, pinching and biting. His continual vocaliza-\n     tions are distracting and make it difficult for other children\n     to stay on task. When Jamie Ruppmann observed Mark in\n     his classroom, she observed two instances of significant dis-\n     ruption, in which he threw himself on the floor. She noted\n     that in each instance it took about five to eight minutes to\n     get Mark settled down. His loud screeching outbursts, which\n     occur daily, take the attention of the teacher and the aide to\n     redirect him; these outbursts also take the other children off\n     task and they then have to be redirected. Mark hits and\n     pinches others several times a day.\n\nWhile the hearing officer did not find Mark's disruptive behavior\nby\nitself to be dispositive, the attention she gave to Mark's conduct\nwas\nentirely appropriate, indeed required, under DeVries.\nD.\n\nThe district court also found that Leesburg would not have been an\nappropriate placement. This conclusion generally derived from the\nsame analysis that led to the court's determination that Mark\nshould\n\n                                14\n\fremain in the regular classroom. To the contrary, we hold that the\npro-\nposed Leesburg placement was carefully tailored to ensure that he\nwas mainstreamed \"to the maximum extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C.\nยง 1412(5)(B). Leesburg was a regular elementary school. Responding\nto Mark's lack of academic progress in the regular classroom, the\nMay IEP would have placed Mark in the self-contained class for his\nacademic subjects, while including him with his non-disabled peers\nfor all other school activities such as art, music, and physical\neduca-\ntion. To promote the success of this partial mainstreaming, the\nhear-\ning officer required the school to have an aide or teacher\naccompany\nMark whenever he was in the regular classroom environment and to\nplace Mark with the same regular education class for all his non-\nacademic activities.\n\nIV.\n\nThis is not a case which either the local educational authorities\nor\nthe reviewing administrative officers took lightly. We have\nsketched\nin great detail the efforts that Loudoun County made to provide\nMark\nHartmann with a suitable education. Furthermore, the administrative\nreview process could not have been more thorough. The hearing offi-\ncer heard testimony from eighteen witnesses over a two month period\nand made detailed factual findings regarding all aspects of Mark's\neducational   experience.    The   officer's   analysis   carefully\nincorporated\nthose findings and specifically addressed the evidence the\nHartmanns\npresented in support of their position. The district court,\nhowever, set\nall this extensive effort and review at nought. The court failed to\nmen-\ntion, let alone discuss, critical administrative findings\ninconsistent\nwith its conclusions. While making much of the credentials and\ncredi-\nbility of witnesses endorsing full inclusion, the court gave little\nor no\nattention to the testimony of Loudoun professionals. In some\ninstances the court, without listening to local educators,\ndiscounted\ntheir views despite the fact that the hearing officer had found\nthem\ncredible. One Loudoun official was dismissed outright as \"a philo-\nsophical opponent of inclusion\" for daring to state that he saw no\nevi-\ndence that Mark had progressed in the regular classroom.\n\fThe IDEA encourages mainstreaming, but only to the extent that\nit does not prevent a child from receiving educational benefit. The\nevidence in this case demonstrates that Mark Hartmann was not mak-\n\n                                 15\n\fing academic progress in a regular education classroom despite the\nprovision of adequate supplementary aids and services. Loudoun\nCounty properly proposed to place Mark in a partially mainstreamed\nprogram which would have addressed the academic deficiencies of\nhis full inclusion program while permitting him to interact with\nnon-\nhandicapped students to the greatest extent possible. This\nprofessional\njudgment by local educators was deserving of respect. The approval\nof this educational approach by the local and state administrative\noffi-\ncers likewise deserved a deference from the district court which it\nfailed to receive. In rejecting reasonable pedagogical choices and\ndis-\nregarding well-supported administrative findings, the district\ncourt\nassumed an educational mantle which the IDEA did not confer.\nAccordingly, the judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded\nwith directions to dismiss it.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n                                16\n\f</pre>",
