Juan and Ynez Salinas conveyed 17/32 of their mineral interest\n                  to third parties and 150 acres to their son Octavio before\n                  conveying undivided interests in the remaining property to their\n                  12 children—the Salinas Siblings. ....................................................... 2\n          B.      In October 1968, Leoncio deeded his interests in the Subject\n                  Property to Horacio and, in doing so, referenced the partition of\n                  the Subject Property.............................................................................. 3\n\n          C.      In December 1968, the nine Salinas Siblings who owned\n                  surface interests in the Subject Property entered a Partition\n                  Agreement to divide the surface into nine Parcels and divided\n                  their mineral interests along the same lines.......................................... 4\n\n          D.      For 36 years, nobody questioned the validity of the Partition\n                  Agreement and everybody acted consistently with the Partition\n                  Agreement’s validity. ........................................................................... 7\n\n          E.      In 2001, Thorp drilled productive wells on Parcels 5 and 8 and\n                  paid royalties on production in accordance with the Partition\n                  Agreement that had been in place since 1968. ..................................... 9\n\n          F.      In 2004, the plaintiffs filed suit to try to undo the deal their\n                  parents struck. ..................................................................................... 10\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT .............................................................................. 10\n\nARGUMENT .......................................................................................................... 13\n\n1176340\n\f          A.   The trial court properly granted Appellees’ motions for\n               summary judgment on at least four grounds, any one of which\n               will suffice to affirm the trial court’s judgment and render\n               judgment for Appellees in this matter. ............................................... 13\n\n               1.      The trial court properly granted summary judgment that\n                       the Partition Agreement is valid and enforceable because\n                       the Partition Agreement was signed by all parties whose\n                       interests were affected by it...................................................... 13\n\n                       a.      Texas law does not require all parties with a\n                               mineral interest in property to join in a partition\n                               agreement regarding that property. ................................ 14\n\n                       b.      Juana did not need to sign the Partition Agreement\n                               because it does not affect her mineral interest in\n                               the Subject Property. Indeed, she and her heirs\n                               and assigns have always been treated as undivided\n                               mineral-interest holders and, for that reason, have\n                               no standing to attack the Partition Agreement’s\n                               validity here.................................................................... 16\n\n                       c.      Like Juana, Leoncio did not need to sign the\n                               Partition Agreement because he had already\n                               conveyed all of his interest in the Subject Property\n                               to his brother Horacio. ................................................... 19\n\n                       d.      Appellants cite no authority that actually supports\n                               their claim that the Partition Agreement is invalid\n                               without Juana’s and Leoncio’s signatures. .................... 23\n\n               2.      Even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective due to\n                       the lack of Juana’s and Leoncio’s signatures, summary\n                       judgment is proper because Appellants accepted benefits\n                       of the Partition Agreement, ratified it, acquiesced in it,\n                       and are estopped to deny its validity now. ............................... 26\n\n               3.      Summary judgment is also proper because Appellants’\n                       claims are barred by adverse possession. ................................. 32\n\n\n\n                                                     ii\n1176340\n\f                        a.       The portion of the minerals that remain unsevered\n                                 from the surface were adversely possessed along\n                                 with the surface. ............................................................. 32\n\n                        b.       The summary judgment evidence established all of\n                                 the elements of adverse possession, and Appellants\n                                 presented no evidence to the contrary............................ 34\n\n                        c.       Even if Ana Saenz “consented” to the use of the\n                                 surface by the siblings and their successors, her\n                                 consent could not have been granted until after the\n                                 10-year statute of limitations had expired...................... 38\n\n                4.      At a minimum, summary judgment is proper as against\n                        the parties who joined in the Partition Agreement, as well\n                        as their successors. ................................................................... 40\n\n          B.    Even if there were a fact question relating to the Partition\n                Agreement, Appellants’ claim for damages in their trespass-to-\n                try title action should be treated as final because Appellants\n                have not challenged or briefed the summary judgment ground\n                that they have no evidence of such damages. ..................................... 41\nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER............................................................................. 43\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE................................................................................ 45\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE ...................................................................... 47\n\n\n\n\n                                                      iii\n1176340\n\f                                     INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\nCASES\n\nAmerico Life, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs/Appellants seek to invalidate\n                       a 1968 partition agreement, claiming it is invalid because\n                       it was not signed by all tenants who owned a mineral\n                       interest in the land at issue.\n\nTrial Court:                   229th District Court of Starr County, Texas; Honorable\n                               Ana Lisa Garza Presiding.1\n\nCourse of Proceedings: Plaintiffs brought a trespass-to-try-title action regarding\n                       mineral interests in land that was partitioned in 1968 by\n                       an agreement signed by all parties claiming an interest in\n                       the surface.2 The agreement divided the surface into nine\n                       parcels and split the parties’ mineral interests along those\n                       lines.3 It went unchallenged for 36 years. Plaintiffs then\n                       sued the current mineral-interest owners and the mineral\n                       lessees who paid royalties based on the agreement.4\n                       Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the agreement was\n                       void and that they continued to own undivided mineral\n                       interests in parcels which the partition did not allot to\n                       their predecessors.5 They also sought damages.6 The\n                       owners and the lessees, Thorp et al. and Smith\n                       Production, moved for summary judgment on several\n                       grounds, including that the partition agreement was valid,\n                       Plaintiffs’ claims were barred, and Plaintiffs were not\n                       entitled to damages.7 The trial court granted the motions\n                       without specifying grounds.8 This appeal followed.9\n1\n Judge Garza signed the final judgment in this case.

Did the trial court properly grant Appellees’ summary judgment motions and\n\n          declare the partition agreement valid and enforceable on the ground that the\n\n          agreement is signed by all parties whose property interests it affected?\n\n\n\n2.        Even if the partition agreement were lacking one or more necessary\n\n          signatures, is summary judgment proper on the ground that the agreement is\n\n          nonetheless binding on Appellants because (a) they cannot accept the\n\n          benefits of the partition agreement—a divided surface estate—while\n\n          rejecting its burdens—a divided mineral estate; (b) they ratified and\n\n          acquiesced in the divisions within the partition agreement and are estopped\n\n          to deny the agreement’s binding effect now; (c) adverse possession bars their\n\n          ability to challenge the agreement; and/or (d) Appellants whose predecessors\n\n          signed the agreement are bound by their predecessors’ signatures thereto?\n\n\n\n\n9\n    14 CR 5307-09.\n                                               ix\n1176340\n\f                              RECORD AND APPENDIX\n       The record on appeal includes a 14-volume Clerk’s Record and a one-\nvolume Supplemental Clerk’s Record.

(“Smith Production”) and\n\nThorp Petroleum Corporation; El Paso Production Company; El Paso E&P\n\nCompany, LP; El Paso Exploration & Production Management, Inc.; Stanco Land\n\nManagement, LLC; and Meredith Land & Minerals Company (together “Thorp et\n\nal.” and collectively with Smith Production, “Appellees”).\n\n                               OVERVIEW OF THIS APPEAL\n\n          In this appeal, the Court needs to resolve only one substantive issue: is the\n\n1968 partition agreement valid and enforceable? That issue should be resolved\n\naffirmatively because all parties affected by the partition agreement joined in the\n\npartition agreement. Moreover, any claim that the partition agreement is invalid is\n\nbarred by Appellants’ acceptance of benefits under, ratification of, and\n\nacquiescence in the partition agreement, as well as adverse possession. At a\n\nminimum, the partition agreement binds those who signed it and their successors.\n\n          The trial court granted Appellees’ summary judgment motions and entered a\n\nfinal judgment declaring the partition agreement to be “valid and enforceable for\n\nall purposes as to all parties to this suit” and ordering that the underlying\n\n“Plaintiffs take nothing by their suit against all Defendants.”10 The trial court’s\n\njudgment was correct and should be affirmed by this Court.\n\n\n10\n     Pl.

The following statement of facts is intended to give the Court all of\n\nthe facts the Court needs in order to resolve the legal issues properly on appeal.\n\nA.        Juan and Ynez Salinas conveyed 17/32 of their mineral interest to third\n          parties and 150 acres to their son Octavio before conveying undivided\n          interests in the remaining property to their 12 children—the Salinas Siblings.\n\n          The property at issue was originally part of an estate consisting of 1,284\n\nacres in Starr County, Texas, that was owned by spouses Juan and Ynez Salinas.11\n\nThey conveyed 17/32 of their mineral interest to third parties between 1932 and\n\n1940,12 and they conveyed 150 acres to their son Octavio Salinas in 1963.13 The\n\nproperty remaining after the conveyances—the entire surface of 1,134 acres and\n\nthe 15/32 mineral interest—is the subject of this appeal (the “Subject Property”).\n\n          In 1964, Mr. and Mrs. Salinas conveyed to each of their 12 children (the\n\n“Salinas Siblings”) equal undivided shares in the Subject Property.14 The Salinas\n\nSiblings were (1) Juana Salinas Garcia, (2) Leoncio Salinas,15 (3) Horacio B.\n\nSalinas, (4) Ester Salinas, (5) Octavio Salinas, (6) Adan Salinas, (7) Ascencio\n\n\n11\n  7 CR 2297. Ynez is also referred to as “Ines” in some parts of the record. See, e.g., 7 CR\n2328.\n12\n     8 CR 2570 (Instruments 2-3 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2582-85 (Deeds).\n13\n     7 CR 2315.\n14\n     7 CR 2320-21.\n15\n  One of the Plaintiffs/Appellants, also named Leoncio Salinas, is one of the sons of Adan\nSalinas. The Salinas Sibling named Leoncio Salinas is his uncle and is now deceased.\n\n                                                2\n1176340\n\fSalinas, (8) Arnaldo Salinas, (9) Flavio Salinas, (10) Ramiro Salinas, (11) Emma\n\nSalinas Benavides, and (12) Hermila Salinas Flores.16 They became cotenants of\n\nundivided interests in the Subject Property as a result of the 1964 conveyance.17\n\n          Between 1964 and the fall of 1968, there were several conveyances of the\n\nSubject Property that are not at issue in this appeal. First, the Salinas Siblings and\n\ntheir parents joined in deeding 92.699 acres in the Subject Property to sibling\n\nAdan.18 Second, sibling Ester died intestate, unmarried, and without issue, and all\n\nof the Salinas Siblings (except Ascencio) and their mother deeded Ester’s interest\n\nto Ascencio.19 Third, sibling Juana deeded to her brother Octavio all of her interest\n\nin the Subject Property’s surface.20 Juana expressly reserved her mineral interest.21\n\nB.        In October 1968, Leoncio deeded his interests in the Subject Property to\n          Horacio and, in doing so, referenced the partition of the Subject Property.\n          In or around September 1968, the Salinas Siblings discussed a partition\n\nagreement relating to the Subject Property and orally “agreed that Horacio would\n\nget his acreage in the southeast corner and . . . that Horacio was buying Leoncio’s\n\ninterest so that Horacio would be receiving 214 acres, being made up of the 94.5\n\n16\n     7 CR 2320.\n17\n   7 CR 2320. For ease of identification and for brevity’s sake, the Salinas Siblings will\nhereinafter be referred to by their first names.\n18\n     8 CR 2570 (Instruments 16-18 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2592-600 (Deeds).\n19\n  8 CR 2570 (Instrument 26 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2613-22 (Deed) (providing that “Ines”\nSalinas was a widow by the time of the conveyance—i.e., Juan Salinas was also deceased).\n20\n     7 CR 2322-25.\n21\n     7 CR 2322-25.\n\n                                                3\n1176340\n\facres he was entitled to [approximately 1/12 of 1,134 acres], the 94.5 acres he was\n\nbuying from Leoncio, and the 25 acres of [adjacent] property” that Horacio had\n\npurchased previously from third parties.22 The surface of the Subject Property was\n\nsubsequently surveyed in accordance with that oral agreement.23\n\n          On October 9, 1968, Leoncio deeded to Horacio a tract of land described as\n\n“[a]ll that certain tract set aside, or to be set aside, to Grantor, under that\n\nAgreement heretofore entered into by and between Grantor and Grantee, and their\n\nbrothers and sisters, and more particularly described as follows: . . . Parcel No. 1,\n\ncontaining 214.164 acres of land,” which is then described by metes and bounds.24\n\nThis deed (the “Leoncio-Horacio Deed”) has no mineral reservation and conveyed\n\nParcel 1 “together with all and singular the rights and appurtenances thereto.”25 It\n\nwas intended to convey all of Leoncio’s interest in the Subject Property.26\n\nC.        In December 1968, the nine Salinas Siblings who owned surface interests in\n          the Subject Property entered a Partition Agreement to divide the surface into\n          nine Parcels and divided their mineral interests along the same lines.\n          In December 1968, the nine Salinas Siblings who owned a surface interest\n\n(along with their spouses) memorialized an agreement to partition their respective\n\nrights, title, and interests in the Subject Property (the “Partition Agreement”), and\n\n22\n     8 CR 2770-71 (App. A at ¶¶ 6-8).\n23\n     8 CR 2771 (App. A at ¶ 9); 8 CR 2807 (App. C).\n24\n     7 CR 2326-27 (App. B).\n25\n     See 7 CR 2326-27 (App. B).\n26\n     See 8 CR 2771-72 (App. A at ¶ 11).\n\n                                                4\n1176340\n\fthey recorded it in the Deed Records of Starr County.27 The Partition Agreement\n\ndoes not contain signature lines for Juana or Leoncio.28\n\n          The Partition Agreement sets aside to Horacio the 214.164 acres—i.e.,\n\nParcel 1—that was conveyed to him in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed.29                          The\n\ndescription of Parcel 1 in the Partition Agreement matches the description of\n\nParcel 1 in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed.30                   The Partition Agreement does not\n\npartition Juana’s mineral interests.31              In fact, as Appellants have judicially\n\nadmitted, Juana “and her heirs and assigns have always been treated as undivided\n\ninterest owners under the whole [surface], as it was meant and intended to be.”32\n\n          The Partition Agreement divided the surface of the 1,134 acres into nine\n\nparcels33 and split the signatories’ mineral interests along the new lines, providing:\n\n          It is strictly understood and herein stipulated that this partition\n          agreement is a partition not only of the surface to the tracts\n          hereinafter described, but it is intended by the parties hereto that this\n          partition agreement shall partition all of the rights, title and interest\n          of the respective parties to this agreement in and to the tracts\n          hereinabove described, together with all improvements thereon\n          situated of every kind, character, and description, and it is intended\n          that this partition agreement shall cover and include all of the\n\n27\n   Pl.

For 36 years, nobody questioned the validity of the Partition Agreement and\n          everybody acted consistently with the Partition Agreement’s validity.\n\n          For 36 years, the Salinas Siblings and their successors acted consistently\n\nwith the Partition Agreement’s validity, taking mortgages, granting leases, and\n\noccupying the property as nine divided parcels.37 In that regard, Appellants “do\n\nnot want to disturb the current surface ownership of the [S]ubject [P]roperty[,]” as\n\nestablished by the Partition Agreement.38 And the following conduct relating to\n\nthe mineral interests is particularly noteworthy, in light of the issues in this appeal:\n\n          • In 1971, Ascencio Salinas, predecessor in title to Appellant Romulo\n            Benavides III with respect to Parcel 2, granted an oil-and-gas lease on a\n            portion of his Parcel 2 to Bobby M.

In 2004, the plaintiffs filed suit to try to undo the deal their parents struck.\n\n          On April 15, 2004, some of the Salinas Siblings’ successors filed this suit to\n\nchallenge the Partition Agreement’s validity, hoping to undo the deal their parents\n\nstruck so they can share in royalties on oil and gas produced from parcels they do\n\nnot own. Later, some of Juana Salinas Garcia’s successors joined the suit, hoping\n\nto undo a deal that does not even affect them. This suit has been ongoing for over\n\nten years now. It is time for the Partition Agreement’s validity to be confirmed\n\nonce and for all. For the reasons below, Appellees urge this Court to do so.\n\n                               SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n          The Partition Agreement went unchallenged for 36 years. During that time\n\nperiod, every Salinas Sibling who signed the Partition Agreement, as well as their\n\nsuccessors, acted as though the Partition Agreement were valid. Some of them\n\nconveyed their interests in the parcels that were allotted to them in the Partition\n\nAgreement. Others invested time and money to construct fences and many other\n\nimprovements on the parcels that were allotted to them in the Partition Agreement.\n\nIn 1995 and 2002, several of them even leased their mineral interests on a divided\n\nbasis and, in doing so, incorporated the Partition Agreement into their leases.\n\n          But 36 years after the Salinas Siblings signed the Partition Agreement and\n\nagreed to the division of parcels therein, some of their children brought suit to try\n\nto undo the deal their parents struck because successful drilling in 2002 revealed\n\nthat the minerals were not distributed evenly among the parcels. Instead, the\n                                              10\n1176340\n\fminerals are located primarily in Parcels 5 and 8.        Appellants who have no\n\nownership interests in Parcel 5 or 8 want to reestablish the undivided mineral\n\ninterests that existed before the Partition Agreement was signed because the post-\n\nagreement developments have made the mineral division more advantageous to\n\nother parties.     But no new facts about the surface have come to light, and\n\nAppellants have no desire to undo the surface division in the Partition Agreement.\n\nSo now they are in the untenable position of wanting to reject the burdens of the\n\nPartition Agreement—divided minerals—and retain its benefits—divided surface.\n\n          The Partition Agreement is valid and enforceable because it was signed by\n\nall of the property owners it affected. Juana and Leoncio were not affected by it\n\nand thus did not have to sign it. In fact, Appellants admit there has been no effect\n\non Juana or her heirs and assigns; therefore, even if the Partition Agreement could\n\nbe construed to affect Juana, her heirs and assigns lack standing to challenge it.\n\nLeoncio conveyed all of his interests to his brother Horacio before the Partition\n\nAgreement was signed, and the remaining siblings ratified that conveyance in the\n\nPartition Agreement itself and thereby effectuated Leoncio’s attempted partition.\n\n          Even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective for lack of certain\n\nsignatures, it would nonetheless bind all Appellants, who fall into three categories:\n\n(1) successors to the original parties to the Partition Agreement; (2) successors to\n\nJuana Garcia Salinas; and (3) successors to Leoncio Salinas by virtue of a\n\n\n                                          11\n1176340\n\fquitclaim deed that Leoncio signed in 1991.53 Anna and Joel Saenz are the only\n\nAppellants in category 3, as Anna is the sole grantee in the 1991 quitclaim deed.54\n\n          Appellants in category 1 cannot deny the binding effect of the Partition\n\nAgreement because they are bound by their predecessors’ and their own conduct\n\nconfirming the Partition Agreement’s validity, by adverse possession, and by their\n\npredecessors’ signatures on the Partition Agreement. They are also bound because\n\nTexas law does not permit them to accept the benefits of the Partition\n\nAgreement—a divided surface—and reject the burdens of the Partition\n\nAgreement—divided minerals. Appellants in category 1 include: (a) Anna and\n\nJoel Saenz, to the extent they claim through Anna’s father, Horacio; (b) Romulo\n\nBenavides, III, who claims through his uncle Ascencio and his mother, Emma;\n\n(c) Leoncio Salinas, who claims through his father, Adan; (d) Luisa Ruiz, who\n\nclaims through her mother, Hermila; and (e) Hermelinda Benavides, Thelma\n\nBenavides Aguilar, and Irma Benavides Cerda, who claim through their mother,\n\nEmma.\n\n          Appellants in category 2, which includes all Appellants not listed in the prior\n\nparagraph, cannot deny the Partition Agreement’s validity because it had no impact\n\non their undivided mineral interest and thus they lack standing to challenge it.\n\n\n\n53\n     8 CR 2573 (Instrument 117 in Thorp’s Abstract).\n54\n     8 CR 2573 (Instrument 117 in Thorp’s Abstract).\n\n                                               12\n1176340\n\f          Appellants in category 3—Anna and Joel Saenz, to the extent they claim\n\nthrough Anna’s uncle Leoncio—cannot deny the Partition Agreement’s validity\n\nbecause the Partition Agreement did not impact Leoncio’s interest in the Subject\n\nProperty. Leoncio conveyed all of his interest in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed,\n\nbefore the Partition Agreement was signed.            Thus, he had no interest to be\n\npartitioned by the Partition Agreement and no interest to convey to Anna in 1991.\n\nIt is perhaps for that reason that Leoncio chose to give a quitclaim deed to Anna, as\n\nopposed to giving her a warranty deed like the Leoncio-Horacio Deed.\n\n          Finally, in the alternative, even if the Court were to determine there is a fact\n\nissue regarding the Partition Agreement, Appellants’ claim for damages as to\n\nSmith Production should be treated as final because Appellants have not\n\nchallenged the summary judgment ground that they have no evidence of damages.\n\n                                       ARGUMENT\nA.        The trial court properly granted Appellees’ motions for summary judgment\n          on at least four grounds, any one of which will suffice to affirm the trial\n          court’s judgment and render judgment for Appellees in this matter.\n\n          1.    The trial court properly granted summary judgment that the Partition\n                Agreement is valid and enforceable because the Partition Agreement\n                was signed by all parties whose interests were affected by it.\n\n          Appellants’ sole basis for attacking the Partition Agreement’s validity is that\n\nJuana and Leoncio did not sign it. That argument is wrong for three reasons. First,\n\nTexas law does not require a partition agreement to be signed by all parties who\n\nhave a mineral interest under the partitioned acreage. Second, Juana did not have\n\n                                             13\n1176340\n\fto sign the Partition Agreement because it had no effect on her mineral interest.\n\nIndeed, because it has had no impact on her mineral interest, her heirs and assigns\n\nlack standing to challenge it in this suit. Third, Leoncio did not have to sign the\n\nPartition Agreement because he conveyed all of his interest in the Subject Property\n\nin the Leoncio-Horacio Deed, before the Partition Agreement was signed, and the\n\nremaining Salinas Siblings signed the Partition Agreement and thereby ratified his\n\nconveyance.\n\n                   a.   Texas law does not require all parties with a mineral interest in\n                        property to join in a partition agreement regarding that property.\n          A partition agreement does not have to be signed by all parties who have a\n\nmineral interest under the partitioned acreage in order to be valid and enforceable.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Texas addressed this very issue in Garza v. De Montalvo.55\n\n          In Garza, ten siblings voluntarily partitioned their interests in land that was\n\ncovered by an oil-and-gas lease.56 Their partition agreement did not reference the\n\noil-and-gas lease, “and Sun Oil Company, which then owned the lease, did not join\n\nin the partition agreement.”57 At the time the agreement was entered (in 1937), “no\n\nwells for oil or gas had been drilled on the leased land.”58 Sun Oil Company began\n\ndrilling in 1942 and, in 1943, began paying royalties in accordance with the\n\n\n55\n     See Garza v. De Montalvo, 217 S.W.2d 988, 992 (Tex. 1949).\n56\n     Id at 989.\n57\n     Id. at 990.\n58\n     Id. at 989.\n\n                                               14\n1176340\n\fpartition agreement’s segregation of tracts.59 This method of royalty payments\n\ncontinued for approximately two years but was challenged in 1945 by parties to the\n\npartition agreement who claimed that the partition agreement had no effect on the\n\nmineral estate, in part because “a partition of the mineral estate could not take\n\nplace without the participation of Sun Oil Company, which as assignee of the\n\noriginal lessee owned the working interest in the mineral estate.”60\n\n            The Garza court upheld the partition agreement’s validity despite the fact\n\nthat Sun Oil Company—which owned a possessory mineral interest in the\n\npartitioned property—did not sign the agreement.61 And the court concluded that\n\n“[t]hose who joined in the agreement [could] not attack it under these facts.”62\n\n           Just like the Garza partition agreement, the Partition Agreement here is valid\n\nwithout the joinder of Juana, who had an undivided 1/12 of the 15/32 interest in the\n\nmineral estate. Likewise, the Partition Agreement’s validity is unaffected by the\n\nnon-joinder of the third parties with an undivided 17/32 of the mineral interest.\n\nAppellants seemingly concede at least that much, as they have not challenged the\n\nPartition Agreement’s validity on the ground it was not signed by the third parties.\n\n\n\n\n59\n     Id. at 990.\n60\n     Id. at 992.\n61\n     See id. at 992.\n62\n     Id.\n\n                                             15\n1176340\n\fJuana should not be treated differently from the third parties. Under the Garza\n\nopinion, none of them needed to sign the Partition Agreement to make it valid.\n\n                 b.     Juana did not need to sign the Partition Agreement because it\n                        does not affect her mineral interest in the Subject Property.\n                        Indeed, she and her heirs and assigns have always been treated\n                        as undivided mineral-interest holders and, for that reason, have\n                        no standing to attack the Partition Agreement’s validity here.\n\n          Juana did not need to sign the Partition Agreement for an additional reason:\n\nit simply did not impact her undivided mineral interest in the Subject Property.\n\n          Partition agreements are binding contracts and, as such, are “subject to the\n\nusual rules of construction to determine their scope and application.”63 Thus, as\n\nwith any other contract, “the primary concern of the court is to ascertain the true\n\nintentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument” itself.64 To achieve this\n\nobjective, the entire contract must be examined and considered “in an effort to\n\nharmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be\n\nrendered meaningless.”65 In other words, all provisions of the written instrument at\n\nissue “must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.”66\n\n          Appellants focus on select provisions of the Partition Agreement to conclude\n\nthat the Partition Agreement “purported to convey all of the mineral interests to the\n\n63\n  Id. at 993; accord Hamilton v.

But that fact matters, if for no other\n\nreason than that it establishes that the Appellants who are Juana Salinas Garcia’s\n\nsuccessors lack standing in this suit.\n\n          For standing to exist, “a plaintiff must be personally aggrieved; his alleged\n\ninjury must be concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, not hypothetical.”71\n\nThe standing requirement “is implicit in the Texas Constitution’s open courts\n\nprovision, which contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering\n\nan injury.”72 As this Court has recognized, a plaintiff does not have standing\n\n\n\n\n70\n   10 CR 3493 (Plaintiffs’ Ninth Amended Petition at ¶ 112); see also Appellants’ Brief at 18,\nn.81 (“Defendants may argue that Juana Salinas’ mineral interest was not treated as having been\npartitioned under the partition agreement. . . .

In doing so, the remaining cotentants accomplished equity among\n\nthemselves, consistent with principles underlying the equitable-partition doctrine.89\n\n          Appellants minimize the equitable-partition doctrine by saying that “an\n\nequitable partition only becomes effective when it is entered by a court as part of a\n\npartition decree.”90 Appellants miss the point: this Court, in equity, should not\n\ndisturb the equity that the parties intended to effectuate in the Partition Agreement.\n\n                  d.     Appellants cite no authority that actually supports their claim\n                         that the Partition Agreement is invalid without Juana’s and\n                         Leoncio’s signatures.\n          As support for their claim that the Partition Agreement is invalid without\n\nJuana’s and Leoncio’s signatures, Appellants rely solely on two cases—Stradt v.\n\nFirst United Methodist Church of Huntington, 573 S.W.2d 186 (Tex. 1978), and\n\nThomas v. Southwestern Settlement and Development Company, 123 S.W.2d 290\n\n(Tex. 1939).91 Neither Stradt nor Thomas is factually analogous to this case, and\n\nneither case supports an argument that parties who are unaffected by a partition\n\nagreement must nonetheless sign the partition agreement in order to make it valid.\n\n\n\n\n89\n   See, e.g., Thomas, 123 S.W.2d at 296 (“[T]he doctrine [of equitable partition] is an equitable\ndoctrine, which concerns itself primarily in protecting the vendee in the part of the land\nconveyed to him, when and to the extent that this can be done without prejudice to the cotenants\nof the whole tract, and which in the attainment of such primary object undertakes fairly to adjust\nthe equities of all of the interested parties.”).\n90\n     Appellants’ Brief at 15, n.69.\n91\n     See Appellants’ Brief at 14-19.\n\n                                               23\n1176340\n\f           In Stradt, the plaintiff brought suit for a partition of her interest in 177 acres\n\nof land that her father deeded to the First United Methodist Church of Huntington\n\nwithout the joinder of his daughter (the plaintiff) or his son.92 The 177 acres were\n\npart of a tract that had been the community property of the father and the children’s\n\nmother.93 When the mother died intestate, the father received a one-half divided\n\ninterest, and the children both received a one-fourth undivided interest.”94\n\n           The Church filed a trespass-to-try-title cross action and “tried the case on a\n\ntheory of parol partition[.]”95 The Church argued that the father’s conveyance of a\n\nseparate 1,600 acres to his children in 1946 “was in full settlement of their interest\n\nin their mother’s estate” and that, as a result, they did not have any interest in the\n\n177-acre tract when the father conveyed it to the Church in 1949.96 The trial court\n\nallowed the submission of two special issues on the question of parol partition, and\n\nthe question on appeal was whether there was any evidence to support the\n\nsubmission of or the answers to the special issues.97 The Supreme Court of Texas\n\nheld there was no evidence of a parol partition, reasoning in part that there was no\n\nevidence that the plaintiff-daughter or the son consented to any partition and that\n\n\n92\n     Stradt, 573 S.W.2d at 188.\n93\n     Id.\n94\n     Id.\n95\n     Id.\n96\n     Id.\n97\n     Id. at 189.\n\n                                               24\n1176340\n\f“[a] voluntary partition of land must be based on the agreement of all parties with a\n\npossessory interest thereto and cannot be the result of a unilateral decision.”98\n\n          Unlike the parol partition alleged in Stradt, the Partition Agreement here did\n\nnot divest any non-joining parties of their interests. It did not divest Juana of her\n\nmineral interest, did not divest the third parties of their 17/32 mineral interest, and\n\ncould not divest Leoncio of any interest because he had already conveyed all of his\n\ninterests in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed. The Partition Agreement merely divided\n\nthe possessory interests of its signatories, and thus it does not run afoul of Stradt.\n\n          In Thomas, the plaintiffs—record owners of a 3/35 interest in the land at\n\nissue—claimed that their cotenant, the Houston Oil Company of Texas, had\n\n“brought about a partition by making a sale of a specific portion of the common\n\nestate, which portion was of a value in excess of the value of its pro rata share of\n\nthe estate.”99 The Thomas plaintiffs claimed that the conveyance and partition\n\nbound Houston Oil Company of Texas, and they “invoke[d] the doctrine of\n\nequitable partition as in effect giving them title to that portion of the common\n\nestate that was not conveyed by Houston Oil Company of Texas.”100\n\n          After analyzing cases relating to partitions, the Thomas court held that “the\n\naction of one cotenant in conveying a specific parcel of the commonly owned land\n\n\n98\n     Id. at 190.\n99\n     Thomas, 123 S.W.2d at 292, 294.\n100\n      Id. at 294-95.\n\n                                            25\n1176340\n\fdoes not divest the nonjoining content of his interest in the parcel conveyed and is\n\nnot an effective partition when made, but it will become effective when the court,\n\nafter finding that it can be equitably done, sets apart such tract to the vendee.”101\n\nAnd for reasons inapplicable to this case, the Thomas court held that “the equities\n\nof the case . . . [did] not . . . justify the application of the equitable rule invoked.”102\n\n          Appellants cherry-picked from Thomas a portion of the court’s synopsis of a\n\nrule from a different case—Joyner v. Christian, 113 S.W.2d 1229 (Tex. 1938).\n\nThe full synopsis is that “a partition attempted to be made without joinder of all of\n\nthe cotenants is ineffective when made but will become binding when ratified by\n\nthose who did not participate in it.”103 In fact, a full reading of Joyner, coupled\n\nwith other cases, makes clear that, even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective\n\nfor lack of Juana’s or Leoncio’s signature (which it is not), the Partition Agreement\n\nwould nonetheless be binding on all Appellants, for a number of different reasons.\n\n          2.        Even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective due to the lack of\n                    Juana’s and Leoncio’s signatures, summary judgment is proper\n                    because Appellants accepted benefits of the Partition Agreement,\n                    ratified it, acquiesced in it, and are estopped to deny its validity now.\n\n          Appellants have made it abundantly clear that they “do not want to disturb\n\nthe current surface ownership of the [S]ubject [P]roperty.” 104 In fact, they “are\n\n\n101\n      Id. at 299; see also id. at 296-99 (analyzing Texas cases relating to partition).\n102\n      Id. at 295.\n103\n      Id. at 299 (emphasis added to identify text omitted from Appellants’ Brief).\n104\n      10 CR 3493 (Plaintiffs’ Ninth Amended Petition at ¶ 113).\n\n                                                    26\n1176340\n\fwilling to stipulate and agree that, even if the [Partition Agreement] . . . is held to\n\nbe invalid or unenforceable, they will enter into and sign any necessary agreements\n\nto vest title to the surface into the current alleged owners of the surface.”105\n\n            In seeking to uphold the surface division in the Partition Agreement on the\n\none hand, and seeking to undo the mineral division in the Partition Agreement on\n\nthe other hand, Appellants are seeking an outcome that equity does not permit.\n\n            The essence of a partition is that it gives the parties full ownership of\n            something, instead of a prior undivided ownership, and gives it in\n            exchange for surrender of an undivided interest in something else.\n            Equitably speaking, one can no more accept the benefits of a partition\n            while rejecting its burdens than he or she can do so with regard to\n            any contract, deed, or will.106\n\nFor this reason alone, this Court should enforce the Partition Agreement even if it\n\ndetermines that the Partition Agreement is otherwise unenforceable for lack of\n\ncertain signatures.\n\n            Moreover, even if Appellants could accept the portions of the Partition\n\nAgreement they like and reject the rest (which they clearly cannot do), they still\n\ncannot escape the legal effect of the many actions they and their predecessors have\n\ntaken consistent with the Partition Agreement’s validity.                  As Appellants\n\nacknowledge, a party is “equitably prohibited from challenging [a] partition under\n\nratification, estoppel, or acquiescence” if “the party challenging the partition acted\n\n\n105\n      Id.\n106\n      Wright v.

Scurry and the other defendants holding under him [were]\n\nestopped to deny its binding effect as against them.”110 The court continued:\n\n          [T]he . . . allottees ratified as between themselves their voluntary\n          action in making the partition, by each taking possession of the tract\n          set apart to him and making improvements thereon, and by executing\n          ratification deeds to each other respectively, and by severally\n          executing numerous oil and gas leases, royalty deeds, and other\n          conveyances, to third persons. The partition and the respective deeds\n          of confirmation executed by the allottees to each other are void. The\n          action of the allottees, upon being acquiesced in by the nonjoining\n          cotenants, is given the effect, upon the principle of estoppel, of\n          segregating the common lands into separate tracts. This principle\n\n\n\n107\n      Appellants’ Brief at 29-30.\n108\n   Joyner, 113 S.W.2d at 1232-33. Of note, the Joyner court treated estoppel, ratification, and\nacquiescence as related concepts and did not define specific elements for any of them. See id.\n109\n      Joyner, 113 S.W.2d at 1230-31.\n110\n      Id. at 1232 (emphasis added).\n\n                                              28\n1176340\n\f          denies the allottees, including Scurry and those holding under him, the\n          right to question the binding force of the segregation.111\n\n          For 36 years, the Salinas Siblings and their successors acted consistently\n\nwith the Partition Agreement’s validity, taking mortgages, granting leases, and\n\noccupying the property as nine divided parcels.112 Appellants tacitly admit the\n\nactions reflecting that the partition of the surface estate was valid, as the section of\n\ntheir Brief regarding ratification, acquiescence, and estoppel focuses solely on\n\nwhether Appellants have acted as if the partition of the mineral estate was valid.113\n\nTheir focus is understandable, given that they “do not want to disturb the current\n\nsurface ownership of the [S]ubject [P]roperty[.]”114 But again, they cannot ratify\n\nthe Partition Agreement’s division of the surface estate and reject its division of the\n\nmineral estate. They simply cannot have it both ways.\n\n          Although Appellants suggest they never acted as if the partition of the\n\nmineral estate was valid, the record proves otherwise. Here are some examples.\n\n          • First, as addressed further in Section A(4) below, all nine of the Salinas\n            Siblings who signed the Partition Agreement condoned the division of\n            the mineral estate therein, and that action binds all Appellants who claim\n            through them.\n\n111\n   Id.

Appellants Anna\n            and Joel Saenz are claiming interests through Leoncio as a result of his\n            quitclaim deed to Anna in 1991, but that deed (like all quitclaim deeds)\n            contains no warranty or covenant for the right, title, or interest that it\n            purports to pass.116 By the deed, Leoncio passed only what he owned in\n            the Subject Property.117 Owning nothing, he passed nothing to Anna.118\n            Moreover, Anna and Joel Saenz are bound by Leoncio’s acquiescence in\n            the Partition Agreement beginning back in 1968.\n\n          • Third, all Appellants who referred to and/or incorporated the Partition\n            Agreement into their oil-and-gas leases in 1971, 1995, and 2002, either\n            directly or through their predecessors, acted as if the partition was\n            valid.119\n\n          • Fourth, Appellants Leoncio Salinas, Romulo Benavides III, Anna Maria\n            Saenz and husband Joel Saenz, Luisa M. Ruiz, and Hermelinda\n            Benavides recognized the validity of the division of the mineral estate\n            when they joined in a Cross-Conveyance and Stipulation of Interest\n            Agreement whereby they cross-conveyed their divided interests in\n            Parcels 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9, so as to create the undivided interests therein\n            stipulated in those Parcels.120\n\n          Appellants attempt to overcome all of the evidence establishing their\n\nacceptance of the validity of the partition of the mineral estate by focusing on the\n\n\n115\n      7 CR 2362 (App. A at ¶ 11).\n116\n      Rogers v.

Summary judgment is also proper because Appellants’ claims are\n                 barred by adverse possession.\n\n          The trial court’s summary judgment can also be affirmed on the affirmative\n\ndefense of adverse possession, which Appellees’ summary judgment evidence\n\nestablishes as a matter of law. From the time the Partition Agreement was signed\n\nin 1968 until this suit was filed in 2004, each of the Salinas Siblings receiving a\n\nparcel under the Partition Agreement (and/or their successors) have maintained\n\nactual and visible possession of the allotted parcel under a claim of right that is\n\ninconsistent with and hostile to the claim of any other person.124 Appellants\n\nattempt to upset that long-settled title, arguing that adverse possession does not\n\napply because: (i) minerals were severed from the surface, (ii) the elements of\n\nadverse possession have not been met, and (iii) Appellant Anna Saenz consented to\n\nthe possession. As discussed below, all of Appellants’ justifications fail.\n\n                 a.     The portion of the minerals that remain unsevered from the\n                        surface were adversely possessed along with the surface.\n          Appellants assert that, because part of the minerals underlying the Subject\n\nProperty were severed, the remaining unsevered minerals could not be adversely\n\npossessed by occupation of the surface and, instead, could only be adversely\n\npossessed by drilling and production. That is not the law in Texas.\n\n\n\nRobinson v. O'Connor, 181 S.W.2d 935, 938 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1944, writ ref’d w.o.m.)\n(holding that, “by long acquiescence,” parties ratified a deed an attempted partition preceding it).\n124\n      See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 16.021(1) (West 2002).\n\n                                                32\n1176340\n\f          The general rule that possession of the surface will not perfect title to\n\nsevered minerals relies on the theory that possession of the surface estate is not a\n\nrepudiation of the owner of the mineral estate.125 But that theory does not apply to\n\nany portion of the minerals that has not been severed from the surface.\n\n          When, as here, a portion (11/12 of 15/32) of minerals remains unsevered\n\nfrom the surface estate, adverse possession of the surface perfects title to the\n\nunsevered minerals.126 For example, in Dixon v. Henderson, the court held that a\n\ncotenant perfected title to the surface and to the minerals that remained unsevered\n\nunder the tract under the ten-year statute of limitation, without any drilling or\n\nproduction.127\n\n          In this case, a subset of the minerals was severed from the surface of the\n\nSubject Property—the 17/32 interest assigned to third parties in 1932 and 1940,\n\nand the 1/12 of 15/32 interest retained by Juana when she deeded her surface\n\ninterest to her brother Octavio. But the remaining mineral estate underlying the\n\nSubject Property—11/12 of 15/32—was not severed and continued to be owned in\n\ncommon with the surface estate. Thus, as in Dixon, if the Partition Agreement\n125\n    See Elliott v. Nelson, 251 S.W. 501, 504 (Tex. 1923) (“[N]o delay in working or mining the\nminerals . . . can be construed into a repudiation[ ] by the owner of the other estate, of the estate\nin the minerals reserved . . . .”).\n126\n    See, e.g., Dixon v.

(“[A]dverse possession of the surface extends to and includes an adverse possession of the\nmineral interest thereunder which had never been separated or severed from the surface\nestate . . . .”).\n127\n      Dixon, 267 S.W.2d at 873 (citing Thomas, 123 S.W.2d at 291, 300).\n\n                                                33\n1176340\n\fwere not binding here, then the unsevered portion of the minerals would be subject\n\nto adverse possession of the surface without the need for drilling and production.\n\n                 b.     The summary judgment evidence established all of the elements\n                        of adverse possession, and Appellants presented no evidence to\n                        the contrary.\n\n          Appellants contend that the only summary judgment evidence in support of\n\nadverse possession is the affidavit of Fausto Salinas, which they claim is\n\nconclusory. Appellants disregard the supporting statements in Fausto’s affidavit\n\nand in his deposition testimony, which was also included in the summary judgment\n\nrecord. Appellants also ignore interrogatory answers that are part of the record\n\nhere. A full review of the record shows that adverse possession was established as\n\na matter of law, with no controverting evidence presented by Appellants.\n\n          Adverse possession requires proof of “(1) actual possession of the disputed\n\nproperty; (2) under a claim of right; (3) that was adverse or hostile to the claim of\n\nanother person and that it was consistently and continuously so for the duration of\n\nthe statutory period.”128        In addition, “a co-tenant may not adversely possess\n\nagainst another co-tenant unless it clearly appears he has repudiated the title of his\n\n\n\n\n128\n      Villareal v.

In Republic Production Co. v. Lee, for\n\nexample, the court held that an attempted partition that lacked a cotenant, when\n\nfollowed by adverse possession, constituted a repudiation of the cotenancy:\n\n          It is a rule of wide application that if two or more tenants in common\n          of a tract of land enter into a partition of same, and set apart the whole\n          to the exclusion of a non-participating cotenant, such act of partition,\n          when followed by adverse possession, even if wholly void as against\n          the excluded cotenant, constitutes a complete and unequivocal\n          repudiation of the cotenancy relationship. It is also well settled that\n          such a partition, even though there be no sufficient record thereof as\n          will give notice to the excluded cotenant, may be proven as an act\n          manifesting an intention on the part of the participating cotenant to\n          oust the other cotenant or repudiate the tenancy relationship with\n          him.131\n\n\n\n\n129\n      King Ranch, Inc. v.

A complete review of the\n\nrecord establishes each element of adverse possession.\n\n          Fausto’s affidavit provides that that the Salinas Sibling took immediate\n\npossession of and “began to construct improvements, fences, wells, and buildings\n\non their respective parcels.”132            The affidavit also provides that Horacio\n\nimmediately sold Parcel 1 to a third party but reserved his mineral rights therein.133\n\n          Important to the oil-and-gas production obtained from Parcels 5 and 8,\n\nFausto’s affidavit provides additional detail about the actions of Fausto’s father,\n\nOctavio, to stake his exclusive claim to Parcel 8, and the actions of Fausto’s uncle,\n\nFlavio, to stake his exclusive claim to Parcel 5.134 They constructed fences and\n\nother improvements, and Fausto and his father have been cultivating, using, and\n\nenjoying Parcel 8 since the Partition Agreement was signed in 1968.135\n\n\n\n\n132\n      7 CR 2362 (App. A at ¶ 12).\n133\n      8 CR 2571 (Instruments 29 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2647-51 (Deed).\n134\n      7 CR 2362 (App. A at ¶¶ 14-15).\n135\n      Id. at ¶ 14.\n\n                                               36\n1176340\n\f          In Fausto’s deposition, which is part of the summary judgment record,\n\nFausto gave testimony that is consistent with his affidavit and provides further\n\ndetail about adverse possession. He explained that, after the Partition Agreement\n\nwas executed, a dozer was brought in to clear senderos dividing each of the\n\npartitioned blocks.136 Fences were then erected in the senderos along the survey\n\nline of each parcel, as divided by the Partition Agreement.137 Fausto also testified\n\nthat, from the time the Partition Agreement was signed in 1968 until this lawsuit\n\nwas filed in 2004, title to each parcel was held continuously and peaceably—that\n\nno one ever challenged or questioned the siblings’ or their successors’ individual\n\ntitle in the allotted parcels claimed under the Partition Agreement.138 Fausto’s\n\ndeposition testimony was uncontroverted and establishes adverse possession as a\n\nmatter of law under the ten-year adverse possession statute.139\n\n          In addition to Fausto’s affidavit and deposition testimony, Appellants’ own\n\ninterrogatory responses below provide evidence of adverse possession. In response\n\nto Interrogatory 7, which asked Appellants whether they occupied any portion of\n\nthe Subject Property and asked them to describe any such occupation, they wrote:\n\n\n\n136\n    See, e.g., 7 CR 2363-87, at 36:7-13 (going so far as to identify the foreman and dozer driver\nwho cut the senderos, Lee Walker and Felix Flores).

Leoncio and his family have put an\n          extensive amount of time and hard work . . . into this property . . . .\n          There have been new fences, lines, sheds, corrals, water\n          improvements and other projects on the property. Leoncio has been\n          living on the property since his father passed away in 1998. Romulo’s\n          surface has a house, corrals, fencing, and water wells. Hermelinda’s\n          surface has fencing and water well improvements. Surface uses are\n          residential, agricultural, hunting, livestock and recreational.140\n\nAnd in response to Interrogatory 8, which asked whether Appellants’ predecessors\n\never occupied any portion of the Subject Property, Appellants wrote: “yes, some\n\npredecessors in interest of the Plaintiffs [Appellants] occupied the property dating\n\nall the way back to Juan and Ines Salinas.”141\n\n          Tellingly, although Appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthey offer no rebutting evidence. Indeed, they have asserted repeatedly that they\n\nare not trying to disturb the long-recognized division of the surface.142 But that\n\nsurface use is exactly what establishes adverse possession in the event the Partition\n\nAgreement did not bind all of the contested interests in the Subject Property.\n\n                   c.    Even if Ana Saenz “consented” to the use of the surface by the\n                         siblings and their successors, her consent could not have been\n                         granted until after the 10-year statute of limitations had expired.\n\n          Appellants contend that the trial court improperly excluded the affidavit of\n\nAppellant Anna Saenz and her claim that she consented to the use of the divided\n\n140\n      8 CR 2778.\n141\n      8 CR 2779.\n142\n      Appellants’ Brief at 8.\n\n                                               38\n1176340\n\fparcels by her parents’ siblings. But that claim is contradicted by Anna’s own\n\ndeposition testimony that nobody asked for her consent to go onto their land.143\n\nShe even admitted that she did not own any interest in the surface of the Subject\n\nProperty and that people with surface ownership, such as Fausto Salinas (Octavio\n\nSalinas’s son), did not need to share the benefits resulting from their ownership.144\n\n          Anna did not obtain any potential interest in any portion of the Subject\n\nProperty until 1989, when her father Horacio died intestate and she inherited his\n\ninterest in Parcel 1 of the Subject Property.145 Accordingly, any “consent” that\n\nAnna gave before 1989 would have been useless. Indeed, in both of the consent\n\ncases that Appellants cite, the permission to use the property that barred adverse\n\npossession came from a party claiming record title, not a third party.146 Thus,\n\nduring the time period that is relevant here, Anna’s “consent” had no effect.\n\n          Anna obtained her alleged interest in the Subject Property 21 years after the\n\nPartition Agreement was signed—i.e., approximately 11 years after the 10-year\n\nstatute of limitations had expired and the Salinas Siblings and their successors had\n\n\n\n\n143\n      8 CR 2799.\n144\n      8 CR 2800-02.\n145\n      8 CR 2553, 2792.\n146\n   See Villareal v.

At a minimum, summary judgment is proper as against the parties\n                     who joined in the Partition Agreement, as well as their successors.\n\n          A longstanding rule in Texas is that parties who join in a partition agreement\n\nare bound by the agreement, even if the agreement is determined to be void due to\n\nthe non-joinder of cotenants in the partitioned property. For example, in Joyner,\n\nthe plaintiffs, who were cotenants of partitioned property, sued Scurry Christian,\n\nclaiming they were left out of a partition agreement between Scurry and his\n\nsiblings.148 The Supreme Court of Texas held that, even though the agreement was\n\nvoid due to non-joinder of the cotenants, “Scurry and the other defendants holding\n\nunder him [were] estopped to deny its binding effect as against them.”149 The court\n\nreinforced and clarified that rule in Republic Production Co. v. Lee, holding: “Even\n\nif the instruments of conveyance [in the partition proceeding at issue] were void,\n\nthe partition was nonetheless valid as to those who participated therein.”150\n\n\n\n\n147\n      Tex.

Likewise, their successors\n\ncannot undo the deal that the Salinas Siblings struck in the Partition Agreement.\n\n          Thus, at a minimum, summary judgment is proper against (a) Anna and Joel\n\nSaenz, to the extent they claim through Anna’s father, Horacio; (b) Romulo\n\nBenavides, III, who claims through his uncle Ascencio and his mother, Emma;\n\n(c) Leoncio Salinas, who claims through his father, Adan; (d) Luisa Ruiz, who\n\nclaims through her mother, Hermila; and (e) Hermelinda Benavides, Thelma\n\nBenavides Aguilar, and Irma Benavides Cerda, who claim through their mother,\n\nEmma.\n\nB.        Even if there were a fact question relating to the Partition Agreement,\n          Appellants’ claim for damages in their trespass-to-try title action should be\n          treated as final because Appellants have not challenged or briefed the\n          summary judgment ground that they have no evidence of such damages.\n          In the underlying trespass-to-try-title action, Appellants (as plaintiffs) sought\n\nboth “an order quieting title to the disputed property and damages to compensate\n\nthem for all [alleged] unlawful conduct of defendants, including all actual, special,\n\nconsequential, and incidental damages.”151 Smith Production moved for summary\n\njudgment on multiple grounds, including that “Plaintiffs have no evidence . . . of\n\n\n\n\n151\n    10 CR 3495-96 (Plaintiffs’ Ninth Amended Petition at ¶ 116(e).

P. 783(f), 805.\n\n                                               41\n1176340\n\fany damages.”152            The trial court granted all Appellees’ summary judgment\n\nmotions without specifying the grounds on which it was ruling.153 The trial court\n\nthen entered a final judgment and ordered that the “Partition Agreement . . . is\n\nhereby declared to be valid and enforceable for all purposes as to all parties to this\n\nsuit” and that “Plaintiffs take nothing by their suit against all Defendants.”154\n\n          “When, as in the present case, a movant asserts multiple grounds for\n\nsummary judgment, and the trial court does not specify in the order the ground on\n\nwhich summary judgment was granted, the nonmovant must negate all grounds on\n\nappeal.” 155 Appellants have acknowledged this requirement in their own Brief.156\n\n          Appellants have not challenged or briefed Smith Production’s summary\n\njudgment ground that Appellants lack evidence of the damages sought in their\n\ntrespass-to-try-title action.         Thus, they cannot complain about those damages on\n\nappeal, and the trial court’s judgment on those damages should be affirmed even if\n\nthis Court determines there is a fact issue relating to the Partition Agreement.157\n\n\n152\n      8 CR 2843 (Smith Production’s Motion for Summary Judgment at 6).\n153\n      Appellants’ Brief at 13 (citing Pl.

The\n\nPartition Agreement was signed by all of the parties who were affected. The only\n\nreason Appellants want to undo the Partition Agreement now is because drilling\n\nthat began about 34 years after its execution revealed that its division of mineral\n\ninterests is more advantageous to other parties than it is to many of the Appellants.\n\nThere is no rule of construction that permits the unambiguous language in the\n\nPartition Agreement to be departed from because its application to facts that\n\ndeveloped after its execution results in unequal benefits to some of its signatories’\n\nsuccessors and other parties. Moreover, Texas law prohibits what Appellants seek\n\nhere, which is an acceptance of the portions of the Partition Agreement they like—\n\ndivided surface—and a rejection of the portions they dislike—divided minerals.\n\n          WHEREFORE Appellees pray that this Court affirm the judgment below\n\nand grant to them such further relief to which they may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         43\n1176340\n\f          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                SCOTT, DOUGLASS, &\n                MCCONNICO, L.L.P.\n                303 Colorado Street, Suite 2400\n                Austin, Texas 78701-2589\n                (512) 495-6300\n                (512) 495-6399 Fax\n\n          By: /s/ Kennon L.

I was born on July 2, 1935. I am, therefore, over 21 years of age, I am competent\nto make this affidavit, I have never been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and\nI have personal knowledge of all facts stated herein and they are true and correct.\n\n2.    References will be made in this affidavit to instruments of record in Starr County,\nTexas, as shown on the Abstract of Title filed by Thorp Petroleum Corporation (\"Thorp's\nAbstract\").\n\n3.      My father, Octavio Salinas, was one of 12 children of Juan and Ynes Salinas. Juan\nN. Salinas and Ynes Salinas owned a tract of approximately 1,284 acres in Porciones 38,\n39 and 40, ancient jurisdiction of Reynosa, Starr County, Texas, referred to herein as \"the\nproperty.\" In 1964, my grandparents made a deed (item 12 in Thorp's Abstract) to my\nfather, Octavio Salinas, of 150 acres in the northeast corner of the property. Later in 1964,\nmy grandparents made a gift deed to each of their children of an undivided 1/12 interest\nin the remainder of the property (\"1964 Gift Deed,\" item 14 in Thorp's Abstract). The net\nacreage conveyed was 1,134 acres.\n\n4.    There were mineral interests in the property that my grandparents did not own.\nThus, all of the minerals are not owned by Plaintiffs and Defendants.\n\n5.      I was employed in the oil field business up until 1966 when I started farming some\nof the above referred to property together with my father. My grandfather was aware of the\nfact that his children would eventually divide up the 1,134 acres of land, and before he died\nin 1967. I remember hearing my grandfather express his desire that the ranch house be\nset aside for Esther Salinas and Ascencio Salinas, two of his children, neither of whom\nwere married, and who lived there.\n\n6.     After my grandfather died and before December of 1968, I was present on several\noccasions when my aunts and uncles met to discuss how they were going to divide the\n1,134 acres. Some of them had expressed desires as to where they wanted their portion\nof the 1,134 acres to be located, and essentially, all of my aunts and uncles had no\ndisagreement where each was to receive his or her part of the 1,134 acres. During those\ndiscussions between my aunts and my uncles, I remember that they discussed the fact\nthey had always agreed that if Esther died before Ascencio, that her interest would go to\nhim. My aunt Ester died without a will, unmarried and without ever having had any children.\nMy grandmother, my father and all surviving aunts and uncles joined in a deed (item 26 in\nThorp's Abstract) to my uncle Ascencio Salinas conveying the interest they inherited from\nEster.\n\n7.    In September of 1968, I went with my father to Raymondville, Texas where we met\n\f\fwith Juana Salinas, his sister. My father, Octavio Salinas, had previously made an\nagreement with her to buy her 94.5 acres, which was her part of the 1,134 acres.\nHowever, she did not want to sell her minerals. She preferred to retain her mineral interest\nunder the 1,134 acres. While in Raymondville, Juana Salinas and her husband, signed a\ndeed to my father and I was a witness to her husband's mark on the deed.\n\n8.      I also remember that my uncles, Horacio and Adan Salinas, had each purchased\n25 acres from the Margo's, which was located adjacent to the lands which Hermila was to\nreceive in the partition. All of my aunts and uncles, including Hermila, agreed that Adan\nand Horacio would get an additional 25 acres adjacent to their pro rata part of the 1,134\nacres and in exchange, Hermila would get the 50 acre Margo tract as part of her 94.5\nacres. They agreed that Adan would get his acreage in the northwest corner where he\nbuilt his house. Adan had already been deeded 92.6 acres in the northwest corner when\nthe partition survey was done. The survey of Adan's 94.5 acres, therefore, included the\n92.6 acres which he had already acquired, and that with the 25 acres he had purchased\nfrom the Margo's, made his total surveyed acres 119.5 acres. They agreed that Horacio\nwould get his acreage in the southeast corner and it was understood that Horacio was\nbuying Leoncio's interest so that Horacio would be receiving 214 acres, being made up of\nthe 94.5 acres he was entitled to, the 94.5 acres he was buying from Leoncio, and,the 25\nacres of the Margo property. They also agreed that Octavio would get his property adjacent\nto the 150 acres he already owned, and it was also understood that he had purchased\nJuana's interest in the surface. Therefore, he would be getting his 94.5 acres, Juana's 94.5\nacres, and the 150 acres which he already owned. He would, therefore, be entitled to 339\nacres. Those instructions were given to the surveyor so that those parcels could be\nsurveyed.\n\n9.     After all of my aunts and uncles agreed on where each would receive his or her\nproperty, I heard my uncle Horacio say that he was going to employ the county surveyor,\nElias Aguilar, to survey each tract that each of my aunts and uncles was to receive. I\nremember being at the ranch when Elias Aguilar and his crew were there surveying.\n\n10. After the surveys were completed, probably in December 1968, my father and I, and\nuncle Horacio, and one or two other uncles went to the office of John Pope III and they\nemployed John Pope Ili to prepare a partition agreement. Everyone who signed it knew\nthat Juana and Leoncio were not signing the instrument, and all of them knew the minerals,\nexcept for Juana's, were being divided, I had heard this discussed in the family meetings\nand get-togethers I attended. At those meetings, some of the siblings wanted to keep the\nminerals undivided, others wanted to divide them along with the surface rights. In the end,\nthose who wanted to divide up the Salinas mineral rights prevailed, and they signed the\npartition agreement, dated December 27, 1968 (item 27 in Thorp's Abstract), in which they\nall agreed to divide the minerals so that the minerals were with the surface which each\nreceived.\n\n11. In November of 1968, I, together with Bet° Salinas and a couple of other friends,\nhad a conversation with Leonicio Salinas. I knew that my father and I were interested in\nacquiring as much of the 1,134 acres that we could, so I asked Leonicio if he would be\nwilling to sell us the acreage which he would be getting in the partition. He told me at that\n\n                                             2\n\ftime, that he had already sold everything he would be getting in the partition to my uncle\nHoracio and that he had nothing else left to sell. I subsequently learned that in October of\n1968, Leonicio had signed a deed to Horacio Salinas. Leoncio has never made a claim to\nany of the surface or minerals under the 1,134 acres that I am aware of.\n\n12. After the agreement of partition was signed, the parties immediately began and\ncontinued exclusive possession. Many began to construct improvements, fences, wells,\nand buildings on their respective parcels. My uncle Horacio immediately sold his 214-acre\nParcel 1 to Eusebio Solis, reserving all his mineral rights (item 29 in Thorp's Abstract).\n\n13. My uncle Flavio Salinas immediately went into possession of his Parcel 5,\nconstructing fences and other improvements thereon. His possession and that of his\nchildren (Elodia, since his death has been continuous, actual, visible and hostile to any\nother claim to Parcel 5, using and enjoying said parcel exclusively. Before suit was filed\nby Anna Saenz in 2004, no one had ever asserted any claim to Parcel 5 except Flavio\nSalinas and his heirs and successors.\n\n14. My father immediately went into exclusive possession of his Parcel 8, constructing\nfences and other improvements. Since 1968, continuing until the present time, my father,\nmyself and my sisters have continued to be and remain in continuous, actual, and visible\npossession of Parcel 8, cultivating, using and enjoying said parcel exclusively. Our\npossession was hostile to and did not recognize any claim to said land as being superior\nto our own. Before suit was filed by Anna Saenz in 2004, no one had ever asserted any\nclaim to Parcel 8 except Octavio Salinas and his heirs and successors.\n\n15. My sisters, Rosalinda Balderas and Elda Salinas Ponce, and my nieces, Cindy\nReyna, Veronica Campbell, and Linda Mandes, and I are now the sole owners and in\nexclusive possession of all of the surface of Parcel 8 and all but Juana Salinas Garcia's\nshare of the Salinas mineral interest therein, and of all of the surface of the 150 acres and\nall of the Salinas mineral interest therein.\n\n16.     My uncle Adan had already built his house on his tract because a long time before\nthe partition deed, he knew what tract he was going to eventually get. From the time of the\npartition, my aunts and uncles or their heirs or grantees have been in possession of those\ntracts.

Juan and Ynez Salinas conveyed 17/32 of their mineral interest\n                  to third parties and 150 acres to their son Octavio before\n                  conveying undivided interests in the remaining property to their\n                  12 children—the Salinas Siblings. ....................................................... 2\n          B.      In October 1968, Leoncio deeded his interests in the Subject\n                  Property to Horacio and, in doing so, referenced the partition of\n                  the Subject Property.............................................................................. 3\n\n          C.      In December 1968, the nine Salinas Siblings who owned\n                  surface interests in the Subject Property entered a Partition\n                  Agreement to divide the surface into nine Parcels and divided\n                  their mineral interests along the same lines.......................................... 4\n\n          D.      For 36 years, nobody questioned the validity of the Partition\n                  Agreement and everybody acted consistently with the Partition\n                  Agreement’s validity. ........................................................................... 7\n\n          E.      In 2001, Thorp drilled productive wells on Parcels 5 and 8 and\n                  paid royalties on production in accordance with the Partition\n                  Agreement that had been in place since 1968. ..................................... 9\n\n          F.      In 2004, the plaintiffs filed suit to try to undo the deal their\n                  parents struck. ..................................................................................... 10\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT .............................................................................. 10\n\nARGUMENT .......................................................................................................... 13\n\n1176340\n\f          A.   The trial court properly granted Appellees’ motions for\n               summary judgment on at least four grounds, any one of which\n               will suffice to affirm the trial court’s judgment and render\n               judgment for Appellees in this matter. ............................................... 13\n\n               1.      The trial court properly granted summary judgment that\n                       the Partition Agreement is valid and enforceable because\n                       the Partition Agreement was signed by all parties whose\n                       interests were affected by it...................................................... 13\n\n                       a.      Texas law does not require all parties with a\n                               mineral interest in property to join in a partition\n                               agreement regarding that property. ................................ 14\n\n                       b.      Juana did not need to sign the Partition Agreement\n                               because it does not affect her mineral interest in\n                               the Subject Property. Indeed, she and her heirs\n                               and assigns have always been treated as undivided\n                               mineral-interest holders and, for that reason, have\n                               no standing to attack the Partition Agreement’s\n                               validity here.................................................................... 16\n\n                       c.      Like Juana, Leoncio did not need to sign the\n                               Partition Agreement because he had already\n                               conveyed all of his interest in the Subject Property\n                               to his brother Horacio. ................................................... 19\n\n                       d.      Appellants cite no authority that actually supports\n                               their claim that the Partition Agreement is invalid\n                               without Juana’s and Leoncio’s signatures. .................... 23\n\n               2.      Even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective due to\n                       the lack of Juana’s and Leoncio’s signatures, summary\n                       judgment is proper because Appellants accepted benefits\n                       of the Partition Agreement, ratified it, acquiesced in it,\n                       and are estopped to deny its validity now. ............................... 26\n\n               3.      Summary judgment is also proper because Appellants’\n                       claims are barred by adverse possession. ................................. 32\n\n\n\n                                                     ii\n1176340\n\f                        a.       The portion of the minerals that remain unsevered\n                                 from the surface were adversely possessed along\n                                 with the surface. ............................................................. 32\n\n                        b.       The summary judgment evidence established all of\n                                 the elements of adverse possession, and Appellants\n                                 presented no evidence to the contrary............................ 34\n\n                        c.       Even if Ana Saenz “consented” to the use of the\n                                 surface by the siblings and their successors, her\n                                 consent could not have been granted until after the\n                                 10-year statute of limitations had expired...................... 38\n\n                4.      At a minimum, summary judgment is proper as against\n                        the parties who joined in the Partition Agreement, as well\n                        as their successors. ................................................................... 40\n\n          B.    Even if there were a fact question relating to the Partition\n                Agreement, Appellants’ claim for damages in their trespass-to-\n                try title action should be treated as final because Appellants\n                have not challenged or briefed the summary judgment ground\n                that they have no evidence of such damages. ..................................... 41\nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER............................................................................. 43\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE................................................................................ 45\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE ...................................................................... 47\n\n\n\n\n                                                      iii\n1176340\n\f                                     INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\nCASES\n\nAmerico Life, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs/Appellants seek to invalidate\n                       a 1968 partition agreement, claiming it is invalid because\n                       it was not signed by all tenants who owned a mineral\n                       interest in the land at issue.\n\nTrial Court:                   229th District Court of Starr County, Texas; Honorable\n                               Ana Lisa Garza Presiding.1\n\nCourse of Proceedings: Plaintiffs brought a trespass-to-try-title action regarding\n                       mineral interests in land that was partitioned in 1968 by\n                       an agreement signed by all parties claiming an interest in\n                       the surface.2 The agreement divided the surface into nine\n                       parcels and split the parties’ mineral interests along those\n                       lines.3 It went unchallenged for 36 years. Plaintiffs then\n                       sued the current mineral-interest owners and the mineral\n                       lessees who paid royalties based on the agreement.4\n                       Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the agreement was\n                       void and that they continued to own undivided mineral\n                       interests in parcels which the partition did not allot to\n                       their predecessors.5 They also sought damages.6 The\n                       owners and the lessees, Thorp et al. and Smith\n                       Production, moved for summary judgment on several\n                       grounds, including that the partition agreement was valid,\n                       Plaintiffs’ claims were barred, and Plaintiffs were not\n                       entitled to damages.7 The trial court granted the motions\n                       without specifying grounds.8 This appeal followed.9\n1\n Judge Garza signed the final judgment in this case.

Did the trial court properly grant Appellees’ summary judgment motions and\n\n          declare the partition agreement valid and enforceable on the ground that the\n\n          agreement is signed by all parties whose property interests it affected?\n\n\n\n2.        Even if the partition agreement were lacking one or more necessary\n\n          signatures, is summary judgment proper on the ground that the agreement is\n\n          nonetheless binding on Appellants because (a) they cannot accept the\n\n          benefits of the partition agreement—a divided surface estate—while\n\n          rejecting its burdens—a divided mineral estate; (b) they ratified and\n\n          acquiesced in the divisions within the partition agreement and are estopped\n\n          to deny the agreement’s binding effect now; (c) adverse possession bars their\n\n          ability to challenge the agreement; and/or (d) Appellants whose predecessors\n\n          signed the agreement are bound by their predecessors’ signatures thereto?\n\n\n\n\n9\n    14 CR 5307-09.\n                                               ix\n1176340\n\f                              RECORD AND APPENDIX\n       The record on appeal includes a 14-volume Clerk’s Record and a one-\nvolume Supplemental Clerk’s Record.

(“Smith Production”) and\n\nThorp Petroleum Corporation; El Paso Production Company; El Paso E&P\n\nCompany, LP; El Paso Exploration & Production Management, Inc.; Stanco Land\n\nManagement, LLC; and Meredith Land & Minerals Company (together “Thorp et\n\nal.” and collectively with Smith Production, “Appellees”).\n\n                               OVERVIEW OF THIS APPEAL\n\n          In this appeal, the Court needs to resolve only one substantive issue: is the\n\n1968 partition agreement valid and enforceable? That issue should be resolved\n\naffirmatively because all parties affected by the partition agreement joined in the\n\npartition agreement. Moreover, any claim that the partition agreement is invalid is\n\nbarred by Appellants’ acceptance of benefits under, ratification of, and\n\nacquiescence in the partition agreement, as well as adverse possession. At a\n\nminimum, the partition agreement binds those who signed it and their successors.\n\n          The trial court granted Appellees’ summary judgment motions and entered a\n\nfinal judgment declaring the partition agreement to be “valid and enforceable for\n\nall purposes as to all parties to this suit” and ordering that the underlying\n\n“Plaintiffs take nothing by their suit against all Defendants.”10 The trial court’s\n\njudgment was correct and should be affirmed by this Court.\n\n\n10\n     Pl. App. A at 4, ¶ 3 (14 CR 5294).\n\n1176340\n\f                                  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n          The statement of facts in Appellants’ Brief is incomplete and thus potentially\n\nmisleading. The following statement of facts is intended to give the Court all of\n\nthe facts the Court needs in order to resolve the legal issues properly on appeal.\n\nA.        Juan and Ynez Salinas conveyed 17/32 of their mineral interest to third\n          parties and 150 acres to their son Octavio before conveying undivided\n          interests in the remaining property to their 12 children—the Salinas Siblings.\n\n          The property at issue was originally part of an estate consisting of 1,284\n\nacres in Starr County, Texas, that was owned by spouses Juan and Ynez Salinas.11\n\nThey conveyed 17/32 of their mineral interest to third parties between 1932 and\n\n1940,12 and they conveyed 150 acres to their son Octavio Salinas in 1963.13 The\n\nproperty remaining after the conveyances—the entire surface of 1,134 acres and\n\nthe 15/32 mineral interest—is the subject of this appeal (the “Subject Property”).\n\n          In 1964, Mr. and Mrs. Salinas conveyed to each of their 12 children (the\n\n“Salinas Siblings”) equal undivided shares in the Subject Property.14 The Salinas\n\nSiblings were (1) Juana Salinas Garcia, (2) Leoncio Salinas,15 (3) Horacio B.\n\nSalinas, (4) Ester Salinas, (5) Octavio Salinas, (6) Adan Salinas, (7) Ascencio\n\n\n11\n  7 CR 2297. Ynez is also referred to as “Ines” in some parts of the record. See, e.g., 7 CR\n2328.\n12\n     8 CR 2570 (Instruments 2-3 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2582-85 (Deeds).\n13\n     7 CR 2315.\n14\n     7 CR 2320-21.\n15\n  One of the Plaintiffs/Appellants, also named Leoncio Salinas, is one of the sons of Adan\nSalinas. The Salinas Sibling named Leoncio Salinas is his uncle and is now deceased.\n\n                                                2\n1176340\n\fSalinas, (8) Arnaldo Salinas, (9) Flavio Salinas, (10) Ramiro Salinas, (11) Emma\n\nSalinas Benavides, and (12) Hermila Salinas Flores.16 They became cotenants of\n\nundivided interests in the Subject Property as a result of the 1964 conveyance.17\n\n          Between 1964 and the fall of 1968, there were several conveyances of the\n\nSubject Property that are not at issue in this appeal. First, the Salinas Siblings and\n\ntheir parents joined in deeding 92.699 acres in the Subject Property to sibling\n\nAdan.18 Second, sibling Ester died intestate, unmarried, and without issue, and all\n\nof the Salinas Siblings (except Ascencio) and their mother deeded Ester’s interest\n\nto Ascencio.19 Third, sibling Juana deeded to her brother Octavio all of her interest\n\nin the Subject Property’s surface.20 Juana expressly reserved her mineral interest.21\n\nB.        In October 1968, Leoncio deeded his interests in the Subject Property to\n          Horacio and, in doing so, referenced the partition of the Subject Property.\n          In or around September 1968, the Salinas Siblings discussed a partition\n\nagreement relating to the Subject Property and orally “agreed that Horacio would\n\nget his acreage in the southeast corner and . . . that Horacio was buying Leoncio’s\n\ninterest so that Horacio would be receiving 214 acres, being made up of the 94.5\n\n16\n     7 CR 2320.\n17\n   7 CR 2320. For ease of identification and for brevity’s sake, the Salinas Siblings will\nhereinafter be referred to by their first names.\n18\n     8 CR 2570 (Instruments 16-18 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2592-600 (Deeds).\n19\n  8 CR 2570 (Instrument 26 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2613-22 (Deed) (providing that “Ines”\nSalinas was a widow by the time of the conveyance—i.e., Juan Salinas was also deceased).\n20\n     7 CR 2322-25.\n21\n     7 CR 2322-25.\n\n                                                3\n1176340\n\facres he was entitled to [approximately 1/12 of 1,134 acres], the 94.5 acres he was\n\nbuying from Leoncio, and the 25 acres of [adjacent] property” that Horacio had\n\npurchased previously from third parties.22 The surface of the Subject Property was\n\nsubsequently surveyed in accordance with that oral agreement.23\n\n          On October 9, 1968, Leoncio deeded to Horacio a tract of land described as\n\n“[a]ll that certain tract set aside, or to be set aside, to Grantor, under that\n\nAgreement heretofore entered into by and between Grantor and Grantee, and their\n\nbrothers and sisters, and more particularly described as follows: . . . Parcel No. 1,\n\ncontaining 214.164 acres of land,” which is then described by metes and bounds.24\n\nThis deed (the “Leoncio-Horacio Deed”) has no mineral reservation and conveyed\n\nParcel 1 “together with all and singular the rights and appurtenances thereto.”25 It\n\nwas intended to convey all of Leoncio’s interest in the Subject Property.26\n\nC.        In December 1968, the nine Salinas Siblings who owned surface interests in\n          the Subject Property entered a Partition Agreement to divide the surface into\n          nine Parcels and divided their mineral interests along the same lines.\n          In December 1968, the nine Salinas Siblings who owned a surface interest\n\n(along with their spouses) memorialized an agreement to partition their respective\n\nrights, title, and interests in the Subject Property (the “Partition Agreement”), and\n\n22\n     8 CR 2770-71 (App. A at ¶¶ 6-8).\n23\n     8 CR 2771 (App. A at ¶ 9); 8 CR 2807 (App. C).\n24\n     7 CR 2326-27 (App. B).\n25\n     See 7 CR 2326-27 (App. B).\n26\n     See 8 CR 2771-72 (App. A at ¶ 11).\n\n                                                4\n1176340\n\fthey recorded it in the Deed Records of Starr County.27 The Partition Agreement\n\ndoes not contain signature lines for Juana or Leoncio.28\n\n          The Partition Agreement sets aside to Horacio the 214.164 acres—i.e.,\n\nParcel 1—that was conveyed to him in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed.29                          The\n\ndescription of Parcel 1 in the Partition Agreement matches the description of\n\nParcel 1 in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed.30                   The Partition Agreement does not\n\npartition Juana’s mineral interests.31              In fact, as Appellants have judicially\n\nadmitted, Juana “and her heirs and assigns have always been treated as undivided\n\ninterest owners under the whole [surface], as it was meant and intended to be.”32\n\n          The Partition Agreement divided the surface of the 1,134 acres into nine\n\nparcels33 and split the signatories’ mineral interests along the new lines, providing:\n\n          It is strictly understood and herein stipulated that this partition\n          agreement is a partition not only of the surface to the tracts\n          hereinafter described, but it is intended by the parties hereto that this\n          partition agreement shall partition all of the rights, title and interest\n          of the respective parties to this agreement in and to the tracts\n          hereinabove described, together with all improvements thereon\n          situated of every kind, character, and description, and it is intended\n          that this partition agreement shall cover and include all of the\n\n27\n   Pl. App. F; see also Appellants’ Brief, n. 29 (explaining that the Partition Agreement was\nultimately signed and filed for recorded in January 1969).\n28\n     See Pl. App. F.\n29\n     Pl.

In 2004, the plaintiffs filed suit to try to undo the deal their parents struck.\n\n          On April 15, 2004, some of the Salinas Siblings’ successors filed this suit to\n\nchallenge the Partition Agreement’s validity, hoping to undo the deal their parents\n\nstruck so they can share in royalties on oil and gas produced from parcels they do\n\nnot own. Later, some of Juana Salinas Garcia’s successors joined the suit, hoping\n\nto undo a deal that does not even affect them. This suit has been ongoing for over\n\nten years now. It is time for the Partition Agreement’s validity to be confirmed\n\nonce and for all. For the reasons below, Appellees urge this Court to do so.\n\n                               SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n          The Partition Agreement went unchallenged for 36 years. During that time\n\nperiod, every Salinas Sibling who signed the Partition Agreement, as well as their\n\nsuccessors, acted as though the Partition Agreement were valid. Some of them\n\nconveyed their interests in the parcels that were allotted to them in the Partition\n\nAgreement. Others invested time and money to construct fences and many other\n\nimprovements on the parcels that were allotted to them in the Partition Agreement.\n\nIn 1995 and 2002, several of them even leased their mineral interests on a divided\n\nbasis and, in doing so, incorporated the Partition Agreement into their leases.\n\n          But 36 years after the Salinas Siblings signed the Partition Agreement and\n\nagreed to the division of parcels therein, some of their children brought suit to try\n\nto undo the deal their parents struck because successful drilling in 2002 revealed\n\nthat the minerals were not distributed evenly among the parcels. Instead, the\n                                              10\n1176340\n\fminerals are located primarily in Parcels 5 and 8.        Appellants who have no\n\nownership interests in Parcel 5 or 8 want to reestablish the undivided mineral\n\ninterests that existed before the Partition Agreement was signed because the post-\n\nagreement developments have made the mineral division more advantageous to\n\nother parties.     But no new facts about the surface have come to light, and\n\nAppellants have no desire to undo the surface division in the Partition Agreement.\n\nSo now they are in the untenable position of wanting to reject the burdens of the\n\nPartition Agreement—divided minerals—and retain its benefits—divided surface.\n\n          The Partition Agreement is valid and enforceable because it was signed by\n\nall of the property owners it affected. Juana and Leoncio were not affected by it\n\nand thus did not have to sign it. In fact, Appellants admit there has been no effect\n\non Juana or her heirs and assigns; therefore, even if the Partition Agreement could\n\nbe construed to affect Juana, her heirs and assigns lack standing to challenge it.\n\nLeoncio conveyed all of his interests to his brother Horacio before the Partition\n\nAgreement was signed, and the remaining siblings ratified that conveyance in the\n\nPartition Agreement itself and thereby effectuated Leoncio’s attempted partition.\n\n          Even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective for lack of certain\n\nsignatures, it would nonetheless bind all Appellants, who fall into three categories:\n\n(1) successors to the original parties to the Partition Agreement; (2) successors to\n\nJuana Garcia Salinas; and (3) successors to Leoncio Salinas by virtue of a\n\n\n                                          11\n1176340\n\fquitclaim deed that Leoncio signed in 1991.53 Anna and Joel Saenz are the only\n\nAppellants in category 3, as Anna is the sole grantee in the 1991 quitclaim deed.54\n\n          Appellants in category 1 cannot deny the binding effect of the Partition\n\nAgreement because they are bound by their predecessors’ and their own conduct\n\nconfirming the Partition Agreement’s validity, by adverse possession, and by their\n\npredecessors’ signatures on the Partition Agreement. They are also bound because\n\nTexas law does not permit them to accept the benefits of the Partition\n\nAgreement—a divided surface—and reject the burdens of the Partition\n\nAgreement—divided minerals. Appellants in category 1 include: (a) Anna and\n\nJoel Saenz, to the extent they claim through Anna’s father, Horacio; (b) Romulo\n\nBenavides, III, who claims through his uncle Ascencio and his mother, Emma;\n\n(c) Leoncio Salinas, who claims through his father, Adan; (d) Luisa Ruiz, who\n\nclaims through her mother, Hermila; and (e) Hermelinda Benavides, Thelma\n\nBenavides Aguilar, and Irma Benavides Cerda, who claim through their mother,\n\nEmma.\n\n          Appellants in category 2, which includes all Appellants not listed in the prior\n\nparagraph, cannot deny the Partition Agreement’s validity because it had no impact\n\non their undivided mineral interest and thus they lack standing to challenge it.\n\n\n\n53\n     8 CR 2573 (Instrument 117 in Thorp’s Abstract).\n54\n     8 CR 2573 (Instrument 117 in Thorp’s Abstract).\n\n                                               12\n1176340\n\f          Appellants in category 3—Anna and Joel Saenz, to the extent they claim\n\nthrough Anna’s uncle Leoncio—cannot deny the Partition Agreement’s validity\n\nbecause the Partition Agreement did not impact Leoncio’s interest in the Subject\n\nProperty. Leoncio conveyed all of his interest in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed,\n\nbefore the Partition Agreement was signed.            Thus, he had no interest to be\n\npartitioned by the Partition Agreement and no interest to convey to Anna in 1991.\n\nIt is perhaps for that reason that Leoncio chose to give a quitclaim deed to Anna, as\n\nopposed to giving her a warranty deed like the Leoncio-Horacio Deed.\n\n          Finally, in the alternative, even if the Court were to determine there is a fact\n\nissue regarding the Partition Agreement, Appellants’ claim for damages as to\n\nSmith Production should be treated as final because Appellants have not\n\nchallenged the summary judgment ground that they have no evidence of damages.\n\n                                       ARGUMENT\nA.        The trial court properly granted Appellees’ motions for summary judgment\n          on at least four grounds, any one of which will suffice to affirm the trial\n          court’s judgment and render judgment for Appellees in this matter.\n\n          1.    The trial court properly granted summary judgment that the Partition\n                Agreement is valid and enforceable because the Partition Agreement\n                was signed by all parties whose interests were affected by it.\n\n          Appellants’ sole basis for attacking the Partition Agreement’s validity is that\n\nJuana and Leoncio did not sign it. That argument is wrong for three reasons. First,\n\nTexas law does not require a partition agreement to be signed by all parties who\n\nhave a mineral interest under the partitioned acreage. Second, Juana did not have\n\n                                             13\n1176340\n\fto sign the Partition Agreement because it had no effect on her mineral interest.\n\nIndeed, because it has had no impact on her mineral interest, her heirs and assigns\n\nlack standing to challenge it in this suit. Third, Leoncio did not have to sign the\n\nPartition Agreement because he conveyed all of his interest in the Subject Property\n\nin the Leoncio-Horacio Deed, before the Partition Agreement was signed, and the\n\nremaining Salinas Siblings signed the Partition Agreement and thereby ratified his\n\nconveyance.\n\n                   a.   Texas law does not require all parties with a mineral interest in\n                        property to join in a partition agreement regarding that property.\n          A partition agreement does not have to be signed by all parties who have a\n\nmineral interest under the partitioned acreage in order to be valid and enforceable.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Texas addressed this very issue in Garza v. De Montalvo.55\n\n          In Garza, ten siblings voluntarily partitioned their interests in land that was\n\ncovered by an oil-and-gas lease.56 Their partition agreement did not reference the\n\noil-and-gas lease, “and Sun Oil Company, which then owned the lease, did not join\n\nin the partition agreement.”57 At the time the agreement was entered (in 1937), “no\n\nwells for oil or gas had been drilled on the leased land.”58 Sun Oil Company began\n\ndrilling in 1942 and, in 1943, began paying royalties in accordance with the\n\n\n55\n     See Garza v.

Likewise, the Partition Agreement’s validity is unaffected by the\n\nnon-joinder of the third parties with an undivided 17/32 of the mineral interest.\n\nAppellants seemingly concede at least that much, as they have not challenged the\n\nPartition Agreement’s validity on the ground it was not signed by the third parties.\n\n\n\n\n59\n     Id. at 990.\n60\n     Id. at 992.\n61\n     See id. at 992.\n62\n     Id.\n\n                                             15\n1176340\n\fJuana should not be treated differently from the third parties. Under the Garza\n\nopinion, none of them needed to sign the Partition Agreement to make it valid.\n\n                 b.     Juana did not need to sign the Partition Agreement because it\n                        does not affect her mineral interest in the Subject Property.\n                        Indeed, she and her heirs and assigns have always been treated\n                        as undivided mineral-interest holders and, for that reason, have\n                        no standing to attack the Partition Agreement’s validity here.\n\n          Juana did not need to sign the Partition Agreement for an additional reason:\n\nit simply did not impact her undivided mineral interest in the Subject Property.\n\n          Partition agreements are binding contracts and, as such, are “subject to the\n\nusual rules of construction to determine their scope and application.”63 Thus, as\n\nwith any other contract, “the primary concern of the court is to ascertain the true\n\nintentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument” itself.64 To achieve this\n\nobjective, the entire contract must be examined and considered “in an effort to\n\nharmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be\n\nrendered meaningless.”65 In other words, all provisions of the written instrument at\n\nissue “must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.”66\n\n          Appellants focus on select provisions of the Partition Agreement to conclude\n\nthat the Partition Agreement “purported to convey all of the mineral interests to the\n\n63\n  Id. at 993; accord Hamilton v.

It did not divest Juana of her\n\nmineral interest, did not divest the third parties of their 17/32 mineral interest, and\n\ncould not divest Leoncio of any interest because he had already conveyed all of his\n\ninterests in the Leoncio-Horacio Deed. The Partition Agreement merely divided\n\nthe possessory interests of its signatories, and thus it does not run afoul of Stradt.\n\n          In Thomas, the plaintiffs—record owners of a 3/35 interest in the land at\n\nissue—claimed that their cotenant, the Houston Oil Company of Texas, had\n\n“brought about a partition by making a sale of a specific portion of the common\n\nestate, which portion was of a value in excess of the value of its pro rata share of\n\nthe estate.”99 The Thomas plaintiffs claimed that the conveyance and partition\n\nbound Houston Oil Company of Texas, and they “invoke[d] the doctrine of\n\nequitable partition as in effect giving them title to that portion of the common\n\nestate that was not conveyed by Houston Oil Company of Texas.”100\n\n          After analyzing cases relating to partitions, the Thomas court held that “the\n\naction of one cotenant in conveying a specific parcel of the commonly owned land\n\n\n98\n     Id. at 190.\n99\n     Thomas, 123 S.W.2d at 292, 294.\n100\n      Id. at 294-95.\n\n                                            25\n1176340\n\fdoes not divest the nonjoining content of his interest in the parcel conveyed and is\n\nnot an effective partition when made, but it will become effective when the court,\n\nafter finding that it can be equitably done, sets apart such tract to the vendee.”101\n\nAnd for reasons inapplicable to this case, the Thomas court held that “the equities\n\nof the case . . .

Even if the Partition Agreement were ineffective due to the lack of\n                    Juana’s and Leoncio’s signatures, summary judgment is proper\n                    because Appellants accepted benefits of the Partition Agreement,\n                    ratified it, acquiesced in it, and are estopped to deny its validity now.\n\n          Appellants have made it abundantly clear that they “do not want to disturb\n\nthe current surface ownership of the [S]ubject [P]roperty.” 104 In fact, they “are\n\n\n101\n      Id. at 299; see also id. at 296-99 (analyzing Texas cases relating to partition).\n102\n      Id. at 295.\n103\n      Id. at 299 (emphasis added to identify text omitted from Appellants’ Brief).\n104\n      10 CR 3493 (Plaintiffs’ Ninth Amended Petition at ¶ 113).\n\n                                                    26\n1176340\n\fwilling to stipulate and agree that, even if the [Partition Agreement] . . . is held to\n\nbe invalid or unenforceable, they will enter into and sign any necessary agreements\n\nto vest title to the surface into the current alleged owners of the surface.”105\n\n            In seeking to uphold the surface division in the Partition Agreement on the\n\none hand, and seeking to undo the mineral division in the Partition Agreement on\n\nthe other hand, Appellants are seeking an outcome that equity does not permit.\n\n            The essence of a partition is that it gives the parties full ownership of\n            something, instead of a prior undivided ownership, and gives it in\n            exchange for surrender of an undivided interest in something else.\n            Equitably speaking, one can no more accept the benefits of a partition\n            while rejecting its burdens than he or she can do so with regard to\n            any contract, deed, or will.106\n\nFor this reason alone, this Court should enforce the Partition Agreement even if it\n\ndetermines that the Partition Agreement is otherwise unenforceable for lack of\n\ncertain signatures.\n\n            Moreover, even if Appellants could accept the portions of the Partition\n\nAgreement they like and reject the rest (which they clearly cannot do), they still\n\ncannot escape the legal effect of the many actions they and their predecessors have\n\ntaken consistent with the Partition Agreement’s validity.

Scurry and the other defendants holding under him [were]\n\nestopped to deny its binding effect as against them.”110 The court continued:\n\n          [T]he . . . allottees ratified as between themselves their voluntary\n          action in making the partition, by each taking possession of the tract\n          set apart to him and making improvements thereon, and by executing\n          ratification deeds to each other respectively, and by severally\n          executing numerous oil and gas leases, royalty deeds, and other\n          conveyances, to third persons. The partition and the respective deeds\n          of confirmation executed by the allottees to each other are void. The\n          action of the allottees, upon being acquiesced in by the nonjoining\n          cotenants, is given the effect, upon the principle of estoppel, of\n          segregating the common lands into separate tracts.

They simply cannot have it both ways.\n\n          Although Appellants suggest they never acted as if the partition of the\n\nmineral estate was valid, the record proves otherwise. Here are some examples.\n\n          • First, as addressed further in Section A(4) below, all nine of the Salinas\n            Siblings who signed the Partition Agreement condoned the division of\n            the mineral estate therein, and that action binds all Appellants who claim\n            through them.\n\n111\n   Id.

It is also well settled that\n          such a partition, even though there be no sufficient record thereof as\n          will give notice to the excluded cotenant, may be proven as an act\n          manifesting an intention on the part of the participating cotenant to\n          oust the other cotenant or repudiate the tenancy relationship with\n          him.131\n\n\n\n\n129\n      King Ranch, Inc. v.

A complete review of the\n\nrecord establishes each element of adverse possession.\n\n          Fausto’s affidavit provides that that the Salinas Sibling took immediate\n\npossession of and “began to construct improvements, fences, wells, and buildings\n\non their respective parcels.”132            The affidavit also provides that Horacio\n\nimmediately sold Parcel 1 to a third party but reserved his mineral rights therein.133\n\n          Important to the oil-and-gas production obtained from Parcels 5 and 8,\n\nFausto’s affidavit provides additional detail about the actions of Fausto’s father,\n\nOctavio, to stake his exclusive claim to Parcel 8, and the actions of Fausto’s uncle,\n\nFlavio, to stake his exclusive claim to Parcel 5.134 They constructed fences and\n\nother improvements, and Fausto and his father have been cultivating, using, and\n\nenjoying Parcel 8 since the Partition Agreement was signed in 1968.135\n\n\n\n\n132\n      7 CR 2362 (App. A at ¶ 12).\n133\n      8 CR 2571 (Instruments 29 in Thorp’s Abstract); 8 CR 2647-51 (Deed).\n134\n      7 CR 2362 (App. A at ¶¶ 14-15).\n135\n      Id. at ¶ 14.\n\n                                               36\n1176340\n\f          In Fausto’s deposition, which is part of the summary judgment record,\n\nFausto gave testimony that is consistent with his affidavit and provides further\n\ndetail about adverse possession. He explained that, after the Partition Agreement\n\nwas executed, a dozer was brought in to clear senderos dividing each of the\n\npartitioned blocks.136 Fences were then erected in the senderos along the survey\n\nline of each parcel, as divided by the Partition Agreement.137 Fausto also testified\n\nthat, from the time the Partition Agreement was signed in 1968 until this lawsuit\n\nwas filed in 2004, title to each parcel was held continuously and peaceably—that\n\nno one ever challenged or questioned the siblings’ or their successors’ individual\n\ntitle in the allotted parcels claimed under the Partition Agreement.138 Fausto’s\n\ndeposition testimony was uncontroverted and establishes adverse possession as a\n\nmatter of law under the ten-year adverse possession statute.139\n\n          In addition to Fausto’s affidavit and deposition testimony, Appellants’ own\n\ninterrogatory responses below provide evidence of adverse possession. In response\n\nto Interrogatory 7, which asked Appellants whether they occupied any portion of\n\nthe Subject Property and asked them to describe any such occupation, they wrote:\n\n\n\n136\n    See, e.g., 7 CR 2363-87, at 36:7-13 (going so far as to identify the foreman and dozer driver\nwho cut the senderos, Lee Walker and Felix Flores). Fausto further identified which of the\nsiblings drilled water wells on their allotted parcels.

Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 16.026(a) (West 2002).\n\n                                               37\n1176340\n\f          Leoncio [son of Adan Salinas], Romulo [nephew of Ascencio\n          Salinas], and Hermelinda [daughter of Emma Salinas] own and\n          occupy a portion of the surface. Leoncio and his family have put an\n          extensive amount of time and hard work . . . into this property . . . .\n          There have been new fences, lines, sheds, corrals, water\n          improvements and other projects on the property. Leoncio has been\n          living on the property since his father passed away in 1998. Romulo’s\n          surface has a house, corrals, fencing, and water wells. Hermelinda’s\n          surface has fencing and water well improvements. Surface uses are\n          residential, agricultural, hunting, livestock and recreational.140\n\nAnd in response to Interrogatory 8, which asked whether Appellants’ predecessors\n\never occupied any portion of the Subject Property, Appellants wrote: “yes, some\n\npredecessors in interest of the Plaintiffs [Appellants] occupied the property dating\n\nall the way back to Juan and Ines Salinas.”141\n\n          Tellingly, although Appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthey offer no rebutting evidence. Indeed, they have asserted repeatedly that they\n\nare not trying to disturb the long-recognized division of the surface.142 But that\n\nsurface use is exactly what establishes adverse possession in the event the Partition\n\nAgreement did not bind all of the contested interests in the Subject Property.\n\n                   c.    Even if Ana Saenz “consented” to the use of the surface by the\n                         siblings and their successors, her consent could not have been\n                         granted until after the 10-year statute of limitations had expired.\n\n          Appellants contend that the trial court improperly excluded the affidavit of\n\nAppellant Anna Saenz and her claim that she consented to the use of the divided\n\n140\n      8 CR 2778.\n141\n      8 CR 2779.\n142\n      Appellants’ Brief at 8.\n\n                                               38\n1176340\n\fparcels by her parents’ siblings. But that claim is contradicted by Anna’s own\n\ndeposition testimony that nobody asked for her consent to go onto their land.143\n\nShe even admitted that she did not own any interest in the surface of the Subject\n\nProperty and that people with surface ownership, such as Fausto Salinas (Octavio\n\nSalinas’s son), did not need to share the benefits resulting from their ownership.144\n\n          Anna did not obtain any potential interest in any portion of the Subject\n\nProperty until 1989, when her father Horacio died intestate and she inherited his\n\ninterest in Parcel 1 of the Subject Property.145 Accordingly, any “consent” that\n\nAnna gave before 1989 would have been useless. Indeed, in both of the consent\n\ncases that Appellants cite, the permission to use the property that barred adverse\n\npossession came from a party claiming record title, not a third party.146 Thus,\n\nduring the time period that is relevant here, Anna’s “consent” had no effect.\n\n          Anna obtained her alleged interest in the Subject Property 21 years after the\n\nPartition Agreement was signed—i.e., approximately 11 years after the 10-year\n\nstatute of limitations had expired and the Salinas Siblings and their successors had\n\n\n\n\n143\n      8 CR 2799.\n144\n      8 CR 2800-02.\n145\n      8 CR 2553, 2792.\n146\n   See Villareal v.

At a minimum, summary judgment is proper as against the parties\n                     who joined in the Partition Agreement, as well as their successors.\n\n          A longstanding rule in Texas is that parties who join in a partition agreement\n\nare bound by the agreement, even if the agreement is determined to be void due to\n\nthe non-joinder of cotenants in the partitioned property. For example, in Joyner,\n\nthe plaintiffs, who were cotenants of partitioned property, sued Scurry Christian,\n\nclaiming they were left out of a partition agreement between Scurry and his\n\nsiblings.148 The Supreme Court of Texas held that, even though the agreement was\n\nvoid due to non-joinder of the cotenants, “Scurry and the other defendants holding\n\nunder him [were] estopped to deny its binding effect as against them.”149 The court\n\nreinforced and clarified that rule in Republic Production Co. v. Lee, holding: “Even\n\nif the instruments of conveyance [in the partition proceeding at issue] were void,\n\nthe partition was nonetheless valid as to those who participated therein.”150\n\n\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span>\n      <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Likewise, their successors\n\ncannot undo the deal that the Salinas Siblings struck in the Partition Agreement.\n\n          Thus, at a minimum, summary judgment is proper against (a) Anna and Joel\n\nSaenz, to the extent they claim through Anna’s father, Horacio; (b) Romulo\n\nBenavides, III, who claims through his uncle Ascencio and his mother, Emma;\n\n(c) Leoncio Salinas, who claims through his father, Adan; (d) Luisa Ruiz, who\n\nclaims through her mother, Hermila; and (e) Hermelinda Benavides, Thelma\n\nBenavides Aguilar, and Irma Benavides Cerda, who claim through their mother,\n\nEmma.\n\nB.        Even if there were a fact question relating to the Partition Agreement,\n          Appellants’ claim for damages in their trespass-to-try title action should be\n          treated as final because Appellants have not challenged or briefed the\n          summary judgment ground that they have no evidence of such damages.\n          In the underlying trespass-to-try-title action, Appellants (as plaintiffs) sought\n\nboth “an order quieting title to the disputed property and damages to compensate\n\nthem for all [alleged] unlawful conduct of defendants, including all actual, special,\n\nconsequential, and incidental damages.”151 Smith Production moved for summary\n\njudgment on multiple grounds, including that “Plaintiffs have no evidence . . . of\n\n\n\n\n151\n    10 CR 3495-96 (Plaintiffs’ Ninth Amended Petition at ¶ 116(e). Plaintiffs in trespass-to-try-\ntitle actions are entitled to seek damages and to recover them if they prove entitlement to them.\nSee, e.g., Tex. Prop. Code Ann. §§ 22.021(d), 22.022 (West 2014); Tex. R. Civ. P. 783(f), 805.\n\n                                               41\n1176340\n\fany damages.”152            The trial court granted all Appellees’ summary judgment\n\nmotions without specifying the grounds on which it was ruling.153 The trial court\n\nthen entered a final judgment and ordered that the “Partition Agreement . . . is\n\nhereby declared to be valid and enforceable for all purposes as to all parties to this\n\nsuit” and that “Plaintiffs take nothing by their suit against all Defendants.”154\n\n          “When, as in the present case, a movant asserts multiple grounds for\n\nsummary judgment, and the trial court does not specify in the order the ground on\n\nwhich summary judgment was granted, the nonmovant must negate all grounds on\n\nappeal.” 155 Appellants have acknowledged this requirement in their own Brief.156\n\n          Appellants have not challenged or briefed Smith Production’s summary\n\njudgment ground that Appellants lack evidence of the damages sought in their\n\ntrespass-to-try-title action.         Thus, they cannot complain about those damages on\n\nappeal, and the trial court’s judgment on those damages should be affirmed even if\n\nthis Court determines there is a fact issue relating to the Partition Agreement.157\n\n\n152\n      8 CR 2843 (Smith Production’s Motion for Summary Judgment at 6).\n153\n      Appellants’ Brief at 13 (citing Pl.

The\n\nPartition Agreement was signed by all of the parties who were affected. The only\n\nreason Appellants want to undo the Partition Agreement now is because drilling\n\nthat began about 34 years after its execution revealed that its division of mineral\n\ninterests is more advantageous to other parties than it is to many of the Appellants.\n\nThere is no rule of construction that permits the unambiguous language in the\n\nPartition Agreement to be departed from because its application to facts that\n\ndeveloped after its execution results in unequal benefits to some of its signatories’\n\nsuccessors and other parties. Moreover, Texas law prohibits what Appellants seek\n\nhere, which is an acceptance of the portions of the Partition Agreement they like—\n\ndivided surface—and a rejection of the portions they dislike—divided minerals.\n\n          WHEREFORE Appellees pray that this Court affirm the judgment below\n\nand grant to them such further relief to which they may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         43\n1176340\n\f          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                SCOTT, DOUGLASS, &\n                MCCONNICO, L.L.P.\n                303 Colorado Street, Suite 2400\n                Austin, Texas 78701-2589\n                (512) 495-6300\n                (512) 495-6399 Fax\n\n          By: /s/ Kennon L.

I was born on July 2, 1935. I am, therefore, over 21 years of age, I am competent\nto make this affidavit, I have never been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and\nI have personal knowledge of all facts stated herein and they are true and correct.\n\n2.    References will be made in this affidavit to instruments of record in Starr County,\nTexas, as shown on the Abstract of Title filed by Thorp Petroleum Corporation (\"Thorp's\nAbstract\").\n\n3.      My father, Octavio Salinas, was one of 12 children of Juan and Ynes Salinas. Juan\nN. Salinas and Ynes Salinas owned a tract of approximately 1,284 acres in Porciones 38,\n39 and 40, ancient jurisdiction of Reynosa, Starr County, Texas, referred to herein as \"the\nproperty.\" In 1964, my grandparents made a deed (item 12 in Thorp's Abstract) to my\nfather, Octavio Salinas, of 150 acres in the northeast corner of the property. Later in 1964,\nmy grandparents made a gift deed to each of their children of an undivided 1/12 interest\nin the remainder of the property (\"1964 Gift Deed,\" item 14 in Thorp's Abstract). The net\nacreage conveyed was 1,134 acres.\n\n4.    There were mineral interests in the property that my grandparents did not own.\nThus, all of the minerals are not owned by Plaintiffs and Defendants.\n\n5.      I was employed in the oil field business up until 1966 when I started farming some\nof the above referred to property together with my father. My grandfather was aware of the\nfact that his children would eventually divide up the 1,134 acres of land, and before he died\nin 1967. I remember hearing my grandfather express his desire that the ranch house be\nset aside for Esther Salinas and Ascencio Salinas, two of his children, neither of whom\nwere married, and who lived there.\n\n6.     After my grandfather died and before December of 1968, I was present on several\noccasions when my aunts and uncles met to discuss how they were going to divide the\n1,134 acres. Some of them had expressed desires as to where they wanted their portion\nof the 1,134 acres to be located, and essentially, all of my aunts and uncles had no\ndisagreement where each was to receive his or her part of the 1,134 acres. During those\ndiscussions between my aunts and my uncles, I remember that they discussed the fact\nthey had always agreed that if Esther died before Ascencio, that her interest would go to\nhim. My aunt Ester died without a will, unmarried and without ever having had any children.\nMy grandmother, my father and all surviving aunts and uncles joined in a deed (item 26 in\nThorp's Abstract) to my uncle Ascencio Salinas conveying the interest they inherited from\nEster.\n\n7.    In September of 1968, I went with my father to Raymondville, Texas where we met\n\f\fwith Juana Salinas, his sister. My father, Octavio Salinas, had previously made an\nagreement with her to buy her 94.5 acres, which was her part of the 1,134 acres.\nHowever, she did not want to sell her minerals. She preferred to retain her mineral interest\nunder the 1,134 acres. While in Raymondville, Juana Salinas and her husband, signed a\ndeed to my father and I was a witness to her husband's mark on the deed.\n\n8.      I also remember that my uncles, Horacio and Adan Salinas, had each purchased\n25 acres from the Margo's, which was located adjacent to the lands which Hermila was to\nreceive in the partition. All of my aunts and uncles, including Hermila, agreed that Adan\nand Horacio would get an additional 25 acres adjacent to their pro rata part of the 1,134\nacres and in exchange, Hermila would get the 50 acre Margo tract as part of her 94.5\nacres. They agreed that Adan would get his acreage in the northwest corner where he\nbuilt his house. Adan had already been deeded 92.6 acres in the northwest corner when\nthe partition survey was done. The survey of Adan's 94.5 acres, therefore, included the\n92.6 acres which he had already acquired, and that with the 25 acres he had purchased\nfrom the Margo's, made his total surveyed acres 119.5 acres. They agreed that Horacio\nwould get his acreage in the southeast corner and it was understood that Horacio was\nbuying Leoncio's interest so that Horacio would be receiving 214 acres, being made up of\nthe 94.5 acres he was entitled to, the 94.5 acres he was buying from Leoncio, and,the 25\nacres of the Margo property. They also agreed that Octavio would get his property adjacent\nto the 150 acres he already owned, and it was also understood that he had purchased\nJuana's interest in the surface. Therefore, he would be getting his 94.5 acres, Juana's 94.5\nacres, and the 150 acres which he already owned. He would, therefore, be entitled to 339\nacres. Those instructions were given to the surveyor so that those parcels could be\nsurveyed.\n\n9.     After all of my aunts and uncles agreed on where each would receive his or her\nproperty, I heard my uncle Horacio say that he was going to employ the county surveyor,\nElias Aguilar, to survey each tract that each of my aunts and uncles was to receive. I\nremember being at the ranch when Elias Aguilar and his crew were there surveying.\n\n10. After the surveys were completed, probably in December 1968, my father and I, and\nuncle Horacio, and one or two other uncles went to the office of John Pope III and they\nemployed John Pope Ili to prepare a partition agreement. Everyone who signed it knew\nthat Juana and Leoncio were not signing the instrument, and all of them knew the minerals,\nexcept for Juana's, were being divided, I had heard this discussed in the family meetings\nand get-togethers I attended. At those meetings, some of the siblings wanted to keep the\nminerals undivided, others wanted to divide them along with the surface rights. In the end,\nthose who wanted to divide up the Salinas mineral rights prevailed, and they signed the\npartition agreement, dated December 27, 1968 (item 27 in Thorp's Abstract), in which they\nall agreed to divide the minerals so that the minerals were with the surface which each\nreceived.\n\n11. In November of 1968, I, together with Bet° Salinas and a couple of other friends,\nhad a conversation with Leonicio Salinas. I knew that my father and I were interested in\nacquiring as much of the 1,134 acres that we could, so I asked Leonicio if he would be\nwilling to sell us the acreage which he would be getting in the partition. He told me at that\n\n                                             2\n\ftime, that he had already sold everything he would be getting in the partition to my uncle\nHoracio and that he had nothing else left to sell. I subsequently learned that in October of\n1968, Leonicio had signed a deed to Horacio Salinas. Leoncio has never made a claim to\nany of the surface or minerals under the 1,134 acres that I am aware of.\n\n12. After the agreement of partition was signed, the parties immediately began and\ncontinued exclusive possession. Many began to construct improvements, fences, wells,\nand buildings on their respective parcels. My uncle Horacio immediately sold his 214-acre\nParcel 1 to Eusebio Solis, reserving all his mineral rights (item 29 in Thorp's Abstract).\n\n13. My uncle Flavio Salinas immediately went into possession of his Parcel 5,\nconstructing fences and other improvements thereon. His possession and that of his\nchildren (Elodia, since his death has been continuous, actual, visible and hostile to any\nother claim to Parcel 5, using and enjoying said parcel exclusively. Before suit was filed\nby Anna Saenz in 2004, no one had ever asserted any claim to Parcel 5 except Flavio\nSalinas and his heirs and successors.\n\n14. My father immediately went into exclusive possession of his Parcel 8, constructing\nfences and other improvements. Since 1968, continuing until the present time, my father,\nmyself and my sisters have continued to be and remain in continuous, actual, and visible\npossession of Parcel 8, cultivating, using and enjoying said parcel exclusively. Our\npossession was hostile to and did not recognize any claim to said land as being superior\nto our own. Before suit was filed by Anna Saenz in 2004, no one had ever asserted any\nclaim to Parcel 8 except Octavio Salinas and his heirs and successors.\n\n15. My sisters, Rosalinda Balderas and Elda Salinas Ponce, and my nieces, Cindy\nReyna, Veronica Campbell, and Linda Mandes, and I are now the sole owners and in\nexclusive possession of all of the surface of Parcel 8 and all but Juana Salinas Garcia's\nshare of the Salinas mineral interest therein, and of all of the surface of the 150 acres and\nall of the Salinas mineral interest therein.\n\n16.     My uncle Adan had already built his house on his tract because a long time before\nthe partition deed, he knew what tract he was going to eventually get. From the time of the\npartition, my aunts and uncles or their heirs or grantees have been in possession of those\ntracts. Until the filing of this suit, 36 years after the partition, none of the 12 siblings or their\nheirs ever contested the possession or ownership of surface or minerals of those who\nsigned the partition agreement.\n\n                                                                              f\n                                                               ef:->\n                                                     FAUSTO SALINAS\n\n      SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN              BEFOR ME, the undersigned authority, by the\nsaid FAUSTO SALINAS, on this             ay of                     , 2010, to certify\nwhich witness my hand and official seal of office. /\n                                                        .11,           L,tik\n                                                     NOTA • Y P         C, STATE OF TEXAS\n\n                                                 3\n                                                                                                        0 rs4 I—)\n                                                                                                                    .<4\n\fAPPENDIX B\n\f                                                                            EE\n         Fit.k.
