Schember argued the cause and filed the briefs \nfor appellant.\n\n     William E. Persina, Attorney, Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority, argued the cause for the appellee.  With him on \nthe brief were David M. Smith, Solicitor, and William R. \nTobey, Deputy Solicitor.\n\n\f     Before:  Tatel and Garland, Circuit Judges, and Williams, \nSenior Circuit Judge.\n\n     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Tatel.\n\n     Tatel, Circuit Judge:  This case presents a straightforward \nquestion of statutory interpretation:  Does the statute that \ngives federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review decisions \nof the Federal Labor Relations Authority \"other than ... \norder[s] ... involving an appropriate unit determination,\" \nleave district courts free to review such determinations pursu-\nant to the Administrative Procedure Act?  Answering no, we \naffirm the district court's dismissal of this challenge to an \nappropriate unit determination.\n\n                                I.\n\n     National Guard \"dual status technicians\" (mechanics, ma-\nchinists, and supply technicians) are federal employees who, \npursuant to the National Guard Technicians Act (NGTA), 32 \nU.S.C. s 709, are separately employed and supervised by the \nAdjutant General of their respective State Guards.  As a \ncondition of employment, they must maintain membership in \nthe state unit of the National Guard for which they work.  Id. \ns 709(b).  For collective bargaining purposes, dual status \ntechnicians are represented by appellant, the Association of \nCivilian Technicians.  Though a national union, the Associa-\ntion bargains separately on behalf of each state-based unit.\n\n     This case began when the Association filed a petition with \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking to have dual \nstatus technician bargaining units consolidated into a single, \nnational unit.  The Federal Labor Relations Act (FLRA) \ndirects the Authority to determine whether unit determina-\ntion petitions are \"appropriate,\" based on such factors as \nwhether the determination \"will ensure a clear and identifi-\nable community of interest among the employees in the unit \nand will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the \noperations of the agency involved.\"  5 U.S.C. s 7112(a).  Ap-\nplying these standards, the Authority's Regional Director \ndenied the petition.  On review, the Authority acknowledged \nthat some evidence--particularly the \"interchange\" of techni-\n\n\fcians among State Guards--supported the appropriateness of \nthe proposed national unit.  The Authority, however, affirmed \nthe Regional Director's conclusion that more evidence justi-\nfied maintaining state-based units:  Each National Guard \nstate unit has \"an individual mission unique to its state or \nterritory\";  the NGTA invests Adjutants General with \"overall \nauthority over all personnel and labor relations matters in \ntheir respective State Activities\";  and national collective bar-\ngaining would be ineffective because \"authority over the day-\nto-day employment of the technicians ... is designated by \nstatute to the states.\"  The Association urged the Authority \nto consider the increased bargaining rights that consolidation \nwould purportedly bring to union members, but the agency \ndeclined to do so, agreeing with the Regional Director that \nthe statutory obligation to \"ensure employees the fullest \nfreedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this chap-\nter,\" id., applies only to units already determined to be \nappropriate.  On the basis of this analysis, the Authority \ndenied the petition for review.\n\n     Invoking section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act--\n\"[a] person ... aggrieved by agency action ... is entitled to \njudicial review thereof,\" id. s 702--the Association sued the \nAuthority in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia, arguing that the unit determination was \"arbi-\ntrary [and] capricious,\" id. s 706(a)(2)(A).  The district court \ndismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, relying on FLRA \nsection 7123:  \"Any person aggrieved by any final order of the \n[Federal Labor Relations] Authority other than an order \nunder ... section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate \nunit determination), may ... institute an action for judicial \nreview of the Authority's order in the [appropriate] United \nStates court of appeals.\"  Id. s 7123(a) (emphasis added).  \nThe district court concluded that this exception deprives not \njust courts of appeals, but all federal courts, of jurisdiction to \nreview appropriate unit determinations.\n\n     The Association appeals.  Our review is de novo.  Nat'l \nTaxpayers Union v. United States, 68 F.3d 1428, 1432 (D.C. \nCir. 1995) (\"In a case ... involving a District Court's dismiss-\n\n\fal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, our \nstandard of review is de novo.\").\n\n                               II.\n\n     Notwithstanding eighty-two pages of briefing, this case is \nnot difficult.  FLRA section 7123 gives courts of appeals \njurisdiction to review Authority decisions \"other than ... \norder[s] under ... section 7112 of this title (involving an \nappropriate unit determination).\"  5 U.S.C. s 7123(a).  The \nAPA expressly provides that its general review provisions, \npursuant to which the Association filed this suit, do not apply \nwhere \"statutes preclude judicial review.\"  Id. s 701(a)(1);  cf. \nid. s 702 (\"Nothing herein ... confers authority to grant \nrelief if any other statute that grants consent to suit express-\nly or impliedly forbids the relief ... sought.\").  Because \nFLRA section 7123 \"precludes judicial review\" of appropriate \nunit determinations, the district court properly held that it \nlacked jurisdiction to hear this case.\n\n     Pointing out that FLRA section 7123 mentions only \"courts \nof appeals,\" the Association insists that the provision does not \nbar district courts from reviewing appropriate unit determi-\nnations.  Like the district court, we disagree.  We cannot \nimagine that Congress, having vested in courts of appeals \nexclusive jurisdiction to review all Authority decisions except \nthose relating to appropriate unit determinations, would have \nintended that such determinations could nevertheless be re-\nviewed by district courts.  See Columbia Power Trades \nCouncil v. United States Dep't of Energy, 671 F.2d 325, 327 \n(9th Cir. 1982) (\"At no point does the Act entitle a party to \npetition a district court for relief.  Given the broad purpose of \nthe Act[,] ... and the limited role of the judiciary in this \nstatutory scheme, it is manifestly the expressed desire of \nCongress to create an exclusive statutory scheme.\") (footnote \nomitted).\n\n     Although FLRA section 7123's clarity makes resort to \nlegislative history unnecessary, we think it worth noting that \nthe Joint Committee Report on the bill that became the \nFLRA declared:  \"As in the private sector, there will be no \n\n\fjudicial review of the Authority's determination of the appro-\npriateness of bargaining units.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717, at \n153 (1978).  The Report does not say that there will be \"no \ncircuit court review\";  it says there will be \"no judicial re-\nview.\"  Moreover, the Joint Committee's comparison to the \n\"private sector\" demonstrates that Congress had in mind a \nreview scheme identical to the NLRB's, and the Supreme \nCourt has determined that the National Labor Relations Act's \npreclusion of direct court of appeals review of certain matters \nalso bars district court APA review.  See NLRB v. United \nFood & Commercial Workers Union, Local 23, 484 U.S. 112, \n133 (1987).  \"It would be absurd,\" the Supreme Court de-\nclared, to allow district court review of settlement determina-\ntions when the NLRA expressly precludes direct review of \nsuch determinations in courts of appeals.  Id.\n\n     In holding that FLRA section 7123 precludes direct review \nof Authority appropriate unit determinations, we emphasize \nthat the Association remains free to obtain indirect judicial \nreview by refusing to bargain, drawing an unfair labor prac-\ntice charge, and appealing that charge to the Authority and \nthen to a court of appeals.  See, e.g., Dep't of Energy v. \nFLRA, 880 F.2d 1163, 1163-65, 1164 n.3 (10th Cir. 1989) \n(reviewing the Authority's unit determination in the context \nof an unfair labor practice proceeding).  It is in this way, as \nthe Joint Committee indicated, see supra at 4-5, that the \nFLRA parallels the NLRA.  The Association claims that the \nexistence of this indirect method of review implies that direct \nreview should be available as well, but we rejected a virtually \nidentical argument in Physicians National House Staff Ass'n \nv. Fanning, where a union sought APA review of an NLRB \ndenial of a certification petition.  642 F.2d 492, 495 (D.C. Cir. \n1980).  Pointing out that the denial occurred in the course of \nan unreviewable representation proceeding, we rejected the \nunion's argument that the district court nevertheless had \njurisdiction because the union's only other means of review \nwas through an onerous unfair labor practice proceeding.  \nOur analysis in Fanning applies here as well:\n\n\f     [I]t may be unlikely that the correctness of these deci-\n     sions may be tested in an unfair labor practice proceed-\n     ing reviewable in a court of appeals, but we think this is \n     not a reason to permit District Court review.  Congress \n     has considered the likelihood that some Board decisions \n     in representation proceedings may evade all judicial re-\n     view.  Nevertheless, it has rejected attempts to provide \n     review in such cases.\n     \nId. at 499.\n\n     Undeterred by all this \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \nCongressional intent to preclude judicial review, Abbott Labs. \nv. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted), the Association offers four unper-\nsuasive arguments in support of its belief that the district \ncourt nevertheless had jurisdiction to entertain its challenge \nto the appropriate-unit determination in this case.  Citing a \nSupreme Court case, McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, \nInc., 498 U.S. 479 (1991), and a decision of this circuit, \nCrowley Caribbean Transportation, Inc. v. PeNa, 37 F.3d 671 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994), the Association first argues that two aspects \nof the Authority's decision amount to \"broad legal interpreta-\ntion[s]\" that the district court had jurisdiction to review even \nthough they were embedded in an otherwise unreviewable \ndecision.  Appellant's Opening Br. at 24.  The \"broad legal \ndeterminations\" the Association has in mind are the Authori-\nty's holding that the NGTA invests Adjutants General with \nresponsibility for personnel and labor relations matters in \ntheir respective state activities, and the agency's finding that \nan increase in employee rights resulting from consolidation is \nnot a relevant factor in appropriate unit determinations.  The \nSupreme Court, however, has generally rejected \"the princi-\nple that if the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise \nunreviewable action, the action becomes reviewable.\"  Inter-\nstate Commerce Comm'n v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs, 482 \nU.S. 270, 283 (1987) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Although the cases the Association cites reveal \nlimited exceptions to this principle, those exceptions are \ninapplicable here.  In McNary, the Supreme Court held that \n\n\fa district court could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over \na general due process challenge to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service's administration of \"Special Agricultur-\nal Worker\" status, even though the controlling statute made \nindividual status determinations unreviewable.  498 U.S. at \n494.  Just because district courts may in some cases review \ngeneric, constitutional challenges to otherwise unreviewable \nagency actions hardly means that the district court in this \ncase had jurisdiction over the Association's non-constitutional, \nindividualized claim.  Nor does our assumption in Crowley \nthat a district court might have jurisdiction over an agency's \narticulation of its general enforcement policy, 37 F.3d at 677, \nsupport the Association's argument that district courts may \nreview any agency legal interpretation made in the context of \notherwise unreviewable individual adjudications.  On the con-\ntrary, Crowley echoes the Supreme Court's \"square[ ] re-\nject[ion of] the notion of carving reviewable legal rulings out \nfrom the middle of non-reviewable actions.\"  Id. at 676 (citing \nBhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs, 482 U.S. at 283).\n\n     The Association next argues that the Authority's findings \nregarding the scope of Adjutant General responsibility and \nthe relevance of increased employee rights are reviewable \npursuant to the \"rule\" giving federal courts authority to \nreview agency decisions that \"erroneously disclaim jurisdic-\ntion to enforce the law[.]\"  Appellant's Opening Br. at 33.  In \nsupport of this proposition, the Association cites a Ninth \nCircuit decision, Montana Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA, 898 \nF.2d 753 (1990).  That case, however, as well as a similar \ndecision of this circuit, International Longshoremen's Ass'n \nv. National Mediation Board, 785 F.2d 1098, 1100 (D.C. Cir. \n1986), held that agency nonenforcement decisions, normally \nunreviewable, see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985), \nmay be reviewed if they rest on the agency's erroneous belief \nthat it lacks jurisdiction.  That rule does not apply here, for \nthe Authority neither disclaimed jurisdiction nor declined to \nenforce the FLRA.  On the contrary, the agency affirmative-\nly exercised its statutory jurisdiction, evaluated the merits of \nthe consolidation petition, and concluded that the proposed \nunit was not appropriate.\n\n\f     Third, the Association attempts to bring this case within \nthe ambit of Adams v. Richardson, which held that district \ncourts may exercise jurisdiction over agency action that \namounts to \"an abdication of ... Congress' clear statement of \nan affirmative enforcement duty.\"  480 F.2d 1159, 1162 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  Citing the agency's same two rulings about \nAdjutant General responsibility and the relevance of in-\ncreased bargaining rights, the Association argues that the \nAuthority abdicated its responsibility \"to determine appropri-\nate bargaining units\" and \"to enforce [the] mandate of [sec-\ntion 7112 of the Act].\"  Appellant's Opening Br. at 34-35.  In \nour view, these two rulings do not come close to the \"abdica-\ntion\" that justified district court jurisdiction in Adams.  In \nthat case, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare \ndeclined to enforce an entire statutory scheme, Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964.  Adams, 480 F.2d at 1161.  The \nevidence showed that the Secretary, in violation of an unam-\nbiguous statutory directive that HEW \"effectuate the provi-\nsions of ... this title,\" 42 U.S.C. s 2000d-1, failed to take \nappropriate action to terminate federal funding to segregated \nschool systems, a failure we called \"a dereliction of duty,\" \nAdams, 480 F.2d at 1163.  The record in this case reflects no \nsuch dereliction.  As we indicated above, the Authority exer-\ncised jurisdiction over the consolidation petition and ruled \nagainst the Association.  The Association's claim that the \nagency abdicated its enforcement responsibility represents \nnothing more than substantive disagreement with the agen-\ncy's legal rulings.\n\n     Finally, the Association argues that the Authority's ruling \namounts to the kind of \"open violation of statutory authority\" \nthat the Supreme Court found reviewable in Leedom v. Kyne, \n358 U.S. 184, 188 (1958). \"The invocation of Leedom jurisdic-\ntion,\" we have emphasized, \"is extraordinary;  to justify such \njurisdiction, there must be a specific provision of the Act \nwhich, although it is clear and mandatory, was nevertheless \nviolated by the [agency].\"  Council of Prison Locals v. Brew-\ner, 735 F.2d 1497, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  In this case, the Association \npoints to no clear violation of an unambiguous statutory \n\n\fprovision.  Instead, its arguments--that the Authority openly \nviolated the clear mandate of the Act by determining that the \nNGTA prohibits nationwide consolidation of bargaining units \nand (again) by failing to include increased bargaining rights \nas a factor in its decision--merely repeat its disagreement \nwith the agency's ruling.  This falls well short of the require-\nments for Leedom jurisdiction.  \"That the [agency] may have \nmade an error of fact or law is insufficient;  the [agency] must \nhave acted without statutory authority.\"  Fanning, 642 F.2d \nat 496.\n\n     The dismissal of this case for want of jurisdiction is af-\nfirmed.\n\n                                                             So ordered.\n\n                                                       ",

Applying these standards, the Authority's Regional Director denied the petition. On review, the Authority acknowledged that some evidence &#8212; particularly the \"interchange\" of technicians among State Guards &#8212; supported the appropriateness of the proposed national unit.

Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the Association offers four unpersuasive arguments in support of its belief that the district court nevertheless had jurisdiction to entertain its challenge to the appropriate-unit determination in this case. Citing a Supreme Court case, <i>McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.,</i> 498 U.S. 479, 111 S.Ct. 888, 112 L.Ed.2d 1005 (1991), and a decision of this circuit, <i>Crowley Caribbean Transportation, Inc. v. Pe&#241;a,</i> 37 F.3d 671 (D.C.Cir. 1994), the Association first argues that two aspects of the Authority's decision amount to \"broad legal interpretation[s]\" that the district court had jurisdiction to review even though they were embedded in an otherwise unreviewable decision. Appellant's Opening Br. at 24. The \"broad legal determinations\" the Association has in mind are the Authority's holding that the NGTA invests Adjutants General with responsibility for personnel and labor relations matters in their respective state activities, and the agency's finding that an increase in employee rights resulting from consolidation is not a relevant factor in appropriate unit determinations. The Supreme Court, however, has generally rejected \"the principle that if the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise unreviewable action, the action becomes reviewable.\" <i>Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs,</i> 482 U.S. 270, 283, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Although the cases the Association cites reveal limited exceptions to this principle, those exceptions are inapplicable here. In <i>McNary,</i> the Supreme Court held that a district court could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a general due process challenge to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's administration of \"Special Agricultural Worker\" status, even though the controlling statute made individual status determinations unreviewable. 498 U.S. at 494, 111 S.Ct. 888. Just because district courts may in some cases review generic, constitutional challenges to otherwise unreviewable agency actions hardly means that the district court in this case had jurisdiction over the Association's non-constitutional, individualized claim. Nor does our assumption in <i>Crowley</i> that a district court might have jurisdiction over an agency's articulation of its general enforcement policy, 37 F.3d at 677, support the Association's argument that district courts may review any agency legal interpretation made in the context of otherwise unreviewable individual adjudications. On the contrary, <i>Crowley</i> echoes the Supreme Court's \"square[ ] reject[ion of] the notion of carving reviewable legal rulings out from the middle of non-reviewable actions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 676 (citing <i>Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs,</i> 482 U.S. at 283, 107 S.Ct. 2360).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Association next argues that the Authority's findings regarding the scope of Adjutant General responsibility and the relevance of increased employee rights are reviewable pursuant to the \"rule\" giving federal courts authority to review agency decisions that \"erroneously disclaim jurisdiction to enforce the law[.]\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 33. In support of this proposition, the Association cites a Ninth Circuit decision, <i>Montana Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA,</i> 898 F.2d 753 (1990). That case, however, as well as a similar decision of this circuit, <i>International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. National Mediation Board,</i> 785 F.2d 1098, 1100 (D.C.Cir.1986), held that agency <i>nonenforcement</i> decisions, normally unreviewable, <i>see Heckler v. Chaney,</i> 470 U.S. 821, 832, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985), may be reviewed if they rest on the agency's erroneous belief that it lacks jurisdiction. That rule does not apply here, for the Authority neither disclaimed jurisdiction nor declined to enforce the FLRA. On the contrary, the agency affirmatively exercised its statutory jurisdiction, evaluated the merits of the consolidation petition, and concluded that the proposed unit was not appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Association attempts to bring this case within the ambit of <i>Adams v. Richardson,</i> which held that district courts may exercise jurisdiction over agency action that amounts to \"an abdication of ... Congress' clear statement of an affirmative enforcement duty.\" 480 F.2d 1159, 1162 (D.C.Cir.1973). Citing the agency's same two rulings about Adjutant General responsibility and the relevance of increased bargaining rights, the Association argues that the Authority abdicated its responsibility \"to determine appropriate bargaining units\" and \"to enforce [the] mandate of [section 7112 of the Act].\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 34-35. In our view, these two rulings do not come close to the \"abdication\" that justified district court jurisdiction in <i>Adams.</i> In that case, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare declined to enforce an entire statutory scheme, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <i>Adams,</i> 480 F.2d at 1161. The evidence showed that the Secretary, in violation of an unambiguous statutory directive that HEW \"effectuate the provisions of ... this title,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-1, failed to take appropriate action to terminate federal funding to segregated school systems, a failure we called \"a dereliction of duty,\" <i>Adams,</i> 480 F.2d at 1163. The record in this case reflects no such dereliction. As we indicated above, the Authority exercised jurisdiction over the consolidation petition and ruled against the Association. The Association's claim that the agency abdicated its enforcement responsibility represents nothing more than substantive disagreement with the agency's legal rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Association argues that the Authority's ruling amounts to the kind of \"open violation of statutory authority\" that the Supreme Court found reviewable in <i>Leedom v. Kyne,</i> 358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958). \"The invocation of <i>Leedom</i> jurisdiction,\" we have emphasized, \"is extraordinary; to justify such jurisdiction, there must be a specific provision of the Act which, although it is clear and mandatory, was nevertheless violated by the [agency].\" <i>Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer,</i> 735 F.2d 1497, 1501 (D.C.Cir.1984) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Association points to no clear violation of an unambiguous statutory provision. Instead, its arguments &#8212; that the Authority openly violated the clear mandate of the Act by determining that the NGTA prohibits nationwide consolidation of bargaining units and (again) by failing to include increased bargaining rights as a factor in its decision &#8212; merely repeat its disagreement with the agency's ruling. This falls well short of the requirements for <i>Leedom</i> jurisdiction. \"That the [agency] may have made an error of fact or law is insufficient; the [agency] must have acted without statutory authority.\" <i>Fanning,</i> 642 F.2d at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of this case for want of jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Answering no, we affirm the district court's dismissal of this challenge to an appropriate unit determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Guard \"dual status technicians\" (mechanics, machinists, and supply technicians) are federal employees who, pursuant to the National Guard Technicians Act (NGTA), 32 U.S.C. &#167; 709, are separately employed and supervised by the Adjutant General of their respective State Guards. As a condition of employment, they must maintain membership in the state unit of the National Guard for which they work. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 709(b). For collective bargaining purposes, dual status technicians are represented by appellant, the Association of Civilian Technicians. Though a national union, the Association bargains separately on behalf of each state-based unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case began when the Association filed a petition with the Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking to have dual status technician bargaining units consolidated into a single, national unit. The Federal Labor Relations Act (FLRA) directs the Authority to determine whether unit determination petitions are \"appropriate,\" based on such factors as whether the determination \"will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 7112(a). Applying these standards, the Authority's Regional Director denied the petition. On review, the Authority acknowledged that some evidence &#8212; particularly the \"interchange\" of technicians among State Guards &#8212; supported the appropriateness of the proposed national unit. The Authority, however, affirmed the Regional Director's conclusion that more evidence justified maintaining state-based units: Each National Guard state unit has \"an individual mission unique to its state or territory\"; the NGTA invests Adjutants General with \"overall authority over all personnel and labor relations matters in their respective State Activities\"; and national collective bargaining would be ineffective because \"authority over the day-to-day employment of the technicians ... is designated by statute to the states.\" The Association urged the Authority to consider the increased bargaining rights that consolidation would purportedly bring to union members, but the agency declined to do so, agreeing with the Regional Director that the statutory obligation to \"ensure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this chapter,\" <i>id.,</i> applies only to units already determined to be appropriate. On the basis of this analysis, the Authority denied the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act &#8212; \"[a] person ... aggrieved by agency action ... is entitled to judicial review thereof,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 702 &#8212; the Association sued the Authority in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing that the unit determination was \"arbitrary [and] capricious,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 706(a)(2)(A). The district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, relying on FLRA section 7123: \"Any person aggrieved by any final order of the [Federal Labor Relations] Authority <i>other than an order under ... section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination),</i> may ... institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the [appropriate] United States court of appeals.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7123(a) (emphasis added).

Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111911\"><a href=\"/opinion/111911/icc-v-locomotive-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 283, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111911\"><a href=\"/opinion/111911/icc-v-locomotive-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Although the cases the Association cites reveal limited exceptions to this principle, those exceptions are inapplicable here. In <i>McNary,</i> the Supreme Court held that a district court could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a general due process challenge to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's administration of \"Special Agricultural Worker\" status, even though the controlling statute made individual status determinations unreviewable. 498 U.S. at 494, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112536\"><a href=\"/opinion/112536/mcnary-v-haitian-refugee-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>. Just because district courts may in some cases review generic, constitutional challenges to otherwise unreviewable agency actions hardly means that the district court in this case had jurisdiction over the Association's non-constitutional, individualized claim. Nor does our assumption in <i>Crowley</i> that a district court might have jurisdiction over an agency's articulation of its general enforcement policy, 37 F.3d at 677, support the Association's argument that district courts may review any agency legal interpretation made in the context of otherwise unreviewable individual adjudications. On the contrary, <i>Crowley</i> echoes the Supreme Court's \"square[ ] reject[ion of] the notion of carving reviewable legal rulings out from the middle of non-reviewable actions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 676 (citing <i>Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs,</i> 482 U.S. at 283, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111911\"><a href=\"/opinion/111911/icc-v-locomotive-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In support of this proposition, the Association cites a Ninth Circuit decision, <i>Montana Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538461\"><a href=\"/opinion/538461/montana-air-chapter-no-29-association-of-civilian-technicians-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span> (1990). That case, however, as well as a similar decision of this circuit, <i>International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. National Mediation Board,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466266\"><a href=\"/opinion/466266/international-longshoremens-association-afl-cio-v-national-mediation/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span>, 1100 (D.C.Cir.1986), held that agency <i>nonenforcement</i> decisions, normally unreviewable, <i>see Heckler v. Chaney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 832, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1985), may be reviewed if they rest on the agency's erroneous belief that it lacks jurisdiction. That rule does not apply here, for the Authority neither disclaimed jurisdiction nor declined to enforce the FLRA. On the contrary, the agency affirmatively exercised its statutory jurisdiction, evaluated the merits of the consolidation petition, and concluded that the proposed unit was not appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Association attempts to bring this case within the ambit of <i>Adams v. Richardson,</i> which held that district courts may exercise jurisdiction over agency action that amounts to \"an abdication of ... Congress' clear statement of an affirmative enforcement duty.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312132\"><a href=\"/opinion/312132/kenneth-adams-v-elliot-l-richardson-individuallyand-as-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1162 (D.C.Cir.1973). Citing the agency's same two rulings about Adjutant General responsibility and the relevance of increased bargaining rights, the Association argues that the Authority abdicated its responsibility \"to determine appropriate bargaining units\" and \"to enforce [the] mandate of [section 7112 of the Act].\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 34-35. In our view, these two rulings do not come close to the \"abdication\" that justified district court jurisdiction in <i>Adams.</i> In that case, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare declined to enforce an entire statutory scheme, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <i>Adams,</i> 480 F.2d at 1161. The evidence showed that the Secretary, in violation of an unambiguous statutory directive that HEW \"effectuate the provisions of ... this title,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-1, failed to take appropriate action to terminate federal funding to segregated school systems, a failure we called \"a dereliction of duty,\" <i>Adams,</i> 480 F.2d at 1163. The record in this case reflects no such dereliction. As we indicated above, the Authority exercised jurisdiction over the consolidation petition and ruled against the Association. The Association's claim that the agency abdicated its enforcement responsibility represents nothing more than substantive disagreement with the agency's legal rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Association argues that the Authority's ruling amounts to the kind of \"open violation of statutory authority\" that the Supreme Court found reviewable in <i>Leedom v. Kyne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105802\"><a href=\"/opinion/105802/leedom-v-kyne/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 188, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105802\"><a href=\"/opinion/105802/leedom-v-kyne/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105802\"><a href=\"/opinion/105802/leedom-v-kyne/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span> (1958). \"The invocation of <i>Leedom</i> jurisdiction,\" we have emphasized, \"is extraordinary; to justify such jurisdiction, there must be a specific provision of the Act which, although it is clear and mandatory, was nevertheless violated by the [agency].\" <i>Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437081\"><a href=\"/opinion/437081/council-of-prison-locals-v-roy-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1497</span></a></span>, 1501 (D.C.Cir.1984) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Association points to no clear violation of an unambiguous statutory provision. Instead, its arguments &#8212; that the Authority openly violated the clear mandate of the Act by determining that the NGTA prohibits nationwide consolidation of bargaining units and (again) by failing to include increased bargaining rights as a factor in its decision &#8212; merely repeat its disagreement with the agency's ruling. This falls well short of the requirements for <i>Leedom</i> jurisdiction. \"That the [agency] may have made an error of fact or law is insufficient; the [agency] must have acted without statutory authority.\" <i>Fanning,</i> 642 F.2d at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of this case for want of jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
