See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n                  OPINION\n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Appellant, Rob Farmer, appeals the district court's order granting\nsummary judgment in favor of Appellee, the University of Maryland\nSchool of Medicine. Farmer claims that the University's race-\nconscious admissions process is inconsistent with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the United States Constitution. For reasons that follow,\nwe affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n             I.\n\n   As the district court found, there is substantial evidence that the\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSM) considers race\nduring the admissions process. Cognitive factors, primarily grade\npoint average (GPA) and Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)\nscores, are the most important criteria for admission, but the school\nalso considers \"non-cognitive\" factors, such as letters of recommenda-\ntion, family background, work history, personal statements, and race.1\n____________________________________________________________\n  1\n     The record does not suggest the use of any rigid formula for determin-\ning the relative weight of race or other non-cognitive factors. Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that UMSM segregates applications into different\ntracks based on race, sets aside a specified number of spots for minori-\nties, or operates under an express quota system. It is enough, for pur-\nposes of this appeal, to accept the Appellant's assertion that cognitive\nfactors are the most important considerations for admission, and that race\nalso plays an important role as a non-cognitive factor.\n\n             2\n\f   Like many universities, UMSM processes applications through a\nseries of stages, weeding out unqualified candidates at each stage.\nCandidates who survive the early stages are given a personal inter-\nview, and the process culminates in a vote by the admissions commit-\ntee. At the first stage, applicants complete a standard American\nMedical College Admissions Service application form. Applicants\nmay, if they so choose, identify their race on this form. These prelimi-\nnary applications are filtered by residency, GPA, and MCAT scores.\nApplications from Maryland residents are almost invariably sent to\nthe second stage. Many other applications, however, are culled from\nthe pack at the first stage. In the second stage, applicants complete a\nlengthier application, which includes the submission of letters of rec-\nommendation and personal statements, as well as GPA and MCAT\nscores. Each application is assigned to a member of the admissions\ncommittee, who presents the application to the full committee along\nwith a recommendation whether the applicant should be interviewed.\nEach member of the admissions committee receives a report including\nthe applicant's grades, MCAT scores, undergraduate and graduate\ninstitutions attended, degrees earned, age, race (if provided by the\napplicant), and residency. The committee members consider this\ninformation as well as the remaining non-cognitive factors, see ante\nat 2. The full committee then votes to grant the applicant an interview,\nor to reject the applicant without an interview. After the selected\napplicants are interviewed, the applicant's full application is pre-\nsented again to the admissions committee, which votes to either reject\nthe application or offer admission.\n\n   Farmer, a white male, applied to UMSM three times—in 1994,\n1995, and 1996—and was rejected without an interview each time.\nDisappointed by his rejection, Farmer filed suit, alleging that\nUMSM's race-conscious admissions policy was unconstitutional. Far-\nmer limited his challenge to the rejection of his 1995 application—\nthat being his strongest application.\n\n   Farmer's 1995 application revealed, as the district court noted, that\nFarmer spent the nine years following his high school graduation rock\nclimbing, hitchhiking, and juggling. In 1987, at the age of 27, Farmer\nenrolled at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Farmer was uninter-\nested in medical school at the time, and took few science courses.\nAfter graduating in 1991, Farmer moved to Maryland to work for his\n\n             3\n\ffather repairing houses. The district court noted that this was the only\npaid employment Farmer listed on his application. In 1994, Farmer\nbegan pursuing a medical career.\n\n   Farmer lacked the minimum number of science courses to apply to\nUMSM. Consequently, from 1992 to 1993, he took science courses\nat Towson University. Farmer earned a science GPA of 2.8, and he\nreceived \"C\" grades in several classes, including Basic Math and Sci-\nence, General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Immunology.2 In\nApril 1994, Farmer took the MCAT for the first time. He concedes\nhis scores were poor. When he took the MCAT a second time, he\ngreatly improved his score.3\n\n   In 1995, Farmer was one of 4,466 applicants seeking one of\napproximately 140 available places in the Fall 1996 entering class. Of\nthe 4,466 applicants, 518 were offered interviews and of those, 299\nwere offered admission and 144 matriculated. The overall rate of\nadmission was 6%. Fifty-six black students were offered admission to\nUMSM's Fall 1996 class; twenty-eight black students chose to attend.\n____________________________________________________________\n   2\n     Farmer's experts stated that the average science GPA for minority\nadmittees to UMSM was 3.32. The average science GPA for non-\nminority admittees was 3.63. J.A. 1414.\n   3\n     On the 1994 MCAT, Farmer received the following scores: Verbal\nreasoning — 11 (85-96 percentile), Physical sciences — 6 (13-27 per-\ncentile), Writing Sample — P (63-75 percentile), and Biological sciences\n— 7 (24-37 percentile). In 1995, Farmer received the following scores:\nVerbal reasoning — 10 (75-87 percentile), Physical science — 10 (74-86\npercentile), Writing sample — S (96-99 percentile), and Biological sci-\nences — 9 (56-72 percentile).\n\n   From these data and the data that Farmer obtained in discovery, Far-\nmer's experts generated \"composite\" scores. Farmer's composite score\non his first MCAT was 38. Farmer's composite score on his second\nMCAT was 49. The average composite MCAT score for all admittees\nwas 44.92. J.A. 1402. The average composite MCAT score for minority\nadmittees was 38.42. The average MCAT for non-minority admittees\nwas 46.67.\n\n   The average GPA for all admittees is unclear from the record. The\naverage GPA for preferred admittees was 3.46. The average GPA for\nnon-preferred admittees was 3.64. J.A. 1414. Farmer's overall GPA was\n3.41. J.A. 1401.\n\n             4\n\f   Because Farmer was a Maryland resident, his application automati-\ncally advanced to the second stage. Farmer's file included his rejected\n1994 application, his second MCAT score, his undergraduate tran-\nscript, his employment history, a second letter of recommendation\nfrom Towson University, other personal information (such as his mis-\ndemeanor arrest record) and additional personal statements. Hermione\nHicks, the Director of Recruitment for the Office of Admissions at\nUMSM, presented Farmer's 1995 application to the admissions com-\nmittee. Hicks noted that Farmer had not held a \"significant job\" as an\nadult and had spent \"an extreme amount of time\" involved in purely\nrecreational activities. Hicks recommended against giving Farmer an\ninterview. The admissions committee voted 14-0 to reject Farmer\nwithout an interview.\n\n   During discovery, Hick's and other committee members' deposi-\ntion testimony was that race played no part in the decision to reject\nFarmer. They testified that Farmer's application was rejected because\nof (1) the cool letter of recommendation from Towson University, (2)\nhis relatively low GPA from Towson, (3) his less than average and\ninconsistent MCAT scores, (4) his quirky personal statements, (5) his\nsparse employment history, and (6) the inconsistent explanations Far-\nmer gave for his arrest record.\n\n   During the admissions committee's evaluation of Farmer, Ms.\nHicks read to the committee a portion of the Towson letter of recom-\nmendation, which she found to be very unsupportive of Farmer:\n\n       We greatly respect his interest in the humanities, environ-\n       mental issues and human rights, but have had concerns\n       about whether his personality and somewhat inconsistent\n       academic performance would lend themselves to the con-\n       ventions of the medical profession that he hopes to enter.\n\nJ.A. 174-175. The admissions committee, familiar with the care with\nwhich letters of recommendations are written, understood this to be\na very poor recommendation. Every member of the admissions com-\nmittee who voted on Farmer's application has attested that the Tow-\nson letter was fatal to Farmer's application because it raised questions\nabout his personality and fitness for a medical career. J.A. 240-263;\n359-360; 370; 516-521; 550; 722-723; 811-812.\n\n             5\n\f   The admissions committee was also concerned about Farmer's per-\nsonal statements. These statements revealed negative feelings about\nthe medical profession. In one statement, quoting from the cartoon\n\"Calvin and Hobbes,\" Farmer stated that doctors should \"be careful\nor be roadkill.\" Farmer also described how, at age nine, he fell out of\na tree and broke his arm. According to Farmer, his doctor \"pro-\nnounced [him] crippled for life—a terrible falsehood to tell a nine-\nyear old boy.\" Farmer also wrote that \"perhaps most doctors have not\nread any new medical information in the last 12 years.\" He further\nstated that \"from a very unscientific poll, [he has] determined that\nnearly everyone has a horror story to tell about a doctor.\"\n\n   Returning to his personal experiences with physicians, Farmer\nwrote about (1) the \"absence of compassion\" and \"ignorance\" of a\ndoctor treating his mother, (2) the incompetence of another physician\ntreating a friend for abdominal pains, (3) the \"substandard\" care\nreceived by a friend's wife during nasal surgery, (4) the lack of \"com-\nmon sense\" of his own childhood physician, and (5) the \"crooked\nbone in [his] hand\" caused by another physician's incompetence.\n\n   Finally, Farmer used his personal statements to disparage his fel-\nlow applicants to medical school. He wrote: \"Most of the pre-med\nstudents I've seen are very good at rote memorization, but they often\nfall woefully short in areas of common sense, assertiveness, social\nconcern, and knowledge of current events.\" In another statement, Far-\nmer wrote, \"[m]ost of your prospective students are essentially inter-\nchangeable units; if one student doesn't fill a need somewhere,\nsomeone else will fill that need . . . . This is why it is so important that\nyou accept me.\" According to the uncontroverted deposition testi-\nmony of Ms. Hicks and another committee member, Associate Dean\nMilford Foxwell, the admissions committee felt that Farmer's per-\nsonal statements reflected hostility to the medical profession and con-\ndescension to his prospective classmates. The committee believed that\nthese views made Farmer a poor candidate for admission.4\n____________________________________________________________\n   4\n     As noted above, Farmer's various applications gave different explana-\ntions for his arrest record. On his 1994 application, Farmer wrote that he\nhad been convicted of criminal mischief after being \"unjustly accused of\ndamaging a window screen.\" Farmer also wrote that he failed to appear\n\n             6\n\f   After being rejected by UMSM again the following year, Farmer\nspent two years at Saba University's medical school in the Nether-\nlands Antilles, after which he dropped out of medical school entirely.\n\n             II.\n\n   Farmer's complaint and amended complaint alleged claims under\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1981; and directly under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment's Equal Protection Clause. Farmer sought money damages, an\norder requiring the medical school to admit him, and a permanent\ninjunction against future use of a race-conscious admissions policy.\n\n    After substantial discovery, UMSM moved for summary judgment,\narguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact because even\nif race had not been a factor in admissions decision-making, Farmer\nwould not have been admitted. UMSM also moved to exclude both\nof Farmer's experts. The district court granted the motion for sum-\nmary judgment. The district court also excluded both experts—one\nbecause the expert's contingent fee arrangement violated Maryland\n\"public policy,\" and the other because she was unqualified to render\nan expert opinion. Finally, the district court concluded that Farmer did\nnot have standing to pursue forward-looking injunctive relief. Farmer\nfiled this appeal.\n\n            III.\n\n   We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, employing the\nsame standards employed by the district court. Felty v. Graves-\nHumphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1127-28 (4th Cir. 1987). Summary\njudgment is appropriate if \"there is no genuine issue as to any mate-\nrial fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.\" Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56. The party moving for summary judg-\n____________________________________________________________\n\nto answer a charge of \"illegal dogwalking.\" On his 1995 application, Far-\nmer claimed that he had merely \"once pled `no contest' to something like\n4th degree trespassing.\" Attempting to clarify, Farmer further explained\nthat \"the woman against whom [he] allegedly trespassed later became\n[his] girlfriend.\"\n\n             7\n\fment bears the initial burden of pointing to the absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322\n(1986). The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to come for-\nward with facts sufficient to create a triable issue of fact. Anderson\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986).5\n\n   Under the established law of equal protection, \"even if the govern-\nment has considered an impermissible criterion in making a decision\nadverse to the plaintiff, it can nonetheless defeat liability by demon-\nstrating that it would have made the same decision absent the forbid-\nden consideration.\" Texas v. Lesage, 522 U.S. 18, 20-21 (1999).\nAccording to UMSM, Farmer would not have been admitted to the\nmedical school if the admissions process had been race-neutral. As\nthe above recitation of the uncontested facts demonstrates, we think\nUMSM has met its burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact; viewing the evidence in the light most favor-\nable to Farmer, a reasonable finder-of-fact could only conclude that\nFarmer would have been rejected absent the allegedly forbidden con-\nsideration.\n\n   Farmer's attempts to rebut UMSM's showing of the absence of a\ngenuine issue of material fact fall short. Most of his argument on\nappeal has been dedicated to convincing us that race plays a signifi-\ncant role in admissions. As we stated at the outset, we take that as\ngiven. But the fact that race plays a major role in general is insuffi-\ncient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Farmer\nwas injured by UMSM's admissions policy. In order to demonstrate\nthat he was adversely affected, Farmer must be able to show that he\nwas displaced by beneficiaries of racial considerations. Farmer argues\nthat his GPA and MCAT scores were superior to several of the 56\nblack students who were offered admission. But that is insufficient to\ncreate a triable issue. Even if we were to assume that MCAT scores,\nGPA, and race were the only factors considered by the admissions\n____________________________________________________________\n  5\n    We review a district court's decision to exclude an expert for abuse\nof discretion. General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 139 (1997).\nHowever, as will become clear, we find it unnecessary to decide whether\nthe district court appropriately excluded Farmer's experts. Even consid-\nering the experts' proffered testimony, Farmer has failed to demonstrate\na genuine issue of material fact.\n\n             8\n\fcommittee, Farmer has failed to adduce any evidence that he was\nwithin the next group of 56 applicants that would have been admitted\nhad the entire pool of 4,466 applicants been considered under a race-\nneutral policy. Indeed, even if we were to assume (and this is more\nthan Farmer purports to show) that his GPA and MCAT scores were\nsuperior to every black student who was offered admission, Farmer\nhas still failed to produce a single shred of evidence that he was\nwithin the next group of 56 applicants.6 We simply do not know, even\nunder these extraordinarily generous assumptions, how many other\napplicants were standing between Farmer and acceptance to the medi-\ncal school. UMSM has said that under no circumstances would it have\naccepted Farmer, and we have been given no reason to doubt it.7\n\n   Moreover, even if Farmer was competitive with respect to cogni-\ntive factors, he fails to demonstrate that he was competitive in the\nother non-racial, non-cognitive factors. UMSM has come forward\nwith sufficient evidence that the non-cognitive aspects of Farmer's\n____________________________________________________________\n  6\n    This is obviously a grossly excessive assumption, but it is difficult to\nderive a fairer approximation (to the medical school) from the limited\nrecord. Moreover, analysis of cognitive factors is not the entirely objec-\ntive exercise that Farmer suggests it is. Not all GPAs are created equal.\nUMSM also considers the caliber of the institution at which the GPA was\nacquired.\n    7\n      In the summer of 1995, Farmer participated in the Facilitation of\nEntry Program. This program is designed to help aspiring medical stu-\ndents improve their credentials. The program includes a free Kaplan\nMCAT preparation course. Farmer asserts that, by providing this pro-\ngram, UMSM is promising to accept any participant who improves their\ncredentials into the medical school, and that UMSM's failure to admit\nhim after he completed the program proves that he was denied admission\nbecause he is white. We are unable to find any support for this assertion\nin the record, much less sufficient support to warrant a trial. It is clear\nthat Farmer's 1995 application was considered by the admissions com-\nmittee after his completion of the summer program. For example, his\n1995 letter of recommendation, which the admissions committee had\nbefore it at the time it voted to deny him an interview, is dated November\n3, 1995, well after the summer program had ended. We simply do not\nfind credible the assertion that UMSM would make such a conditional\npromise prior to making a full review of the applicant's entire applica-\ntion. And, of course, UMSM flatly denies making any such promise.\n\n             9\n\fapplication precluded admission. Every member of the admissions\ncommittee has sworn that certain non-cognitive, non-racial factors—\nmost specifically the letters of recommendation—were fatal to Far-\nmer's application. Farmer has provided no evidence to rebut the depo-\nsition testimony of the committee members. For this reason as well,\nthere is no genuine controversy over whether Farmer would have\ngained admission had the process been entirely color-blind.8 Because\nFarmer has failed to rebut UMSM's demonstration of the absence of\na genuine issue of material fact, the district court correctly granted UMSM\nsummary judgment with respect to retrospective relief.\n\n             IV.\n\n   Farmer next argues that the district court erred when it found that\nhe did not have standing to pursue a permanent injunction barring\nUMSM from considering race in the admissions process. The only\ndispute is whether injury-in-fact exists for Farmer to pursue forward-\nlooking relief. In order to maintain a claim for forward-looking relief,\nFarmer must allege that use of a race-conscious admissions policy in\nthe future constitutes \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent,\nnot conjectural or hypothetical.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,\n515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. 555, 560 (1992)).\n____________________________________________________________\n   8\n     Farmer also argues that the district court erred in ruling that his\n§ 1981 count did not state a claim. Title 42, Section 1981 \"guarantees to\nall persons in the United States the same right . . . to make and enforce\ncontracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" The district court ruled that\nFarmer, being white himself, could not state a claim under the section.\nThis ruling would seem to be unassailably correct based on the plain lan-\nguage of the statute, but apparently it is not. In L.N. McDonald v. Santa\nFe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273 (1976), the Supreme Court\nheld that § 1981 prohibited discrimination against a white person in favor\nof a black person. Id. at 285. However, the medical school accurately\npoints out that § 1983 is the exclusive remedy for violations of § 1981\nby state actors. Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701 (1989);\nDennis v. County of Fairfax, 55 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir. 1995). Accord-\ningly, Farmer has no cause of action based on § 1981 independent of\n§ 1983. Of course, Farmer's § 1983 claim was dismissed by the district\ncourt's order granting summary judgment, which we affirm today.\n\n             10\n\f   While Farmer need not allege that he would have gained admit-\ntance to UMSM in order to establish standing, he does have to allege\na real and imminent threat that he would suffer injury in the future.\nAnd the threat of injury must be particularized as to Farmer. Ada-\nrand, 515 U.S. at 211. In equal protection cases of this kind, the\ninjury is the inability to compete \"on an equal footing.\" Id. (quoting\nNortheastern Florida Chapter, Associated General Contractors of\nAmerica v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993)). Farmer\nhas not, and will not, suffer such an injury. As the above discussion\nindicates, UMSM has adequately demonstrated that Farmer has not\nbeen exposed to any \"discriminatory classification.\" Id. Notwithstand-\ning his bare assertions to the contrary, Farmer was rejected because\nof, inter alia, an unsatisfactory letter of recommendation. The letter\nwas unsatisfactory regardless of race. Or, to put it another way, Far-\nmer was never actually treated differently on the basis of race. As for\nthe future, it is beyond cavil that Farmer would be rejected for the\nsame reason should he reapply to UMSM. Indeed, when Farmer reap-\nplied to UMSM in 1996, Towson refused to give him any recommen-\ndation, stating that \"serious reservations\" precluded a letter of\nrecommendation in support of Farmer's application. J.A. 72. Conse-\nquently, assuming that some white applicants to UMSM do not com-\npete on equal footing, Farmer will not be exposed to any such\ninequality. In short, Farmer cannot show any \"particularized\" injury.\n\n    In addition, even if Farmer could show the threat of a concrete, par-\nticularized injury, he fails to demonstrate that UMSM's admissions\npolicy will cause him \"imminent\" injury. Id. \"Although `imminence'\nis concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched\nbeyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the injury is not too specu-\nlative for Article III purposes—that the injury is `certainly impend-\ning.'\" Lujan, 504 U.S. 565 n. 2 (emphasis in original). In order to\nhave standing, Farmer must make an adequate showing that \"some-\ntime in the relatively near future\" he will again apply to UMSM and\nbe subjected to an impermissibly race-conscious admissions process.\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211. This he has not done. In the initial\ninterrogatories propounded to Farmer, he admitted that he would not\nreapply to UMSM except as a transfer student. J.A. 266. It was not\nuntil UMSM moved for summary judgment, challenging Farmer's\nstanding to pursue prospective relief, that Farmer insisted that he\nmight reapply as a first year student. Farmer, in his reply brief, states\n\n            11\n\fthat he applied as a transfer student in 2001 (after the record had\nclosed) and was rejected. It is not clear from the record whether race\nis a factor considered in the admission of transfer students. Thus, Far-\nmer has not expressed an unequivocal intention to subject himself to\na race-conscious admissions process. Consequently, Farmer has failed\nto show \"imminent injury.\" Moreover, even assuming that race is a\nconsideration in the admission of transfer students, UMSM stated at\noral argument that the school does not accept transfers from Saba\nUniversity. Again, because Farmer has failed to demonstrate that he\nwill very likely be subjected to an allegedly unconstitutional admis-\nsions process, he does not have standing to pursue forward-looking\nrelief. Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judg-\nment to UMSM.\n\n            V.\n\n   For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is\naffirmed.\n\n           AFFIRMED\n\n            12\n\f",

See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n                  OPINION\n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Appellant, Rob Farmer, appeals the district court's order granting\nsummary judgment in favor of Appellee, the University of Maryland\nSchool of Medicine. Farmer claims that the University's race-\nconscious admissions process is inconsistent with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the United States Constitution. For reasons that follow,\nwe affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n             I.\n\n   As the district court found, there is substantial evidence that the\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSM) considers race\nduring the admissions process. Cognitive factors, primarily grade\npoint average (GPA) and Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)\nscores, are the most important criteria for admission, but the school\nalso considers \"non-cognitive\" factors, such as letters of recommenda-\ntion, family background, work history, personal statements, and race.1\n____________________________________________________________\n  1\n     The record does not suggest the use of any rigid formula for determin-\ning the relative weight of race or other non-cognitive factors. Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that UMSM segregates applications into different\ntracks based on race, sets aside a specified number of spots for minori-\nties, or operates under an express quota system. It is enough, for pur-\nposes of this appeal, to accept the Appellant's assertion that cognitive\nfactors are the most important considerations for admission, and that race\nalso plays an important role as a non-cognitive factor.\n\n             2\n\f   Like many universities, UMSM processes applications through a\nseries of stages, weeding out unqualified candidates at each stage.\nCandidates who survive the early stages are given a personal inter-\nview, and the process culminates in a vote by the admissions commit-\ntee. At the first stage, applicants complete a standard American\nMedical College Admissions Service application form. Applicants\nmay, if they so choose, identify their race on this form. These prelimi-\nnary applications are filtered by residency, GPA, and MCAT scores.\nApplications from Maryland residents are almost invariably sent to\nthe second stage. Many other applications, however, are culled from\nthe pack at the first stage. In the second stage, applicants complete a\nlengthier application, which includes the submission of letters of rec-\nommendation and personal statements, as well as GPA and MCAT\nscores. Each application is assigned to a member of the admissions\ncommittee, who presents the application to the full committee along\nwith a recommendation whether the applicant should be interviewed.\nEach member of the admissions committee receives a report including\nthe applicant's grades, MCAT scores, undergraduate and graduate\ninstitutions attended, degrees earned, age, race (if provided by the\napplicant), and residency. The committee members consider this\ninformation as well as the remaining non-cognitive factors, see ante\nat 2. The full committee then votes to grant the applicant an interview,\nor to reject the applicant without an interview. After the selected\napplicants are interviewed, the applicant's full application is pre-\nsented again to the admissions committee, which votes to either reject\nthe application or offer admission.\n\n   Farmer, a white male, applied to UMSM three times—in 1994,\n1995, and 1996—and was rejected without an interview each time.\nDisappointed by his rejection, Farmer filed suit, alleging that\nUMSM's race-conscious admissions policy was unconstitutional. Far-\nmer limited his challenge to the rejection of his 1995 application—\nthat being his strongest application.\n\n   Farmer's 1995 application revealed, as the district court noted, that\nFarmer spent the nine years following his high school graduation rock\nclimbing, hitchhiking, and juggling. In 1987, at the age of 27, Farmer\nenrolled at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Farmer was uninter-\nested in medical school at the time, and took few science courses.\nAfter graduating in 1991, Farmer moved to Maryland to work for his\n\n             3\n\ffather repairing houses. The district court noted that this was the only\npaid employment Farmer listed on his application. In 1994, Farmer\nbegan pursuing a medical career.\n\n   Farmer lacked the minimum number of science courses to apply to\nUMSM. Consequently, from 1992 to 1993, he took science courses\nat Towson University. Farmer earned a science GPA of 2.8, and he\nreceived \"C\" grades in several classes, including Basic Math and Sci-\nence, General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Immunology.2 In\nApril 1994, Farmer took the MCAT for the first time. He concedes\nhis scores were poor. When he took the MCAT a second time, he\ngreatly improved his score.3\n\n   In 1995, Farmer was one of 4,466 applicants seeking one of\napproximately 140 available places in the Fall 1996 entering class. Of\nthe 4,466 applicants, 518 were offered interviews and of those, 299\nwere offered admission and 144 matriculated. The overall rate of\nadmission was 6%. Fifty-six black students were offered admission to\nUMSM's Fall 1996 class; twenty-eight black students chose to attend.\n____________________________________________________________\n   2\n     Farmer's experts stated that the average science GPA for minority\nadmittees to UMSM was 3.32. The average science GPA for non-\nminority admittees was 3.63. J.A. 1414.\n   3\n     On the 1994 MCAT, Farmer received the following scores: Verbal\nreasoning — 11 (85-96 percentile), Physical sciences — 6 (13-27 per-\ncentile), Writing Sample — P (63-75 percentile), and Biological sciences\n— 7 (24-37 percentile). In 1995, Farmer received the following scores:\nVerbal reasoning — 10 (75-87 percentile), Physical science — 10 (74-86\npercentile), Writing sample — S (96-99 percentile), and Biological sci-\nences — 9 (56-72 percentile).\n\n   From these data and the data that Farmer obtained in discovery, Far-\nmer's experts generated \"composite\" scores. Farmer's composite score\non his first MCAT was 38. Farmer's composite score on his second\nMCAT was 49. The average composite MCAT score for all admittees\nwas 44.92. J.A. 1402. The average composite MCAT score for minority\nadmittees was 38.42. The average MCAT for non-minority admittees\nwas 46.67.\n\n   The average GPA for all admittees is unclear from the record. The\naverage GPA for preferred admittees was 3.46. The average GPA for\nnon-preferred admittees was 3.64. J.A. 1414. Farmer's overall GPA was\n3.41. J.A. 1401.\n\n             4\n\f   Because Farmer was a Maryland resident, his application automati-\ncally advanced to the second stage. Farmer's file included his rejected\n1994 application, his second MCAT score, his undergraduate tran-\nscript, his employment history, a second letter of recommendation\nfrom Towson University, other personal information (such as his mis-\ndemeanor arrest record) and additional personal statements. Hermione\nHicks, the Director of Recruitment for the Office of Admissions at\nUMSM, presented Farmer's 1995 application to the admissions com-\nmittee. Hicks noted that Farmer had not held a \"significant job\" as an\nadult and had spent \"an extreme amount of time\" involved in purely\nrecreational activities. Hicks recommended against giving Farmer an\ninterview. The admissions committee voted 14-0 to reject Farmer\nwithout an interview.\n\n   During discovery, Hick's and other committee members' deposi-\ntion testimony was that race played no part in the decision to reject\nFarmer. They testified that Farmer's application was rejected because\nof (1) the cool letter of recommendation from Towson University, (2)\nhis relatively low GPA from Towson, (3) his less than average and\ninconsistent MCAT scores, (4) his quirky personal statements, (5) his\nsparse employment history, and (6) the inconsistent explanations Far-\nmer gave for his arrest record.\n\n   During the admissions committee's evaluation of Farmer, Ms.\nHicks read to the committee a portion of the Towson letter of recom-\nmendation, which she found to be very unsupportive of Farmer:\n\n       We greatly respect his interest in the humanities, environ-\n       mental issues and human rights, but have had concerns\n       about whether his personality and somewhat inconsistent\n       academic performance would lend themselves to the con-\n       ventions of the medical profession that he hopes to enter.\n\nJ.A. 174-175. The admissions committee, familiar with the care with\nwhich letters of recommendations are written, understood this to be\na very poor recommendation. Every member of the admissions com-\nmittee who voted on Farmer's application has attested that the Tow-\nson letter was fatal to Farmer's application because it raised questions\nabout his personality and fitness for a medical career. J.A. 240-263;\n359-360; 370; 516-521; 550; 722-723; 811-812.\n\n             5\n\f   The admissions committee was also concerned about Farmer's per-\nsonal statements. These statements revealed negative feelings about\nthe medical profession. In one statement, quoting from the cartoon\n\"Calvin and Hobbes,\" Farmer stated that doctors should \"be careful\nor be roadkill.\" Farmer also described how, at age nine, he fell out of\na tree and broke his arm. According to Farmer, his doctor \"pro-\nnounced [him] crippled for life—a terrible falsehood to tell a nine-\nyear old boy.\" Farmer also wrote that \"perhaps most doctors have not\nread any new medical information in the last 12 years.\" He further\nstated that \"from a very unscientific poll, [he has] determined that\nnearly everyone has a horror story to tell about a doctor.\"\n\n   Returning to his personal experiences with physicians, Farmer\nwrote about (1) the \"absence of compassion\" and \"ignorance\" of a\ndoctor treating his mother, (2) the incompetence of another physician\ntreating a friend for abdominal pains, (3) the \"substandard\" care\nreceived by a friend's wife during nasal surgery, (4) the lack of \"com-\nmon sense\" of his own childhood physician, and (5) the \"crooked\nbone in [his] hand\" caused by another physician's incompetence.\n\n   Finally, Farmer used his personal statements to disparage his fel-\nlow applicants to medical school. He wrote: \"Most of the pre-med\nstudents I've seen are very good at rote memorization, but they often\nfall woefully short in areas of common sense, assertiveness, social\nconcern, and knowledge of current events.\" In another statement, Far-\nmer wrote, \"[m]ost of your prospective students are essentially inter-\nchangeable units; if one student doesn't fill a need somewhere,\nsomeone else will fill that need . . . . This is why it is so important that\nyou accept me.\" According to the uncontroverted deposition testi-\nmony of Ms. Hicks and another committee member, Associate Dean\nMilford Foxwell, the admissions committee felt that Farmer's per-\nsonal statements reflected hostility to the medical profession and con-\ndescension to his prospective classmates. The committee believed that\nthese views made Farmer a poor candidate for admission.4\n____________________________________________________________\n   4\n     As noted above, Farmer's various applications gave different explana-\ntions for his arrest record. On his 1994 application, Farmer wrote that he\nhad been convicted of criminal mischief after being \"unjustly accused of\ndamaging a window screen.\" Farmer also wrote that he failed to appear\n\n             6\n\f   After being rejected by UMSM again the following year, Farmer\nspent two years at Saba University's medical school in the Nether-\nlands Antilles, after which he dropped out of medical school entirely.\n\n             II.\n\n   Farmer's complaint and amended complaint alleged claims under\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1981; and directly under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment's Equal Protection Clause. Farmer sought money damages, an\norder requiring the medical school to admit him, and a permanent\ninjunction against future use of a race-conscious admissions policy.\n\n    After substantial discovery, UMSM moved for summary judgment,\narguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact because even\nif race had not been a factor in admissions decision-making, Farmer\nwould not have been admitted. UMSM also moved to exclude both\nof Farmer's experts. The district court granted the motion for sum-\nmary judgment. The district court also excluded both experts—one\nbecause the expert's contingent fee arrangement violated Maryland\n\"public policy,\" and the other because she was unqualified to render\nan expert opinion. Finally, the district court concluded that Farmer did\nnot have standing to pursue forward-looking injunctive relief. Farmer\nfiled this appeal.\n\n            III.\n\n   We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, employing the\nsame standards employed by the district court. Felty v.

As\nthe above recitation of the uncontested facts demonstrates, we think\nUMSM has met its burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact; viewing the evidence in the light most favor-\nable to Farmer, a reasonable finder-of-fact could only conclude that\nFarmer would have been rejected absent the allegedly forbidden con-\nsideration.\n\n   Farmer's attempts to rebut UMSM's showing of the absence of a\ngenuine issue of material fact fall short. Most of his argument on\nappeal has been dedicated to convincing us that race plays a signifi-\ncant role in admissions. As we stated at the outset, we take that as\ngiven. But the fact that race plays a major role in general is insuffi-\ncient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Farmer\nwas injured by UMSM's admissions policy. In order to demonstrate\nthat he was adversely affected, Farmer must be able to show that he\nwas displaced by beneficiaries of racial considerations. Farmer argues\nthat his GPA and MCAT scores were superior to several of the 56\nblack students who were offered admission. But that is insufficient to\ncreate a triable issue. Even if we were to assume that MCAT scores,\nGPA, and race were the only factors considered by the admissions\n____________________________________________________________\n  5\n    We review a district court's decision to exclude an expert for abuse\nof discretion. General Electric Co. v. Joiner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118157\"><a href=\"/opinion/118157/general-electric-co-v-joiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139 (1997).\nHowever, as will become clear, we find it unnecessary to decide whether\nthe district court appropriately excluded Farmer's experts. Even consid-\nering the experts' proffered testimony, Farmer has failed to demonstrate\na genuine issue of material fact.\n\n             8\n\fcommittee, Farmer has failed to adduce any evidence that he was\nwithin the next group of 56 applicants that would have been admitted\nhad the entire pool of 4,466 applicants been considered under a race-\nneutral policy. Indeed, even if we were to assume (and this is more\nthan Farmer purports to show) that his GPA and MCAT scores were\nsuperior to every black student who was offered admission, Farmer\nhas still failed to produce a single shred of evidence that he was\nwithin the next group of 56 applicants.6 We simply do not know, even\nunder these extraordinarily generous assumptions, how many other\napplicants were standing between Farmer and acceptance to the medi-\ncal school. UMSM has said that under no circumstances would it have\naccepted Farmer, and we have been given no reason to doubt it.7\n\n   Moreover, even if Farmer was competitive with respect to cogni-\ntive factors, he fails to demonstrate that he was competitive in the\nother non-racial, non-cognitive factors. UMSM has come forward\nwith sufficient evidence that the non-cognitive aspects of Farmer's\n____________________________________________________________\n  6\n    This is obviously a grossly excessive assumption, but it is difficult to\nderive a fairer approximation (to the medical school) from the limited\nrecord. Moreover, analysis of cognitive factors is not the entirely objec-\ntive exercise that Farmer suggests it is. Not all GPAs are created equal.\nUMSM also considers the caliber of the institution at which the GPA was\nacquired.\n    7\n      In the summer of 1995, Farmer participated in the Facilitation of\nEntry Program. This program is designed to help aspiring medical stu-\ndents improve their credentials. The program includes a free Kaplan\nMCAT preparation course. Farmer asserts that, by providing this pro-\ngram, UMSM is promising to accept any participant who improves their\ncredentials into the medical school, and that UMSM's failure to admit\nhim after he completed the program proves that he was denied admission\nbecause he is white. We are unable to find any support for this assertion\nin the record, much less sufficient support to warrant a trial. It is clear\nthat Farmer's 1995 application was considered by the admissions com-\nmittee after his completion of the summer program. For example, his\n1995 letter of recommendation, which the admissions committee had\nbefore it at the time it voted to deny him an interview, is dated November\n3, 1995, well after the summer program had ended. We simply do not\nfind credible the assertion that UMSM would make such a conditional\npromise prior to making a full review of the applicant's entire applica-\ntion. And, of course, UMSM flatly denies making any such promise.\n\n             9\n\fapplication precluded admission. Every member of the admissions\ncommittee has sworn that certain non-cognitive, non-racial factors—\nmost specifically the letters of recommendation—were fatal to Far-\nmer's application. Farmer has provided no evidence to rebut the depo-\nsition testimony of the committee members. For this reason as well,\nthere is no genuine controversy over whether Farmer would have\ngained admission had the process been entirely color-blind.8 Because\nFarmer has failed to rebut UMSM's demonstration of the absence of\na genuine issue of material fact, the district court correctly granted UMSM\nsummary judgment with respect to retrospective relief.\n\n             IV.\n\n   Farmer next argues that the district court erred when it found that\nhe did not have standing to pursue a permanent injunction barring\nUMSM from considering race in the admissions process. The only\ndispute is whether injury-in-fact exists for Farmer to pursue forward-\nlooking relief. In order to maintain a claim for forward-looking relief,\nFarmer must allege that use of a race-conscious admissions policy in\nthe future constitutes \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent,\nnot conjectural or hypothetical.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

Title 42, Section 1981 \"guarantees to\nall persons in the United States the same right . . . to make and enforce\ncontracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" The district court ruled that\nFarmer, being white himself, could not state a claim under the section.\nThis ruling would seem to be unassailably correct based on the plain lan-\nguage of the statute, but apparently it is not. In L.N. McDonald v. Santa\nFe Trail Transportation Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109513\"><a href=\"/opinion/109513/mcdonald-v-santa-fe-trail-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), the Supreme Court\nheld that § 1981 prohibited discrimination against a white person in favor\nof a black person. Id. at 285. However, the medical school accurately\npoints out that § 1983 is the exclusive remedy for violations of § 1981\nby state actors. Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch.

Accord-\ningly, Farmer has no cause of action based on § 1981 independent of\n§ 1983. Of course, Farmer's § 1983 claim was dismissed by the district\ncourt's order granting summary judgment, which we affirm today.\n\n             10\n\f   While Farmer need not allege that he would have gained admit-\ntance to UMSM in order to establish standing, he does have to allege\na real and imminent threat that he would suffer injury in the future.\nAnd the threat of injury must be particularized as to Farmer. Ada-\nrand, 515 U.S. at 211. In equal protection cases of this kind, the\ninjury is the inability to compete \"on an equal footing.\" Id. (quoting\nNortheastern Florida Chapter, Associated General Contractors of\nAmerica v. City of Jacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1993)). Farmer\nhas not, and will not, suffer such an injury. As the above discussion\nindicates, UMSM has adequately demonstrated that Farmer has not\nbeen exposed to any \"discriminatory classification.\" Id. Notwithstand-\ning his bare assertions to the contrary, Farmer was rejected because\nof, inter alia, an unsatisfactory letter of recommendation. The letter\nwas unsatisfactory regardless of race. Or, to put it another way, Far-\nmer was never actually treated differently on the basis of race. As for\nthe future, it is beyond cavil that Farmer would be rejected for the\nsame reason should he reapply to UMSM. Indeed, when Farmer reap-\nplied to UMSM in 1996, Towson refused to give him any recommen-\ndation, stating that \"serious reservations\" precluded a letter of\nrecommendation in support of Farmer's application. J.A. 72. Conse-\nquently, assuming that some white applicants to UMSM do not com-\npete on equal footing, Farmer will not be exposed to any such\ninequality. In short, Farmer cannot show any \"particularized\" injury.\n\n    In addition, even if Farmer could show the threat of a concrete, par-\nticularized injury, he fails to demonstrate that UMSM's admissions\npolicy will cause him \"imminent\" injury. Id. \"Although `imminence'\nis concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched\nbeyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the injury is not too specu-\nlative for Article III purposes—that the injury is `certainly impend-\ning.'\" Lujan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> n. 2 (emphasis in original). In order to\nhave standing, Farmer must make an adequate showing that \"some-\ntime in the relatively near future\" he will again apply to UMSM and\nbe subjected to an impermissibly race-conscious admissions process.\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211. This he has not done. In the initial\ninterrogatories propounded to Farmer, he admitted that he would not\nreapply to UMSM except as a transfer student. J.A. 266. It was not\nuntil UMSM moved for summary judgment, challenging Farmer's\nstanding to pursue prospective relief, that Farmer insisted that he\nmight reapply as a first year student. Farmer, in his reply brief, states\n\n            11\n\fthat he applied as a transfer student in 2001 (after the record had\nclosed) and was rejected. It is not clear from the record whether race\nis a factor considered in the admission of transfer students. Thus, Far-\nmer has not expressed an unequivocal intention to subject himself to\na race-conscious admissions process. Consequently, Farmer has failed\nto show \"imminent injury.\" Moreover, even assuming that race is a\nconsideration in the admission of transfer students, UMSM stated at\noral argument that the school does not accept transfers from Saba\nUniversity. Again, because Farmer has failed to demonstrate that he\nwill very likely be subjected to an allegedly unconstitutional admis-\nsions process, he does not have standing to pursue forward-looking\nrelief. Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judg-\nment to UMSM.\n\n            V.\n\n   For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is\naffirmed.\n\n           AFFIRMED\n\n            12\n\f</pre>",
