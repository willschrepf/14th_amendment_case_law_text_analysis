At issue is whether\n\nHouston Municipal Employees Pension System (HMEPS) board members violated HMEPS’s\n\nenabling statute by requiring the petitioners’ continued participation in the City of Houston’s\n\ndefined-benefit pension plan. As provided by statute, the pension board has exclusive, final, and\n\nbinding authority to interpret, construe, and supplement omissions in the statute and to determine\n\fall questions pertaining to eligibility for membership, services, and benefits. TEX . REV . CIV . STAT .\n\nANN . ART . 6243h, § 2(x)-(y). Consistent with this legislative mandate, we have held that HMEPS’s\n\nenabling statute precludes judicial review of such matters. Houston Mun. Emps. Pension Sys. v.\n\nFerrell, 248 S.W.3d 151, 158-59 (Tex. 2007). To defeat the presumptive jurisdictional bar, the\n\npetitioners assert that subject-matter jurisdiction exists here because the pension-board members\n\nacted ultra vires and violated the Texas Constitution by augmenting the statute rather than\n\ninterpreting it.\n\n        The underlying dispute arose when the City of Houston attempted to remove a division of\n\nemployees from the pension system by forming quasi-governmental entities to perform the same\n\ngovernmental functions using the same employees. Contemporaneously with the City’s restructuring\n\nefforts, the pension board determined that those employees remained under the City’s effective\n\ncontrol and payroll and therefore fell within the ambit of the statutory definition of “employee,”\n\nwhich defines an individual’s status as a HMEPS member. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART .\n\n6243h, §§ 1(11) (defining “employee”), (13) (defining “member”). The board’s decision resulted\n\nin otherwise eligible members being denied “retiree” status and further required affected employees\n\nto continue making contributions to the pension fund despite being under the immediate employ of\n\na third-party entity. See id. §§ 1(22) (defining “retiree”), (24) (defining “separation from service”).\n\nThe individual petitioners and the City assert that the pension board unlawfully redefined the term\n\n“employee” to capture these employees after they had ceased working for the City. Considering\n\nHMEPS and the board members’ plea to the jurisdiction, the trial court found jurisdiction to be\n\nlacking, and the court of appeals affirmed. 405 S.W.3d 204, 209 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n                                                   2\n\f2013).\n\n         We conclude the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted because\n\n(1) the pension board acted within the scope of its broad statutory authority in construing the term\n\n“employee” and (2) the individual petitioners have not asserted viable constitutional claims.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the court of appeals’ judgment.\n\n                                                   I. Background\n\n         HMEPS is organized and operated under Article 6243h of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes,\n\nwhich requires cities with a population of more than 1.5 million to make contributions to an\n\nemployee pension fund in an amount based in part on the combined salary of the pension system’s\n\nmembers.1 TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h, §§ 1-28; see also id. § 8(d). The statute defines\n\na “member” of the pension fund as “each active employee included in the pension system,” except\n\nfor statutorily ineligible employees. Id. § 1(13). An “employee” is “any [eligible] person . . . who\n\nholds a municipal position[,] . . . whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city[,] . . .\n\nand who is paid a regular salary for services.” Id. § 1(11).\n\n         HMEPS is governed by a Board of Trustees imbued with broad authority to administer,\n\nmanage, and operate the pension fund. See id. § 2(x). Among other powers, the pension board can\n\n(1) adopt written rules and guidelines for the administration of the pension fund; (2) interpret and\n\nconstrue the Act and any summary-plan documents and procedures, provided such construction is\n\nconsistent with section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC); (3) “correct\n\n\n\n         1\n             Presently, only the City of Houston meets Article 6243h’s population threshold.\n\n                                                            3\n\fany defect, supply any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency” in the statute in the manner and\n\nto the extent the board deems “for the greatest benefit of all members”; and (4) determine all legal\n\nand factual questions pertaining to the fund’s administration and eligibility for membership, services,\n\nand benefits. Id. So broad is the board’s authority that the statute expressly mandates that “[t]he\n\ndetermination of any fact by the pension board and the pension board’s interpretation of [the] Act\n\nare final and binding on any interested party, including members, deferred participants, retirees, . . .\n\nand the city.” Id. § 2(y). But though the board’s authority under the statute is indisputably broad,\n\nthe allegation in the underlying lawsuit is that the pension board crossed the line between\n\ninterpreting the statute, which it is expressly authorized to do, and unlawfully altering it by\n\nsupplementing the statutory definition of “employee” in a manner that encompasses personnel the\n\nCity has outsourced to a third-party entity.\n\n        At the heart of the dispute is the City’s effort to reduce its pension-fund contributions by\n\nusing outsourcing as part of a comprehensive cost-saving initiative. Historically, the City has\n\nemployed more than 100 people in its Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department\n\n(convention department) to operate municipally-owned properties such as theaters, convention\n\ncenters, and parking lots. In May 2011, however, the City announced plans to remove those\n\nemployees from the municipal payroll—and thus the pension system—by outsourcing convention\n\nand entertainment municipal functions to Houston First Corporation, a City-controlled, tax-funded\n\nlocal government corporation. Among other indicia of control, Houston First’s budget is approved\n\nby the Houston City Council, and its board is appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city\n\ncouncil.\n\n                                                   4\n\f       In response to the City’s transition plan, the pension board announced in August 2011 that\n\nthe definition of “employee” in Article 6243h “includes a full-time employee of a Texas local\n\ngovernment corporation . . . controlled by the City, upon a determination by the External Affairs\n\nCommittee of the Board of Trustees that such [local government corporation]’s employees are\n\nEmployees for purposes of the [HMEPS] Plan.” Thereafter, the board amended the pension-plan\n\ndocuments to incorporate this construction of the term “employee.”\n\n       Undeterred, the City formed a nonprofit entity named Houston First Foundation and notified\n\nthe pension board that the newly formed entity would employ all the City employees who had been\n\nslated to join Houston First Corporation. Believing Houston First Foundation to be a wholly-owned\n\nand controlled subsidiary of Houston First Corporation—and by extension, the City—the pension\n\nboard adopted a resolution in October 2011 that reiterated the previously adopted construction of the\n\nterm “employee” and further announced that “employees of any entity controlled, directly or\n\nindirectly, by [the City] are considered Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS, unless\n\nthe External Affairs Committee expressly determines otherwise.”\n\n       Subsequently, the City abandoned Houston First Foundation and formed another nonprofit\n\ncorporation called Convention and Cultural Services, Inc. (CCSI) to operate in conjunction with\n\nHouston First to provide convention and entertainment services to the City. Although Houston First\n\nwould still provide those services to the City, it would not employ the service personnel directly.\n\nInstead, CCSI would employ and lease the workforce to Houston First, its only client. By agreement,\n\nHouston First was obligated to fully reimburse CCSI for “all internal and external costs and expenses\n\nassociated with” the provision of personnel. CCSI purported to operate independently, but Houston\n\n                                                 5\n\fFirst and CCSI had overlapping executives, some of whom had been City employees.\n\n       In a letter to the pension system’s executive director, the City Attorney expressly disavowed\n\nany right or ability of the City to control CCSI, stating “[n]either the City, the Mayor, nor City\n\nCouncil will have any appointment authority or control over the corporation or its board of\n\ndirectors.” Instead, CCSI was described as “a non-governmental, non-profit corporation whose\n\nboard will be self perpetuating.” The letter further explained that “[CCSI] will be contracting for\n\nits own employee benefits, including a [401(k)] plan, and will not participate in any City of Houston\n\nbenefit programs.” The City thus took the position that following transition of convention\n\ndepartment employees to CCSI, the employees would no longer be City employees or HMEPS\n\nmembers and, as a result, the City would not be obligated to make contributions to the pension fund\n\nbased on those employees’ salaries.\n\n       Despite this maneuver, the pension board’s External Affairs Committee issued a resolution\n\nin November 2011 to the effect that the leased workers “would be in a control group and would\n\nremain as members of the plan.” Though directly employed by CCSI, the leased employees\n\n(1) performed substantially similar duties as they had when employed directly by the City;\n\n(2) operated in the same governmental facilities; (3) were subject to removal from their positions at\n\nthe City’s request; and (4) were compensated using funds furnished by the publicly-funded local\n\ngovernment corporation, which was contractually obligated to reimburse CCSI for the employees’\n\nservices on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\n\n       With the exception of a group of City employees who were within a few years of retiring, the\n\nCity proceeded to transfer convention and entertainment services and employees in accordance with\n\n                                                 6\n\fthe transition plan.    When the transfer of personnel had been consummated, three CCSI\n\nemployees—John Klumb, Veronica McClelland, and Vivian Montejano—sought full retirement\n\nbenefits from HMEPS on the basis that their employment with the City had ended when they became\n\nCCSI employees and, at that time, they were otherwise eligible to retire. See id. §§ 1(22) (defining\n\n“retiree”), (1)(24) (defining “separation from service”), 10(b) (eligibility requirements for retirement\n\nbenefits); July 2011 Amended & Restated Meet & Confer Agreement Between HEMPS and the City\n\n§ 14 (July 2011 MCA) (eligibility for retirement pension). Three other CCSI employees—John\n\nGonzalez, Anita Robles, and Charmaine Pilgrim—claimed that, although not yet eligible to retire,\n\nthey were no longer employed by the City and were therefore entitled to defer retirement status and\n\ncease having HMEPS contributions of 5% deducted from their salaries. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT .\n\nANN . ART . 6243h, §§ 8(a) (requiring employer to deduct pension-fund contributions from members’\n\nsalaries during employment), 12 (deferred-retirement option); July 2011 MCA § 8. Based on the\n\npension board’s interpretation of the term “employee” in Article 6243h, as adopted in the revised\n\npension-plan documents, the External Affairs Committee concluded that the transferred employees\n\nremained “employees,” and thus “members” of the pension system, and that no separation from\n\nmunicipal service had occurred.\n\n        Klumb, McClelland, Montejano, Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim (collectively, the Petitioners)\n\nsued HMEPS, alleging violations of the Texas Constitution and breach of contract. The Petitioners\n\nsought monetary damages and a declaration that they were no longer City employees as that term is\n\ndefined in Article 6243h. In a plea to the jurisdiction, HMEPS argued that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction because (1) Article 6243h precludes judicial review of the pension\n\n                                                   7\n\fboard’s decisions interpreting that statute and determining eligibility for membership and benefits\n\nand (2) sovereign immunity bars the Petitioners’ breach-of-contract and constitutional claims.\n\n       Petitioners responded by amending their petition to assert ultra vires, equal-protection, and\n\ndue-course-of-law claims against the five pension-board members (Trustees) who voted to amend\n\nthe HMEPS pension-plan documents to “illegally change the definition of ‘employee’ contained in\n\nSection 1(11) of Article 6243h.” The Petitioners requested declaratory relief and an injunction\n\nagainst the Trustees based on the following alleged ultra vires acts: (1) voting to approve a\n\ndefinition of the term “employee” that improperly alters the statutory definition of that term;\n\n(2) compounding that unauthorized act by adopting the October 2011 resolution, which did the same;\n\n(3) authorizing the External Affairs Committee to determine who qualifies as an “employee” in\n\ncontravention of a written agreement with the City; (4) construing Article 6243h in a manner\n\ninconsistent with section 401 of the IRC; (5) refusing a non-discretionary duty to pay Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano their retirement benefits following separation of service from the City;\n\nand (6) refusing a non-discretionary duty to recognize Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim’s separation\n\nfrom service with the City. According to the Petitioners, the pension board’s supplemental definition\n\nof the term “employee” effected an amendment of the statute, which was neither approved by the\n\nCity nor adopted in accordance with statutorily mandated procedures and historical practice (what\n\nthe parties refer to as “meet-and-confer agreements” between HMEPS and the City). See id. § 3(n)\n\n(authorizing the pension board, “[n]otwithstanding any other law,” to “enter into a written agreement\n\nwith the city regarding pension issues and benefits” that is binding on the City and HMEPS members\n\nif approved under procedures specified in the statute). The Petitioners further asserted the pension\n\n                                                 8\n\fboard had improperly delegated authority to the External Affairs Committee in violation of an\n\nexisting meet-and-confer agreement, which states that, except for personnel decisions “no committee\n\n[of the pension fund] shall have authority to make final approvals, but shall only make\n\nrecommendations to the full board.”\n\n        The City intervened, generally aligning itself with the Petitioners and seeking similar\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n        HMEPS and the Trustees (collectively, HMEPS) filed an amended plea to the jurisdiction,\n\narguing that both the pension board’s interpretation of the term “employee” and its application to the\n\nfactual circumstances presented were “final and binding” with no right of judicial review. See id.\n\n§ 2(x)-(y); Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158-59. HMEPS further asserted sovereign immunity bars the\n\nPetitioners’ breach-of-contract and constitutional claims because (1) violation of a meet-and-confer\n\nagreement cannot serve as a basis for an ultra vires claim and (2) the constitutional claims are\n\nfacially invalid. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed\n\nthe suit for want of jurisdiction.\n\n        The court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) Texas courts have jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether the pension board’s actions are ultra vires; (2) the pension board’s construction of the term\n\n“employee” was not an ultra vires act because it was consistent with the board’s exclusive authority\n\nto interpret–and supply any omission in—the statute; (3) violation of a meet-and-confer agreement\n\ndoes not support an ultra vires claim; (4) the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether the board’s supplemental definition of “employee” disqualifies the pension plan under the\n\nIRC; (5) the Petitioners’ equal-protection challenge is meritless because preservation of funding\n\n                                                   9\n\fsources for the pension fund provides a rational basis for continuing to treat the transferred\n\nemployees as employees of the City; (6) the petitioner’s due-course-of-law claim fails because the\n\nemployees lack a vested property interest in the retirement benefits at issue and the funds deducted\n\nfrom their salaries as contributions to the pension fund; and (7) the trial court did not err in striking\n\nand refusing to consider an affidavit offered to establish the board’s intent to amend, rather than\n\ninterpret, the statute and, in any event, the exclusion of the evidence was harmless. 405 S.W.3d at\n\n215-27.\n\n         On appeal to this Court, the Petitioners and the City raise essentially the same grounds for\n\ndenying HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction. In the alternative, they assert that the evidence raises a\n\nfact issue concerning the existence of jurisdiction that must be resolved by the trier of fact on remand\n\nto the trial court.2\n\n                                                     II. Discussion\n\n                                               A. Standard of Review\n\n         Subject-matter jurisdiction is essential to the court’s power to decide a case. Tex. Dep’t. of\n\nParks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004). The existence of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction is a question of law that can be challenged, as it was here, by a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nBland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000). We review de novo the trial\n\n\n\n         2\n           Relatedly, the Petitioners and the City complain that the court of appeals erroneously affirmed the exclusion\nof affidavit evidence pertaining to the Trustees’ subjective intent to amend the definition of “employee.” W ith respect\nto the ultra vires claims, the threshold jurisdictional issue boils down to whether the pension board articulated an\ninterpretation of a statutory term or altered it. This is a matter of statutory construction, which is determined as a matter\nof law considering the statute’s plain language. See, e.g., State v. Shumake, 199 S.W .3d 279, 284 (Tex. 2006).\nConsequently, evidence of the Trustees’ subjective intent is irrelevant.\n\n                                                             10\n\fcourt’s disposition of HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226.\n\n        In doing so, we consider the pleadings and factual assertions, as well as any evidence in the\n\nrecord that is relevant to the jurisdictional issue. City of Elsa v. Gonzalez, 325 S.W.3d 622, 625\n\n(Tex. 2010). Construing the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiffs, we look to the pleaders’\n\nintent and determine whether the pleaders have alleged facts affirmatively demonstrating the court’s\n\njurisdiction to entertain the matter. Id. When a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts, we consider whether evidence in the record raises a fact issue, and if it does, the\n\njurisdictional issue must be resolved by the trier of fact. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227-28.\n\nConversely, the trial court must rule on the plea as a matter of law if the evidence is undisputed or\n\nfails to raise a fact question. Id. at 228.\n\n        The jurisdictional issue in this case has two aspects. The first is whether courts have\n\nauthority to review the pension board’s actions under an ultra vires theory notwithstanding Article\n\n6243h’s ban on judicial review. The second is whether sovereign immunity bars the Petitioners’\n\nconstitutional claims.\n\n                                        B. Ultra Vires Claims\n\n        The pension board has broad authority to interpret and apply Article 6243h, to supplement\n\nomissions in its terms, to adopt written rules and guidelines for the fund’s administration, and to\n\ndetermine all questions of law and fact pertaining to the same. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART .\n\n6243h, § (2)(x). The board’s actions with respect to these matters are “final and binding,” id. § 2(y),\n\nand therefore not amenable to judicial review, see Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158-59 (holding that\n\nArticle 6243h’s “final and binding” language precludes judicial review of the pension board’s\n\n                                                   11\n\fdecision denying police officers service credit for time they spent training as cadets in the Houston\n\nPolice Academy). Neither the Petitioners nor the City disputes the validity of the foregoing\n\nprinciples.\n\n        Rather, they assert those principles simply do not apply when the pension board\n\nfundamentally alters the terms of the statute without the City’s consent. When viewed in this way,\n\nthey contend the jurisdictional inquiry is not determined by reference to Ferrell, but instead is\n\ncontrolled by City of El Paso v. Heinrich, in which we held that sovereign immunity does not\n\nprohibit ultra vires suits seeking “to require state officials to comply with statutory or constitutional\n\nprovisions.” 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex. 2009).\n\n        Sovereign immunity and the unavailability of judicial review are related, but conceptually\n\ndistinct concepts. The former serves the pragmatic purpose of “shield[ing] the public from the costs\n\nand consequences of improvident actions of their governments.” Tooke v. City of Mexia, 197\n\nS.W.3d 325, 332 (Tex. 2006). The latter effectuates a legislative prerogative to protect the\n\ninviolability of an administrative process while simultaneously recognizing that suits challenging\n\nan administrative action necessarily implicate sovereign immunity. Whatever functional differences\n\nmight exist between these concepts, we will assume for purposes of our analysis that the ultra vires\n\ndoctrine is an exception to Article 6243h’s ban on judicial review. See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 160\n\n(Brister, J., concurring) (acknowledging that Article 6243h forecloses judicial review of claims that\n\nthe pension board misinterpreted the statute but observing that “[a] different case might be presented\n\nif the plaintiffs alleged the board was clearly violating some provision of the statute”).\n\n        As stated in Heinrich, the ultra vires doctrine applies when a government official’s conduct\n\n                                                   12\n\fis “without legal or statutory authority.” 284 S.W.3d at 372. To trigger the ultra vires exception to\n\nsovereign immunity, “a suit must not complain of a government officer’s exercise of discretion, but\n\nrather must allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to\n\nperform a purely ministerial act.” Id. In the present case, the Petitioners and the City allege both\n\ncategories of ultra vires acts. The threshold issue, however, is whether the pension board acted\n\nwithout legal authority by expanding Article 6243h’s definition of “employee” without the City’s\n\napproval and in conflict with the plain language of the statute.3 With the exception of the allegation\n\nthat the pension board unlawfully delegated decision-making authority to a committee, the validity\n\nof the remaining ultra vires claims depends on the resolution of this issue. We thus begin our\n\nanalysis there.\n\n                          1. The Board’s Construction of the Term “Employee”\n\n         Article 6243h defines the term “employee” as “any [eligible] person . . . (A) who holds a\n\nmunicipal position . . . ; (B) whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city . . . ; and\n\n(C) who is paid a regular salary for services.” TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h, § 1(11). The\n\nconstituent terms “municipal position,” “a regular full-time payroll of a city,” and “regular salary for\n\n\n\n         3\n            The Petitioners and the City also allege that the pension board’s definition of “employee” is ultra vires because\nit does not comply with section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as required by section 2(x)(2) of Article\n6243h. See T EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . A N N . ART . 6243h, § 2(x)(2). This argument, which derives support largely from their\ninterpretation of a notice of “proposed rulemaking” the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued in November 2011, merits\nlittle analysis. See 76 FR 69172–01, 69173 & 69184-86 (2011) (stating that key components of the term “governmental\nplan” in section 414(d) of the IRC are undefined, observing that no regulations interpreting that provision exist, and\nproposing a “facts and circumstances” balancing test to define an entity’s status as an “agency or instrumentality of a\nState or political subdivision of a State” for purposes of that section). To date the proposed regulations and interpretive\nguidance have not been adopted by the IRS. Even assuming the Petitioners and the City have correctly interpreted the\n“proposed rulemaking,” an ultra vires claim cannot be premised on an alleged conflict with a regulatory scheme that has\nnever been enacted.\n\n                                                              13\n\fservices” are not defined. HMEPS therefore maintains that it has the authority to interpret these\n\nterms and fill in the interstices of the statute to address newly emerging circumstances affecting the\n\nadministration of the statute “for the greatest benefit of all members.” See id. § 2(x)(2), (3).\n\nMoreover, because the statute expressly authorizes the pension board to adopt written rules and\n\nguidelines for the administration of the pension fund, HMEPS contends the board had discretion to\n\nadopt supplemental language adding contours to the statutory definition and to amend the pension-\n\nplan documents accordingly. See id. § 2(x)(1).\n\n        The Petitioners and the City’s contrary position is that no interpretation was required or\n\npermitted because, manifestly, personnel employed by CCSI are neither holding municipal positions\n\nnor being carried on the City’s payroll. Accordingly, they contend that to reach these employees,\n\nthe Trustees effectively amended and expanded the statutory definition and did so without entering\n\ninto a section 3(n) meet-and-confer agreement with the City. See id. § 3(n) (“Notwithstanding any\n\nother law, the pension board may enter into a written agreement with the city regarding pension\n\nissues and benefits. The agreement must be approved by the pension board and the governing body\n\nand signed by the mayor and by the pension board or the pension board’s designee.”).\n\n        The breadth of the pension board’s authority under Article 6243h is inescapable. As it\n\npertains to the matter at hand, the statute expressly authorizes the pension board to construe the\n\nstatute, add language it deems necessary for the administration of the pension fund, and determine\n\nall eligibility questions and all other legal and factual matters pertaining to the fund’s administration.\n\nCourts may not review the board’s actions in doing so absent a manifest conflict with express\n\nstatutory terms. That is not the case here because (1) the definition of “employee” is composed of\n\n                                                   14\n\fessential terms that are undefined and (2) the supplemental language the board adopted neither\n\ninherently nor patently conflicts with the terms of the statute.4 We therefore conclude that, as a\n\nmatter of law, the pension board did not act without legal authority in interpreting the term\n\n“employee” to include “a full-time employee of a Texas local government corporation . . . controlled\n\nby the City, upon a determination by the External Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees that\n\nsuch [local government corporation]’s employees are Employees for purposes of the [HMEPS]\n\nPlan.” The board’s additional explication of the definition as including “employees of any entity\n\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by [the City]” is also well within the board’s discretionary authority.\n\nAbsent a conspicuous and irreconcilable conflict, any further consideration of the matter would\n\nimpermissibly encroach on the unreviewable, discretionary authority afforded to the board under\n\nArticle 6243h.5 See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158–59 (holding that courts lack jurisdiction to require\n\npension board to comply with a judicial interpretation of Article 6243h).\n\n         Furthermore, there is no requirement that the pension board obtain the City’s consent to\n\n\n         4\n             By way of example, the Petitioners complain about the board’s definition of employee to the extent it includes\n“a full-time employee of a Texas local government corporation . . . controlled by the City” and “employees of any entity\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly” by the City. That definition is not inherently inconsistent with the common\nunderstanding of the term “employee” as one who “works in the service of another person (the employer) under an\nexpress or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.”\nB LA C K ’ S L A W D IC TIO N ARY 639 (10th ed. 2014). Thus, reading the terms that comprise the statutory definition of\n“employee” through the control prism articulated by the board does not so clearly conflict with the statute as to be ultra\nvires.\n\n         5\n           Although we are precluded from opining on the accuracy or reasonableness vel non of the pension board’s\ninterpretation of the statute, we observe parenthetically that the statute provides a list of ineligible employees to whom\nthe term “employee” might otherwise apply and, in doing so, suggests that the term is amenable to more precise\narticulation. See T EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . A N N . ART . 6243h, § 4. The City has also acknowledged that terms used in the\nstatute may be susceptible to more than one meaning and that the board has discretion to determine the meaning of those\nwords. In multiple “meet and confer” agreements, the City agreed that all words used in those agreements, which\nincluded the word “employee,” would have the same meaning provided in Article 6243h “as determined by the Board”\nunless specially defined in the agreement.\n\n                                                             15\n\fexercise its discretionary powers. Section 3(n) of the statute authorizes, but does not require, the\n\npension board to enter into a written agreement with the City regarding pension and benefit issues.\n\nSee TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h, § 3(n) (“[T]he pension board may enter into a written\n\nagreement with the city regarding pension issues and benefits.” (emphasis added)). Section 3(n)\n\ndoes not purport to constrain the board’s authority under section 2(x); it merely provides an\n\nalternative mechanism for the board to resolve pension issues. When the pension board and the City\n\nagree on a pension issue, the statute allows them to execute an enforceable contract to that effect.\n\nWhen they cannot agree, the statute makes the board’s determinations of fact and statutory\n\ninterpretations “final and binding.” See id. § 2(y).\n\n         Although the pension board has unquestionably broad discretionary authority under section\n\n2(x), we caution that the board may not violate the statute. Though we need not consider the matter\n\nhere, we do not foreclose the possibility that, in appropriate circumstances, a particular interpretation\n\nof the statute could be ultra vires. We observe only the absence of such circumstances here, leaving\n\nany further dispute regarding the matter to the Legislature, as it evidently intended.6 See Ferrell, 248\n\nS.W.3d at 160 (Brister, J., concurring) (noting, “Our legislators [have] decided they wish to be the\n\nfinal (and frequent) arbiter of disputes about how these pension systems should be run”;\n\nconsequently, the courts “must leave them to it, as the Texas Constitution expressly allows the\n\nLegislature to grant jurisdiction to administrative bodies rather than the courts”).\n\n\n\n\n         6\n            Another remedy available to aggrieved parties is using the elective process to alter HMEPS’s governing body.\nSee T EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . A N N . ART . 6243h, § 2(c)-(d); July 2011 MCA § 4.\n\n                                                          16\n\f                        2. Delegation of Board Authority to a Committee\n\n        The Petitioners and the City also contend the pension board acted ultra vires by delegating\n\ndecision-making authority to the External Affairs Committee in violation of the following provision\n\nin a July 2011 meet-and-confer agreement between HMEPS and the City:\n\n\n        Except for meet and confer decisions and personnel decisions, no committee shall\n        have authority to make final approvals, but shall only make recommendations to the\n        full board.\n\nThe pension board’s October 2011 resolution nevertheless states that “employees of an entity\n\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by the City are considered Employees for purposes of membership\n\nin [the Pension Fund], unless the External Affairs Committee expressly determines otherwise;\n\nprovided, however that nothing in this resolution would apply to . . . any otherwise ineligible\n\nemployee as determined by the External Affairs Committee.”\n\n        Article 6243h generally permits delegation. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h,\n\n§ 3(k) (“The pension board may allocate among the trustees the responsibilities of the pension board\n\nunder this Act and may designate any person who is not a trustee . . . to carry out the responsibilities\n\nof the pension board.”). Under section 3(k) of the statute, the pension board is permitted to delegate\n\ndecision-making authority in the manner effectuated by the October 2011 resolution.\n\n        The Petitioners and the City contend, however, that the July 2011 meet-and-confer agreement\n\namended the statute and divested the pension board of the power to delegate final decision-making\n\nauthority to a committee, requiring instead that committees “shall only make recommendations to\n\nthe full Board.” The Petitioners and the City allege that the October 2011 resolution thus violates\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fthe terms of the meet-and-confer agreement and is ultra vires. We disagree.\n\n         Meet-and-confer agreements are written contracts, and regardless of whether the parties deem\n\nthe provisions of the contract to be an “amendment” of the statute, noncompliance with a contract\n\ndoes not give rise to an ultra vires claim. See City of Houston v. Williams, 353 S.W.3d 128, 149\n\n(Tex. 2011); Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855-57 (Tex.\n\n2002). Therefore, any claim that the pension board violated the July 2011 meet-and-confer\n\nagreement is a breach-of-contract claim that cannot be maintained absent a waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity. As we have previously explained, “declaratory-judgment suits against state officials\n\nseeking to establish a contract’s validity, to enforce performance under a contract, or to impose\n\ncontractual liabilities are suits against the State. . . . Consequently, such suits cannot be maintained\n\nwithout legislative permission.” IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855-56. No waiver of immunity is alleged\n\nor supported on the record before the Court.7\n\n                              C. Equal Protection and Due Course of Law\n\n         In addition to asserting ultra vires claims as a basis for subject-matter jurisdiction, the\n\nPetitioners further contend that sovereign immunity does not bar relief on their claims under the\n\nTexas Constitution. See, e.g., Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d 618, 621 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(suits to require state officials to comply with constitutional provisions are not prohibited by\n\nsovereign immunity); see also TEX . CONST . ART . I §§ 3 (equal-protection clause), 19 (due-course-of-\n\nlaw clause). While it is true that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit to vindicate constitutional\n\n        7\n           Although the Legislature has waived a local governmental entity’s sovereign immunity to suit for contracts\nfor goods or services, the waiver does not apply here because the meet-and-confer agreement is not a contract for goods\nor services. See Zachry Constr. Corp. v. Port of Houston Auth. of Harris Cnty, 449 S.W .3d 98, 106 (Tex. 2014).\n\n                                                          18\n\frights, Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372, immunity from suit is not waived if the constitutional claims\n\nare facially invalid, see Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, 345 S.W.3d 1, 11 (Tex. 2011).\n\n                                        1. Equal Protection\n\n       The Petitioners allege the pension board treated them differently than former city employees\n\nwho now work for separate legal entities due to municipal outsourcing. For example, the Petitioners\n\nargue the City employees working at the Houston Zoo became employees of Houston Zoo, Inc., and\n\nthat the pension fund determined a separation of service occurred as a result. According to the\n\nPetitioners, the zoo employees were declassified as “employees” and pension-system “members” and\n\nsome were thereafter permitted to collect their pension benefits while remaining employed in\n\nessentially the same jobs. The Petitioners contend they are similarly situated to the zoo employees\n\nbut are being treated differently. They further assert—as they must to state a valid equal-protection\n\nclaim—that the pension board’s disparate determination that CCSI employees remain members of\n\nthe pension system is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental objective.\n\n       The Texas Constitution provides that all people “have equal rights, and no man, or set of\n\nmen, is entitled to exclusive separate public emoluments, or privileges.” TEX . CONST . ART . 1 § 3.\n\nThe Petitioners contend the pension board’s determination that they remain members of HMEPS\n\nviolated their right to equal protection of the law. To state a viable equal-protection claim under the\n\nTexas Constitution, the Petitioners must show they have been “treated differently from others\n\nsimilarly situated.” Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. City of Sunset Valley, 146 S.W.3d 637, 647 (Tex. 2004).\n\nBecause neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right is involved, the Petitioners must\n\nfurther demonstrate that the challenged decision is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental\n\n                                                  19\n\fpurpose. First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Combs, 258 S.W.3d 627, 639 (Tex. 2008). In conducting a\n\nrational-basis review, we consider whether the challenged action has a rational basis and whether\n\nuse of the challenged classification would reasonably promote that purpose.                           Id.    These\n\ndeterminations are “not subject to courtroom fact-finding and may be based on rational speculation\n\nunsupported by evidence or empirical data.” FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315\n\n(1993).8\n\n        Even assuming the pension board has in fact treated similarly situated employees differently,\n\nwe hold the Petitioners failed to plead a viable equal-protection claim because the board’s actions\n\nare rationally related to at least two legitimate government objectives which are promoted by the\n\nchallenged classification. First, the pension board has a legitimate interest in preserving sources of\n\npension funding that are adequate to meet the demands on the fund, which it may rationally\n\naccomplish by ensuring the City meets its contribution obligations to the pension system. See 405\n\nS.W.3d at 225 (citing U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 174 (1980), which recognizes\n\npreservation of pension funds as a legitimate basis for distinguishing among pensioners). Continued\n\ndepletion of the workforce through nominal privatization of municipal services would undoubtedly\n\nrestrict or significantly impair the pension system’s funding sources. The preservation of funding\n\nsources is a legitimate and rational basis for concluding that, under the circumstances presented here,\n\nconvention department workers performing municipal functions as CCSI employees remain\n\n\n\n\n        8\n           Federal equal-protection cases are instructive with regard to equal-protection challenges under the Texas\nConstitution. See First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Combs, 258 S.W .3d 627, 638 (Tex. 2008).\n\n                                                        20\n\fmembers of the pension system.9 Given the long-term ramifications of concerted efforts to reduce\n\nthe City’s contributions to the pension fund, any previous failure of the pension board to perceive\n\nor acknowledge a threat to pension-funding sources does not change the analysis of this issue. Cf.\n\nMcDonald v. Bd. of Election Comm’rs of Chicago, 394 U.S. 802, 808 (1969) (“[A] legislature\n\ntraditionally has been allowed to take reform ‘one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the\n\nproblem which seems most acute to the legislative mind[]’; and a legislature need not run the risk\n\nof losing an entire remedial scheme simply because it failed, through inadvertence or otherwise, to\n\ncover every evil that might conceivably have been attacked.” (internal citation omitted)).\n\n         The pension board also has a legitimate interest in policies that lessen the risk of overpaying\n\npensioners or allowing them to “double dip.” See, e.g, Connolly v. McCall, 254 F.3d 36, 43 (2d Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam) (recognizing “legitimate interest in saving money by barring pension practices\n\nthat have the character of ‘double-dipping’”). In this case, the pension board has disallowed\n\nfunctional City employees from collecting government-funded HMEPS retirement benefits while\n\nalso receiving salaries and 401(k) contributions originating in the dollar-for-dollar expense\n\nreimbursements CCSI collects from Houston First, the City controlled and tax-funded local\n\ngovernment corporation. The pension board’s decision to eliminate further demands on the public\n\nfisc is rationally related to its interest in preventing employment arrangements that permit forms of\n\n         9\n            Petitioners contend that “the refusal to pay earned pensions to eligible former employees or insisting that\nformer employees pay into a pension fund on which they cannot claim a pension cannot be rationally related to\npreserving a pension fund which has as its purpose to provide pensions for eligible former employees.” This argument\npresupposes eligibility and separation from service, which are matters reserved to the board’s exclusive determination.\nIt is also based on a faulty premise. The pension fund does not have a singular purpose of paying benefits as each\nmember becomes eligible; rather, its principal purpose is to administer the fund for the greatest benefit of all members.\nThat purpose is imperiled if the work force becomes insufficient to subsidize the pension fund for current or future\nretirees.\n\n                                                           21\n\f“double dipping.”\n\n       Because we conclude that any differentiation between employees is rationally related to\n\nlegitimate governmental objectives, the Petitioners’ equal-protection claims fail as a matter of law.\n\n                                       2. Due Course of Law\n\n       In their remaining claims, the Petitioners contend they have been deprived of vested property\n\nrights without due process. See TEX . CONST . ART I § 19; see also Univ. of Tex. Med. Sch. v. Than,\n\n901 S.W.2d 926, 929 (Tex. 1995) (no meaningful distinction exists between the terms “due process”\n\nand “due course of law”). Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano allege HMEPS unconstitutionally\n\ndenied them retirement benefits they would otherwise have been eligible to collect after a separation\n\nof service from the City. Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim were not eligible for retirement at the time\n\nthey became CCSI employees, but they claim a vested property right in funds deducted from their\n\nsalaries and contributed to the pension fund on their behalf.\n\n       The Texas Constitution provides that “[n]o citizen of this State shall be deprived of life,\n\nliberty, property, or privileges or immunities . . . except by the due course of the law of the land.”\n\nTEX . CONST . ART . I, § 19. Before any substantive or procedural due-process rights attach, however,\n\nthe Petitioners must have a liberty or property interest that is entitled to constitutional protection.\n\nThan, 901 S.W.2d at 929. A constitutionally protected right must be a vested right, which is\n\n“‘something more than a mere expectancy based upon an anticipated continuance of an existing\n\nlaw.’” City of Dallas v. Trammell, 101 S.W.2d 1009, 1014 (Tex. 1937) (quoting Dodge v. Bd. of\n\nEduc. of City of Chicago, 5 N.E.2d 84, 86 (Ill. 1936)). The court of appeals held, and we agree, that\n\nthe Petitioners’ due-course claims are facially invalid because the Petitioners have no vested property\n\n                                                  22\n\fright to the pension-plan contributions and future retirement benefits at issue. 405 S.W.3d at 226-27.\n\n        Our decision in the City of Dallas v. Trammell is dispositive of the Petitioners’ claims to a\n\nvested property interest in retirement benefits as of the date they otherwise became eligible but for\n\nthe pension board’s articulated and applied definition of the term “employee” in Article 6243h. In\n\nTrammell, we considered the constitutionality of a statutory amendment that effected a substantial\n\nreduction in the monthly pension benefits payable to a police-department retiree. Id. at 1009. The\n\npurpose of the contested enactment was to rectify inadequacies in pension-plan funding that\n\nthreatened the plan’s long-term solvency. Id. at 1010, 1015-16. In challenging the statutory\n\namendment, the retiree asserted that he had a vested property right in the amount of the monthly\n\npension benefit that was granted to him on the date of his retirement and that any subsequent\n\nreduction of that amount was unconstitutional. Id. The question presented was whether, as of the\n\ndate of retirement, a pensioner has a vested right in future installment payments that could not be\n\naltered by subsequent legislative action. Id. at 1011.\n\n        In analyzing the issue, we adopted\n\n        the rule that the right of a pensioner to receive monthly payments from the pension\n        fund after retirement from service, or after his right to participate in the fund has\n        accrued, is predicated upon the anticipated continuance of existing laws, and is\n        subordinate to the right of the Legislature to abolish the pension system, or diminish\n        the accrued benefits of pensions thereunder . . . .\n\nId. at 1013. Applying this rule, we said there is no vested interest in future pension installments that\n\nwould preclude the Legislature from repealing or modifying the law on which the pension system\n\nis founded, even if doing so would adversely impact or even abolish the right to future payment of\n\nunaccrued benefits. Id. at 1012, 1014; see also id. 1013-15. Stated another way, the right to receive\n\n                                                  23\n\fbenefits under a pension fund “is made subject to the reserved power of the Legislature to amend,\n\nmodify, or repeal the law upon which the pension system is erected, and this necessarily constitutes\n\na qualification upon the anticipated pension and a reserved right to terminate or diminish it.” Id. at\n\n1014. We concluded Trammell with “a direct holding that as to future installments of a pension the\n\npensioner has no vested right,” id. at 1017, and we have since affirmed Trammell’s root analysis on\n\nseveral occasions. See Ex Parte Abell, 613 S.W.2d 255, 261-62 (Tex. 1981); Bd. of Managers of\n\nHarris Cnty. Hosp. Dist. v. Pension Bd., 449 S.W.2d 33, 37 (Tex. 1969); Woods v. Reilly, 218\n\nS.W.2d 437, 441 (Tex. 1949).\n\n       Although Trammell is directly adverse to the Petitioners’ claims, they question Trammell’s\n\ncontinued vitality based on a subsequent amendment to the Texas Constitution, citing article XVI,\n\nsection 67 of the Texas Constitution and City of Fort Worth v. Howerton, 236 S.W.2d 615, 619 (Tex.\n\n1951). According to the Petitioners, the cited authority negates legislative authority to abolish\n\nHMEPS because under section 67(c), if the Legislature were to abolish the pension system (as\n\nopposed to merely amending the statute), it would be required to pass a law authorizing the City to\n\nelect to establish a pension system for its municipal employees. See TEX . CONST . ART . XVI, § 67(c).\n\nPer Howerton, if the City so elected, any subsequently established pension fund would no longer be\n\nsubject to legislative control. See Howerton, 236 S.W.2d at 619 (if city adopts a pension fund\n\npursuant to constitutional authority, the Legislature is not authorized to change the plan without the\n\ncity’s consent).\n\n       Obviously, certain contingencies must occur before an interest could be said to be fixed and\n\nunalterable by the Legislature as contemplated in Howerton; the main ones being that the Legislature\n\n                                                 24\n\fwould have to abolish the pension system and the City would have to elect to establish a pension\n\nfund. Perhaps the City would elect to do so if given the opportunity, but even if the City were to\n\nestablish its own pension system, the Petitioners cite no limit on the City’s authority to amend or\n\nabolish any such system. Thus, we are not persuaded the cited authority undermines Trammell’s\n\ncore holding that no vested property right exists when a pension fund can be amended or abolished\n\nby the governing authority; it makes no difference whether the authority with the power to abolish\n\nthe pension system is the Legislature or some other entity. The crux of Trammell’s analysis is that\n\nany right emanating from a mere expectancy is not vested, and the Petitioners have cited no authority\n\nelevating their interests in the pension fund beyond a mere expectancy to a constitutional guarantee.\n\nWe therefore reject the distinction the Petitioners attempt to draw between Trammell and the\n\ncircumstances presented here.10\n\n         Approaching the matter from a different angle, the Petitioners embrace Trammell to the\n\nextent it confirms that interests in pension benefits are fixed, and thus vested, when all contingencies\n\nto entitlement have occurred. The Petitioners contend that any contingencies to their entitlement to\n\npension benefits were satisfied when they became eligible to retire, even though no separation from\n\nservice occurred under Article 6243h, as interpreted by the pension board. Trammell, however, does\n\nnot support the Petitioners’ contention that their retirement interests became fixed at the time of their\n\neligibility for retirement. In fact, Trammell does the opposite, expressly holding that the plaintiff,\n\n\n         10\n           A different scenario might be presented if article XVI, section 66 of the Texas Constitution were applicable.\nThat constitutional provision, which was added by amendment in 2003, expressly protects benefits under certain\nretirement systems from being reduced or otherwise impaired. See T EX . C O N ST . A RT . XVI, § 66. The guarantees\nafforded by section 66 are not implicated here because, by a three-to-one margin, City of Houston voters opted to\nexercise an exemption authorized by that amendment. See id. § 66(h).\n\n                                                          25\n\fwho had already retired and had actually been receiving pension benefits, had no vested right in\n\nfuture installments of the same. Applying Trammell’s “direct holding,” we conclude that Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano have no vested property right in the retirement benefits at issue.\n\n       With regard to the remaining constitutional claims, we observed in Trammell that “[i]t is well\n\nsettled that the mere circumstance that a part of a pension fund is made up by deductions from the\n\nagreed compensation of employees does not in itself give the pensioner a vested right in the fund,\n\nand does not make it any less a public fund subject to the control of the Legislature.” 101 S.W.2d\n\nat 1012-13. In Devon v. City of San Antonio, we relied on Trammell in declining to recognize an\n\nemployee’s claimed interest in contributions to a municipal pension fund even though those\n\ncontributions had been withheld from his wages. We explained there that\n\n       [t]he deductions withheld from [the employee’s] wages and paid into the pension\n       fund never belonged to him, but remained public money used for a public purpose.\n       They were not first segregated from the public funds so as to become [the\n       employee’s] private property and then paid into the pension fund; rather the\n       deductions were “set aside from one public fund and turned over to another” and are\n       no less public money after the payment into the pension fund than before.\n\n443 S.W.2d 598, 600 (Tex. App.—Waco 1969, writ ref’d) (quoting Trammell, 101 S.W.2d at 1013);\n\nsee also Jud v. City of San Antonio, 313 S.W.2d 903, 905 (Tex. Civ. App.—Eastland 1958, writ\n\nref’d) (overruling “appellant’s contention that he has a vested right in contributions to the pension\n\nfund”). The same is true here. Accordingly, we conclude that Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim lack\n\na vested property right in their pension-fund contributions.\n\n       Because the Petitioners have no vested rights in the retirement benefits and pension-plan\n\ncontributions at issue, we hold their pleadings conclusively negate the existence of subject-matter\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fjurisdiction over their constitutional claims.\n\n                                          III. Conclusion\n\n       The Petitioners and the City failed to plead actionable ultra vires and constitutional claims\n\nagainst HMEPS and the Trustees. Subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims is therefore lacking\n\nas a matter of law. We therefore affirm the court of appeals’ judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      ____________________________________\n                                                      Eva M.

At issue is whether\n\nHouston Municipal Employees Pension System (HMEPS) board members violated HMEPS’s\n\nenabling statute by requiring the petitioners’ continued participation in the City of Houston’s\n\ndefined-benefit pension plan. As provided by statute, the pension board has exclusive, final, and\n\nbinding authority to interpret, construe, and supplement omissions in the statute and to determine\n\fall questions pertaining to eligibility for membership, services, and benefits. TEX . REV . CIV . STAT .\n\nANN . ART . 6243h, § 2(x)-(y). Consistent with this legislative mandate, we have held that HMEPS’s\n\nenabling statute precludes judicial review of such matters.

To defeat the presumptive jurisdictional bar, the\n\npetitioners assert that subject-matter jurisdiction exists here because the pension-board members\n\nacted ultra vires and violated the Texas Constitution by augmenting the statute rather than\n\ninterpreting it.\n\n        The underlying dispute arose when the City of Houston attempted to remove a division of\n\nemployees from the pension system by forming quasi-governmental entities to perform the same\n\ngovernmental functions using the same employees. Contemporaneously with the City’s restructuring\n\nefforts, the pension board determined that those employees remained under the City’s effective\n\ncontrol and payroll and therefore fell within the ambit of the statutory definition of “employee,”\n\nwhich defines an individual’s status as a HMEPS member. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART .\n\n6243h, §§ 1(11) (defining “employee”), (13) (defining “member”). The board’s decision resulted\n\nin otherwise eligible members being denied “retiree” status and further required affected employees\n\nto continue making contributions to the pension fund despite being under the immediate employ of\n\na third-party entity. See id. §§ 1(22) (defining “retiree”), (24) (defining “separation from service”).\n\nThe individual petitioners and the City assert that the pension board unlawfully redefined the term\n\n“employee” to capture these employees after they had ceased working for the City. Considering\n\nHMEPS and the board members’ plea to the jurisdiction, the trial court found jurisdiction to be\n\nlacking, and the court of appeals affirmed. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209 (Tex.

Background\n\n         HMEPS is organized and operated under Article 6243h of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes,\n\nwhich requires cities with a population of more than 1.5 million to make contributions to an\n\nemployee pension fund in an amount based in part on the combined salary of the pension system’s\n\nmembers.1 TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h, §§ 1-28; see also id. § 8(d). The statute defines\n\na “member” of the pension fund as “each active employee included in the pension system,” except\n\nfor statutorily ineligible employees. Id. § 1(13). An “employee” is “any [eligible] person . . . who\n\nholds a municipal position[,] . . . whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city[,] . . .\n\nand who is paid a regular salary for services.” Id. § 1(11).\n\n         HMEPS is governed by a Board of Trustees imbued with broad authority to administer,\n\nmanage, and operate the pension fund. See id. § 2(x). Among other powers, the pension board can\n\n(1) adopt written rules and guidelines for the administration of the pension fund; (2) interpret and\n\nconstrue the Act and any summary-plan documents and procedures, provided such construction is\n\nconsistent with section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC); (3) “correct\n\n\n\n         1\n             Presently, only the City of Houston meets Article 6243h’s population threshold.\n\n                                                            3\n\fany defect, supply any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency” in the statute in the manner and\n\nto the extent the board deems “for the greatest benefit of all members”; and (4) determine all legal\n\nand factual questions pertaining to the fund’s administration and eligibility for membership, services,\n\nand benefits. Id. So broad is the board’s authority that the statute expressly mandates that “[t]he\n\ndetermination of any fact by the pension board and the pension board’s interpretation of [the] Act\n\nare final and binding on any interested party, including members, deferred participants, retirees, . . .\n\nand the city.” Id. § 2(y). But though the board’s authority under the statute is indisputably broad,\n\nthe allegation in the underlying lawsuit is that the pension board crossed the line between\n\ninterpreting the statute, which it is expressly authorized to do, and unlawfully altering it by\n\nsupplementing the statutory definition of “employee” in a manner that encompasses personnel the\n\nCity has outsourced to a third-party entity.\n\n        At the heart of the dispute is the City’s effort to reduce its pension-fund contributions by\n\nusing outsourcing as part of a comprehensive cost-saving initiative. Historically, the City has\n\nemployed more than 100 people in its Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department\n\n(convention department) to operate municipally-owned properties such as theaters, convention\n\ncenters, and parking lots. In May 2011, however, the City announced plans to remove those\n\nemployees from the municipal payroll—and thus the pension system—by outsourcing convention\n\nand entertainment municipal functions to Houston First Corporation, a City-controlled, tax-funded\n\nlocal government corporation. Among other indicia of control, Houston First’s budget is approved\n\nby the Houston City Council, and its board is appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city\n\ncouncil.\n\n                                                   4\n\f       In response to the City’s transition plan, the pension board announced in August 2011 that\n\nthe definition of “employee” in Article 6243h “includes a full-time employee of a Texas local\n\ngovernment corporation . . . controlled by the City, upon a determination by the External Affairs\n\nCommittee of the Board of Trustees that such [local government corporation]’s employees are\n\nEmployees for purposes of the [HMEPS] Plan.” Thereafter, the board amended the pension-plan\n\ndocuments to incorporate this construction of the term “employee.”\n\n       Undeterred, the City formed a nonprofit entity named Houston First Foundation and notified\n\nthe pension board that the newly formed entity would employ all the City employees who had been\n\nslated to join Houston First Corporation. Believing Houston First Foundation to be a wholly-owned\n\nand controlled subsidiary of Houston First Corporation—and by extension, the City—the pension\n\nboard adopted a resolution in October 2011 that reiterated the previously adopted construction of the\n\nterm “employee” and further announced that “employees of any entity controlled, directly or\n\nindirectly, by [the City] are considered Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS, unless\n\nthe External Affairs Committee expressly determines otherwise.”\n\n       Subsequently, the City abandoned Houston First Foundation and formed another nonprofit\n\ncorporation called Convention and Cultural Services, Inc. (CCSI) to operate in conjunction with\n\nHouston First to provide convention and entertainment services to the City. Although Houston First\n\nwould still provide those services to the City, it would not employ the service personnel directly.\n\nInstead, CCSI would employ and lease the workforce to Houston First, its only client. By agreement,\n\nHouston First was obligated to fully reimburse CCSI for “all internal and external costs and expenses\n\nassociated with” the provision of personnel. CCSI purported to operate independently, but Houston\n\n                                                 5\n\fFirst and CCSI had overlapping executives, some of whom had been City employees.\n\n       In a letter to the pension system’s executive director, the City Attorney expressly disavowed\n\nany right or ability of the City to control CCSI, stating “[n]either the City, the Mayor, nor City\n\nCouncil will have any appointment authority or control over the corporation or its board of\n\ndirectors.” Instead, CCSI was described as “a non-governmental, non-profit corporation whose\n\nboard will be self perpetuating.” The letter further explained that “[CCSI] will be contracting for\n\nits own employee benefits, including a [401(k)] plan, and will not participate in any City of Houston\n\nbenefit programs.” The City thus took the position that following transition of convention\n\ndepartment employees to CCSI, the employees would no longer be City employees or HMEPS\n\nmembers and, as a result, the City would not be obligated to make contributions to the pension fund\n\nbased on those employees’ salaries.\n\n       Despite this maneuver, the pension board’s External Affairs Committee issued a resolution\n\nin November 2011 to the effect that the leased workers “would be in a control group and would\n\nremain as members of the plan.” Though directly employed by CCSI, the leased employees\n\n(1) performed substantially similar duties as they had when employed directly by the City;\n\n(2) operated in the same governmental facilities; (3) were subject to removal from their positions at\n\nthe City’s request; and (4) were compensated using funds furnished by the publicly-funded local\n\ngovernment corporation, which was contractually obligated to reimburse CCSI for the employees’\n\nservices on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\n\n       With the exception of a group of City employees who were within a few years of retiring, the\n\nCity proceeded to transfer convention and entertainment services and employees in accordance with\n\n                                                 6\n\fthe transition plan.    When the transfer of personnel had been consummated, three CCSI\n\nemployees—John Klumb, Veronica McClelland, and Vivian Montejano—sought full retirement\n\nbenefits from HMEPS on the basis that their employment with the City had ended when they became\n\nCCSI employees and, at that time, they were otherwise eligible to retire. See id. §§ 1(22) (defining\n\n“retiree”), (1)(24) (defining “separation from service”), 10(b) (eligibility requirements for retirement\n\nbenefits); July 2011 Amended & Restated Meet & Confer Agreement Between HEMPS and the City\n\n§ 14 (July 2011 MCA) (eligibility for retirement pension). Three other CCSI employees—John\n\nGonzalez, Anita Robles, and Charmaine Pilgrim—claimed that, although not yet eligible to retire,\n\nthey were no longer employed by the City and were therefore entitled to defer retirement status and\n\ncease having HMEPS contributions of 5% deducted from their salaries. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT .\n\nANN . ART . 6243h, §§ 8(a) (requiring employer to deduct pension-fund contributions from members’\n\nsalaries during employment), 12 (deferred-retirement option); July 2011 MCA § 8. Based on the\n\npension board’s interpretation of the term “employee” in Article 6243h, as adopted in the revised\n\npension-plan documents, the External Affairs Committee concluded that the transferred employees\n\nremained “employees,” and thus “members” of the pension system, and that no separation from\n\nmunicipal service had occurred.\n\n        Klumb, McClelland, Montejano, Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim (collectively, the Petitioners)\n\nsued HMEPS, alleging violations of the Texas Constitution and breach of contract. The Petitioners\n\nsought monetary damages and a declaration that they were no longer City employees as that term is\n\ndefined in Article 6243h. In a plea to the jurisdiction, HMEPS argued that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction because (1) Article 6243h precludes judicial review of the pension\n\n                                                   7\n\fboard’s decisions interpreting that statute and determining eligibility for membership and benefits\n\nand (2) sovereign immunity bars the Petitioners’ breach-of-contract and constitutional claims.\n\n       Petitioners responded by amending their petition to assert ultra vires, equal-protection, and\n\ndue-course-of-law claims against the five pension-board members (Trustees) who voted to amend\n\nthe HMEPS pension-plan documents to “illegally change the definition of ‘employee’ contained in\n\nSection 1(11) of Article 6243h.” The Petitioners requested declaratory relief and an injunction\n\nagainst the Trustees based on the following alleged ultra vires acts: (1) voting to approve a\n\ndefinition of the term “employee” that improperly alters the statutory definition of that term;\n\n(2) compounding that unauthorized act by adopting the October 2011 resolution, which did the same;\n\n(3) authorizing the External Affairs Committee to determine who qualifies as an “employee” in\n\ncontravention of a written agreement with the City; (4) construing Article 6243h in a manner\n\ninconsistent with section 401 of the IRC; (5) refusing a non-discretionary duty to pay Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano their retirement benefits following separation of service from the City;\n\nand (6) refusing a non-discretionary duty to recognize Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim’s separation\n\nfrom service with the City. According to the Petitioners, the pension board’s supplemental definition\n\nof the term “employee” effected an amendment of the statute, which was neither approved by the\n\nCity nor adopted in accordance with statutorily mandated procedures and historical practice (what\n\nthe parties refer to as “meet-and-confer agreements” between HMEPS and the City). See id. § 3(n)\n\n(authorizing the pension board, “[n]otwithstanding any other law,” to “enter into a written agreement\n\nwith the city regarding pension issues and benefits” that is binding on the City and HMEPS members\n\nif approved under procedures specified in the statute). The Petitioners further asserted the pension\n\n                                                 8\n\fboard had improperly delegated authority to the External Affairs Committee in violation of an\n\nexisting meet-and-confer agreement, which states that, except for personnel decisions “no committee\n\n[of the pension fund] shall have authority to make final approvals, but shall only make\n\nrecommendations to the full board.”\n\n        The City intervened, generally aligning itself with the Petitioners and seeking similar\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n        HMEPS and the Trustees (collectively, HMEPS) filed an amended plea to the jurisdiction,\n\narguing that both the pension board’s interpretation of the term “employee” and its application to the\n\nfactual circumstances presented were “final and binding” with no right of judicial review. See id.\n\n§ 2(x)-(y); Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158-59. HMEPS further asserted sovereign immunity bars the\n\nPetitioners’ breach-of-contract and constitutional claims because (1) violation of a meet-and-confer\n\nagreement cannot serve as a basis for an ultra vires claim and (2) the constitutional claims are\n\nfacially invalid. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed\n\nthe suit for want of jurisdiction.\n\n        The court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) Texas courts have jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether the pension board’s actions are ultra vires; (2) the pension board’s construction of the term\n\n“employee” was not an ultra vires act because it was consistent with the board’s exclusive authority\n\nto interpret–and supply any omission in—the statute; (3) violation of a meet-and-confer agreement\n\ndoes not support an ultra vires claim; (4) the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether the board’s supplemental definition of “employee” disqualifies the pension plan under the\n\nIRC; (5) the Petitioners’ equal-protection challenge is meritless because preservation of funding\n\n                                                   9\n\fsources for the pension fund provides a rational basis for continuing to treat the transferred\n\nemployees as employees of the City; (6) the petitioner’s due-course-of-law claim fails because the\n\nemployees lack a vested property interest in the retirement benefits at issue and the funds deducted\n\nfrom their salaries as contributions to the pension fund; and (7) the trial court did not err in striking\n\nand refusing to consider an affidavit offered to establish the board’s intent to amend, rather than\n\ninterpret, the statute and, in any event, the exclusion of the evidence was harmless. 405 S.W.3d at\n\n215-27.\n\n         On appeal to this Court, the Petitioners and the City raise essentially the same grounds for\n\ndenying HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction. In the alternative, they assert that the evidence raises a\n\nfact issue concerning the existence of jurisdiction that must be resolved by the trier of fact on remand\n\nto the trial court.2\n\n                                                     II.

Miranda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894512\"><a href=\"/opinion/894512/texas-dept-parks-and-wildlife-v-miranda/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (Tex. 2004). The existence of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction is a question of law that can be challenged, as it was here, by a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nBland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449865/bland-independent-school-dist-v-blue/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (Tex. 2000). We review de novo the trial\n\n\n\n         2\n           Relatedly, the Petitioners and the City complain that the court of appeals erroneously affirmed the exclusion\nof affidavit evidence pertaining to the Trustees’ subjective intent to amend the definition of “employee.” W ith respect\nto the ultra vires claims, the threshold jurisdictional issue boils down to whether the pension board articulated an\ninterpretation of a statutory term or altered it. This is a matter of statutory construction, which is determined as a matter\nof law considering the statute’s plain language. See, e.g., State v. Shumake, 199 S.W .3d 279, 284 (Tex. 2006).\nConsequently, evidence of the Trustees’ subjective intent is irrelevant.\n\n                                                             10\n\fcourt’s disposition of HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226.\n\n        In doing so, we consider the pleadings and factual assertions, as well as any evidence in the\n\nrecord that is relevant to the jurisdictional issue. City of Elsa v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895263\"><a href=\"/opinion/895263/city-of-elsa-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625\n\n(Tex. 2010). Construing the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiffs, we look to the pleaders’\n\nintent and determine whether the pleaders have alleged facts affirmatively demonstrating the court’s\n\njurisdiction to entertain the matter. Id. When a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts, we consider whether evidence in the record raises a fact issue, and if it does, the\n\njurisdictional issue must be resolved by the trier of fact. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227-28.\n\nConversely, the trial court must rule on the plea as a matter of law if the evidence is undisputed or\n\nfails to raise a fact question. Id. at 228.\n\n        The jurisdictional issue in this case has two aspects. The first is whether courts have\n\nauthority to review the pension board’s actions under an ultra vires theory notwithstanding Article\n\n6243h’s ban on judicial review. The second is whether sovereign immunity bars the Petitioners’\n\nconstitutional claims.\n\n                                        B. Ultra Vires Claims\n\n        The pension board has broad authority to interpret and apply Article 6243h, to supplement\n\nomissions in its terms, to adopt written rules and guidelines for the fund’s administration, and to\n\ndetermine all questions of law and fact pertaining to the same. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART .\n\n6243h, § (2)(x). The board’s actions with respect to these matters are “final and binding,” id. § 2(y),\n\nand therefore not amenable to judicial review, see Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158-59 (holding that\n\nArticle 6243h’s “final and binding” language precludes judicial review of the pension board’s\n\n                                                   11\n\fdecision denying police officers service credit for time they spent training as cadets in the Houston\n\nPolice Academy). Neither the Petitioners nor the City disputes the validity of the foregoing\n\nprinciples.\n\n        Rather, they assert those principles simply do not apply when the pension board\n\nfundamentally alters the terms of the statute without the City’s consent. When viewed in this way,\n\nthey contend the jurisdictional inquiry is not determined by reference to Ferrell, but instead is\n\ncontrolled by City of El Paso v. Heinrich, in which we held that sovereign immunity does not\n\nprohibit ultra vires suits seeking “to require state officials to comply with statutory or constitutional\n\nprovisions.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372 (Tex. 2009).\n\n        Sovereign immunity and the unavailability of judicial review are related, but conceptually\n\ndistinct concepts. The former serves the pragmatic purpose of “shield[ing] the public from the costs\n\nand consequences of improvident actions of their governments.” Tooke v. City of Mexia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1400009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1400009/tooke-v-city-of-mexia/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (Tex. 2006). The latter effectuates a legislative prerogative to protect the\n\ninviolability of an administrative process while simultaneously recognizing that suits challenging\n\nan administrative action necessarily implicate sovereign immunity. Whatever functional differences\n\nmight exist between these concepts, we will assume for purposes of our analysis that the ultra vires\n\ndoctrine is an exception to Article 6243h’s ban on judicial review. See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 160\n\n(Brister, J., concurring) (acknowledging that Article 6243h forecloses judicial review of claims that\n\nthe pension board misinterpreted the statute but observing that “[a] different case might be presented\n\nif the plaintiffs alleged the board was clearly violating some provision of the statute”).\n\n        As stated in Heinrich, the ultra vires doctrine applies when a government official’s conduct\n\n                                                   12\n\fis “without legal or statutory authority.” 284 S.W.3d at 372. To trigger the ultra vires exception to\n\nsovereign immunity, “a suit must not complain of a government officer’s exercise of discretion, but\n\nrather must allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to\n\nperform a purely ministerial act.” Id. In the present case, the Petitioners and the City allege both\n\ncategories of ultra vires acts. The threshold issue, however, is whether the pension board acted\n\nwithout legal authority by expanding Article 6243h’s definition of “employee” without the City’s\n\napproval and in conflict with the plain language of the statute.3 With the exception of the allegation\n\nthat the pension board unlawfully delegated decision-making authority to a committee, the validity\n\nof the remaining ultra vires claims depends on the resolution of this issue. We thus begin our\n\nanalysis there.\n\n                          1. The Board’s Construction of the Term “Employee”\n\n         Article 6243h defines the term “employee” as “any [eligible] person . . . (A) who holds a\n\nmunicipal position . . . ; (B) whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city . . . ; and\n\n(C) who is paid a regular salary for services.” TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h, § 1(11). The\n\nconstituent terms “municipal position,” “a regular full-time payroll of a city,” and “regular salary for\n\n\n\n         3\n            The Petitioners and the City also allege that the pension board’s definition of “employee” is ultra vires because\nit does not comply with section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as required by section 2(x)(2) of Article\n6243h. See T EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . A N N . ART . 6243h, § 2(x)(2). This argument, which derives support largely from their\ninterpretation of a notice of “proposed rulemaking” the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued in November 2011, merits\nlittle analysis. See 76 FR 69172–01, 69173 & 69184-86 (2011) (stating that key components of the term “governmental\nplan” in section 414(d) of the IRC are undefined, observing that no regulations interpreting that provision exist, and\nproposing a “facts and circumstances” balancing test to define an entity’s status as an “agency or instrumentality of a\nState or political subdivision of a State” for purposes of that section). To date the proposed regulations and interpretive\nguidance have not been adopted by the IRS. Even assuming the Petitioners and the City have correctly interpreted the\n“proposed rulemaking,” an ultra vires claim cannot be premised on an alleged conflict with a regulatory scheme that has\nnever been enacted.\n\n                                                              13\n\fservices” are not defined. HMEPS therefore maintains that it has the authority to interpret these\n\nterms and fill in the interstices of the statute to address newly emerging circumstances affecting the\n\nadministration of the statute “for the greatest benefit of all members.” See id. § 2(x)(2), (3).\n\nMoreover, because the statute expressly authorizes the pension board to adopt written rules and\n\nguidelines for the administration of the pension fund, HMEPS contends the board had discretion to\n\nadopt supplemental language adding contours to the statutory definition and to amend the pension-\n\nplan documents accordingly. See id. § 2(x)(1).\n\n        The Petitioners and the City’s contrary position is that no interpretation was required or\n\npermitted because, manifestly, personnel employed by CCSI are neither holding municipal positions\n\nnor being carried on the City’s payroll. Accordingly, they contend that to reach these employees,\n\nthe Trustees effectively amended and expanded the statutory definition and did so without entering\n\ninto a section 3(n) meet-and-confer agreement with the City. See id. § 3(n) (“Notwithstanding any\n\nother law, the pension board may enter into a written agreement with the city regarding pension\n\nissues and benefits. The agreement must be approved by the pension board and the governing body\n\nand signed by the mayor and by the pension board or the pension board’s designee.”).\n\n        The breadth of the pension board’s authority under Article 6243h is inescapable. As it\n\npertains to the matter at hand, the statute expressly authorizes the pension board to construe the\n\nstatute, add language it deems necessary for the administration of the pension fund, and determine\n\nall eligibility questions and all other legal and factual matters pertaining to the fund’s administration.\n\nCourts may not review the board’s actions in doing so absent a manifest conflict with express\n\nstatutory terms. That is not the case here because (1) the definition of “employee” is composed of\n\n                                                   14\n\fessential terms that are undefined and (2) the supplemental language the board adopted neither\n\ninherently nor patently conflicts with the terms of the statute.4 We therefore conclude that, as a\n\nmatter of law, the pension board did not act without legal authority in interpreting the term\n\n“employee” to include “a full-time employee of a Texas local government corporation . . . controlled\n\nby the City, upon a determination by the External Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees that\n\nsuch [local government corporation]’s employees are Employees for purposes of the [HMEPS]\n\nPlan.” The board’s additional explication of the definition as including “employees of any entity\n\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by [the City]” is also well within the board’s discretionary authority.\n\nAbsent a conspicuous and irreconcilable conflict, any further consideration of the matter would\n\nimpermissibly encroach on the unreviewable, discretionary authority afforded to the board under\n\nArticle 6243h.5 See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158–59 (holding that courts lack jurisdiction to require\n\npension board to comply with a judicial interpretation of Article 6243h).\n\n         Furthermore, there is no requirement that the pension board obtain the City’s consent to\n\n\n         4\n             By way of example, the Petitioners complain about the board’s definition of employee to the extent it includes\n“a full-time employee of a Texas local government corporation . . . controlled by the City” and “employees of any entity\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly” by the City. That definition is not inherently inconsistent with the common\nunderstanding of the term “employee” as one who “works in the service of another person (the employer) under an\nexpress or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.”\nB LA C K ’ S L A W D IC TIO N ARY 639 (10th ed. 2014). Thus, reading the terms that comprise the statutory definition of\n“employee” through the control prism articulated by the board does not so clearly conflict with the statute as to be ultra\nvires.\n\n         5\n           Although we are precluded from opining on the accuracy or reasonableness vel non of the pension board’s\ninterpretation of the statute, we observe parenthetically that the statute provides a list of ineligible employees to whom\nthe term “employee” might otherwise apply and, in doing so, suggests that the term is amenable to more precise\narticulation. See T EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . A N N . ART . 6243h, § 4. The City has also acknowledged that terms used in the\nstatute may be susceptible to more than one meaning and that the board has discretion to determine the meaning of those\nwords. In multiple “meet and confer” agreements, the City agreed that all words used in those agreements, which\nincluded the word “employee,” would have the same meaning provided in Article 6243h “as determined by the Board”\nunless specially defined in the agreement.\n\n                                                             15\n\fexercise its discretionary powers. Section 3(n) of the statute authorizes, but does not require, the\n\npension board to enter into a written agreement with the City regarding pension and benefit issues.\n\nSee TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h, § 3(n) (“[T]he pension board may enter into a written\n\nagreement with the city regarding pension issues and benefits.” (emphasis added)). Section 3(n)\n\ndoes not purport to constrain the board’s authority under section 2(x); it merely provides an\n\nalternative mechanism for the board to resolve pension issues. When the pension board and the City\n\nagree on a pension issue, the statute allows them to execute an enforceable contract to that effect.\n\nWhen they cannot agree, the statute makes the board’s determinations of fact and statutory\n\ninterpretations “final and binding.” See id. § 2(y).\n\n         Although the pension board has unquestionably broad discretionary authority under section\n\n2(x), we caution that the board may not violate the statute. Though we need not consider the matter\n\nhere, we do not foreclose the possibility that, in appropriate circumstances, a particular interpretation\n\nof the statute could be ultra vires. We observe only the absence of such circumstances here, leaving\n\nany further dispute regarding the matter to the Legislature, as it evidently intended.6 See Ferrell, 248\n\nS.W.3d at 160 (Brister, J., concurring) (noting, “Our legislators [have] decided they wish to be the\n\nfinal (and frequent) arbiter of disputes about how these pension systems should be run”;\n\nconsequently, the courts “must leave them to it, as the Texas Constitution expressly allows the\n\nLegislature to grant jurisdiction to administrative bodies rather than the courts”).\n\n\n\n\n         6\n            Another remedy available to aggrieved parties is using the elective process to alter HMEPS’s governing body.\nSee T EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . A N N . ART . 6243h, § 2(c)-(d); July 2011 MCA § 4.\n\n                                                          16\n\f                        2. Delegation of Board Authority to a Committee\n\n        The Petitioners and the City also contend the pension board acted ultra vires by delegating\n\ndecision-making authority to the External Affairs Committee in violation of the following provision\n\nin a July 2011 meet-and-confer agreement between HMEPS and the City:\n\n\n        Except for meet and confer decisions and personnel decisions, no committee shall\n        have authority to make final approvals, but shall only make recommendations to the\n        full board.\n\nThe pension board’s October 2011 resolution nevertheless states that “employees of an entity\n\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by the City are considered Employees for purposes of membership\n\nin [the Pension Fund], unless the External Affairs Committee expressly determines otherwise;\n\nprovided, however that nothing in this resolution would apply to . . . any otherwise ineligible\n\nemployee as determined by the External Affairs Committee.”\n\n        Article 6243h generally permits delegation. See TEX . REV . CIV . STAT . ANN . ART . 6243h,\n\n§ 3(k) (“The pension board may allocate among the trustees the responsibilities of the pension board\n\nunder this Act and may designate any person who is not a trustee . . . to carry out the responsibilities\n\nof the pension board.”). Under section 3(k) of the statute, the pension board is permitted to delegate\n\ndecision-making authority in the manner effectuated by the October 2011 resolution.\n\n        The Petitioners and the City contend, however, that the July 2011 meet-and-confer agreement\n\namended the statute and divested the pension board of the power to delegate final decision-making\n\nauthority to a committee, requiring instead that committees “shall only make recommendations to\n\nthe full Board.” The Petitioners and the City allege that the October 2011 resolution thus violates\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fthe terms of the meet-and-confer agreement and is ultra vires. We disagree.\n\n         Meet-and-confer agreements are written contracts, and regardless of whether the parties deem\n\nthe provisions of the contract to be an “amendment” of the statute, noncompliance with a contract\n\ndoes not give rise to an ultra vires claim.

Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149\n\n(Tex. 2011); Tex.

Therefore, any claim that the pension board violated the July 2011 meet-and-confer\n\nagreement is a breach-of-contract claim that cannot be maintained absent a waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity. As we have previously explained, “declaratory-judgment suits against state officials\n\nseeking to establish a contract’s validity, to enforce performance under a contract, or to impose\n\ncontractual liabilities are suits against the State. . . . Consequently, such suits cannot be maintained\n\nwithout legislative permission.” IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855-56.

Equal Protection and Due Course of Law\n\n         In addition to asserting ultra vires claims as a basis for subject-matter jurisdiction, the\n\nPetitioners further contend that sovereign immunity does not bar relief on their claims under the\n\nTexas Constitution. See, e.g., Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v.

While it is true that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit to vindicate constitutional\n\n        7\n           Although the Legislature has waived a local governmental entity’s sovereign immunity to suit for contracts\nfor goods or services, the waiver does not apply here because the meet-and-confer agreement is not a contract for goods\nor services.

Equal Protection\n\n       The Petitioners allege the pension board treated them differently than former city employees\n\nwho now work for separate legal entities due to municipal outsourcing. For example, the Petitioners\n\nargue the City employees working at the Houston Zoo became employees of Houston Zoo, Inc., and\n\nthat the pension fund determined a separation of service occurred as a result. According to the\n\nPetitioners, the zoo employees were declassified as “employees” and pension-system “members” and\n\nsome were thereafter permitted to collect their pension benefits while remaining employed in\n\nessentially the same jobs. The Petitioners contend they are similarly situated to the zoo employees\n\nbut are being treated differently. They further assert—as they must to state a valid equal-protection\n\nclaim—that the pension board’s disparate determination that CCSI employees remain members of\n\nthe pension system is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental objective.\n\n       The Texas Constitution provides that all people “have equal rights, and no man, or set of\n\nmen, is entitled to exclusive separate public emoluments, or privileges.” TEX . CONST . ART . 1 § 3.\n\nThe Petitioners contend the pension board’s determination that they remain members of HMEPS\n\nviolated their right to equal protection of the law. To state a viable equal-protection claim under the\n\nTexas Constitution, the Petitioners must show they have been “treated differently from others\n\nsimilarly situated.” Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v.

First, the pension board has a legitimate interest in preserving sources of\n\npension funding that are adequate to meet the demands on the fund, which it may rationally\n\naccomplish by ensuring the City meets its contribution obligations to the pension system. See 405\n\nS.W.3d at 225 (citing U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v.

Continued\n\ndepletion of the workforce through nominal privatization of municipal services would undoubtedly\n\nrestrict or significantly impair the pension system’s funding sources. The preservation of funding\n\nsources is a legitimate and rational basis for concluding that, under the circumstances presented here,\n\nconvention department workers performing municipal functions as CCSI employees remain\n\n\n\n\n        8\n           Federal equal-protection cases are instructive with regard to equal-protection challenges under the Texas\nConstitution.

Combs, 258 S.W .3d 627, 638 (Tex. 2008).\n\n                                                        20\n\fmembers of the pension system.9 Given the long-term ramifications of concerted efforts to reduce\n\nthe City’s contributions to the pension fund, any previous failure of the pension board to perceive\n\nor acknowledge a threat to pension-funding sources does not change the analysis of this issue. Cf.\n\nMcDonald v. Bd. of Election Comm’rs of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107917\"><a href=\"/opinion/107917/mcdonald-v-board-of-election-commrs-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808 (1969) (“[A] legislature\n\ntraditionally has been allowed to take reform ‘one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the\n\nproblem which seems most acute to the legislative mind[]’; and a legislature need not run the risk\n\nof losing an entire remedial scheme simply because it failed, through inadvertence or otherwise, to\n\ncover every evil that might conceivably have been attacked.” (internal citation omitted)).\n\n         The pension board also has a legitimate interest in policies that lessen the risk of overpaying\n\npensioners or allowing them to “double dip.” See, e.g, Connolly v. McCall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773703\"><a href=\"/opinion/773703/timothy-j-connolly-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (2d Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam) (recognizing “legitimate interest in saving money by barring pension practices\n\nthat have the character of ‘double-dipping’”). In this case, the pension board has disallowed\n\nfunctional City employees from collecting government-funded HMEPS retirement benefits while\n\nalso receiving salaries and 401(k) contributions originating in the dollar-for-dollar expense\n\nreimbursements CCSI collects from Houston First, the City controlled and tax-funded local\n\ngovernment corporation. The pension board’s decision to eliminate further demands on the public\n\nfisc is rationally related to its interest in preventing employment arrangements that permit forms of\n\n         9\n            Petitioners contend that “the refusal to pay earned pensions to eligible former employees or insisting that\nformer employees pay into a pension fund on which they cannot claim a pension cannot be rationally related to\npreserving a pension fund which has as its purpose to provide pensions for eligible former employees.” This argument\npresupposes eligibility and separation from service, which are matters reserved to the board’s exclusive determination.\nIt is also based on a faulty premise. The pension fund does not have a singular purpose of paying benefits as each\nmember becomes eligible; rather, its principal purpose is to administer the fund for the greatest benefit of all members.\nThat purpose is imperiled if the work force becomes insufficient to subsidize the pension fund for current or future\nretirees.\n\n                                                           21\n\f“double dipping.”\n\n       Because we conclude that any differentiation between employees is rationally related to\n\nlegitimate governmental objectives, the Petitioners’ equal-protection claims fail as a matter of law.\n\n                                       2. Due Course of Law\n\n       In their remaining claims, the Petitioners contend they have been deprived of vested property\n\nrights without due process. See TEX . CONST .

Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano allege HMEPS unconstitutionally\n\ndenied them retirement benefits they would otherwise have been eligible to collect after a separation\n\nof service from the City. Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim were not eligible for retirement at the time\n\nthey became CCSI employees, but they claim a vested property right in funds deducted from their\n\nsalaries and contributed to the pension fund on their behalf.\n\n       The Texas Constitution provides that “[n]o citizen of this State shall be deprived of life,\n\nliberty, property, or privileges or immunities . . . except by the due course of the law of the land.”\n\nTEX .

Before any substantive or procedural due-process rights attach, however,\n\nthe Petitioners must have a liberty or property interest that is entitled to constitutional protection.\n\nThan, 901 S.W.2d at 929. A constitutionally protected right must be a vested right, which is\n\n“‘something more than a mere expectancy based upon an anticipated continuance of an existing\n\nlaw.’” City of Dallas v. Trammell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1014 (Tex. 1937) (quoting Dodge v.

The court of appeals held, and we agree, that\n\nthe Petitioners’ due-course claims are facially invalid because the Petitioners have no vested property\n\n                                                  22\n\fright to the pension-plan contributions and future retirement benefits at issue. 405 S.W.3d at 226-27.\n\n        Our decision in the City of Dallas v. Trammell is dispositive of the Petitioners’ claims to a\n\nvested property interest in retirement benefits as of the date they otherwise became eligible but for\n\nthe pension board’s articulated and applied definition of the term “employee” in Article 6243h. In\n\nTrammell, we considered the constitutionality of a statutory amendment that effected a substantial\n\nreduction in the monthly pension benefits payable to a police-department retiree. Id. at 1009. The\n\npurpose of the contested enactment was to rectify inadequacies in pension-plan funding that\n\nthreatened the plan’s long-term solvency. Id. at 1010, 1015-16. In challenging the statutory\n\namendment, the retiree asserted that he had a vested property right in the amount of the monthly\n\npension benefit that was granted to him on the date of his retirement and that any subsequent\n\nreduction of that amount was unconstitutional. Id. The question presented was whether, as of the\n\ndate of retirement, a pensioner has a vested right in future installment payments that could not be\n\naltered by subsequent legislative action. Id. at 1011.\n\n        In analyzing the issue, we adopted\n\n        the rule that the right of a pensioner to receive monthly payments from the pension\n        fund after retirement from service, or after his right to participate in the fund has\n        accrued, is predicated upon the anticipated continuance of existing laws, and is\n        subordinate to the right of the Legislature to abolish the pension system, or diminish\n        the accrued benefits of pensions thereunder . . . .\n\nId. at 1013. Applying this rule, we said there is no vested interest in future pension installments that\n\nwould preclude the Legislature from repealing or modifying the law on which the pension system\n\nis founded, even if doing so would adversely impact or even abolish the right to future payment of\n\nunaccrued benefits. Id. at 1012, 1014; see also id. 1013-15. Stated another way, the right to receive\n\n                                                  23\n\fbenefits under a pension fund “is made subject to the reserved power of the Legislature to amend,\n\nmodify, or repeal the law upon which the pension system is erected, and this necessarily constitutes\n\na qualification upon the anticipated pension and a reserved right to terminate or diminish it.” Id. at\n\n1014. We concluded Trammell with “a direct holding that as to future installments of a pension the\n\npensioner has no vested right,” id. at 1017, and we have since affirmed Trammell’s root analysis on\n\nseveral occasions.

Howerton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1736670\"><a href=\"/opinion/1736670/city-of-fort-worth-v-howerton/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (Tex.\n\n1951). According to the Petitioners, the cited authority negates legislative authority to abolish\n\nHMEPS because under section 67(c), if the Legislature were to abolish the pension system (as\n\nopposed to merely amending the statute), it would be required to pass a law authorizing the City to\n\nelect to establish a pension system for its municipal employees. See TEX . CONST . ART . XVI, § 67(c).\n\nPer Howerton, if the City so elected, any subsequently established pension fund would no longer be\n\nsubject to legislative control. See Howerton, 236 S.W.2d at 619 (if city adopts a pension fund\n\npursuant to constitutional authority, the Legislature is not authorized to change the plan without the\n\ncity’s consent).\n\n       Obviously, certain contingencies must occur before an interest could be said to be fixed and\n\nunalterable by the Legislature as contemplated in Howerton; the main ones being that the Legislature\n\n                                                 24\n\fwould have to abolish the pension system and the City would have to elect to establish a pension\n\nfund. Perhaps the City would elect to do so if given the opportunity, but even if the City were to\n\nestablish its own pension system, the Petitioners cite no limit on the City’s authority to amend or\n\nabolish any such system. Thus, we are not persuaded the cited authority undermines Trammell’s\n\ncore holding that no vested property right exists when a pension fund can be amended or abolished\n\nby the governing authority; it makes no difference whether the authority with the power to abolish\n\nthe pension system is the Legislature or some other entity. The crux of Trammell’s analysis is that\n\nany right emanating from a mere expectancy is not vested, and the Petitioners have cited no authority\n\nelevating their interests in the pension fund beyond a mere expectancy to a constitutional guarantee.\n\nWe therefore reject the distinction the Petitioners attempt to draw between Trammell and the\n\ncircumstances presented here.10\n\n         Approaching the matter from a different angle, the Petitioners embrace Trammell to the\n\nextent it confirms that interests in pension benefits are fixed, and thus vested, when all contingencies\n\nto entitlement have occurred. The Petitioners contend that any contingencies to their entitlement to\n\npension benefits were satisfied when they became eligible to retire, even though no separation from\n\nservice occurred under Article 6243h, as interpreted by the pension board. Trammell, however, does\n\nnot support the Petitioners’ contention that their retirement interests became fixed at the time of their\n\neligibility for retirement. In fact, Trammell does the opposite, expressly holding that the plaintiff,\n\n\n         10\n           A different scenario might be presented if article XVI, section 66 of the Texas Constitution were applicable.\nThat constitutional provision, which was added by amendment in 2003, expressly protects benefits under certain\nretirement systems from being reduced or otherwise impaired. See T EX . C O N ST . A RT . XVI, § 66. The guarantees\nafforded by section 66 are not implicated here because, by a three-to-one margin, City of Houston voters opted to\nexercise an exemption authorized by that amendment. See id. § 66(h).\n\n                                                          25\n\fwho had already retired and had actually been receiving pension benefits, had no vested right in\n\nfuture installments of the same. Applying Trammell’s “direct holding,” we conclude that Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano have no vested property right in the retirement benefits at issue.\n\n       With regard to the remaining constitutional claims, we observed in Trammell that “[i]t is well\n\nsettled that the mere circumstance that a part of a pension fund is made up by deductions from the\n\nagreed compensation of employees does not in itself give the pensioner a vested right in the fund,\n\nand does not make it any less a public fund subject to the control of the Legislature.” 101 S.W.2d\n\nat 1012-13. In Devon v. City of San Antonio, we relied on Trammell in declining to recognize an\n\nemployee’s claimed interest in contributions to a municipal pension fund even though those\n\ncontributions had been withheld from his wages. We explained there that\n\n       [t]he deductions withheld from [the employee’s] wages and paid into the pension\n       fund never belonged to him, but remained public money used for a public purpose.\n       They were not first segregated from the public funds so as to become [the\n       employee’s] private property and then paid into the pension fund; rather the\n       deductions were “set aside from one public fund and turned over to another” and are\n       no less public money after the payment into the pension fund than before.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1656294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1656294/devon-v-city-of-san-antonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (Tex.

Accordingly, we conclude that Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim lack\n\na vested property right in their pension-fund contributions.\n\n       Because the Petitioners have no vested rights in the retirement benefits and pension-plan\n\ncontributions at issue, we hold their pleadings conclusively negate the existence of subject-matter\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fjurisdiction over their constitutional claims.\n\n                                          III.
