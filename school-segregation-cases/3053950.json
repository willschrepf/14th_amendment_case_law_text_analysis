(Super. Ct.

Reversed.\n\n        Williams Iagmin and Jon R. Williams for Defendant and Appellant.\n\n        The Zalkin Law Firm, Irwin M. Zalkin and Devin M. Storey; Pine & Pine,\n\nNorman Pine and Scott Tillet, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\n\n        Jose Lopez sued the national Jehovah's Witnesses organization, Watchtower Bible\n\nand Tract Society of New York, Inc. (Watchtower), alleging his Bible instructor sexually\n\nabused him in 1986 when he was a child. Lopez asserted several legal theories, including\n\nfailure to warn, negligent supervision, and negligent hiring/retention. After contentious\n\fdiscovery disputes, the court issued two discovery orders against Watchtower: (1)\n\ncompelling the deposition of an individual (Gerrit Lösch) whom the court found was a\n\n\"managing agent\" of Watchtower; and (2) ordering the production of documents in\n\nWatchtower's files pertaining to other perpetrators of child sexual abuse. When\n\nWatchtower failed to comply with these orders, the court granted Lopez's motion for\n\nmonetary and terminating sanctions, struck Watchtower's answer, and entered\n\nWatchtower's default.1\n\n       On appeal, Watchtower challenges the validity of the discovery orders and\n\ncontends the court abused its discretion in failing to impose lesser sanctions. We reject\n\nWatchtower's challenges to the document production order, but conclude the court erred\n\nin ordering Watchtower to produce Lösch for his deposition. The factual record does not\n\nsupport the court's finding that Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing agent\" and therefore\n\nthe court erred in sanctioning Watchtower for Lösch's nonattendance at the deposition.\n\n(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.280, 2025.450.)2 We additionally conclude that under the\n\nparticular circumstances of this case, the court erred in issuing terminating sanctions as\n\nthe initial remedial measure without first attempting to compel compliance with its\n\ndiscovery orders by using lesser sanctions and/or by imposing evidentiary or issue\n\nsanctions.\n\n\n\n1     The court later entered a default judgment in Lopez's favor for $13.5 million. This\njudgment is the subject of a separate appeal.\n\n2      Statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Accordingly, we reverse the order compelling the Lösch deposition and the entry\n\nof default based on the terminating sanctions. We remand for the court to consider the\n\nappropriate sanctions for Watchtower's violation of the document production order. The\n\ninitial measure should be a remedy that is less onerous than a terminating sanction.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                               A. Summary of Allegations\n\n       The Jehovah's Witnesses is a religion with more than 1.2 million members in\n\nabout 13,777 congregations in the United States. During the relevant times, Watchtower\n\nsupervised the local congregations and was responsible for the religion's policies and\n\nadministrative matters. Jehovah's Witnesses congregations are comprised of elders\n\n(spiritual leaders responsible for congregation governance), ministerial servants\n\n(performing administrative tasks), and various levels of baptized members, including\n\npublishers (rank-and-file members). As stipulated by the parties, congregation elders\n\nserve as agents for Watchtower.\n\n       In June 2012, 34-year-old Lopez filed a complaint against Watchtower and the\n\nLinda Vista Spanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (Linda Vista congregation),\n\nseeking damages for sexual abuse committed by Gonzales Campos in 1986 when Lopez\n\nwas about seven years old. In his amended complaint, Lopez alleged that in the mid-\n\n1980's, Lopez's mother was a baptized Jehovah's Witnesses member associated with the\n\nLinda Vista congregation, and received Bible study from a congregation elder, Joel\n\nMunoz. Munoz recommended to Lopez's mother that Lopez should be receiving Bible\n\nstudy instruction and she \"should approach [Campos] because he was very good with\n\n\n                                             3\n\fchildren.\" Following this direction, Lopez's mother spoke with Campos and Campos\n\nbegan giving lessons to Lopez. After Campos had given Lopez several Bible study\n\nlessons, and in the context of a Bible study lesson, Campos sexually molested Lopez.\n\n         Lopez reported the abuse to his mother, who reported it to Elder Munoz and his\n\nwife. The next day, several elders from the Linda Vista congregation came to Lopez's\n\nhome and spoke to Lopez's mother about the abuse. One of the elders asked Lopez to\n\nshow him, on a teddy bear or doll, where Campos had touched him. Soon after, Lopez's\n\nfamily left the congregation and Lopez had no additional contact with Campos.\n\n         At the time of the abuse, Campos was directed by Linda Vista congregation\n\nleaders to provide Bible instruction to Lopez and other minors. In giving the Bible study\n\nlessons to minors, Campos filled out a form for each study session, identifying the Bible\n\nstudy student, address, and date of the lesson, and submitted each form to a congregation\n\nelder.\n\n         About four years earlier, in approximately 1982, Campos had allegedly sexually\n\nmolested another young boy from the Linda Vista congregation. Soon after the abuse,\n\nthis earlier victim reported the abuse to his mother, who reported the abuse to two church\n\nelders. When questioned by the elders, Campos confessed to acting inappropriately. The\n\nelders nonetheless continued to hold Campos out as safe to be around children, and\n\naffirmatively recommended him to serve as a Bible study instructor.\n\n         Campos had been a member of the Linda Vista congregation since about 1979. In\n\n1987, Campos became associated with another Jehovah's Witnesses congregation (La\n\nJolla Spanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, also known as Playa Pacifica\n\n\n                                             4\n\fSpanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (La Jolla congregation)). In about 1988,\n\nLa Jolla congregation elders appointed Campos to a ministerial servant position, and\n\nWatchtower approved the appointment. While serving as a ministerial servant, Campos\n\nfrequently preached at the Linda Vista and La Jolla congregations, and continued to teach\n\nBible study to Jehovah's Witnesses children. In 1993, Watchtower approved Campos's\n\nappointment as elder of the La Jolla congregation, and he was later appointed secretary of\n\nthe congregation, placing him on the congregation's governing \"Service Committee.\"\n\n       Lopez alleged that Campos sexually abused at least eight other Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses children between 1982 and 1995, including when Campos served as an elder.\n\nSome of these abuse incidents were reported to congregation elders.\n\n       Based on these allegations, Lopez's amended complaint asserted six causes of\n\naction against Watchtower and the Linda Vista congregation: negligence; negligent\n\nsupervision/failure to warn; negligent hiring/retention; negligent failure to warn, train or\n\neducate; sexual battery; and sexual harassment. Lopez alleged defendants were negligent\n\nbecause they knew or should have known of Campos's \"dangerous and exploitive\n\npropensities and/or that [he] was an unfit agent\"; they allowed Campos to come into\n\ncontact with Lopez without supervision; they failed to tell or concealed from Lopez and\n\nhis parents that Campos had previously sexually abused minors; they failed to tell law\n\nenforcement officials that Lopez had been sexually abused, making it less likely Lopez\n\nwould receive medical/mental health care and treatment; and they held out Campos to\n\nLopez and his parents as being in good standing and trustworthy. Lopez claimed \"[b]y\n\nretaining and promoting [Campos] after learning of his past sexual abuse of children,\n\n\n                                              5\n\f[Watchtower] ratified and authorized [Campos's] conduct.\" Lopez alleged \"[d]efendants\n\nacted with willful and conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others by repeatedly\n\nignoring warnings and complaints that [Campos] had committed acts of sexual abuse\n\nupon minors and allowing [Campos] to attain and retain elevated positions within the\n\nJehovah's Witness[es] religion . . . [w]here he had access to unsuspecting minors.\"\n\n       Lopez alleged the lawsuit was timely under California law. (See § 340.1, subds.\n\n(a), (b)(1), (2).) Lopez claimed Campos's sexual abuse resulted in \"various psychological\n\ncoping mechanisms\" that precluded him from \"ascertaining the resulting damages from\n\nthat conduct, or the wrongfulness of [Campos's] conduct\" and that he did not discover the\n\n\"causal relationship between the molestation and adulthood psychological injuries\" until\n\nApril 2012.\n\n       Lopez later amended the complaint to add a punitive damage claim.\n\n                                  B. Discovery Disputes\n\n                1. Discovery Relating to Campos's Molestation of Others\n\n       At some point before February 2013, Lopez propounded document requests on\n\nWatchtower. The requests sought documents pertaining to written complaints and\n\ninvestigations concerning Campos's sexual abuse of other victims. Watchtower identified\n\nresponsive documents, but declined to produce them on the basis of the First\n\nAmendment, overbreadth, clergy-penitent privilege, and third-party privacy rights.\n\nWatchtower also refused to produce any documents generated after the date Lopez was\n\nallegedly abused (1986), stating the documents were not relevant or admissible, and thus\n\nnot discoverable.\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       Lopez moved to compel the production of the documents, and the court granted\n\nthe motion in part. After briefing and a hearing, the court broadly rejected Watchtower's\n\narguments regarding scope, overbreadth, privacy, and the First Amendment. On the\n\npenitential-communications privilege, the court conducted an in camera hearing, and\n\nfound all but four of the withheld documents were not protected. In reviewing the\n\ndocuments, the court applied the rule that documents created with the knowledge they\n\nwould be read by third parties were not protected by the penitential-communications\n\nprivilege. (See Evid. Code, § 1032.)3\n\n                       2. Deposition Notices at Issue in this Appeal\n\n       Several months later, in August 2013, Lopez's counsel notified defense counsel of\n\nhis intent to notice several depositions, including (1) Watchtower's person most qualified\n\n(PMQ); and (2) Gerrit Lösch, a member of a Jehovah's Witnesses entity known as the\n\n\"Governing Body.\"\n\n       On September 20, 2013, Lopez noticed the deposition of Watchtower's PMQ on\n\n30 identified subject matters. The notice requested the deponent to produce 29 separate\n\ncategories of documents similar to the identified subject matters. The topics and\n\nrequested documents related to Watchtower's organizational structure, including its\n\n\n3      California law defines a \" 'penitential communication' \" as \"a communication\nmade in confidence, in the presence of no third person so far as the penitent is aware, to a\nmember of the clergy who, in the course of the discipline or practice of the clergy\nmember's church, denomination, or organization, is authorized or accustomed to hear\nthose communications and, under the discipline or tenets of his or her church,\ndenomination, or organization, has a duty to keep those communications secret.\" (Evid.\nCode, § 1032.)\n\n\n                                             7\n\fcommittees and the Governing Body; the formulation and implementation of\n\norganizational policies; reports of childhood sexual abuse within the organization from\n\n1979 through the current date, including sexual abuse perpetrators other than Campos;\n\nand Watchtower's handling of sexual abuse notifications.\n\n      Two requests are of particular relevance here because Watchtower's failure to\n\nprovide any documents responsive to these requests was one ground for the court's\n\nterminating sanctions order. Request No. 5 sought:\n\n          \"Any and all individual written accounts, reports, summaries, letters,\n          emails, facsimiles, and records, whether or not compiled, concerning\n          reports of sexual abuse of children by members of the Jehovah's\n          Witnesses, including but not limited to, Governing Body members,\n          district overseers, circuit overseers, elders, ministerial servants,\n          pioneers, publishers, baptized publishers, and individuals from the\n          time period of 1979 to the present.\"\n\nRequest No. 12 sought:\n\n          \"All letters, emails, facsimiles, or other documentary, tangible, or\n          electronically stored information of any kind, Watchtower Bible and\n          Tract Society New York, Inc. received in response to the Body of\n          Elder Letter Dated March 14, 1997.\"4\n\n      On October 9, Watchtower served objections to the requested documents. Those\n\nobjections included: (1) the documents seek information protected from discovery by the\n\n4       The March 14, 1997 letter instructed elders to send a written report to Watchtower\nabout \"anyone who is currently serving or who formerly served in a [Watchtower]-\nappointed position in your congregation who is known to have been guilty of child\nmolestation in the past.\" Watchtower said this information should be kept confidential,\nand instructed elders to place the reports in a \" 'Special Blue' \" envelope. The March 14\nletter also reminded elders of prior letters stating that when a known \"child molester\"\nmoves to another congregation, a letter of introduction should be sent to the new\ncongregation and copies of the letter should be sent to Watchtower in the \" 'Special Blue'\nenvelopes.\"\n\n\n                                            8\n\fpenitential-communications privilege; (2) the documents are protected by the attorney-\n\nclient privilege and/or work-product doctrine; (3) the requests are \"overly broad as to\n\ntime\" and not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence; (4) the disclosure of\n\nthe documents would violate third-party privacy rights; (5) the requests violate\n\nWatchtower's First Amendment rights to religious freedom; and (6) the requests are\n\nunduly burdensome with the intent to harass Watchtower and solicit other clients.\n\n       In late October 2013, the court held a hearing on defendants' summary judgment\n\nmotion pertaining to the statute of limitations. After hearing argument, the court denied\n\nthe motion. The court then noted the upcoming trial date (in January 2014) and asked the\n\nparties whether they had resolved their discovery disputes regarding the PMQ deposition.\n\nThe parties reminded the court it had ordered the parties to meet and confer on discovery\n\nreferees and notified the court that they had agreed on three names. The court then\n\nrandomly chose one of those names to serve as discovery referee: former San Diego\n\nCounty Superior Court Judge Vincent Di Figlia (Referee).\n\n       On November 7, 2013, Lopez served Watchtower with a notice of Lösch's\n\ndeposition. Watchtower objected to the deposition on the ground it \"violates the 'apex-\n\ndeposition rule' \" (a rule prohibiting the deposition of a high-ranking official unless the\n\ndeponent has unique or superior personal knowledge of relevant information).\n\nWatchtower also challenged the proposed scope of the deposition.\n\n                    3. Summary of Parties' Assertions Before Referee\n\n       The Referee scheduled a December 13 hearing to resolve the parties' disputes\n\nregarding (1) the PMQ deposition and document requests; and (2) Lösch's deposition.\n\n\n                                              9\n\fLopez and Watchtower each submitted briefs regarding their respective positions on\n\nthese matters.\n\n       On the PMQ document requests, Lopez argued the pre-abuse, postabuse, and\n\nother-perpetrator evidence was relevant to several issues in the case, including notice,\n\nratification, and punitive damages. Lopez also argued the trial court had rejected many of\n\nWatchtower's objections in ruling on the prior discovery and summary judgment motions,\n\nand the same legal principles apply to the current document requests, including those\n\nseeking postabuse and other-perpetrator information. On Watchtower's penitential-\n\ncommunications privilege claim, Lopez argued that (as the trial court had previously\n\nfound) this privilege did not apply to documents containing statements made with\n\nknowledge that the statements would be disclosed to third parties. Regarding\n\nWatchtower's privacy claim, Lopez proposed that the Referee allow redaction of third-\n\nparty names and identifying information.\n\n       On the Lösch deposition, Lopez asserted that Lösch is currently the longest\n\nserving member on the Governing Body, and has information relevant to the formulation\n\nand implementation of the organization's policy on childhood sexual abuse matters, as\n\nwell as specific matters concerning sexual abuse by Campos. In support, Lopez\n\nsubmitted the deposition testimony (taken in another case) of Allen Shuster, a Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses elder who has served in the Watchtower organization since 1981. Shuster\n\ntestified the Governing Body \"is a committee that oversees the worldwide activity of\n\nJehovah's Witnesses,\" and is responsible for approving policies and guidelines governing\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fthe religion and the religious organization, including those contained in Watchtower\n\ndocuments known as Body of Elder letters pertaining to child sexual abuse matters.\n\n       In opposing the PMQ requested documents, Watchtower argued the requests were\n\noverbroad and sought irrelevant information, and asked the Referee to limit the discovery\n\nto a reasonable time surrounding the date of the alleged abuse (1986) and to preclude all\n\ndiscovery involving perpetrators other than Campos. Watchtower also argued the\n\nrequests seek information protected by attorney-client privileges, the First Amendment,\n\nand the penitential-communication privilege. Although Watchtower challenged the broad\n\nscope of the requests, Watchtower did not specifically argue (or present any evidence\n\nshowing) that responding to the requests would be administratively burdensome.\n\n       Regarding Lösch, Watchtower withdrew its apex-doctrine objection, but argued\n\nthe deposition notice was void on its face because Lösch is not an \" 'officer, director,\n\nmanaging agent or employee' \" of Watchtower and thus a deposition subpoena was\n\nrequired under section 2025.280, subdivision (b). In support Watchtower proffered the\n\ndeclaration of its employee Danny Bland, who stated that based on his search of\n\nWatchtower records, \"Losch [has] never . . . been an officer, director, managing agent or\n\nemployee of Watchtower.\" Watchtower also asserted that a California deposition\n\nsubpoena would be ineffective to compel Lösch's deposition because he is a New York\n\nresident. Watchtower additionally argued that any information regarding the structure,\n\ncomposition, and activities of the Governing Body is irrelevant because the Governing\n\nBody is a separate entity from Watchtower.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                4. Referee Recommendation\n\n       The Referee held a hearing on December 13, 2013, at which both counsel had an\n\nextensive opportunity to present their arguments. Several days after the hearing,\n\nWatchtower requested permission to submit additional information regarding the\n\nJehovah's Witnesses' organizational structure, and the role of the Governing Body within\n\nthis structure, including that Lösch's role is solely one of a spiritual leader (\"akin to the\n\nDalai Lama\") and not \"a corporate managing agent.\" The Referee denied the motion,\n\nconcluding the issues had been fully briefed.\n\n       Shortly after, on December 20, the Referee issued a written order (Referee\n\nRecommendation) concluding that Lopez should be permitted to depose Lösch in New\n\nYork as a \"managing agent\" and that Watchtower produce the documents requested in the\n\nPMQ deposition notice (including Request Nos. 5 and 12).\n\n       Regarding Lösch, the Referee stated: \"The deposition testimony of Mr. Shuster\n\nestablishes that the Governing Body . . . is the principal overseer of the church's\n\nactivities. Mr. Losch is the longest serving member of the Governing Body and may well\n\npossess knowledge pertinent to this litigation.\" The Referee also noted: \"According to\n\ndeposition testimony given by Shuster . . . , the Governing Body approves operational\n\nguidelines for the United States branch of the Jehovah's Witness[es] Organization,\n\nincluding directives for investigating and reporting of alleged childhood sexual abuse\n\nwithin the church.\" The Referee said that \"[d]espite Mr. Bland's declaration, the referee\n\nbelieves that Mr. Losch's position as a member of the Governing Body and its functions\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fas described by Mr. Shuster, make Mr. Losch a managing agent\" under section 2025.280,\n\nsubdivision (a).\n\n       On the document requests, the Referee rejected each of Watchtower's objections,\n\nincluding its blanket privilege and overbreadth claims. The Referee stated: \"It is [my]\n\nrecommendation that the deposition of the PMQ be allowed to go forward on the topics\n\nenumerated, and that the PMQ be required to produce the documents in question which I\n\nbelieve are relevant to the subject matter of the lawsuit in many areas, including\n\nsubsequent ratification by the church, if any.\"\n\n       The Referee qualified its ruling in two ways. First, the Referee stated that to\n\nprotect the \"privacy rights of third parties, defendants may produce documents wherein\n\nthe names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and social security numbers\n\nof third-parties have been redacted.\" Second, the Referee stated, \"in that the court has\n\npreviously reviewed in camera and withheld some documents pursuant to Evidence Code\n\n§§ 1033 and 1034, the referee recommends that defendant prepare a privilege log and\n\nprovide for in camera review by me those documents which may fall within the minister-\n\ncommunicant and/or attorney/client or work produc[t] privileges.\"\n\n                    5. Parties' Responses to Referee Recommendation\n\n       One week later, on December 26, Lopez filed an ex parte application requesting\n\nthe court to compel Watchtower's compliance with the Referee's Recommendation.\n\n       The next day, Watchtower filed objections to the Referee's Recommendation\n\nunder section 644, subdivision (b). With respect to Lösch, Watchtower argued the\n\nReferee misunderstood Shuster's testimony and that the Governing Body is purely a\n\n\n                                             13\n\freligious committee that provides guidance on religious practice. Watchtower also\n\nargued there was no evidence showing Lösch was an officer, director, or managing agent\n\nof Watchtower and thus the court lacked authority to compel Watchtower to produce\n\nLösch for his deposition. In support of these arguments, Watchtower proffered Shuster's\n\nnew declaration, stating: \"[T]he Governing Body . . . is not a committee that operates\n\nwithin the corporate structure of Watchtower . . . and it does not make corporate policy or\n\ndecisions for Watchtower . . . . Rather, the Governing Body is a religious body that\n\nprovides spiritual guidance to Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.\"\n\n       On the document production, Watchtower argued the Referee erred by failing to\n\nrule on each objection, and instead improperly \"lump[ed]\" the requests into a single\n\ncategory. Watchtower also urged the court to reject the Referee's findings because the\n\nrequests were overbroad as to time and the order would impose an \"enormous\"\n\nadministrative burden. In support of the burden argument, it produced three new\n\ndeclarations, none of which were before the Referee.\n\n       First, Watchtower produced the declaration and supplemental declaration of\n\nRichard Ashe, Jr., the person designated as Watchtower's PMQ, who has been an elder\n\nsince 1982 and has worked in Watchtower departments (the United States branch offices\n\nand the Service Department) since 1999. Ashe stated in part:\n\n          \"All of the confidential letters from bodies of elders written to\n          Service Department elders at Watchtower in response to the March\n          14, 1997, letter are filed and maintained in the individual\n          confidential congregation Service Department files for nearly 14,000\n          congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f          \"Most of these 14,000 congregation Service Department files do not\n          have any documents related to child sexual abuse. . . .\"\n\n          \"The typical congregation . . . file has hundreds of pages, most of\n          which are unrelated to the issue of child abuse or child molesters.\n          [¶] . . . [¶] In order to review the documents in these confidential\n          files it would be necessary for a Service Department elder to\n          physically go through each of the nearly 14,000 congregation\n          Service Department files to determine if among the hundreds of\n          pages of documents in each file there happened to be any\n          correspondence related to the March 14, 1997, letter to all bodies of\n          elders or the issue of child abuse.\"\n\n          \"Only a handful of elders at [Watchtower's national office] are\n          qualified and capable of going through these confidential\n          congregation files. At a minimum, it would take an average of three\n          to four hours to go through each of the nearly 14,000 files. That\n          would mean that it would take one . . . elder approximately 56,000\n          hours which works out to be 7,000 days (19.17 years), assuming he\n          searched for the requested documents for . . . 8 hours per day. The\n          number of days could be reduced to 2,334 days (6.39 years) if\n          three . . . elders were assigned this task. Assuming the . . . elders\n          who first reviewed the files were to be paid New York's current\n          minimum wage of $8.00 per hour, the reasonable value of their time\n          would be $448,000.\"\n\n          \"Given the spiritual responsibilities and workloads of the elders in\n          the U.S. Service Department it would not be possible to accomplish\n          these file reviews without stopping all of their other current tasks\n          and responsibilities. This would cripple or severely hamper the\n          operation of [Watchtower's service department] and be a spiritual\n          detriment to the congregations that its elders serve.\"\n\n      Watchtower also produced the declaration of its general counsel, Philip Brumley,\n\nwho stated the Referee's order would require Watchtower attorneys to review 13,777 files\n\nand \"to turn over files\" containing privileged attorney-client communications and work-\n\nproduct information, and would subject Watchtower attorneys to ethics violations and\n\nmalpractice claims. Brumley stated the preparation of privilege logs would take\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\f\"thousands of hours\" and prevent the legal department from providing needed legal\n\nadvice to elders.\n\n       Watchtower also asked the court to remand the matter back to the Referee because\n\nthe \"hearing . . . addressed only the scope of the [permitted] testimony\" and \"did not\n\ninclude or address the objections that had been made to the document production.\"\n\nWatchtower claimed the Referee did not consider its numerous objections, based on\n\n\"privilege, rights of privacy of third persons, attorney work product doctrine, and the\n\nundue burden that the search, assembly and redacting of these documents would cause\n\nupon Watchtower.\"\n\n       In response to Watchtower's objections, Lopez argued Watchtower was not\n\nentitled to challenge the Referee's determinations because the parties had agreed to\n\nsubmit the issues to the Referee. (See § 644, subd. (a).) Lopez alternatively opposed\n\nWatchtower's arguments on their merits, and stated the Referee had expressly considered\n\nand rejected each of Watchtower's objections to the discovery. On Lösch's deposition,\n\nLopez argued the Referee properly found Lösch was a party-affiliated witness (\"a\n\nmanaging agent\") and thus Lösch's deposition notice served on Watchtower was\n\nsufficient to compel his attendance. Lopez maintained that the Referee was entitled to\n\nrely on Shuster's deposition testimony and to reject Watchtower's contrary evidence.\n\n       On the document requests, Lopez objected to Watchtower raising the new\n\nadministrative-burden argument, but also urged the court to reject this new claim based\n\non evidence showing Watchtower specifically directed congregation elders to send\n\nreports about any person in an appointed position \"known to have been guilty of child\n\n\n                                            16\n\fmolestation,\" and instructed elders to place the reports in \" 'Special Blue' envelopes\" and\n\nthat the reports \"should be marked 'Do Not Destroy' and be kept indefinitely.\" Lopez\n\nargued that given these documentation requirements, it was not reasonable to conclude\n\nWatchtower would need to search through each individual congregation file to locate the\n\nresponsive documents.\n\n          C. January 2 Hearing and Order Affirming Referee Recommendation\n\n       At the January 2 hearing, the court initially expressed concern with the scope of\n\nthe issues before it at an ex parte hearing and indicated it had not yet reviewed the\n\nReferee Recommendation or Watchtower's objections. However, as explained in more\n\ndetail below, the court then permitted the parties to argue their points at length (including\n\nthe relevance of the evidence and administrative burden issue), asked questions, and\n\nreviewed the submitted paperwork.\n\n       At the conclusion of the arguments, the court requested Watchtower's counsel to\n\ngive a reasonable time estimate to locate the responsive documents, stating defense\n\ncounsel's claim it would take \"nine and a half years . . . seems ludicrous.\" Watchtower's\n\ncounsel said the \"calculations worked out to be 19.7 years with one person working seven\n\ndays a week, eight hours a day, and flying all over the countryside. And then you use\n\nthree people, and we can knock it down just shy of seven years. . . .\"\n\n       After additional discussion, the court stated it was adopting the Referee\n\nRecommendation, and would continue the trial date 120 days to June 27. The court said,\n\n\"I don't want to have anybody coming back in to tell me they couldn't find the\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fdocuments.\" In its written order (the January 2 order), the court stated it had reviewed\n\nthe Referee Recommendation \"and makes it an order of the Court.\"\n\n                            D. Motions After January 2 Order\n\n       One month later, on February 4, Watchtower moved to stay the court's January 2\n\norder, stating it intended to file a writ petition with the Court of Appeal. The court\n\ndenied the motion, finding a stay was not warranted unless it was imposed by a higher\n\ncourt. At the end of the hearing, the court rejected Watchtower's suggestions it had not\n\nadequately reviewed Watchtower's prior objections, stating \"[the court] looked at the\n\nobjections on the date that you came in. You were here last [on the calendar]. And I\n\nwent ahead and signed an order adopting [the Referee Recommendation].\" The court\n\nalso ordered counsel to \"get that deposition on calendar forthwith.\" When Watchtower\n\ncounsel responded that the document production was asking for the \"Impossible,\" the\n\ncourt replied: \"I understand that it's going to be quite an endeavor, but it also has been a\n\nvery long time that this has been in the making. And one of the things I recall talking\n\nabout the last time was that 90 days had already passed at the request of the documents,\n\nand we're looking at several more months, and it was represented to me that nothing had\n\nbeen done to even start the process. [¶] So I can't tell you how long it's going to take, but\n\nit should have at least been attempted, and it wasn't the last time I made the order.\"\n\n(Italics added.)\n\n       The next month, in March 2014, Lopez's counsel moved for an order scheduling\n\nthe depositions and ordering the documents to be produced, noting that Watchtower was\n\nrefusing to cooperate with the court orders. At the hearing, Watchtower's counsel said\n\n\n                                             18\n\fLösch's own counsel was present and \"we have no ability to compel Mr. Losch to attend\n\n[his deposition]. That's the reality of our situation.\" The court stated it had previously\n\ndetermined (at the January 2 hearing) that Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing agent\"\n\nand declined to rule on a motion to quash the deposition filed by Lösch's personal\n\ncounsel.\n\n       The court and counsel then engaged in a lengthy colloquy pertaining to the\n\ndocuments ordered to be produced. During this discussion, Watchtower's counsel\n\nrestated his strong objections to the order, repeating his position that the order requires\n\nWatchtower to search through 14,000 congregation files and that Watchtower was unable\n\nto do so. The court said it had made clear Watchtower should begin locating responsive\n\ndocuments and asked whether this process had commenced, but Watchtower's counsel\n\nwas unable to identify a single person working on the document production. Lopez's\n\ncounsel responded that he had \"grave concern[s]\" about going ahead with the PMQ\n\ndeposition without any assurance the documents would be produced. He argued, \"this\n\nwhole idea that they cannot produce these documents is disingenuous at best . . . ,\" noting\n\nthat Watchtower requests sexual abuse information from local congregations and\n\n\"keep[s] track\" of these individuals, and therefore it is not credible to conclude \"they just\n\nshove [these documents] away somewhere . . . [and] don't have a database . . . .\"\n\nWatchtower's counsel replied: \"[T]here's just a certain unfairness about what the court\n\nhas ordered my client to do. It is a religion with almost 14,000 congregations nationwide.\n\nThis request asks them to produce documents that were transmitted and filed manually\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\finto these 14,000 files involving these congregations. We explained in detail the manual\n\nsearch that would have to take place.\"\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the court asked whether Watchtower intended to\n\nappear at the New York deposition with documents, and Watchtower's counsel said he\n\nbelieved the court abused its discretion in compelling Watchtower to produce these\n\ndocuments. The court responded there was nothing it could do at this point, \"[b]ut if you\n\nshow up for a deposition and documents aren't produced, and they were inappropriately\n\nnot produced, I'll be looking at other motions.\"\n\n       After the hearing, the court issued an order setting the dates for the New York\n\ndepositions of Watchtower's PMQ and stating \"[t]he topics of the testimony are those\n\npreviously noticed by Plaintiff\" and \"[a]t or before the commencement of the deposition,\n\nWatchtower must produce all documents requested by Plaintiff . . . .\" The court also\n\nordered Lösch's deposition to be taken on specific dates at a New York location to be\n\nmutually agreed by the parties.\n\n       Two weeks later, Watchtower and Lösch each filed a petition for a writ of\n\nmandate challenging the court's January 2 order. Several days later, on March 27, 2014,\n\nthis court summarily denied both petitions, and the California Supreme Court later denied\n\nsimilar petitions.\n\n       The next week, on March 31 and April 1, Watchtower's PMQ (Ashe and\n\nWatchtower attorney Mario Moreno) appeared and testified at their New York\n\ndepositions, but did not produce the documents at issue here. During his deposition,\n\nAshe testified about Watchtower prior publications that discuss the problem of child\n\n\n                                            20\n\fabuse and the significant long-term emotional and psychological damage to victims, and\n\nthe requirement that any known abuse be reported to Watchtower. Ashe also testified\n\nthat all Jehovah's Witnesses congregation files have been fully scanned into a computer\n\nsystem, including child abuse reports that are \"marked do not destroy\" and \"stay[ ]\n\nindefinitely in [the] congregation file.\" He said there are 36 elders in Watchtower's\n\nService Department available to search the files, but their primary job is to give spiritual\n\nguidance to congregation members and elders. Ashe said compliance with the January 2\n\norder \"would effectively shut down their duties in the Service Department for a\n\nconsiderable length of the time.\" When asked why these documents could not be located\n\nby an electronic search method, Ashe testified in part:\n\n          \"[The electronic system] was never designed for the 3,000,000\n          documents that we scanned into it at its managing force. So to put in\n          the words, technical terms used by computer support, sometimes it's\n          loopy. It's not reliable all the time but to try and type in a search\n          parameter, we examine this. How can we do this to be in\n          compliance. There is no easy way to do that. You have to search\n          every congregation file electronically to try and do that. And the\n          search parameters, for example if you type in child abuse, you're\n          going to get every document that has the word child in it and every\n          document that has the word abuse in it.\"\n\nAshe also said that when the computer identifies a responsive document, there is usually\n\na brief delay (\"a second delay\") as the document uploads, and the document then would\n\nhave to be reviewed for attorney/client privilege and therefore \"It gets very complicated.\"\n\nHe opined that \"technically\" Watchtower could not comply with the January 2 order\n\nusing the electronic search method, and that \"It would take years to get that information\n\nput together.\" Ashe also said \"there are no [remaining] physical file[s]. Once they were\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fscanned[,] all those documents were destroyed.\" When asked why Jehovah's Witnesses\n\ncould not devise a search for the phrase \" 'do not destroy,' \" Ashe responded that you \"can\n\ntry to do\" this search, \"but you'll come up with child abuse, you'll come up with adultery,\n\nyou'll come up with bigamist marriage, you'll come up with slander, fraud, murder any\n\nabhorrent sin.\"\n\n       Lösch did not appear for his scheduled deposition.\n\n                   E. Motion for Monetary and Terminating Sanctions\n\n       One week after the depositions, on April 8, Lopez moved for terminating and\n\nmonetary sanctions for Watchtower's failure to comply with the court's orders to produce\n\nthe documents at the PMQ deposition and to produce Lösch for deposition. Regarding\n\nthe PMQ deposition, Lopez's counsel stated that the deponents (Ashe and Moreno) did\n\nnot produce documents responsive to Lopez's document request numbers 5 and 12.5\n\nLopez's counsel also discussed the recent PMQ depositions, and noted that Ashe\n\n\"testified that all of the historical records regarding child abuse that were [requested] by\n\nPlaintiff and ordered produced have been scanned into a computer system, and that the\n\ntext of those scanned documents is searchable,\" but that Watchtower had made no efforts\n\nto \"create[ ] a team to search for them. . . .\" Lopez additionally discussed Watchtower's\n\nassertion of various meritless objections to earlier discovery. Lopez requested monetary\n\nsanctions of $37,799.21, primarily for his counsel's costs in attending Lösch's New York\n\ndeposition and making a record of his nonappearance.\n\n5      Although counsel's declaration identified \"request for production numbers 4 and\n12,\" based on other portions of Lopez's moving papers, it appears that counsel intended to\nidentify request numbers 5 and 12.\n\n                                             22\n\f       In opposition, Watchtower reasserted its challenges to the discovery orders and\n\nalternatively argued there were insufficient grounds for terminating sanctions.\n\nWatchtower argued terminating sanctions were not appropriate because there was no\n\nevidence it destroyed or concealed documents, and instead it \"simply cannot identify all\n\nthe documents requested and produce the unprivileged documents with a privilege log in\n\nthe limited time set by this court . . . .\" Watchtower also argued it had no ability to\n\ncompel Lösch's attendance and thus should not be sanctioned for his nonappearance.\n\nWatchtower additionally asserted that a terminating sanction would be an improper\n\ndrastic remedy because Lopez would be unable to prove his claims and therefore a\n\nterminating order would place him in a better position than if defendants had complied\n\nwith the court's orders. Watchtower also challenged the monetary sanctions request\n\nrelated to Lösch's deposition notice.\n\n       In reply, Lopez produced a declaration of a computer expert (Rafiq Wayani), who\n\nwas consulted after Lopez's counsel learned of the scanned files on Watchtower's\n\ncomputer system. Wayani opined there were methods to extract the relevant data, and\n\nthat this extraction \"could take as little as two days to as long as two months,\" depending\n\non the particular system.\n\n                                F. Court's Sanctions Order\n\n       After conducting a hearing and considering the papers, the court granted Lopez's\n\nsanctions motion, stating that at the January 2 hearing, it \"considered the\n\nrecommendations of the discovery referee, as well as Watchtower's objections thereto,\n\nand adopted the recommendations as the order of the court,\" and Watchtower had\n\n\n                                             23\n\fwillfully and repeatedly refused to comply with the court's order. In its written statement\n\nof decision, the court summarized its reasoning as follows:\n\n          \"The only facts prerequisite to imposition of a discovery sanction are\n          the party's failure to comply with ordered discovery, and the failure\n          was willful. . . . This Court finds that [Watchtower] failed to comply\n          with this court's orders requiring [it] to produce Mr. Losch for\n          deposition, and to produce the documents requested by Plaintiff in\n          connection with the PMQ Notice. This Court further finds that\n          Watchtower's refusal to comply with this Court's orders was\n          willful. . . .\n\n          \"In opposing the motion, Watchtower made various arguments\n          including that Mr. Losch was not Watchtower's managing agent. . . .\n          [T]his Court has found to the contrary and has ordered his deposition\n          to proceed.\n\n          \"[Watchtower] also contends that it was not required to comply with\n          this Court's orders because it is exercising its appellate rights to\n          challenge the validity of the underlying court orders . . . . The Court\n          agrees that Watchtower is within its rights to seek appellate review.\n          However, in the absence of a stay . . . , compliance . . . is required\n          notwithstanding any pending writ petition or petition for review. . . .\n\n          \"At the hearing of this motion, Watchtower devoted substantial time\n          expressing its disagreement with the underlying orders of this Court\n          requiring the deposition of Mr. Losch, and the production of\n          documents relating to childhood sexual abuse complaints. However,\n          the validity of these orders is not at issue in the present motion. The\n          issue raised by Plaintiff's motion involve Watchtower's non-\n          compliance with this Court's orders. This Court's discovery orders\n          are valid and remain in effect, and whether [Watchtower] agrees\n          with the orders is inconsequential. Watchtower was ordered to\n          provide discovery and did not do so.\n\n          \"In its sur-reply, [Watchtower]—citing to [Ashe's] declaration—\n          states that to produce the documents sought would be so time-\n          consuming as to take years to search the relevant records. However,\n          the Court was unable to locate any evidence that Watchtower had at\n          anytime since the Court first ordered production months ago has\n          even attempted to locate responsive documents. Even at the hearing\n          of this motion, Watchtower did not provide any assurances that the\n\n\n                                            24\n\f          documents were in the process of being gathered, or that any effort\n          had been made to comply with this Court's orders.\n\n          [¶] . . . [¶]\n\n          \"The Court considered ordering the imposition of either issue\n          sanctions or evidence sanctions in lieu of the terminating sanctions\n          requested by Plaintiff. However, Plaintiff has made a showing that\n          the materials requested are relevant to nearly [every] aspect of\n          Plaintiff's claim[s], including his negligence based causes of action,\n          ratification based cause of action, and his prayer for punitive\n          damages, as well as to Defendants' claimed statute of limitations\n          defenses. Given Watchtower's willful refusal to comply with\n          multiple orders of this Court, and the fact that Watchtower produced\n          no evidence of any attempt to comply with this Court's orders, this\n          Court finds that only terminating sanctions can effectively respond\n          to Watchtower's willful refusals.\n\n          \"The Court additionally grants Plaintiff's request for monetary\n          sanctions in the amount of $37,799.21 for the reasons argued in\n          Plaintiff's papers, including the expenses associated with traveling to\n          New York relative to the scheduled Losch deposition.\"6\n\nBased on the terminating sanction order, the court entered Watchtower's default and\n\nscheduled a default prove-up hearing.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                          I. Validity of January 2 Discovery Order\n\n       As its primary challenge to the terminating sanction and entry of default,\n\nWatchtower contends the January 2 order is invalid and therefore its violations of the\n\n6       We reject Watchtower's argument that we must disregard this written statement\nbecause it came after the court's oral ruling and/or because it did not comply with\nCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 3.1590. As Watchtower admits, rule 3.1590 \"do[es] not\napply to law and motion matters such as this one.\" Additionally, Watchtower does not\ncite, nor are we aware of, any authority prohibiting a court from explaining the grounds\nfor an oral ruling after the ruling is made. A court may explain its ruling in writing, and\nthe fact Lopez's counsel prepared a draft of the order is immaterial given the court's\nsignature on the order.\n\n                                             25\n\forder cannot be the basis for a discovery sanction. Watchtower contends the court erred\n\nin ordering the Lösch deposition and the PMQ document production. Watchtower also\n\ncontends the January 2 order is void because the court did not independently consider\n\nWatchtower's objections to the Referee Recommendation.\n\n       As explained below, we conclude the court properly considered Watchtower's\n\nchallenges to the Referee Recommendation and did not abuse its discretion in ordering\n\nthe PMQ documents to be produced. But we determine the court order requiring\n\nWatchtower to produce Lösch for a deposition was invalid because the record does not\n\ncontain sufficient evidence showing Lösch was Watchtower's \"officer, director, managing\n\nagent, or employee.\" (§ 2025.280, subds. (a), (b).)\n\n       A. Court Independently Reviewed Objections to Referee Recommendation\n\n       Watchtower initially contends the January 2 order is invalid because the court did\n\nnot comply with its statutory obligation to independently consider its objections to the\n\nReferee Recommendation. (§§ 643, 644.) The record does not support this argument.\n\n       A court may direct a special reference to a discovery referee to resolve the parties'\n\ndiscovery disputes. (§ 639.) If the trial court orders the reference without the parties'\n\nconsent, \"[t]he referee's factual findings are advisory recommendations only; they are not\n\nbinding unless the trial court adopts them.\" (In re Marriage of Petropoulos (2001) 91\n\nCal.App.4th 161, 177 (Petropoulos); § 644. subd. (b).) In determining whether to adopt\n\nthe findings, the court must \"independently consider[ ] the referee's findings and any\n\nobjections and responses thereto filed with the court.\" (§ 644, subd. (b); Marathon Nat.\n\nBank v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1261 (Marathon).)\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       The court has broad discretion to determine the best method for considering a\n\nparty's challenges to the referee's findings, and the court is not required to hold a hearing\n\nor conduct a de novo analysis of the underlying arguments. (See § 644, subd. (b);\n\nMarathon, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1261.) In its review, the court should give the\n\nreferee's findings \" 'great weight' \" and focus on the parties' objections to those findings.\n\n(Petropoulos, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 176.) We examine the trial court's decision to\n\naccept the referee's recommendation for an abuse of discretion. (See Sauer v. Superior\n\nCourt (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 226.)\n\n       The court held a hearing on the Referee Recommendation. At the outset, the court\n\nacknowledged its independent obligation to consider and rule on Watchtower's objections\n\nto the Referee's conclusions. The court initially expressed concern about the ex parte\n\nnature of the hearing, but after recognizing the approaching trial date and that the parties\n\nhad fully briefed the issues, the court moved the hearing to the end of the calendar and\n\nthen provided the parties a full opportunity to argue their respective positions. Although\n\nit appears the court did not read the Referee Recommendation or Watchtower's\n\nopposition memorandum before the hearing, the record affirmatively supports that during\n\nthe hearing the court reviewed these documents, considered the newly submitted\n\ndeclarations, and carefully listened to Watchtower's counsel's oral explanation of the\n\nobjections.\n\n       Watchtower contends it was not possible for the court to read \"195 pages of\n\nwritten objections\" during the hearing. The 195-page number is misleading.\n\nWatchtower's substantive objections to the Referee Recommendation were contained in\n\n\n                                              27\n\fless than eight pages. The remaining pages included Lopez's affirmative discovery\n\nrequests, Watchtower's initial objections to the document requests (spanning about 55\n\npages of substantially identical, boilerplate objections), and the parties' briefs submitted\n\nto the Referee. At the time of the hearing, the court was highly familiar with the issues\n\nand the parties. It had presided over the case for almost two years, had ruled on similar\n\nobjections to earlier discovery requests, and had denied two summary judgment motions.\n\nWe are satisfied the trial judge had the ability to, and did, review the objections and other\n\nrelevant submissions during the hearing.\n\n       At the subsequent hearings in February, March and May 2014, the court stated it\n\nrecalled reviewing and considering Watchtower's objections and that it had independently\n\nfound them to be without merit. Absent a contrary indication on the record, we are\n\nrequired to accept the court's statements and presume the court complied with its\n\nstatutory duties. (See People v. Risenhoover (1968) 70 Cal.2d 39, 56-57 [presumption\n\nthe trial court does what it is supposed to do and reversal is inappropriate unless the\n\nrecord affirmatively shows the trial court misconstrued its powers].)\n\n       Watchtower's reliance on Rockwell International Corp. v. Superior Court (1994)\n\n26 Cal.App.4th 1255 is misplaced. The Rockwell court found \"the trial court abdicated\n\nits judicial responsibility by simply entering an order on the referee's report as though it\n\nwere a binding decision of the court itself.\" (Id. at p. 1270.) Here, the court made clear\n\nthat it understood the report was not binding, and that it was required to consider\n\nWatchtower's objections. Additionally, to the extent the Rockwell court suggested that in\n\nevery case a trial court must consider the transcript of the referee hearing and the parties'\n\n\n                                             28\n\finitial objections to the discovery, we disagree with this blanket rule. The statute requires\n\nonly that the trial court independently consider the referee's findings and any objections\n\nand responses to these findings. (§ 644, subd. (b).) Although a court's review of the\n\nreferee hearing transcript and/or the initial discovery objections may be helpful under\n\ncertain circumstances, the rules do not mandate this in every case.\n\n       Having concluded the court complied with its statutory duties, we now turn to\n\nLopez's contentions that the court abused its discretion in adopting the Referee's\n\nconclusions regarding the PMQ document requests and Lösch's deposition.\n\n                                 B. Document Production\n\n       Watchtower contends the court erred in ordering the PMQ requested documents\n\nproduced because: (1) the document requests did not seek relevant information and were\n\n\"overly broad\"; (2) the requests imposed an undue burden; (3) the order required the\n\nproduction of documents protected by the attorney-client and penitential-communication\n\nprivileges; (4) the order violated third-party privacy rights; and (5) the order violated\n\nWatchtower's First Amendment rights. For the reasons explained below, we find each of\n\nthese arguments to be without merit.\n\n                           1. Relevance/Overbreadth Arguments\n\n       California law provides parties with expansive discovery rights. Section 2017.010\n\nstates: \"[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is\n\nrelevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of\n\nany motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or\n\nappears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\" (Italics\n\n\n                                             29\n\fadded; see Garamendi v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 694, 712, fn. 8.)\n\nThe statutory phrase \" 'subject matter' \" is \" 'broader than the issues' and is not limited to\n\nadmissible evidence.\" (Jessen v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 698,\n\n711; accord, Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 172-173.)\n\n\" 'For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it \"might reasonably assist a party in\n\nevaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. . . .\" [Citation.]\n\nAdmissibility is not the test and information unless privileged, is discoverable if it might\n\nreasonably lead to admissible evidence. [Citation.] These rules are applied liberally in\n\nfavor of discovery [citation], and (contrary to popular belief), fishing expeditions are\n\npermissible in some cases.' \" (Garamendi, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 712, fn. 8.)\n\n       Lopez brought several claims against Watchtower, including negligent hiring,\n\nsupervising, and retaining Campos, and failure to warn. To prevail on his negligent\n\nhiring/retention claim, Lopez will be required to prove Campos was Watchtower's agent\n\nand Watchtower knew or had reason to believe Campos was likely to engage in sexual\n\nabuse. (Evan F. v. Hughson United Methodist Church (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 828, 836,\n\n842-843 (Evan F.); see Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1133,\n\n1139-1140; Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 395-397.)\n\nOn the negligent supervision and failure to warn claims, Lopez will be required to show\n\nWatchtower knew or should have known of Campos's alleged misconduct and did not act\n\nin a reasonable manner when it allegedly recommended him to serve as Lopez's Bible\n\ninstructor. (See Federico v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1207, 1216; Juarez,\n\nsupra, at pp. 395-397.) For each claim, Lopez will also be required to prove the alleged\n\n\n                                               30\n\fsexual abuse occurred, causation, and compensatory damages. (See Evan F., supra, at p.\n\n834.) Lopez sought punitive damages, which requires a showing of fraud, oppression, or\n\nmalice. (Civ. Code, § 3294.)\n\n       Lopez's requests at issue on appeal identified documents concerning reports of\n\nchild sexual abuse by members of the Jehovah's Witnesses from 1979 to the present, and\n\ndocuments prepared in response to a 1997 letter asking for information about known\n\nchild abusers in Jehovah's Witnesses congregations. Watchtower argues the postabuse\n\n(post-1986) documents are not relevant to his claims because \"they will not demonstrate\n\nwhat Watchtower knew before Lopez was abused (notice), what Watchtower did with\n\ninformation about Campos (negligence), or what an officer, director or managing agent of\n\nWatchtower did to express approval or censure Campos's conduct (ratification).\"\n\n       Watchtower is viewing Lopez's discovery rights too narrowly. Although the\n\ndocuments may not contain information specific to Watchtower's preincident knowledge\n\nof Campos's dangerousness or its alleged ratification of Campos's conduct, the court had\n\na valid basis to find the documents were relevant or potentially relevant to other matters\n\nat issue in the case.\n\n       First, the postincident documents were potentially relevant to Lopez's punitive\n\ndamages claim, including the reprehensibility of Watchtower's actions. \"The degree of\n\nreprehensibility of the defendant's conduct is the most important indicator of the\n\nreasonableness of a punitive damage award\" (Izell v. Union Carbide Corp. (2014) 231\n\nCal.App.4th 962, 985), and one relevant factor in this analysis is the extent to which the\n\ndefendant's alleged wrongful conduct involved repeated actions, including conduct\n\n\n                                            31\n\foccurring after the incident in question (see State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell\n\n(2003) 538 U.S. 408, 419; Izell, supra, at pp. 985-986). Although punitive damages may\n\nnot be used to punish a defendant for injury inflicted on third parties, a jury may consider\n\nevidence of harm to others in determining the reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct\n\ntoward the plaintiff. (Philip Morris USA v. Williams (2007) 549 U.S. 346, 355; Johnson\n\nv. Ford Motor Co. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1191, 1202-1204; Izell, supra, at p. 986, fn. 10;\n\nBoeken v. Philip Morris, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1640, 1691; see CACI No. 3943.)\n\nBy placing the defendant's wrongful conduct into the context of a continuing pattern and\n\npractice, \"an individual plaintiff can demonstrate that the conduct toward him or her was\n\nmore blameworthy and warrants a stronger penalty to deter continued or repeated conduct\n\nof the same nature.\" (Johnson, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 1206, fn. 6; Izell, supra, 231\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 987, fn. 10.) Accordingly, if the postabuse documents contain\n\ninformation that Watchtower continued to engage in similar conduct, this information\n\ncould support Lopez's punitive damages claim (if the case reaches that stage).\n\n       The postabuse evidence may also be relevant on the issue whether Watchtower\n\nacted with the willful and conscious disregard for Lopez's rights. If the documents show\n\nWatchtower's agents continued to commit acts of child abuse and that Watchtower did\n\nnot change its policies and/or took no meaningful protective actions, this evidence may\n\nbe probative on the issue whether Watchtower was deliberately indifferent to Lopez's\n\nrights in 1986. Failure to prevent similar incidents may tend to prove the earlier\n\nacceptance of the abuse and thus willful and conscious disregard of Lopez's rights. (See\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fHenry v. County of Shasta (9th Cir. 1997) 132 F.3d 512, 519-520; Grandstaff v. Borger\n\n(5th Cir. 1985) 767 F.2d 161, 170.)\n\n       A similar principle applies on liability issues. The postabuse documents may\n\ncontain information showing the nature of Watchtower's actions towards others accused\n\nof child abuse and this evidence could potentially shed light on Watchtower's actions or\n\nnonactions towards Campos and the intent underlying those actions. An entity's actions\n\nand the intent with which the party engaged in such actions \"may be inferred from\n\nevidence of [its] subsequent conduct,\" including that the conduct was not merely a\n\nmistake or an accident. (Tranchina v. Arcinas (1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 522, 524; see Foley\n\nv. Lowell (1st Cir. 1991) 948 F.2d 10, 14; see also In re Roman Catholic Archbishop of\n\nPortland (Bankr. D.Or. 2005) 335 B.R. 815, 823 [\"Although the relevant time frame for\n\nthese [clergy sexual abuse] claims is the time of the alleged misconduct, evidence of [the\n\nRoman Catholic Archbishop's] later policies could possibly lead to evidence that would\n\nbe relevant to the claims of negligence . . . .\"].) The postincident evidence may also be\n\nrelevant to test the validity of Watchtower's defenses regarding its knowledge of child\n\nsexual abuse at the time of the incident and the effectiveness of its claimed steps to\n\nprotect Jehovah's Witnesses children in the 1980's.\n\n       In responding to these asserted relevancy grounds, Watchtower argues \"Campos\n\nwas not a cleric, agent, or employee of Watchtower\" and therefore its postincident actions\n\ntowards other clerics, agents, or employees had no connection to the claims at issue. This\n\nargument lacks merit at this stage of the litigation. The parties have stipulated the\n\ncongregation elders were Watchtower's agents, and Lopez alleged that before the alleged\n\n\n                                             33\n\fmolestation occurred, congregation elders knew Campos had molested another child, yet\n\nrepresented to its members that Campos was a qualified Jehovah's Witnesses Bible\n\ninstructor and was \"very good with children.\" Lopez also alleged the elders knew\n\nCampos had molested multiple children and despite this knowledge later elevated\n\nCampos to the position of elder, an action Watchtower sanctioned. Given these\n\nallegations, Watchtower's assertions that Campos was merely a \"rank-and-file\n\ncongregation member\" who perpetrated the alleged abuse unrelated to the Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses congregation may be a successful defense (if proven), but it is not a basis for\n\nprecluding discovery.\n\n       Moreover, contrary to Watchtower's assertions, the fact that the other molestation\n\nincidents may have been different from the one that allegedly occurred here does not\n\nmean the other-perpetrator evidence was not discoverable. While the trial court will have\n\nto assess whether the information revealed in the documents is admissible (taking into\n\naccount similarity, remoteness, prejudice, etc.), these issues are not dispositive at the\n\ndiscovery stage. A document may be discoverable even if it is unlikely to be admitted at\n\ntrial. (See Davies v. Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 301; Volkswagen of America,\n\nInc. v. Superior Court (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1490-1491; Norton v. Superior\n\nCourt (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1750, 1761.)\n\n       Watchtower contends that even assuming the relevancy of the postabuse\n\ndocuments, the document requests were patently overbroad given that they seek\n\ndocuments prepared more than 25 years after the alleged abuse. But on the issues for\n\nwhich the sexual abuse reports may be relevant, the court had a reasonable basis to\n\n\n                                             34\n\fconclude reports prepared long after the incident could contain information helpful to\n\nLopez's case, even if the document's remoteness to the incident may preclude its\n\nadmission at trial. Moreover, Watchtower never proposed any time limits it considered\n\nreasonable. Viewing the totality of the circumstances (including the documents'\n\nconceivable significance on both liability and punitive damage issues, and the court's\n\nrejection of Watchtower's burdensome claims, discussed below), the court's\n\ndetermination was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that a 27-year postincident time period\n\nfor requested documents is unusual. But the breadth of the request is partly a function of\n\nthe permissive limitations statutes governing child sexual abuse, under which Lopez was\n\nseeking to recover for an alleged wrongful act committed almost three decades earlier.7\n\nAbsent this tolling period or an equivalent circumstance, it is unlikely that a similarly\n\ntime-expansive document production would be upheld.\n\n                   2. Claimed Burden of Document Production Request\n\n       Watchtower additionally contends that even if the requested documents were\n\ndiscoverable under the liberal discovery-relevancy standards, the court erred in ordering\n\nit to produce the documents because the burden of responding to the requests was\n\noppressive and substantially outweighed any possible relevance or informational value of\n\nthe evidence. In support, Watchtower argues the evidence was \"uncontroverted\" that \"the\n\n\n\n\n7      Whether the lawsuit was timely and/or whether Lopez's claims are supported by\nthe facts is not before us.\n\n                                             35\n\flabor involved in locating and producing the virtually unlimited records Lopez requested\n\nwill require literally tens of thousands of man hours.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       Assuming Watchtower did not waive the argument by failing to raise it with the\n\nReferee, the court's rejection of this contention was fully supported by the record.\n\nContrary to Watchtower's assertions, the evidence regarding the administrative burden\n\nwas not \"uncontroverted.\" Lopez presented evidence countering Watchtower's claim that\n\ncompliance with the Referee Recommendation would require years of \"manually\"\n\nlooking through its files. This included evidence showing Watchtower directed the elders\n\nto send to Watchtower reports about all known child abuse perpetrators in their respective\n\ncongregations and gave specific instructions on the manner in which this information\n\nshould be reported, including to segregate the reports and place them in \" 'Special Blue'\n\nenvelopes\" that were to be kept indefinitely. From this, the court had a reasonable basis\n\nto conclude the requested documents had been segregated within the congregational files\n\nand thus decline to credit Watchtower's claim it would take \"years\" to locate the\n\nresponsive documents.\n\n       The court's rejection of the burden argument was also supported by Watchtower's\n\nconduct in refusing to take any—however minimal—steps to locate the responsive\n\ndocuments or to offer any suggestions on how to reasonably narrow the request. At every\n\nhearing from January through April 2014, the court repeated its concern that although\n\nthese documents had been first requested in October 2013, Watchtower had not made any\n\neffort to identify any responsive documents. Watchtower's PMQ later admitted it was\n\npossible to quickly locate responsive documents if Watchtower knew the identity of a\n\n\n                                             36\n\fsexual abuse perpetrator. Watchtower acknowledged it was aware of at least seven other\n\nchild sexual abuse perpetrators, but it did nothing to locate documents pertaining to these\n\nindividuals.\n\n       The court's finding was also supported by evidence showing Watchtower had\n\nscanned all documents from congregation files into a computer program that had a search\n\nfunction. Although one elder (Ashe) opined the search function would not accurately\n\nidentify the other-perpetrator child abuse reports, Lopez's expert reached a contrary\n\nconclusion and there is no suggestion Watchtower made any efforts to design a search or\n\nconsult with an individual qualified to conduct a search.\n\n       Calcor Space Facility v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, relied on by\n\nWatchtower, does not support its arguments. Calcor involved a document request against\n\na nonparty that contained six pages of highly complex definitions and instructions and\n\ndid not provide reasonable specification of the documents sought. (Id. at pp. 219-221.)\n\nIn reversing an order compelling the documents, Calcor found the documents would have\n\nno evidentiary value in the litigation and urged trial courts to use their authority to\n\nprevent discovery abuse. (Id. at pp. 218-221.)\n\n       This case is different. It involves a request against a party for specifically\n\ndescribed documents that have potential relevance to the subject matter of the lawsuit or\n\nmay lead to the discovery of relevant evidence. Watchtower has superior knowledge\n\nregarding its files and documents, and the evidence showed the documents could be\n\nidentified. We are satisfied the trial court recognized the broad scope of the document\n\nrequests, but reasonably found Lopez's counsel sought the documents in good faith to\n\n\n                                              37\n\fobtain necessary and helpful information to prepare the case. Whether this court would\n\nhave reached the same conclusion as the trial court is not the issue. Instead, it is whether\n\nthe court acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in ordering Watchtower to produce\n\ndocuments responsive to the requests. Under the trial court's expansive authority over\n\ndiscovery issues, we find the court's rulings were reasonable.\n\n                                   3. Claimed Privileges\n\n       Watchtower also contends the order was invalid because it violated attorney-client\n\nand penitential-communication privileges.\n\n       This contention is unavailing because Watchtower misconstrues the scope of the\n\norder. We accept that certain requested documents could contain privileged material\n\nupon which the court would have to rule in due course. But contrary to Watchtower's\n\nassertions, neither the Referee nor the court ordered the production of privileged material.\n\nInstead, the Referee specifically ruled that Watchtower may prepare a privilege log for\n\nlater review. This ruling was incorporated into the court's January 2 order, which\n\nadopted the Referee Recommendation in full. Because responsive documents had not yet\n\nbeen identified, neither the Referee, nor the trial court, was in a position to rule on any\n\nspecific privilege claims.\n\n       Generally, \"the privilege-claimant 'has the initial burden of proving the\n\npreliminary facts to show the privilege applies.' \" (Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los\n\nAngeles v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 417, 442 (Roman Catholic\n\nArchbishop).) Once the claimant establishes the preliminary facts, it is presumed that the\n\nmatter sought to be disclosed was a communication made in confidence in the course of\n\n\n                                              38\n\fthe lawyer-client or clergy-penitent relationship. (Evid. Code, § 917.) At that point, the\n\nburden of proof shifts to the party opposing the privilege claim. (Roman Catholic\n\nArchbishop, supra, at p. 442.)\n\n       Because Watchtower had not yet produced a privilege log or identified any\n\nspecific confidential communications, it had not met its burden to show the preliminary\n\nfacts supporting the application of the privilege. Thus, its privilege claim was premature.\n\nFor example, as the court ruled earlier in this case, to the extent that the reports were\n\nwritten and sent to Watchtower with the expectation they would be read by a third party,\n\nthey do not come within the penitential-communication privilege. (See Roman Catholic\n\nArchbishop, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at pp. 444-445; see also Conti v. Watchtower Bible\n\n& Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1229-1230 (Conti).)\n\n       Watchtower argues \"the very categories and broad descriptions of information and\n\ndocuments demanded by Lopez necessarily sought documents protected by the attorney-\n\nclient and clergy-penitent privileges . . . .\" (Italics added.) The record does not support\n\nthis argument. In the challenged document requests, Lopez primarily sought reports\n\nprepared by elders in response to Watchtower's requests for the information. There is no\n\nindication that these reports necessarily arose from an attorney-client or a clergy-penitent\n\ncommunication and/or were prepared in the context of litigation.\n\n       Watchtower's reliance on Conti, supra, 235 Cal.App.4th 1214, is misplaced.\n\nWatchtower relies on the portion of Conti in which the Court of Appeal declined to\n\nimpose a duty on a clergy member to notify congregation members of a penitential\n\ncommunication (e.g., a church member's private confession to a clergyperson) involving\n\n\n                                              39\n\fsuspected child abuse. (Id. at p. 1230.) We agree with this principle, but it does not help\n\nWatchtower on the issue of whether it met its preliminary burden to show an applicable\n\nprivilege. The Conti court recognized the fundamental importance of the penitential\n\ncommunication privilege, but also found this privilege did not apply to communications\n\nif they were shared with others or made with the expectation they would be disclosed\n\nbeyond the protected relationship. (Id. at pp. 1229-1230.) This principle applies equally\n\nin this case and underscores the need for Watchtower to have provided a privilege log to\n\nsupport any privilege claim.\n\n       In asserting error on the privilege issue, Watchtower focuses on the Referee's\n\nstatement that it would review the claimed privileged documents \"in camera.\"\n\nWatchtower correctly argues that privileged communications are generally not subject to\n\nin camera review. (See Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2010) 47 Cal.4th\n\n725, 736-737.) But there are two fundamental flaws with Watchtower's contention for\n\npurposes of our appellate review. First, there is no showing on this record that\n\nWatchtower raised this in camera issue below. Thus, it is waived. (See Cardinal Health\n\n301, Inc. v. Tyco Electronics Corp. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 116, 155.) More important,\n\nthis contention is unrelated to the court's sanctions order. The court did not sanction\n\nWatchtower because it refused to provide the privileged documents for an in camera\n\nreview. Instead, the court imposed a sanction for Watchtower's willfully violating the\n\ncourt's order to search for, identify, and produce nonprivileged documents (and/or at least\n\nstart this process), and prepare a privilege log for any responsive privileged documents.\n\nIt is undisputed that Watchtower failed to do this. To the extent Watchtower is arguing\n\n\n                                             40\n\fthat it did not make any effort to comply with the court's order because it was concerned\n\nwith the Referee's summary reference to an in camera hearing, we find this argument\n\nunconvincing.\n\n                               4. Third-Party Privacy Rights\n\n       Watchtower contends the court's January 2 order was also invalid because it would\n\nviolate the privacy rights of others, and the court \"failed to adequately take the rights of\n\nthose third parties into consideration . . . .\" The Referee and the trial court rejected these\n\narguments because the order specifically permitted Watchtower to redact names,\n\nbirthdates, and Social Security numbers from the documents.\n\n       Watchtower argues the redaction would not prevent the violation of privacy rights\n\n\"where the circumstances surrounding such reports would nonetheless make them readily\n\nidentifiable to anyone with a modicum of familiarity with those individuals.\" This\n\nargument is unsupported by the record. There were no facts before the Referee or the\n\ntrial court showing the documents would disclose the identities of the individuals after\n\ndeleting personal identifying information. To the extent Watchtower believes that a\n\nparticular document would fall within this category, it had the right to seek some form of\n\nprotection. But the record does not support a blanket objection based on third-party\n\nprivacy rights given the order's express redaction provision.\n\n       We find unavailing Watchtower's additional argument that the documents relating\n\nto other child abuse perpetrators were sought solely to assist Lopez's counsel in soliciting\n\nadditional clients. The Referee and the court rejected this argument, and they had a\n\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\freasonable basis to do so. There is no basis in the appellate record showing the court\n\nabused its discretion in finding the discovery was sought for proper purposes.\n\n                               5. First Amendment Objection\n\n       Watchtower next argues the January 2 order was improper because it violated its\n\nFirst Amendment religious freedom rights. In support, Watchtower contends that issues\n\nof ratification and agency are \"inquiries which necessarily require the court to entangle\n\nitself in the interpretation, evaluation and determination of the religious beliefs and\n\ninternal governance of Jehovah's Witnesses.\" This argument is not a basis for limiting\n\ndiscovery at this stage of the litigation. The court's January 2 order did not reflect the\n\ncourt's ruling that Lopez's ratification or agency theories are legally valid or that the court\n\nor jury will be permitted to engage in factfinding that would interfere with religious\n\ndoctrine.\n\n       In a related argument, Watchtower relies on a line of cases applying the\n\nministerial-privilege doctrine, a constitutionally based rule that exempts religious\n\norganizations from liability arising from employment-related claims by a religious figure.\n\n(See Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC. (2012) __ U.S. __\n\n[132 S.Ct. 694, 706-707]; Alcazar v. Corp. of Catholic Archbishop (9th Cir. 2010) 598\n\nF.3d 668, 672-673, affd. in part and vacated in part, 627 F.3d 1288; see also Henry v. Red\n\nHill Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tustin (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1053.) This\n\ndoctrine \" 'is based on the notion a church's appointment of its clergy, along with such\n\nclosely related issues as clerical salaries, assignments, working conditions, and\n\ntermination of employment, is an inherently religious function because clergy are such an\n\n\n                                              42\n\fintegral part of a church's functioning as a religious institution.' \" (Henry v. Red Hill,\n\nsupra, at p. 1053; Roman Catholic Archbishop, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 433.)\n\n       This rule is not applicable here. The ministerial exception applies to bar an action\n\nby a clergy member against a religious institution. (See Roman Catholic Archbishop,\n\nsupra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 433.) Watchtower has not cited, nor are we aware of, any\n\ndecisions extending this rule to preclude a third party action against a religious\n\norganization for the tortious conduct of its agents. And the law appears to be to the\n\ncontrary. (See Evan F., supra, 8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 841-843 [Methodist pastor molesting\n\nminor]; Stevens v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Fresno (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 877, 884-887\n\n[visiting French priest held agent of local diocese for purposes of holding the diocese\n\nliable for priest's negligence in vehicle accident].)\n\n       More than 10 years ago, a Court of Appeal rejected a similar First Amendment\n\nargument seeking to preclude the production of documents in a child sexual abuse case.\n\n(Roman Catholic Archbishop, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at pp. 432-433.) There, the grand\n\njury subpoenaed documents from the Archdiocese to determine whether to indict priests\n\nwho allegedly sexually abused children while working for the Archdiocese. (Id. at p.\n\n425.) In affirming orders compelling the document production, the court rejected\n\narguments that the disclosure order violated constitutional religious freedom rights, and\n\nfound the asserted \"ecclesiastical abstention doctrine\" and the \"ministerial exception\" rule\n\nwere inapplicable to the case. (Id. at pp. 430-440.) The court also held \"the disclosure of\n\nthe subpoenaed documents . . . will not result in excessive entanglement or any other\n\nviolation of the establishment clause.\" (Id. at p. 436.)\n\n\n                                              43\n\f                                   C. Lösch's Deposition\n\n       Watchtower contends the court erred in ordering it to produce Lösch for\n\ndeposition. The court's order was based on the court's adoption of the Referee's finding\n\nthat Lösch is a \"managing agent\" under section 2025.280, subdivision (a), and thus\n\nservice of the notice on Watchtower was sufficient to require Lösch's appearance. On the\n\nfactual record before us, we determine Lopez did not satisfy his minimal burden to\n\npresent evidence showing Lösch fell within the statutory \"managing agent\" category.\n\n(§ 2025.280, subd. (a).) Accordingly, the order compelling Watchtower to produce\n\nLösch was invalid and the court did not have the authority to sanction Watchtower for its\n\nnoncompliance with this order.\n\n                                  1. Statutory Framework\n\n       Generally, a party may require the deposition of a nonparty only if the party serves\n\nthe deponent with a deposition subpoena. (§ 2025.280, subd. (b).) Thus, a deposition\n\nnotice served on the opposing party is inadequate to compel a third party's attendance.\n\n(Ibid.) However, a subpoena is not required if the deponent is \"an officer, director,\n\nmanaging agent, or employee of a party.\" (§ 2025.280, subd. (a).) The discovery statutes\n\nrefer to this deponent as a \"party-affiliated deponent.\" (§ 2025.450, subd. (h).) The\n\nrequisite \"party-affiliated\" relationship must exist at the time of the deposition notice.\n\n(Maldonado v. Superior Court (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1398 (Maldonado).)\n\n       If a party-affiliated deponent fails to obey a court order to attend a deposition, the\n\ncourt may impose monetary, evidentiary, issue, or terminating sanctions against the party.\n\n(§§ 2025.450, subd. (h), 2025.480, subd. (k); see § 2023.030.) However, if the deponent\n\n\n                                              44\n\fis not a party or a party-affiliated deponent, the court has no authority to impose sanctions\n\non the party for the deponent's disobedience of the order. (See ibid.; § 2025.280, subd.\n\n(b); Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group\n\n2015) ¶ 8:824, p. 8E-144.) By creating this distinction, the Legislature necessarily\n\nrecognized a party should not be sanctioned if it had no legal or practical means to\n\nrequire the nonparty deponent to attend his or her deposition.\n\n                             2. Definition of Managing Agent\n\n       Both parties acknowledge that Lösch was not a party, nor was he an officer,\n\ndirector, or employee of Watchtower. However, Lopez argued Lösch was a party-\n\naffiliated deponent because he was a \"managing agent\" based on his status as a member\n\nof a Jehovah's Witnesses organization known as the \"Governing Body.\" In support,\n\nLopez presented evidence showing the Governing Body issues policy directives\n\napplicable to Watchtower and the local congregations. Although Watchtower argued\n\nbelow (and on appeal) that the Governing Body has solely a spiritual function within the\n\nJehovah's Witnesses religion, Lopez's evidence showed that the Governing Body has\n\nbroader administrative responsibilities, such as issuing policy guidelines regarding child\n\nabuse prevention and reporting in local congregations. The Referee, as a trier of fact, was\n\nentitled to find this evidence credible and reject Watchtower's contrary evidence. On its\n\nindependent review, the court also had a reasonable basis to adopt this factual finding in\n\nits January 2 order.\n\n       But the fact the Governing Body had this policymaking function does not answer\n\nthe question whether Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing agent.\" The California\n\n\n                                             45\n\fSupreme Court has defined a \"managing agent\" for purposes of the discovery statutes as\n\n\"a person who may exercise his judgment and discretion in dealing with corporate\n\nmatters, who can be expected to comply with [the party's] directive to appear for [the\n\nrequested examination], and who can be anticipated to identify himself with the interests\n\nof the corporation.\" (Waters v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 885, 896 (Waters).)\n\n\"The question whether a particular deponent is a 'managing agent' of one of the parties\n\nfor purposes of pretrial discovery proceedings must of necessity be answered\n\npragmatically\" and is highly dependent on the particular factual circumstances before the\n\ncourt. (Id. at pp. 896-897; see Roehl v. Texas Co. (1930) 107 Cal.App. 691, 704.) In\n\nanalyzing the issue, California courts look to federal court decisions that apply a similar\n\n\"managing agent\" test. (Waters, at pp. 895-896; see Reed Paper Co. v. Proctor &\n\nGamble Distributing Co. (D.Me. 1992) 144 F.R.D. 2, 4.) Generally, it is the party\n\nseeking to compel the deposition that has the initial burden to show the foundational facts\n\nto support a \"managing agent\" finding. (See Sugarhill Records, Ltd. v. Motown Record\n\nCorp. (S.D.N.Y. 1985) 105 F.R.D. 166, 170.)\n\n       Before applying the Waters test, we note our agreement with Lopez that a\n\n\"managing agent\" need not be an employee. Given that the terms \"employee,\" \"officer,\"\n\n\"director,\" and \"managing agent\" are each used in the statutory description of a party-\n\naffiliated deponent, and the statute uses these terms in the disjunctive (§ 2025.280, subd.\n\n(a)), we agree that a \"managing agent\" need not also be an employee, officer, or director.\n\nOtherwise, the use of the phrase \"managing agent\" would be surplusage. (See Reno v.\n\nBaird (1998) 18 Cal.4th 640, 658 [\" '[c]ourts should give meaning to every word of a\n\n\n                                             46\n\fstatute if possible, and should avoid a construction making any word [or phrase]\n\nsurplusage' \"].) This conclusion is consistent with analysis by federal courts, which have\n\nrecognized that a third party (such as an independent contractor or former officer) may be\n\ndeemed a party's \"managing agent\" upon a factual showing that the deponent currently\n\nserves in that functional role. (United States v. Afram Lines, Ltd. (1994) 159 F.R.D. 408,\n\n413 (Afram); see Founding Church of Scientology, Inc. v. Webster (Fed. Cir. 1986) 802\n\nF.2d 1448, 1451-1453; Dubai Islamic Bank v. Citibank, N.A. (S.D.N.Y. 2002) 2002 WL\n\n1159699, p. *3; U. S. Fidelity & Guar. Co. v. Braspetro Oil Services Co. (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2001) 2001 WL 43607, p. *3 (Braspetro); Calgene, Inc. v. Enzo Biochem, Inc. (E.D.Cal.\n\n1993) 1993 WL 645999, p. *8.) We also find Watchtower's reliance on decisions\n\nconstruing the \"managing agent\" phrase within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294,\n\nsubdivision (b) not particularly helpful because the punitive damages and discovery\n\nstatutes have different language, purposes, and objectives.\n\n              3. Insufficient Evidence Showing Lösch Is a Managing Agent\n\n       With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the three Waters factors: (1)\n\ndoes the person exercise judgment and discretion in dealing with the party's matters; (2)\n\ncan the person be expected to comply with the party's directive to appear; and (3) can the\n\nperson be anticipated to identify himself or herself with the party's interests. (Waters,\n\nsupra, 58 Cal.2d at p. 896.)\n\n       Lopez's evidence satisfies the first and third factors. Lopez presented Shuster's\n\ndeposition testimony stating Lösch is a long-standing member of the Governing Body,\n\nwhich approves operational guidelines for the United States Branch of the Jehovah's\n\n\n                                             47\n\fWitnesses organization, including issuing directives for preventing and investigating\n\nchild sexual abuse within the church. Shuster also testified that the Governing Body\n\n\"oversees\" the worldwide activity of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n       Based on this testimony, the court could reasonably infer Lösch (as a Governing\n\nBody member) had the authority to, and did, exercise supervisorial authority and\n\ndiscretionary judgment over Watchtower's operations, including those potentially\n\nrelevant to the issues in this case. Based on this same evidence, the court could have also\n\nreasonably found Lösch would likely identify with Watchtower's interests.\n\n       However, Lopez failed to produce any evidence on the second Waters factor:\n\nwhether the proposed deponent can be expected to comply with the party's directive to\n\nappear. Although there was evidence indicating the Governing Body (and its members)\n\nasserted authority over Watchtower and could influence its conduct, there was no\n\nevidence showing the reverse was true. For example, Lopez proffered no facts to indicate\n\nthat Lösch receives compensation or other tangible benefits from Watchtower or that\n\nGoverning Body members had previously complied with such deposition directives. (See\n\nAfram, supra, 159 F.R.D. at p. 415 [deponent's \"history of cooperating with a party in\n\ndiscovery may be probative of the party's ability to rely on the agent to testify\"].)\n\nLikewise, there was no evidence concerning the Governing Body's status as a separate\n\nlegal entity or as an affiliate of Watchtower. (See Braspetro, supra, 2001 WL 43607, *5\n\n[fact that deponent is \"completely separate entity from [party], without any contractual\n\nobligation to act on [party's] behalf\" means \"there is no reason to assume that [party] can\n\nassure participation in a deposition for an action to which [deponent] is not a party\"].)\n\n\n                                             48\n\fWithout evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that Watchtower had\n\nsome legal or practical ability to influence Lösch's decision to attend the deposition, there\n\nis no basis to conclude Lösch could be expected to comply with Watchtower's directives\n\nto appear.\n\n       If the deponent is the party's employee, officer, or director, an entity has\n\nsubstantial practical control to compel the attendance of these individuals, including the\n\nability to terminate an employee who refuses to appear at a noticed deposition or to end\n\nthe relationship with its officer or director. (See Twin Lock, Inc. v. Superior Court (1959)\n\n52 Cal.2d 754, 759 [\"There can be no doubt that a witness . . . will be under considerable\n\ncoercion to attend whenever his corporate employer is placed upon the severe sanctions\n\nauthorized by section 2034.\"].) But if the deponent has no formal or legal role within the\n\nparty's organization, there must be some additional factual basis to establish the party has\n\nthe practical ability to require the nonparty's compliance. (See Maldonado, supra, 94\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1398 [holding party was not required to produce a former employee\n\neven if \"the former employees are far more knowledgeable about the litigation than\n\nanyone currently employed by the company\"].)\n\n       Viewing the entire record and applying the required pragmatic analysis, there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support a determination that Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing\n\nagent\" for purposes of compelling his deposition and granting sanctions for his\n\nnonappearance. The discovery statutes must be construed to ensure fairness and that the\n\nends of justice are served. Because a party may be subject to severe sanctions if a party-\n\naffiliate does not attend a deposition, there must be at least some minimal showing that\n\n\n                                             49\n\fthe party has the ability to induce the deponent to attend the scheduled deposition. A\n\ncontrary conclusion would be unjust and inconsistent with the purposes of discovery\n\nprocedures under California law—to avoid surprise, aid in ensuring all parties are in\n\npossession of relevant facts, and assure fairness to all parties.\n\n                                 III. Terminating Sanctions\n\n       Watchtower also contends the court erred in issuing terminating sanctions.\n\nBecause the court ordered the sanctions issued based on both discovery orders, and we\n\nare reversing one of those orders, the matter must be remanded to the trial court. But\n\ngiven that the issues may arise again on remand and for purposes of judicial efficiency,\n\nwe shall rule on Watchtower's contention.\n\n       California discovery law authorizes a range of penalties for a party's refusal to\n\nobey a discovery order, including monetary sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue\n\nsanctions, and terminating sanctions. (§§ 2023.010, 2023.030; Los Defensores, Inc. v.\n\nGomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174\n\nCal.App.4th 967, 991 (Doppes).) A court has broad discretion in selecting the\n\nappropriate penalty, and we must uphold the court's determination absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. (Los Defensores, supra, at p. 390.) We defer to the court's credibility\n\ndecisions and draw all reasonable inferences in support of the court's ruling. (Id. at pp.\n\n390-391.)\n\n       Despite this broad discretion, the courts have long recognized that the terminating\n\nsanction is a drastic penalty and should be used sparingly. (See Newland v. Superior\n\nCourt (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613-616.) A trial court must be cautious when\n\n\n                                              50\n\fimposing a terminating sanction because the sanction eliminates a party's fundamental\n\nright to a trial, thus implicating due process rights. (See Lyons v. Wickhorst (1986) 42\n\nCal.3d 911, 916; Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at pp. 613-614.) The trial court should\n\nselect a sanction that is \" ' \"tailor[ed] . . . to the harm caused by the withheld\n\ndiscovery.\" ' \" (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) \" '[S]anctions \"should be\n\nappropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the\n\ninterests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.\" ' \" (Ibid.)\n\n       The discovery statutes thus \"evince an incremental approach to discovery\n\nsanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of\n\ntermination.\" (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992, italics added.) Although in\n\nextreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure\n\n(see Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 928-929; Alliance\n\nBank v. Murray (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1, 10), a terminating sanction should generally\n\nnot be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be\n\nunsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective (see\n\nVan Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516; Doppes, supra, 174\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 992; Oliveros v. County of Los Angeles (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1389,\n\n1399; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496).\n\n       There is no question that Watchtower willfully failed to comply with the document\n\nproduction order. In the January 2 written order, the court required Watchtower to\n\nproduce the documents requested in Lopez's PMQ deposition notice, and the court\n\nrepeated this order at several subsequent hearings, including with respect to the postabuse\n\n\n                                               51\n\freports. Watchtower made no effort to comply with the order, and instead continued to\n\nrepeat its previously unsuccessful objections. The court rejected the credibility of\n\nWatchtower's assertions that it would need to physically inspect each congregation file\n\nand that this inspection would take many years to complete. The court instead credited\n\nthe Watchtower PMQ's deposition testimony that all potentially responsive documents\n\nhave been scanned into a computer system and Lopez's expert's opinion that this\n\ncomputer system has a search function that could assist in identifying the requested\n\ndocuments. The court also repeatedly emphasized Watchtower's failure to take any\n\nsteps—however minimal—toward complying with the court's order.\n\n       On this record, the court had the authority to impose sanctions for Watchtower's\n\nwillful disobedience of its order. But, as Lopez admits, the terminating sanctions order\n\nwas the first and only sanction imposed (along with a monetary sanction for the Lösch\n\ndeposition costs). And the court imposed the sanction within four months of its initial\n\ndocument production order.\n\n       The fundamental flaw with the court's approach is that there is no basis in the\n\nrecord showing the court could not have obtained Watchtower's compliance with lesser\n\nsanctions or that another sanction could not effectively remedy the discovery violation.\n\nTo the contrary, the record supports that the court had numerous tools at its disposal to\n\ncompel compliance before imposing the ultimate sanction. For example, the court could\n\nhave imposed a significant monetary penalty for every day Watchtower did not search for\n\nthe documents and/or for each day the responsive documents were not produced.\n\nAlternatively, the court could have imposed evidentiary or issue sanctions to replace the\n\n\n                                            52\n\finformation that would or could be included within those documents. When a party does\n\nnot produce ordered documents, the court is entitled to infer the documents would contain\n\nevidence damaging to that party's case and instruct the jury accordingly. (See Kuhns v.\n\nState of California (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 982, 987-990.) Thus, as Watchtower now\n\nproposes \"the trial court could have . . . ordered an issue sanction that would have\n\nprecluded Watchtower from disputing certain aspects of liability at trial.\" Or—if the case\n\nproceeded to the punitive damage stage—the court could have considered instructing the\n\njury that Watchtower refused to produce documents concerning subsequent child sexual\n\nabuse incidents, and from that the jury could infer Watchtower had engaged in a pattern\n\nand practice of ignoring and/or ratifying sexual abuse by its agents.\n\n       Although the court made a conclusory observation in its written order that it had\n\nconsidered imposing issue or evidentiary sanctions, the record does not contain any basis\n\nto find the court had made a meaningful effort to determine whether the alternatives\n\nwould be effective. The court suggested only that a suitable alternate sanction could not\n\nbe devised because the \"materials requested are relevant to nearly [every] aspect of\n\n[Lopez's] claim[s].\"\n\n       This finding is unsupported. Viewing the record at this stage of the litigation, it is\n\nunlikely the responsive information would relate to at least some of the core issues at\n\ntrial, including whether Lopez was in fact a victim of the abuse, whether Castro was\n\nWatchtower's agent, whether Watchtower's statute of limitations defense applied in this\n\ncase, and the existence and extent of Lopez's economic and/or emotional distress\n\ndamages. Watchtower previously complied with the court's order to produce all\n\n\n                                             53\n\funprivileged documents pertaining to Castro and Watchtower's knowledge of his prior or\n\nsubsequent misconduct, and these documents would have contained information on\n\nseveral of these core issues. Given that there were disputed issues unaffected by the\n\ndocument production and the court and parties made no meaningful effort to at least\n\nconsider and discuss possible alternative sanctions, the court's conclusion that there was\n\nno effective alternate sanction is premature and unsupported.\n\n        We conclude the court erred in ordering terminating sanctions because there was\n\nno evidence that lesser sanctions would have failed to obtain Watchtower's compliance\n\nwith the document production order and because there were other possible sanctions that\n\ncould have effectively remedied the discovery violation. On remand, the court has broad\n\ndiscretion to start with a different sanction that does not wholly eliminate Watchtower's\n\nright to a trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n       We order the court to vacate: (1) the portion of the January 2 order requiring\n\nWatchtower to produce Lösch for his deposition; (2) the order granting terminating and\n\nmonetary sanctions; and (3) the entry of default and the default judgment.

Reversed.\n\n        Williams Iagmin and Jon R. Williams for Defendant and Appellant.\n\n        The Zalkin Law Firm, Irwin M. Zalkin and Devin M. Storey; Pine & Pine,\n\nNorman Pine and Scott Tillet, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\n\n        Jose Lopez sued the national Jehovah's Witnesses organization, Watchtower Bible\n\nand Tract Society of New York, Inc. (Watchtower), alleging his Bible instructor sexually\n\nabused him in 1986 when he was a child. Lopez asserted several legal theories, including\n\nfailure to warn, negligent supervision, and negligent hiring/retention. After contentious\n\fdiscovery disputes, the court issued two discovery orders against Watchtower: (1)\n\ncompelling the deposition of an individual (Gerrit Lösch) whom the court found was a\n\n\"managing agent\" of Watchtower; and (2) ordering the production of documents in\n\nWatchtower's files pertaining to other perpetrators of child sexual abuse. When\n\nWatchtower failed to comply with these orders, the court granted Lopez's motion for\n\nmonetary and terminating sanctions, struck Watchtower's answer, and entered\n\nWatchtower's default.1\n\n       On appeal, Watchtower challenges the validity of the discovery orders and\n\ncontends the court abused its discretion in failing to impose lesser sanctions. We reject\n\nWatchtower's challenges to the document production order, but conclude the court erred\n\nin ordering Watchtower to produce Lösch for his deposition. The factual record does not\n\nsupport the court's finding that Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing agent\" and therefore\n\nthe court erred in sanctioning Watchtower for Lösch's nonattendance at the deposition.\n\n(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.280, 2025.450.)2 We additionally conclude that under the\n\nparticular circumstances of this case, the court erred in issuing terminating sanctions as\n\nthe initial remedial measure without first attempting to compel compliance with its\n\ndiscovery orders by using lesser sanctions and/or by imposing evidentiary or issue\n\nsanctions.\n\n\n\n1     The court later entered a default judgment in Lopez's favor for $13.5 million. This\njudgment is the subject of a separate appeal.\n\n2      Statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Accordingly, we reverse the order compelling the Lösch deposition and the entry\n\nof default based on the terminating sanctions. We remand for the court to consider the\n\nappropriate sanctions for Watchtower's violation of the document production order. The\n\ninitial measure should be a remedy that is less onerous than a terminating sanction.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                               A. Summary of Allegations\n\n       The Jehovah's Witnesses is a religion with more than 1.2 million members in\n\nabout 13,777 congregations in the United States. During the relevant times, Watchtower\n\nsupervised the local congregations and was responsible for the religion's policies and\n\nadministrative matters. Jehovah's Witnesses congregations are comprised of elders\n\n(spiritual leaders responsible for congregation governance), ministerial servants\n\n(performing administrative tasks), and various levels of baptized members, including\n\npublishers (rank-and-file members). As stipulated by the parties, congregation elders\n\nserve as agents for Watchtower.\n\n       In June 2012, 34-year-old Lopez filed a complaint against Watchtower and the\n\nLinda Vista Spanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (Linda Vista congregation),\n\nseeking damages for sexual abuse committed by Gonzales Campos in 1986 when Lopez\n\nwas about seven years old. In his amended complaint, Lopez alleged that in the mid-\n\n1980's, Lopez's mother was a baptized Jehovah's Witnesses member associated with the\n\nLinda Vista congregation, and received Bible study from a congregation elder, Joel\n\nMunoz. Munoz recommended to Lopez's mother that Lopez should be receiving Bible\n\nstudy instruction and she \"should approach [Campos] because he was very good with\n\n\n                                             3\n\fchildren.\" Following this direction, Lopez's mother spoke with Campos and Campos\n\nbegan giving lessons to Lopez. After Campos had given Lopez several Bible study\n\nlessons, and in the context of a Bible study lesson, Campos sexually molested Lopez.\n\n         Lopez reported the abuse to his mother, who reported it to Elder Munoz and his\n\nwife. The next day, several elders from the Linda Vista congregation came to Lopez's\n\nhome and spoke to Lopez's mother about the abuse. One of the elders asked Lopez to\n\nshow him, on a teddy bear or doll, where Campos had touched him. Soon after, Lopez's\n\nfamily left the congregation and Lopez had no additional contact with Campos.\n\n         At the time of the abuse, Campos was directed by Linda Vista congregation\n\nleaders to provide Bible instruction to Lopez and other minors. In giving the Bible study\n\nlessons to minors, Campos filled out a form for each study session, identifying the Bible\n\nstudy student, address, and date of the lesson, and submitted each form to a congregation\n\nelder.\n\n         About four years earlier, in approximately 1982, Campos had allegedly sexually\n\nmolested another young boy from the Linda Vista congregation. Soon after the abuse,\n\nthis earlier victim reported the abuse to his mother, who reported the abuse to two church\n\nelders. When questioned by the elders, Campos confessed to acting inappropriately. The\n\nelders nonetheless continued to hold Campos out as safe to be around children, and\n\naffirmatively recommended him to serve as a Bible study instructor.\n\n         Campos had been a member of the Linda Vista congregation since about 1979. In\n\n1987, Campos became associated with another Jehovah's Witnesses congregation (La\n\nJolla Spanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, also known as Playa Pacifica\n\n\n                                             4\n\fSpanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (La Jolla congregation)). In about 1988,\n\nLa Jolla congregation elders appointed Campos to a ministerial servant position, and\n\nWatchtower approved the appointment. While serving as a ministerial servant, Campos\n\nfrequently preached at the Linda Vista and La Jolla congregations, and continued to teach\n\nBible study to Jehovah's Witnesses children. In 1993, Watchtower approved Campos's\n\nappointment as elder of the La Jolla congregation, and he was later appointed secretary of\n\nthe congregation, placing him on the congregation's governing \"Service Committee.\"\n\n       Lopez alleged that Campos sexually abused at least eight other Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses children between 1982 and 1995, including when Campos served as an elder.\n\nSome of these abuse incidents were reported to congregation elders.\n\n       Based on these allegations, Lopez's amended complaint asserted six causes of\n\naction against Watchtower and the Linda Vista congregation: negligence; negligent\n\nsupervision/failure to warn; negligent hiring/retention; negligent failure to warn, train or\n\neducate; sexual battery; and sexual harassment. Lopez alleged defendants were negligent\n\nbecause they knew or should have known of Campos's \"dangerous and exploitive\n\npropensities and/or that [he] was an unfit agent\"; they allowed Campos to come into\n\ncontact with Lopez without supervision; they failed to tell or concealed from Lopez and\n\nhis parents that Campos had previously sexually abused minors; they failed to tell law\n\nenforcement officials that Lopez had been sexually abused, making it less likely Lopez\n\nwould receive medical/mental health care and treatment; and they held out Campos to\n\nLopez and his parents as being in good standing and trustworthy. Lopez claimed \"[b]y\n\nretaining and promoting [Campos] after learning of his past sexual abuse of children,\n\n\n                                              5\n\f[Watchtower] ratified and authorized [Campos's] conduct.\" Lopez alleged \"[d]efendants\n\nacted with willful and conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others by repeatedly\n\nignoring warnings and complaints that [Campos] had committed acts of sexual abuse\n\nupon minors and allowing [Campos] to attain and retain elevated positions within the\n\nJehovah's Witness[es] religion . . . [w]here he had access to unsuspecting minors.\"\n\n       Lopez alleged the lawsuit was timely under California law. (See § 340.1, subds.\n\n(a), (b)(1), (2).) Lopez claimed Campos's sexual abuse resulted in \"various psychological\n\ncoping mechanisms\" that precluded him from \"ascertaining the resulting damages from\n\nthat conduct, or the wrongfulness of [Campos's] conduct\" and that he did not discover the\n\n\"causal relationship between the molestation and adulthood psychological injuries\" until\n\nApril 2012.\n\n       Lopez later amended the complaint to add a punitive damage claim.\n\n                                  B. Discovery Disputes\n\n                1. Discovery Relating to Campos's Molestation of Others\n\n       At some point before February 2013, Lopez propounded document requests on\n\nWatchtower. The requests sought documents pertaining to written complaints and\n\ninvestigations concerning Campos's sexual abuse of other victims. Watchtower identified\n\nresponsive documents, but declined to produce them on the basis of the First\n\nAmendment, overbreadth, clergy-penitent privilege, and third-party privacy rights.\n\nWatchtower also refused to produce any documents generated after the date Lopez was\n\nallegedly abused (1986), stating the documents were not relevant or admissible, and thus\n\nnot discoverable.\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       Lopez moved to compel the production of the documents, and the court granted\n\nthe motion in part. After briefing and a hearing, the court broadly rejected Watchtower's\n\narguments regarding scope, overbreadth, privacy, and the First Amendment. On the\n\npenitential-communications privilege, the court conducted an in camera hearing, and\n\nfound all but four of the withheld documents were not protected. In reviewing the\n\ndocuments, the court applied the rule that documents created with the knowledge they\n\nwould be read by third parties were not protected by the penitential-communications\n\nprivilege. (See Evid. Code, § 1032.)3\n\n                       2. Deposition Notices at Issue in this Appeal\n\n       Several months later, in August 2013, Lopez's counsel notified defense counsel of\n\nhis intent to notice several depositions, including (1) Watchtower's person most qualified\n\n(PMQ); and (2) Gerrit Lösch, a member of a Jehovah's Witnesses entity known as the\n\n\"Governing Body.\"\n\n       On September 20, 2013, Lopez noticed the deposition of Watchtower's PMQ on\n\n30 identified subject matters. The notice requested the deponent to produce 29 separate\n\ncategories of documents similar to the identified subject matters. The topics and\n\nrequested documents related to Watchtower's organizational structure, including its\n\n\n3      California law defines a \" 'penitential communication' \" as \"a communication\nmade in confidence, in the presence of no third person so far as the penitent is aware, to a\nmember of the clergy who, in the course of the discipline or practice of the clergy\nmember's church, denomination, or organization, is authorized or accustomed to hear\nthose communications and, under the discipline or tenets of his or her church,\ndenomination, or organization, has a duty to keep those communications secret.\" (Evid.\nCode, § 1032.)\n\n\n                                             7\n\fcommittees and the Governing Body; the formulation and implementation of\n\norganizational policies; reports of childhood sexual abuse within the organization from\n\n1979 through the current date, including sexual abuse perpetrators other than Campos;\n\nand Watchtower's handling of sexual abuse notifications.\n\n      Two requests are of particular relevance here because Watchtower's failure to\n\nprovide any documents responsive to these requests was one ground for the court's\n\nterminating sanctions order. Request No. 5 sought:\n\n          \"Any and all individual written accounts, reports, summaries, letters,\n          emails, facsimiles, and records, whether or not compiled, concerning\n          reports of sexual abuse of children by members of the Jehovah's\n          Witnesses, including but not limited to, Governing Body members,\n          district overseers, circuit overseers, elders, ministerial servants,\n          pioneers, publishers, baptized publishers, and individuals from the\n          time period of 1979 to the present.\"\n\nRequest No. 12 sought:\n\n          \"All letters, emails, facsimiles, or other documentary, tangible, or\n          electronically stored information of any kind, Watchtower Bible and\n          Tract Society New York, Inc. received in response to the Body of\n          Elder Letter Dated March 14, 1997.\"4\n\n      On October 9, Watchtower served objections to the requested documents. Those\n\nobjections included: (1) the documents seek information protected from discovery by the\n\n4       The March 14, 1997 letter instructed elders to send a written report to Watchtower\nabout \"anyone who is currently serving or who formerly served in a [Watchtower]-\nappointed position in your congregation who is known to have been guilty of child\nmolestation in the past.\" Watchtower said this information should be kept confidential,\nand instructed elders to place the reports in a \" 'Special Blue' \" envelope. The March 14\nletter also reminded elders of prior letters stating that when a known \"child molester\"\nmoves to another congregation, a letter of introduction should be sent to the new\ncongregation and copies of the letter should be sent to Watchtower in the \" 'Special Blue'\nenvelopes.\"\n\n\n                                            8\n\fpenitential-communications privilege; (2) the documents are protected by the attorney-\n\nclient privilege and/or work-product doctrine; (3) the requests are \"overly broad as to\n\ntime\" and not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence; (4) the disclosure of\n\nthe documents would violate third-party privacy rights; (5) the requests violate\n\nWatchtower's First Amendment rights to religious freedom; and (6) the requests are\n\nunduly burdensome with the intent to harass Watchtower and solicit other clients.\n\n       In late October 2013, the court held a hearing on defendants' summary judgment\n\nmotion pertaining to the statute of limitations. After hearing argument, the court denied\n\nthe motion. The court then noted the upcoming trial date (in January 2014) and asked the\n\nparties whether they had resolved their discovery disputes regarding the PMQ deposition.\n\nThe parties reminded the court it had ordered the parties to meet and confer on discovery\n\nreferees and notified the court that they had agreed on three names. The court then\n\nrandomly chose one of those names to serve as discovery referee: former San Diego\n\nCounty Superior Court Judge Vincent Di Figlia (Referee).\n\n       On November 7, 2013, Lopez served Watchtower with a notice of Lösch's\n\ndeposition. Watchtower objected to the deposition on the ground it \"violates the 'apex-\n\ndeposition rule' \" (a rule prohibiting the deposition of a high-ranking official unless the\n\ndeponent has unique or superior personal knowledge of relevant information).\n\nWatchtower also challenged the proposed scope of the deposition.\n\n                    3. Summary of Parties' Assertions Before Referee\n\n       The Referee scheduled a December 13 hearing to resolve the parties' disputes\n\nregarding (1) the PMQ deposition and document requests; and (2) Lösch's deposition.\n\n\n                                              9\n\fLopez and Watchtower each submitted briefs regarding their respective positions on\n\nthese matters.\n\n       On the PMQ document requests, Lopez argued the pre-abuse, postabuse, and\n\nother-perpetrator evidence was relevant to several issues in the case, including notice,\n\nratification, and punitive damages. Lopez also argued the trial court had rejected many of\n\nWatchtower's objections in ruling on the prior discovery and summary judgment motions,\n\nand the same legal principles apply to the current document requests, including those\n\nseeking postabuse and other-perpetrator information. On Watchtower's penitential-\n\ncommunications privilege claim, Lopez argued that (as the trial court had previously\n\nfound) this privilege did not apply to documents containing statements made with\n\nknowledge that the statements would be disclosed to third parties. Regarding\n\nWatchtower's privacy claim, Lopez proposed that the Referee allow redaction of third-\n\nparty names and identifying information.\n\n       On the Lösch deposition, Lopez asserted that Lösch is currently the longest\n\nserving member on the Governing Body, and has information relevant to the formulation\n\nand implementation of the organization's policy on childhood sexual abuse matters, as\n\nwell as specific matters concerning sexual abuse by Campos. In support, Lopez\n\nsubmitted the deposition testimony (taken in another case) of Allen Shuster, a Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses elder who has served in the Watchtower organization since 1981. Shuster\n\ntestified the Governing Body \"is a committee that oversees the worldwide activity of\n\nJehovah's Witnesses,\" and is responsible for approving policies and guidelines governing\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fthe religion and the religious organization, including those contained in Watchtower\n\ndocuments known as Body of Elder letters pertaining to child sexual abuse matters.\n\n       In opposing the PMQ requested documents, Watchtower argued the requests were\n\noverbroad and sought irrelevant information, and asked the Referee to limit the discovery\n\nto a reasonable time surrounding the date of the alleged abuse (1986) and to preclude all\n\ndiscovery involving perpetrators other than Campos. Watchtower also argued the\n\nrequests seek information protected by attorney-client privileges, the First Amendment,\n\nand the penitential-communication privilege. Although Watchtower challenged the broad\n\nscope of the requests, Watchtower did not specifically argue (or present any evidence\n\nshowing) that responding to the requests would be administratively burdensome.\n\n       Regarding Lösch, Watchtower withdrew its apex-doctrine objection, but argued\n\nthe deposition notice was void on its face because Lösch is not an \" 'officer, director,\n\nmanaging agent or employee' \" of Watchtower and thus a deposition subpoena was\n\nrequired under section 2025.280, subdivision (b). In support Watchtower proffered the\n\ndeclaration of its employee Danny Bland, who stated that based on his search of\n\nWatchtower records, \"Losch [has] never . . . been an officer, director, managing agent or\n\nemployee of Watchtower.\" Watchtower also asserted that a California deposition\n\nsubpoena would be ineffective to compel Lösch's deposition because he is a New York\n\nresident. Watchtower additionally argued that any information regarding the structure,\n\ncomposition, and activities of the Governing Body is irrelevant because the Governing\n\nBody is a separate entity from Watchtower.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                4. Referee Recommendation\n\n       The Referee held a hearing on December 13, 2013, at which both counsel had an\n\nextensive opportunity to present their arguments. Several days after the hearing,\n\nWatchtower requested permission to submit additional information regarding the\n\nJehovah's Witnesses' organizational structure, and the role of the Governing Body within\n\nthis structure, including that Lösch's role is solely one of a spiritual leader (\"akin to the\n\nDalai Lama\") and not \"a corporate managing agent.\" The Referee denied the motion,\n\nconcluding the issues had been fully briefed.\n\n       Shortly after, on December 20, the Referee issued a written order (Referee\n\nRecommendation) concluding that Lopez should be permitted to depose Lösch in New\n\nYork as a \"managing agent\" and that Watchtower produce the documents requested in the\n\nPMQ deposition notice (including Request Nos. 5 and 12).\n\n       Regarding Lösch, the Referee stated: \"The deposition testimony of Mr. Shuster\n\nestablishes that the Governing Body . . . is the principal overseer of the church's\n\nactivities. Mr. Losch is the longest serving member of the Governing Body and may well\n\npossess knowledge pertinent to this litigation.\" The Referee also noted: \"According to\n\ndeposition testimony given by Shuster . . . , the Governing Body approves operational\n\nguidelines for the United States branch of the Jehovah's Witness[es] Organization,\n\nincluding directives for investigating and reporting of alleged childhood sexual abuse\n\nwithin the church.\" The Referee said that \"[d]espite Mr. Bland's declaration, the referee\n\nbelieves that Mr. Losch's position as a member of the Governing Body and its functions\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fas described by Mr. Shuster, make Mr. Losch a managing agent\" under section 2025.280,\n\nsubdivision (a).\n\n       On the document requests, the Referee rejected each of Watchtower's objections,\n\nincluding its blanket privilege and overbreadth claims. The Referee stated: \"It is [my]\n\nrecommendation that the deposition of the PMQ be allowed to go forward on the topics\n\nenumerated, and that the PMQ be required to produce the documents in question which I\n\nbelieve are relevant to the subject matter of the lawsuit in many areas, including\n\nsubsequent ratification by the church, if any.\"\n\n       The Referee qualified its ruling in two ways. First, the Referee stated that to\n\nprotect the \"privacy rights of third parties, defendants may produce documents wherein\n\nthe names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and social security numbers\n\nof third-parties have been redacted.\" Second, the Referee stated, \"in that the court has\n\npreviously reviewed in camera and withheld some documents pursuant to Evidence Code\n\n§§ 1033 and 1034, the referee recommends that defendant prepare a privilege log and\n\nprovide for in camera review by me those documents which may fall within the minister-\n\ncommunicant and/or attorney/client or work produc[t] privileges.\"\n\n                    5. Parties' Responses to Referee Recommendation\n\n       One week later, on December 26, Lopez filed an ex parte application requesting\n\nthe court to compel Watchtower's compliance with the Referee's Recommendation.\n\n       The next day, Watchtower filed objections to the Referee's Recommendation\n\nunder section 644, subdivision (b). With respect to Lösch, Watchtower argued the\n\nReferee misunderstood Shuster's testimony and that the Governing Body is purely a\n\n\n                                             13\n\freligious committee that provides guidance on religious practice. Watchtower also\n\nargued there was no evidence showing Lösch was an officer, director, or managing agent\n\nof Watchtower and thus the court lacked authority to compel Watchtower to produce\n\nLösch for his deposition. In support of these arguments, Watchtower proffered Shuster's\n\nnew declaration, stating: \"[T]he Governing Body . . . is not a committee that operates\n\nwithin the corporate structure of Watchtower . . . and it does not make corporate policy or\n\ndecisions for Watchtower . . . . Rather, the Governing Body is a religious body that\n\nprovides spiritual guidance to Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.\"\n\n       On the document production, Watchtower argued the Referee erred by failing to\n\nrule on each objection, and instead improperly \"lump[ed]\" the requests into a single\n\ncategory. Watchtower also urged the court to reject the Referee's findings because the\n\nrequests were overbroad as to time and the order would impose an \"enormous\"\n\nadministrative burden. In support of the burden argument, it produced three new\n\ndeclarations, none of which were before the Referee.\n\n       First, Watchtower produced the declaration and supplemental declaration of\n\nRichard Ashe, Jr., the person designated as Watchtower's PMQ, who has been an elder\n\nsince 1982 and has worked in Watchtower departments (the United States branch offices\n\nand the Service Department) since 1999. Ashe stated in part:\n\n          \"All of the confidential letters from bodies of elders written to\n          Service Department elders at Watchtower in response to the March\n          14, 1997, letter are filed and maintained in the individual\n          confidential congregation Service Department files for nearly 14,000\n          congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f          \"Most of these 14,000 congregation Service Department files do not\n          have any documents related to child sexual abuse. . . .\"\n\n          \"The typical congregation . . . file has hundreds of pages, most of\n          which are unrelated to the issue of child abuse or child molesters.\n          [¶] . . . [¶] In order to review the documents in these confidential\n          files it would be necessary for a Service Department elder to\n          physically go through each of the nearly 14,000 congregation\n          Service Department files to determine if among the hundreds of\n          pages of documents in each file there happened to be any\n          correspondence related to the March 14, 1997, letter to all bodies of\n          elders or the issue of child abuse.\"\n\n          \"Only a handful of elders at [Watchtower's national office] are\n          qualified and capable of going through these confidential\n          congregation files. At a minimum, it would take an average of three\n          to four hours to go through each of the nearly 14,000 files. That\n          would mean that it would take one . . . elder approximately 56,000\n          hours which works out to be 7,000 days (19.17 years), assuming he\n          searched for the requested documents for . . . 8 hours per day. The\n          number of days could be reduced to 2,334 days (6.39 years) if\n          three . . . elders were assigned this task. Assuming the . . . elders\n          who first reviewed the files were to be paid New York's current\n          minimum wage of $8.00 per hour, the reasonable value of their time\n          would be $448,000.\"\n\n          \"Given the spiritual responsibilities and workloads of the elders in\n          the U.S. Service Department it would not be possible to accomplish\n          these file reviews without stopping all of their other current tasks\n          and responsibilities. This would cripple or severely hamper the\n          operation of [Watchtower's service department] and be a spiritual\n          detriment to the congregations that its elders serve.\"\n\n      Watchtower also produced the declaration of its general counsel, Philip Brumley,\n\nwho stated the Referee's order would require Watchtower attorneys to review 13,777 files\n\nand \"to turn over files\" containing privileged attorney-client communications and work-\n\nproduct information, and would subject Watchtower attorneys to ethics violations and\n\nmalpractice claims. Brumley stated the preparation of privilege logs would take\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\f\"thousands of hours\" and prevent the legal department from providing needed legal\n\nadvice to elders.\n\n       Watchtower also asked the court to remand the matter back to the Referee because\n\nthe \"hearing . . . addressed only the scope of the [permitted] testimony\" and \"did not\n\ninclude or address the objections that had been made to the document production.\"\n\nWatchtower claimed the Referee did not consider its numerous objections, based on\n\n\"privilege, rights of privacy of third persons, attorney work product doctrine, and the\n\nundue burden that the search, assembly and redacting of these documents would cause\n\nupon Watchtower.\"\n\n       In response to Watchtower's objections, Lopez argued Watchtower was not\n\nentitled to challenge the Referee's determinations because the parties had agreed to\n\nsubmit the issues to the Referee. (See § 644, subd. (a).) Lopez alternatively opposed\n\nWatchtower's arguments on their merits, and stated the Referee had expressly considered\n\nand rejected each of Watchtower's objections to the discovery. On Lösch's deposition,\n\nLopez argued the Referee properly found Lösch was a party-affiliated witness (\"a\n\nmanaging agent\") and thus Lösch's deposition notice served on Watchtower was\n\nsufficient to compel his attendance. Lopez maintained that the Referee was entitled to\n\nrely on Shuster's deposition testimony and to reject Watchtower's contrary evidence.\n\n       On the document requests, Lopez objected to Watchtower raising the new\n\nadministrative-burden argument, but also urged the court to reject this new claim based\n\non evidence showing Watchtower specifically directed congregation elders to send\n\nreports about any person in an appointed position \"known to have been guilty of child\n\n\n                                            16\n\fmolestation,\" and instructed elders to place the reports in \" 'Special Blue' envelopes\" and\n\nthat the reports \"should be marked 'Do Not Destroy' and be kept indefinitely.\" Lopez\n\nargued that given these documentation requirements, it was not reasonable to conclude\n\nWatchtower would need to search through each individual congregation file to locate the\n\nresponsive documents.\n\n          C. January 2 Hearing and Order Affirming Referee Recommendation\n\n       At the January 2 hearing, the court initially expressed concern with the scope of\n\nthe issues before it at an ex parte hearing and indicated it had not yet reviewed the\n\nReferee Recommendation or Watchtower's objections. However, as explained in more\n\ndetail below, the court then permitted the parties to argue their points at length (including\n\nthe relevance of the evidence and administrative burden issue), asked questions, and\n\nreviewed the submitted paperwork.\n\n       At the conclusion of the arguments, the court requested Watchtower's counsel to\n\ngive a reasonable time estimate to locate the responsive documents, stating defense\n\ncounsel's claim it would take \"nine and a half years . . . seems ludicrous.\" Watchtower's\n\ncounsel said the \"calculations worked out to be 19.7 years with one person working seven\n\ndays a week, eight hours a day, and flying all over the countryside. And then you use\n\nthree people, and we can knock it down just shy of seven years. . . .\"\n\n       After additional discussion, the court stated it was adopting the Referee\n\nRecommendation, and would continue the trial date 120 days to June 27. The court said,\n\n\"I don't want to have anybody coming back in to tell me they couldn't find the\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fdocuments.\" In its written order (the January 2 order), the court stated it had reviewed\n\nthe Referee Recommendation \"and makes it an order of the Court.\"\n\n                            D. Motions After January 2 Order\n\n       One month later, on February 4, Watchtower moved to stay the court's January 2\n\norder, stating it intended to file a writ petition with the Court of Appeal. The court\n\ndenied the motion, finding a stay was not warranted unless it was imposed by a higher\n\ncourt. At the end of the hearing, the court rejected Watchtower's suggestions it had not\n\nadequately reviewed Watchtower's prior objections, stating \"[the court] looked at the\n\nobjections on the date that you came in. You were here last [on the calendar]. And I\n\nwent ahead and signed an order adopting [the Referee Recommendation].\" The court\n\nalso ordered counsel to \"get that deposition on calendar forthwith.\" When Watchtower\n\ncounsel responded that the document production was asking for the \"Impossible,\" the\n\ncourt replied: \"I understand that it's going to be quite an endeavor, but it also has been a\n\nvery long time that this has been in the making. And one of the things I recall talking\n\nabout the last time was that 90 days had already passed at the request of the documents,\n\nand we're looking at several more months, and it was represented to me that nothing had\n\nbeen done to even start the process. [¶] So I can't tell you how long it's going to take, but\n\nit should have at least been attempted, and it wasn't the last time I made the order.\"\n\n(Italics added.)\n\n       The next month, in March 2014, Lopez's counsel moved for an order scheduling\n\nthe depositions and ordering the documents to be produced, noting that Watchtower was\n\nrefusing to cooperate with the court orders. At the hearing, Watchtower's counsel said\n\n\n                                             18\n\fLösch's own counsel was present and \"we have no ability to compel Mr. Losch to attend\n\n[his deposition]. That's the reality of our situation.\" The court stated it had previously\n\ndetermined (at the January 2 hearing) that Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing agent\"\n\nand declined to rule on a motion to quash the deposition filed by Lösch's personal\n\ncounsel.\n\n       The court and counsel then engaged in a lengthy colloquy pertaining to the\n\ndocuments ordered to be produced. During this discussion, Watchtower's counsel\n\nrestated his strong objections to the order, repeating his position that the order requires\n\nWatchtower to search through 14,000 congregation files and that Watchtower was unable\n\nto do so. The court said it had made clear Watchtower should begin locating responsive\n\ndocuments and asked whether this process had commenced, but Watchtower's counsel\n\nwas unable to identify a single person working on the document production. Lopez's\n\ncounsel responded that he had \"grave concern[s]\" about going ahead with the PMQ\n\ndeposition without any assurance the documents would be produced. He argued, \"this\n\nwhole idea that they cannot produce these documents is disingenuous at best . . . ,\" noting\n\nthat Watchtower requests sexual abuse information from local congregations and\n\n\"keep[s] track\" of these individuals, and therefore it is not credible to conclude \"they just\n\nshove [these documents] away somewhere . . . [and] don't have a database . . . .\"\n\nWatchtower's counsel replied: \"[T]here's just a certain unfairness about what the court\n\nhas ordered my client to do. It is a religion with almost 14,000 congregations nationwide.\n\nThis request asks them to produce documents that were transmitted and filed manually\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\finto these 14,000 files involving these congregations. We explained in detail the manual\n\nsearch that would have to take place.\"\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the court asked whether Watchtower intended to\n\nappear at the New York deposition with documents, and Watchtower's counsel said he\n\nbelieved the court abused its discretion in compelling Watchtower to produce these\n\ndocuments. The court responded there was nothing it could do at this point, \"[b]ut if you\n\nshow up for a deposition and documents aren't produced, and they were inappropriately\n\nnot produced, I'll be looking at other motions.\"\n\n       After the hearing, the court issued an order setting the dates for the New York\n\ndepositions of Watchtower's PMQ and stating \"[t]he topics of the testimony are those\n\npreviously noticed by Plaintiff\" and \"[a]t or before the commencement of the deposition,\n\nWatchtower must produce all documents requested by Plaintiff . . . .\" The court also\n\nordered Lösch's deposition to be taken on specific dates at a New York location to be\n\nmutually agreed by the parties.\n\n       Two weeks later, Watchtower and Lösch each filed a petition for a writ of\n\nmandate challenging the court's January 2 order. Several days later, on March 27, 2014,\n\nthis court summarily denied both petitions, and the California Supreme Court later denied\n\nsimilar petitions.\n\n       The next week, on March 31 and April 1, Watchtower's PMQ (Ashe and\n\nWatchtower attorney Mario Moreno) appeared and testified at their New York\n\ndepositions, but did not produce the documents at issue here. During his deposition,\n\nAshe testified about Watchtower prior publications that discuss the problem of child\n\n\n                                            20\n\fabuse and the significant long-term emotional and psychological damage to victims, and\n\nthe requirement that any known abuse be reported to Watchtower. Ashe also testified\n\nthat all Jehovah's Witnesses congregation files have been fully scanned into a computer\n\nsystem, including child abuse reports that are \"marked do not destroy\" and \"stay[ ]\n\nindefinitely in [the] congregation file.\" He said there are 36 elders in Watchtower's\n\nService Department available to search the files, but their primary job is to give spiritual\n\nguidance to congregation members and elders. Ashe said compliance with the January 2\n\norder \"would effectively shut down their duties in the Service Department for a\n\nconsiderable length of the time.\" When asked why these documents could not be located\n\nby an electronic search method, Ashe testified in part:\n\n          \"[The electronic system] was never designed for the 3,000,000\n          documents that we scanned into it at its managing force. So to put in\n          the words, technical terms used by computer support, sometimes it's\n          loopy. It's not reliable all the time but to try and type in a search\n          parameter, we examine this. How can we do this to be in\n          compliance. There is no easy way to do that. You have to search\n          every congregation file electronically to try and do that. And the\n          search parameters, for example if you type in child abuse, you're\n          going to get every document that has the word child in it and every\n          document that has the word abuse in it.\"\n\nAshe also said that when the computer identifies a responsive document, there is usually\n\na brief delay (\"a second delay\") as the document uploads, and the document then would\n\nhave to be reviewed for attorney/client privilege and therefore \"It gets very complicated.\"\n\nHe opined that \"technically\" Watchtower could not comply with the January 2 order\n\nusing the electronic search method, and that \"It would take years to get that information\n\nput together.\" Ashe also said \"there are no [remaining] physical file[s]. Once they were\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fscanned[,] all those documents were destroyed.\" When asked why Jehovah's Witnesses\n\ncould not devise a search for the phrase \" 'do not destroy,' \" Ashe responded that you \"can\n\ntry to do\" this search, \"but you'll come up with child abuse, you'll come up with adultery,\n\nyou'll come up with bigamist marriage, you'll come up with slander, fraud, murder any\n\nabhorrent sin.\"\n\n       Lösch did not appear for his scheduled deposition.\n\n                   E. Motion for Monetary and Terminating Sanctions\n\n       One week after the depositions, on April 8, Lopez moved for terminating and\n\nmonetary sanctions for Watchtower's failure to comply with the court's orders to produce\n\nthe documents at the PMQ deposition and to produce Lösch for deposition. Regarding\n\nthe PMQ deposition, Lopez's counsel stated that the deponents (Ashe and Moreno) did\n\nnot produce documents responsive to Lopez's document request numbers 5 and 12.5\n\nLopez's counsel also discussed the recent PMQ depositions, and noted that Ashe\n\n\"testified that all of the historical records regarding child abuse that were [requested] by\n\nPlaintiff and ordered produced have been scanned into a computer system, and that the\n\ntext of those scanned documents is searchable,\" but that Watchtower had made no efforts\n\nto \"create[ ] a team to search for them. . . .\" Lopez additionally discussed Watchtower's\n\nassertion of various meritless objections to earlier discovery. Lopez requested monetary\n\nsanctions of $37,799.21, primarily for his counsel's costs in attending Lösch's New York\n\ndeposition and making a record of his nonappearance.\n\n5      Although counsel's declaration identified \"request for production numbers 4 and\n12,\" based on other portions of Lopez's moving papers, it appears that counsel intended to\nidentify request numbers 5 and 12.\n\n                                             22\n\f       In opposition, Watchtower reasserted its challenges to the discovery orders and\n\nalternatively argued there were insufficient grounds for terminating sanctions.\n\nWatchtower argued terminating sanctions were not appropriate because there was no\n\nevidence it destroyed or concealed documents, and instead it \"simply cannot identify all\n\nthe documents requested and produce the unprivileged documents with a privilege log in\n\nthe limited time set by this court . . . .\" Watchtower also argued it had no ability to\n\ncompel Lösch's attendance and thus should not be sanctioned for his nonappearance.\n\nWatchtower additionally asserted that a terminating sanction would be an improper\n\ndrastic remedy because Lopez would be unable to prove his claims and therefore a\n\nterminating order would place him in a better position than if defendants had complied\n\nwith the court's orders. Watchtower also challenged the monetary sanctions request\n\nrelated to Lösch's deposition notice.\n\n       In reply, Lopez produced a declaration of a computer expert (Rafiq Wayani), who\n\nwas consulted after Lopez's counsel learned of the scanned files on Watchtower's\n\ncomputer system. Wayani opined there were methods to extract the relevant data, and\n\nthat this extraction \"could take as little as two days to as long as two months,\" depending\n\non the particular system.\n\n                                F. Court's Sanctions Order\n\n       After conducting a hearing and considering the papers, the court granted Lopez's\n\nsanctions motion, stating that at the January 2 hearing, it \"considered the\n\nrecommendations of the discovery referee, as well as Watchtower's objections thereto,\n\nand adopted the recommendations as the order of the court,\" and Watchtower had\n\n\n                                             23\n\fwillfully and repeatedly refused to comply with the court's order. In its written statement\n\nof decision, the court summarized its reasoning as follows:\n\n          \"The only facts prerequisite to imposition of a discovery sanction are\n          the party's failure to comply with ordered discovery, and the failure\n          was willful. . . . This Court finds that [Watchtower] failed to comply\n          with this court's orders requiring [it] to produce Mr. Losch for\n          deposition, and to produce the documents requested by Plaintiff in\n          connection with the PMQ Notice. This Court further finds that\n          Watchtower's refusal to comply with this Court's orders was\n          willful. . . .\n\n          \"In opposing the motion, Watchtower made various arguments\n          including that Mr. Losch was not Watchtower's managing agent. . . .\n          [T]his Court has found to the contrary and has ordered his deposition\n          to proceed.\n\n          \"[Watchtower] also contends that it was not required to comply with\n          this Court's orders because it is exercising its appellate rights to\n          challenge the validity of the underlying court orders . . . . The Court\n          agrees that Watchtower is within its rights to seek appellate review.\n          However, in the absence of a stay . . . , compliance . . . is required\n          notwithstanding any pending writ petition or petition for review. . . .\n\n          \"At the hearing of this motion, Watchtower devoted substantial time\n          expressing its disagreement with the underlying orders of this Court\n          requiring the deposition of Mr. Losch, and the production of\n          documents relating to childhood sexual abuse complaints. However,\n          the validity of these orders is not at issue in the present motion. The\n          issue raised by Plaintiff's motion involve Watchtower's non-\n          compliance with this Court's orders. This Court's discovery orders\n          are valid and remain in effect, and whether [Watchtower] agrees\n          with the orders is inconsequential. Watchtower was ordered to\n          provide discovery and did not do so.\n\n          \"In its sur-reply, [Watchtower]—citing to [Ashe's] declaration—\n          states that to produce the documents sought would be so time-\n          consuming as to take years to search the relevant records. However,\n          the Court was unable to locate any evidence that Watchtower had at\n          anytime since the Court first ordered production months ago has\n          even attempted to locate responsive documents. Even at the hearing\n          of this motion, Watchtower did not provide any assurances that the\n\n\n                                            24\n\f          documents were in the process of being gathered, or that any effort\n          had been made to comply with this Court's orders.\n\n          [¶] . . . [¶]\n\n          \"The Court considered ordering the imposition of either issue\n          sanctions or evidence sanctions in lieu of the terminating sanctions\n          requested by Plaintiff. However, Plaintiff has made a showing that\n          the materials requested are relevant to nearly [every] aspect of\n          Plaintiff's claim[s], including his negligence based causes of action,\n          ratification based cause of action, and his prayer for punitive\n          damages, as well as to Defendants' claimed statute of limitations\n          defenses. Given Watchtower's willful refusal to comply with\n          multiple orders of this Court, and the fact that Watchtower produced\n          no evidence of any attempt to comply with this Court's orders, this\n          Court finds that only terminating sanctions can effectively respond\n          to Watchtower's willful refusals.\n\n          \"The Court additionally grants Plaintiff's request for monetary\n          sanctions in the amount of $37,799.21 for the reasons argued in\n          Plaintiff's papers, including the expenses associated with traveling to\n          New York relative to the scheduled Losch deposition.\"6\n\nBased on the terminating sanction order, the court entered Watchtower's default and\n\nscheduled a default prove-up hearing.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                          I. Validity of January 2 Discovery Order\n\n       As its primary challenge to the terminating sanction and entry of default,\n\nWatchtower contends the January 2 order is invalid and therefore its violations of the\n\n6       We reject Watchtower's argument that we must disregard this written statement\nbecause it came after the court's oral ruling and/or because it did not comply with\nCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 3.1590. As Watchtower admits, rule 3.1590 \"do[es] not\napply to law and motion matters such as this one.\" Additionally, Watchtower does not\ncite, nor are we aware of, any authority prohibiting a court from explaining the grounds\nfor an oral ruling after the ruling is made. A court may explain its ruling in writing, and\nthe fact Lopez's counsel prepared a draft of the order is immaterial given the court's\nsignature on the order.\n\n                                             25\n\forder cannot be the basis for a discovery sanction. Watchtower contends the court erred\n\nin ordering the Lösch deposition and the PMQ document production. Watchtower also\n\ncontends the January 2 order is void because the court did not independently consider\n\nWatchtower's objections to the Referee Recommendation.\n\n       As explained below, we conclude the court properly considered Watchtower's\n\nchallenges to the Referee Recommendation and did not abuse its discretion in ordering\n\nthe PMQ documents to be produced. But we determine the court order requiring\n\nWatchtower to produce Lösch for a deposition was invalid because the record does not\n\ncontain sufficient evidence showing Lösch was Watchtower's \"officer, director, managing\n\nagent, or employee.\" (§ 2025.280, subds. (a), (b).)\n\n       A. Court Independently Reviewed Objections to Referee Recommendation\n\n       Watchtower initially contends the January 2 order is invalid because the court did\n\nnot comply with its statutory obligation to independently consider its objections to the\n\nReferee Recommendation. (§§ 643, 644.) The record does not support this argument.\n\n       A court may direct a special reference to a discovery referee to resolve the parties'\n\ndiscovery disputes. (§ 639.) If the trial court orders the reference without the parties'\n\nconsent, \"[t]he referee's factual findings are advisory recommendations only; they are not\n\nbinding unless the trial court adopts them.\" (In re Marriage of Petropoulos (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(See § 644, subd. (b);\n\nMarathon, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1261.) In its review, the court should give the\n\nreferee's findings \" 'great weight' \" and focus on the parties' objections to those findings.\n\n(Petropoulos, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 176.) We examine the trial court's decision to\n\naccept the referee's recommendation for an abuse of discretion. (See Sauer v. Superior\n\nCourt (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226.)\n\n       The court held a hearing on the Referee Recommendation. At the outset, the court\n\nacknowledged its independent obligation to consider and rule on Watchtower's objections\n\nto the Referee's conclusions. The court initially expressed concern about the ex parte\n\nnature of the hearing, but after recognizing the approaching trial date and that the parties\n\nhad fully briefed the issues, the court moved the hearing to the end of the calendar and\n\nthen provided the parties a full opportunity to argue their respective positions. Although\n\nit appears the court did not read the Referee Recommendation or Watchtower's\n\nopposition memorandum before the hearing, the record affirmatively supports that during\n\nthe hearing the court reviewed these documents, considered the newly submitted\n\ndeclarations, and carefully listened to Watchtower's counsel's oral explanation of the\n\nobjections.\n\n       Watchtower contends it was not possible for the court to read \"195 pages of\n\nwritten objections\" during the hearing. The 195-page number is misleading.\n\nWatchtower's substantive objections to the Referee Recommendation were contained in\n\n\n                                              27\n\fless than eight pages. The remaining pages included Lopez's affirmative discovery\n\nrequests, Watchtower's initial objections to the document requests (spanning about 55\n\npages of substantially identical, boilerplate objections), and the parties' briefs submitted\n\nto the Referee. At the time of the hearing, the court was highly familiar with the issues\n\nand the parties. It had presided over the case for almost two years, had ruled on similar\n\nobjections to earlier discovery requests, and had denied two summary judgment motions.\n\nWe are satisfied the trial judge had the ability to, and did, review the objections and other\n\nrelevant submissions during the hearing.\n\n       At the subsequent hearings in February, March and May 2014, the court stated it\n\nrecalled reviewing and considering Watchtower's objections and that it had independently\n\nfound them to be without merit. Absent a contrary indication on the record, we are\n\nrequired to accept the court's statements and presume the court complied with its\n\nstatutory duties. (See People v. Risenhoover (1968) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1312693\"><a href=\"/opinion/1312693/people-v-risenhoover/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56-57 [presumption\n\nthe trial court does what it is supposed to do and reversal is inappropriate unless the\n\nrecord affirmatively shows the trial court misconstrued its powers].)\n\n       Watchtower's reliance on Rockwell International Corp. v.

The Rockwell court found \"the trial court abdicated\n\nits judicial responsibility by simply entering an order on the referee's report as though it\n\nwere a binding decision of the court itself.\" (Id. at p. 1270.) Here, the court made clear\n\nthat it understood the report was not binding, and that it was required to consider\n\nWatchtower's objections. Additionally, to the extent the Rockwell court suggested that in\n\nevery case a trial court must consider the transcript of the referee hearing and the parties'\n\n\n                                             28\n\finitial objections to the discovery, we disagree with this blanket rule. The statute requires\n\nonly that the trial court independently consider the referee's findings and any objections\n\nand responses to these findings. (§ 644, subd. (b).) Although a court's review of the\n\nreferee hearing transcript and/or the initial discovery objections may be helpful under\n\ncertain circumstances, the rules do not mandate this in every case.\n\n       Having concluded the court complied with its statutory duties, we now turn to\n\nLopez's contentions that the court abused its discretion in adopting the Referee's\n\nconclusions regarding the PMQ document requests and Lösch's deposition.\n\n                                 B. Document Production\n\n       Watchtower contends the court erred in ordering the PMQ requested documents\n\nproduced because: (1) the document requests did not seek relevant information and were\n\n\"overly broad\"; (2) the requests imposed an undue burden; (3) the order required the\n\nproduction of documents protected by the attorney-client and penitential-communication\n\nprivileges; (4) the order violated third-party privacy rights; and (5) the order violated\n\nWatchtower's First Amendment rights. For the reasons explained below, we find each of\n\nthese arguments to be without merit.\n\n                           1. Relevance/Overbreadth Arguments\n\n       California law provides parties with expansive discovery rights. Section 2017.010\n\nstates: \"[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is\n\nrelevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of\n\nany motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or\n\nappears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\" (Italics\n\n\n                                             29\n\fadded; see Garamendi v.

(See Federico v. Superior Court (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243921\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243921/federico-v-superior-court-of-sacramento-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

For each claim, Lopez will also be required to prove the alleged\n\n\n                                               30\n\fsexual abuse occurred, causation, and compensatory damages. (See Evan F., supra, at p.\n\n834.) Lopez sought punitive damages, which requires a showing of fraud, oppression, or\n\nmalice. (Civ. Code, § 3294.)\n\n       Lopez's requests at issue on appeal identified documents concerning reports of\n\nchild sexual abuse by members of the Jehovah's Witnesses from 1979 to the present, and\n\ndocuments prepared in response to a 1997 letter asking for information about known\n\nchild abusers in Jehovah's Witnesses congregations. Watchtower argues the postabuse\n\n(post-1986) documents are not relevant to his claims because \"they will not demonstrate\n\nwhat Watchtower knew before Lopez was abused (notice), what Watchtower did with\n\ninformation about Campos (negligence), or what an officer, director or managing agent of\n\nWatchtower did to express approval or censure Campos's conduct (ratification).\"\n\n       Watchtower is viewing Lopez's discovery rights too narrowly. Although the\n\ndocuments may not contain information specific to Watchtower's preincident knowledge\n\nof Campos's dangerousness or its alleged ratification of Campos's conduct, the court had\n\na valid basis to find the documents were relevant or potentially relevant to other matters\n\nat issue in the case.\n\n       First, the postincident documents were potentially relevant to Lopez's punitive\n\ndamages claim, including the reprehensibility of Watchtower's actions. \"The degree of\n\nreprehensibility of the defendant's conduct is the most important indicator of the\n\nreasonableness of a punitive damage award\" (Izell v. Union Carbide Corp. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 985), and one relevant factor in this analysis is the extent to which the\n\ndefendant's alleged wrongful conduct involved repeated actions, including conduct\n\n\n                                            31\n\foccurring after the incident in question (see State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.

Although punitive damages may\n\nnot be used to punish a defendant for injury inflicted on third parties, a jury may consider\n\nevidence of harm to others in determining the reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct\n\ntoward the plaintiff. (Philip Morris USA v.

Accordingly, if the postabuse documents contain\n\ninformation that Watchtower continued to engage in similar conduct, this information\n\ncould support Lopez's punitive damages claim (if the case reaches that stage).\n\n       The postabuse evidence may also be relevant on the issue whether Watchtower\n\nacted with the willful and conscious disregard for Lopez's rights. If the documents show\n\nWatchtower's agents continued to commit acts of child abuse and that Watchtower did\n\nnot change its policies and/or took no meaningful protective actions, this evidence may\n\nbe probative on the issue whether Watchtower was deliberately indifferent to Lopez's\n\nrights in 1986. Failure to prevent similar incidents may tend to prove the earlier\n\nacceptance of the abuse and thus willful and conscious disregard of Lopez's rights. (See\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fHenry v.

The postabuse documents may\n\ncontain information showing the nature of Watchtower's actions towards others accused\n\nof child abuse and this evidence could potentially shed light on Watchtower's actions or\n\nnonactions towards Campos and the intent underlying those actions.

The postincident evidence may also be\n\nrelevant to test the validity of Watchtower's defenses regarding its knowledge of child\n\nsexual abuse at the time of the incident and the effectiveness of its claimed steps to\n\nprotect Jehovah's Witnesses children in the 1980's.\n\n       In responding to these asserted relevancy grounds, Watchtower argues \"Campos\n\nwas not a cleric, agent, or employee of Watchtower\" and therefore its postincident actions\n\ntowards other clerics, agents, or employees had no connection to the claims at issue. This\n\nargument lacks merit at this stage of the litigation. The parties have stipulated the\n\ncongregation elders were Watchtower's agents, and Lopez alleged that before the alleged\n\n\n                                             33\n\fmolestation occurred, congregation elders knew Campos had molested another child, yet\n\nrepresented to its members that Campos was a qualified Jehovah's Witnesses Bible\n\ninstructor and was \"very good with children.\" Lopez also alleged the elders knew\n\nCampos had molested multiple children and despite this knowledge later elevated\n\nCampos to the position of elder, an action Watchtower sanctioned. Given these\n\nallegations, Watchtower's assertions that Campos was merely a \"rank-and-file\n\ncongregation member\" who perpetrated the alleged abuse unrelated to the Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses congregation may be a successful defense (if proven), but it is not a basis for\n\nprecluding discovery.\n\n       Moreover, contrary to Watchtower's assertions, the fact that the other molestation\n\nincidents may have been different from the one that allegedly occurred here does not\n\nmean the other-perpetrator evidence was not discoverable. While the trial court will have\n\nto assess whether the information revealed in the documents is admissible (taking into\n\naccount similarity, remoteness, prejudice, etc.), these issues are not dispositive at the\n\ndiscovery stage. A document may be discoverable even if it is unlikely to be admitted at\n\ntrial. (See Davies v.

But on the issues for\n\nwhich the sexual abuse reports may be relevant, the court had a reasonable basis to\n\n\n                                             34\n\fconclude reports prepared long after the incident could contain information helpful to\n\nLopez's case, even if the document's remoteness to the incident may preclude its\n\nadmission at trial. Moreover, Watchtower never proposed any time limits it considered\n\nreasonable. Viewing the totality of the circumstances (including the documents'\n\nconceivable significance on both liability and punitive damage issues, and the court's\n\nrejection of Watchtower's burdensome claims, discussed below), the court's\n\ndetermination was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that a 27-year postincident time period\n\nfor requested documents is unusual. But the breadth of the request is partly a function of\n\nthe permissive limitations statutes governing child sexual abuse, under which Lopez was\n\nseeking to recover for an alleged wrongful act committed almost three decades earlier.7\n\nAbsent this tolling period or an equivalent circumstance, it is unlikely that a similarly\n\ntime-expansive document production would be upheld.\n\n                   2. Claimed Burden of Document Production Request\n\n       Watchtower additionally contends that even if the requested documents were\n\ndiscoverable under the liberal discovery-relevancy standards, the court erred in ordering\n\nit to produce the documents because the burden of responding to the requests was\n\noppressive and substantially outweighed any possible relevance or informational value of\n\nthe evidence. In support, Watchtower argues the evidence was \"uncontroverted\" that \"the\n\n\n\n\n7      Whether the lawsuit was timely and/or whether Lopez's claims are supported by\nthe facts is not before us.\n\n                                             35\n\flabor involved in locating and producing the virtually unlimited records Lopez requested\n\nwill require literally tens of thousands of man hours.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       Assuming Watchtower did not waive the argument by failing to raise it with the\n\nReferee, the court's rejection of this contention was fully supported by the record.\n\nContrary to Watchtower's assertions, the evidence regarding the administrative burden\n\nwas not \"uncontroverted.\" Lopez presented evidence countering Watchtower's claim that\n\ncompliance with the Referee Recommendation would require years of \"manually\"\n\nlooking through its files. This included evidence showing Watchtower directed the elders\n\nto send to Watchtower reports about all known child abuse perpetrators in their respective\n\ncongregations and gave specific instructions on the manner in which this information\n\nshould be reported, including to segregate the reports and place them in \" 'Special Blue'\n\nenvelopes\" that were to be kept indefinitely. From this, the court had a reasonable basis\n\nto conclude the requested documents had been segregated within the congregational files\n\nand thus decline to credit Watchtower's claim it would take \"years\" to locate the\n\nresponsive documents.\n\n       The court's rejection of the burden argument was also supported by Watchtower's\n\nconduct in refusing to take any—however minimal—steps to locate the responsive\n\ndocuments or to offer any suggestions on how to reasonably narrow the request. At every\n\nhearing from January through April 2014, the court repeated its concern that although\n\nthese documents had been first requested in October 2013, Watchtower had not made any\n\neffort to identify any responsive documents. Watchtower's PMQ later admitted it was\n\npossible to quickly locate responsive documents if Watchtower knew the identity of a\n\n\n                                             36\n\fsexual abuse perpetrator. Watchtower acknowledged it was aware of at least seven other\n\nchild sexual abuse perpetrators, but it did nothing to locate documents pertaining to these\n\nindividuals.\n\n       The court's finding was also supported by evidence showing Watchtower had\n\nscanned all documents from congregation files into a computer program that had a search\n\nfunction. Although one elder (Ashe) opined the search function would not accurately\n\nidentify the other-perpetrator child abuse reports, Lopez's expert reached a contrary\n\nconclusion and there is no suggestion Watchtower made any efforts to design a search or\n\nconsult with an individual qualified to conduct a search.\n\n       Calcor Space Facility v.

Calcor involved a document request against\n\na nonparty that contained six pages of highly complex definitions and instructions and\n\ndid not provide reasonable specification of the documents sought. (Id. at pp. 219-221.)\n\nIn reversing an order compelling the documents, Calcor found the documents would have\n\nno evidentiary value in the litigation and urged trial courts to use their authority to\n\nprevent discovery abuse. (Id. at pp. 218-221.)\n\n       This case is different. It involves a request against a party for specifically\n\ndescribed documents that have potential relevance to the subject matter of the lawsuit or\n\nmay lead to the discovery of relevant evidence. Watchtower has superior knowledge\n\nregarding its files and documents, and the evidence showed the documents could be\n\nidentified. We are satisfied the trial court recognized the broad scope of the document\n\nrequests, but reasonably found Lopez's counsel sought the documents in good faith to\n\n\n                                              37\n\fobtain necessary and helpful information to prepare the case. Whether this court would\n\nhave reached the same conclusion as the trial court is not the issue. Instead, it is whether\n\nthe court acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in ordering Watchtower to produce\n\ndocuments responsive to the requests. Under the trial court's expansive authority over\n\ndiscovery issues, we find the court's rulings were reasonable.\n\n                                   3. Claimed Privileges\n\n       Watchtower also contends the order was invalid because it violated attorney-client\n\nand penitential-communication privileges.\n\n       This contention is unavailing because Watchtower misconstrues the scope of the\n\norder. We accept that certain requested documents could contain privileged material\n\nupon which the court would have to rule in due course. But contrary to Watchtower's\n\nassertions, neither the Referee nor the court ordered the production of privileged material.\n\nInstead, the Referee specifically ruled that Watchtower may prepare a privilege log for\n\nlater review. This ruling was incorporated into the court's January 2 order, which\n\nadopted the Referee Recommendation in full. Because responsive documents had not yet\n\nbeen identified, neither the Referee, nor the trial court, was in a position to rule on any\n\nspecific privilege claims.\n\n       Generally, \"the privilege-claimant 'has the initial burden of proving the\n\npreliminary facts to show the privilege applies.' \" (Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los\n\nAngeles v. Superior Court (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442 (Roman Catholic\n\nArchbishop).) Once the claimant establishes the preliminary facts, it is presumed that the\n\nmatter sought to be disclosed was a communication made in confidence in the course of\n\n\n                                              38\n\fthe lawyer-client or clergy-penitent relationship. (Evid. Code, § 917.) At that point, the\n\nburden of proof shifts to the party opposing the privilege claim. (Roman Catholic\n\nArchbishop, supra, at p. 442.)\n\n       Because Watchtower had not yet produced a privilege log or identified any\n\nspecific confidential communications, it had not met its burden to show the preliminary\n\nfacts supporting the application of the privilege. Thus, its privilege claim was premature.\n\nFor example, as the court ruled earlier in this case, to the extent that the reports were\n\nwritten and sent to Watchtower with the expectation they would be read by a third party,\n\nthey do not come within the penitential-communication privilege. (See Roman Catholic\n\nArchbishop, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at pp. 444-445; see also Conti v. Watchtower Bible\n\n& Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229-1230 (Conti).)\n\n       Watchtower argues \"the very categories and broad descriptions of information and\n\ndocuments demanded by Lopez necessarily sought documents protected by the attorney-\n\nclient and clergy-penitent privileges . . . .\" (Italics added.) The record does not support\n\nthis argument. In the challenged document requests, Lopez primarily sought reports\n\nprepared by elders in response to Watchtower's requests for the information. There is no\n\nindication that these reports necessarily arose from an attorney-client or a clergy-penitent\n\ncommunication and/or were prepared in the context of litigation.\n\n       Watchtower's reliance on Conti, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is misplaced.\n\nWatchtower relies on the portion of Conti in which the Court of Appeal declined to\n\nimpose a duty on a clergy member to notify congregation members of a penitential\n\ncommunication (e.g., a church member's private confession to a clergyperson) involving\n\n\n                                              39\n\fsuspected child abuse. (Id. at p. 1230.) We agree with this principle, but it does not help\n\nWatchtower on the issue of whether it met its preliminary burden to show an applicable\n\nprivilege. The Conti court recognized the fundamental importance of the penitential\n\ncommunication privilege, but also found this privilege did not apply to communications\n\nif they were shared with others or made with the expectation they would be disclosed\n\nbeyond the protected relationship. (Id. at pp. 1229-1230.) This principle applies equally\n\nin this case and underscores the need for Watchtower to have provided a privilege log to\n\nsupport any privilege claim.\n\n       In asserting error on the privilege issue, Watchtower focuses on the Referee's\n\nstatement that it would review the claimed privileged documents \"in camera.\"\n\nWatchtower correctly argues that privileged communications are generally not subject to\n\nin camera review. (See Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736-737.) But there are two fundamental flaws with Watchtower's contention for\n\npurposes of our appellate review. First, there is no showing on this record that\n\nWatchtower raised this in camera issue below. Thus, it is waived. (See Cardinal Health\n\n301, Inc. v. Tyco Electronics Corp. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248353\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248353/cardinal-health-301-inc-v-tyco-electronics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155.) More important,\n\nthis contention is unrelated to the court's sanctions order. The court did not sanction\n\nWatchtower because it refused to provide the privileged documents for an in camera\n\nreview. Instead, the court imposed a sanction for Watchtower's willfully violating the\n\ncourt's order to search for, identify, and produce nonprivileged documents (and/or at least\n\nstart this process), and prepare a privilege log for any responsive privileged documents.\n\nIt is undisputed that Watchtower failed to do this. To the extent Watchtower is arguing\n\n\n                                             40\n\fthat it did not make any effort to comply with the court's order because it was concerned\n\nwith the Referee's summary reference to an in camera hearing, we find this argument\n\nunconvincing.\n\n                               4. Third-Party Privacy Rights\n\n       Watchtower contends the court's January 2 order was also invalid because it would\n\nviolate the privacy rights of others, and the court \"failed to adequately take the rights of\n\nthose third parties into consideration . . . .\" The Referee and the trial court rejected these\n\narguments because the order specifically permitted Watchtower to redact names,\n\nbirthdates, and Social Security numbers from the documents.\n\n       Watchtower argues the redaction would not prevent the violation of privacy rights\n\n\"where the circumstances surrounding such reports would nonetheless make them readily\n\nidentifiable to anyone with a modicum of familiarity with those individuals.\" This\n\nargument is unsupported by the record. There were no facts before the Referee or the\n\ntrial court showing the documents would disclose the identities of the individuals after\n\ndeleting personal identifying information. To the extent Watchtower believes that a\n\nparticular document would fall within this category, it had the right to seek some form of\n\nprotection. But the record does not support a blanket objection based on third-party\n\nprivacy rights given the order's express redaction provision.\n\n       We find unavailing Watchtower's additional argument that the documents relating\n\nto other child abuse perpetrators were sought solely to assist Lopez's counsel in soliciting\n\nadditional clients. The Referee and the court rejected this argument, and they had a\n\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\freasonable basis to do so. There is no basis in the appellate record showing the court\n\nabused its discretion in finding the discovery was sought for proper purposes.\n\n                               5. First Amendment Objection\n\n       Watchtower next argues the January 2 order was improper because it violated its\n\nFirst Amendment religious freedom rights. In support, Watchtower contends that issues\n\nof ratification and agency are \"inquiries which necessarily require the court to entangle\n\nitself in the interpretation, evaluation and determination of the religious beliefs and\n\ninternal governance of Jehovah's Witnesses.\" This argument is not a basis for limiting\n\ndiscovery at this stage of the litigation. The court's January 2 order did not reflect the\n\ncourt's ruling that Lopez's ratification or agency theories are legally valid or that the court\n\nor jury will be permitted to engage in factfinding that would interfere with religious\n\ndoctrine.\n\n       In a related argument, Watchtower relies on a line of cases applying the\n\nministerial-privilege doctrine, a constitutionally based rule that exempts religious\n\norganizations from liability arising from employment-related claims by a religious figure.\n\n(See Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v.

The ministerial exception applies to bar an action\n\nby a clergy member against a religious institution. (See Roman Catholic Archbishop,\n\nsupra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 433.) Watchtower has not cited, nor are we aware of, any\n\ndecisions extending this rule to preclude a third party action against a religious\n\norganization for the tortious conduct of its agents. And the law appears to be to the\n\ncontrary. (See Evan F., supra, 8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 841-843 [Methodist pastor molesting\n\nminor]; Stevens v.

Lösch's Deposition\n\n       Watchtower contends the court erred in ordering it to produce Lösch for\n\ndeposition. The court's order was based on the court's adoption of the Referee's finding\n\nthat Lösch is a \"managing agent\" under section 2025.280, subdivision (a), and thus\n\nservice of the notice on Watchtower was sufficient to require Lösch's appearance. On the\n\nfactual record before us, we determine Lopez did not satisfy his minimal burden to\n\npresent evidence showing Lösch fell within the statutory \"managing agent\" category.\n\n(§ 2025.280, subd. (a).) Accordingly, the order compelling Watchtower to produce\n\nLösch was invalid and the court did not have the authority to sanction Watchtower for its\n\nnoncompliance with this order.\n\n                                  1. Statutory Framework\n\n       Generally, a party may require the deposition of a nonparty only if the party serves\n\nthe deponent with a deposition subpoena. (§ 2025.280, subd. (b).) Thus, a deposition\n\nnotice served on the opposing party is inadequate to compel a third party's attendance.\n\n(Ibid.) However, a subpoena is not required if the deponent is \"an officer, director,\n\nmanaging agent, or employee of a party.\" (§ 2025.280, subd. (a).) The discovery statutes\n\nrefer to this deponent as a \"party-affiliated deponent.\" (§ 2025.450, subd. (h).) The\n\nrequisite \"party-affiliated\" relationship must exist at the time of the deposition notice.\n\n(Maldonado v. Superior Court (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273958\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273958/maldonado-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(h), 2025.480, subd. (k); see § 2023.030.) However, if the deponent\n\n\n                                              44\n\fis not a party or a party-affiliated deponent, the court has no authority to impose sanctions\n\non the party for the deponent's disobedience of the order. (See ibid.; § 2025.280, subd.\n\n(b); Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group\n\n2015) ¶ 8:824, p. 8E-144.) By creating this distinction, the Legislature necessarily\n\nrecognized a party should not be sanctioned if it had no legal or practical means to\n\nrequire the nonparty deponent to attend his or her deposition.\n\n                             2. Definition of Managing Agent\n\n       Both parties acknowledge that Lösch was not a party, nor was he an officer,\n\ndirector, or employee of Watchtower. However, Lopez argued Lösch was a party-\n\naffiliated deponent because he was a \"managing agent\" based on his status as a member\n\nof a Jehovah's Witnesses organization known as the \"Governing Body.\" In support,\n\nLopez presented evidence showing the Governing Body issues policy directives\n\napplicable to Watchtower and the local congregations. Although Watchtower argued\n\nbelow (and on appeal) that the Governing Body has solely a spiritual function within the\n\nJehovah's Witnesses religion, Lopez's evidence showed that the Governing Body has\n\nbroader administrative responsibilities, such as issuing policy guidelines regarding child\n\nabuse prevention and reporting in local congregations. The Referee, as a trier of fact, was\n\nentitled to find this evidence credible and reject Watchtower's contrary evidence. On its\n\nindependent review, the court also had a reasonable basis to adopt this factual finding in\n\nits January 2 order.\n\n       But the fact the Governing Body had this policymaking function does not answer\n\nthe question whether Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing agent.\" The California\n\n\n                                             45\n\fSupreme Court has defined a \"managing agent\" for purposes of the discovery statutes as\n\n\"a person who may exercise his judgment and discretion in dealing with corporate\n\nmatters, who can be expected to comply with [the party's] directive to appear for [the\n\nrequested examination], and who can be anticipated to identify himself with the interests\n\nof the corporation.\" (Waters v. Superior Court (1962) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1168730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1168730/waters-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 896 (Waters).)\n\n\"The question whether a particular deponent is a 'managing agent' of one of the parties\n\nfor purposes of pretrial discovery proceedings must of necessity be answered\n\npragmatically\" and is highly dependent on the particular factual circumstances before the\n\ncourt. (Id. at pp. 896-897; see Roehl v. Texas Co. (1930) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3279936\"><a href=\"/opinion/3281579/roehl-v-the-texas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704.) In\n\nanalyzing the issue, California courts look to federal court decisions that apply a similar\n\n\"managing agent\" test. (Waters, at pp. 895-896; see Reed Paper Co. v. Proctor &\n\nGamble Distributing Co. (D.Me. 1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4.) Generally, it is the party\n\nseeking to compel the deposition that has the initial burden to show the foundational facts\n\nto support a \"managing agent\" finding. (See Sugarhill Records, Ltd. v. Motown Record\n\nCorp. (S.D.N.Y. 1985) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170.)\n\n       Before applying the Waters test, we note our agreement with Lopez that a\n\n\"managing agent\" need not be an employee. Given that the terms \"employee,\" \"officer,\"\n\n\"director,\" and \"managing agent\" are each used in the statutory description of a party-\n\naffiliated deponent, and the statute uses these terms in the disjunctive (§ 2025.280, subd.\n\n(a)), we agree that a \"managing agent\" need not also be an employee, officer, or director.\n\nOtherwise, the use of the phrase \"managing agent\" would be surplusage. (See Reno v.\n\nBaird (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1275413\"><a href=\"/opinion/1275413/reno-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 [\" '[c]ourts should give meaning to every word of a\n\n\n                                             46\n\fstatute if possible, and should avoid a construction making any word [or phrase]\n\nsurplusage' \"].) This conclusion is consistent with analysis by federal courts, which have\n\nrecognized that a third party (such as an independent contractor or former officer) may be\n\ndeemed a party's \"managing agent\" upon a factual showing that the deponent currently\n\nserves in that functional role.

We also find Watchtower's reliance on decisions\n\nconstruing the \"managing agent\" phrase within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294,\n\nsubdivision (b) not particularly helpful because the punitive damages and discovery\n\nstatutes have different language, purposes, and objectives.\n\n              3. Insufficient Evidence Showing Lösch Is a Managing Agent\n\n       With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the three Waters factors: (1)\n\ndoes the person exercise judgment and discretion in dealing with the party's matters; (2)\n\ncan the person be expected to comply with the party's directive to appear; and (3) can the\n\nperson be anticipated to identify himself or herself with the party's interests. (Waters,\n\nsupra, 58 Cal.2d at p. 896.)\n\n       Lopez's evidence satisfies the first and third factors. Lopez presented Shuster's\n\ndeposition testimony stating Lösch is a long-standing member of the Governing Body,\n\nwhich approves operational guidelines for the United States Branch of the Jehovah's\n\n\n                                             47\n\fWitnesses organization, including issuing directives for preventing and investigating\n\nchild sexual abuse within the church. Shuster also testified that the Governing Body\n\n\"oversees\" the worldwide activity of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n       Based on this testimony, the court could reasonably infer Lösch (as a Governing\n\nBody member) had the authority to, and did, exercise supervisorial authority and\n\ndiscretionary judgment over Watchtower's operations, including those potentially\n\nrelevant to the issues in this case. Based on this same evidence, the court could have also\n\nreasonably found Lösch would likely identify with Watchtower's interests.\n\n       However, Lopez failed to produce any evidence on the second Waters factor:\n\nwhether the proposed deponent can be expected to comply with the party's directive to\n\nappear. Although there was evidence indicating the Governing Body (and its members)\n\nasserted authority over Watchtower and could influence its conduct, there was no\n\nevidence showing the reverse was true. For example, Lopez proffered no facts to indicate\n\nthat Lösch receives compensation or other tangible benefits from Watchtower or that\n\nGoverning Body members had previously complied with such deposition directives. (See\n\nAfram, supra, 159 F.R.D. at p. 415 [deponent's \"history of cooperating with a party in\n\ndiscovery may be probative of the party's ability to rely on the agent to testify\"].)\n\nLikewise, there was no evidence concerning the Governing Body's status as a separate\n\nlegal entity or as an affiliate of Watchtower. (See Braspetro, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">43607</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5\n\n[fact that deponent is \"completely separate entity from [party], without any contractual\n\nobligation to act on [party's] behalf\" means \"there is no reason to assume that [party] can\n\nassure participation in a deposition for an action to which [deponent] is not a party\"].)\n\n\n                                             48\n\fWithout evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that Watchtower had\n\nsome legal or practical ability to influence Lösch's decision to attend the deposition, there\n\nis no basis to conclude Lösch could be expected to comply with Watchtower's directives\n\nto appear.\n\n       If the deponent is the party's employee, officer, or director, an entity has\n\nsubstantial practical control to compel the attendance of these individuals, including the\n\nability to terminate an employee who refuses to appear at a noticed deposition or to end\n\nthe relationship with its officer or director. (See Twin Lock, Inc. v.

But if the deponent has no formal or legal role within the\n\nparty's organization, there must be some additional factual basis to establish the party has\n\nthe practical ability to require the nonparty's compliance. (See Maldonado, supra, 94\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1398 [holding party was not required to produce a former employee\n\neven if \"the former employees are far more knowledgeable about the litigation than\n\nanyone currently employed by the company\"].)\n\n       Viewing the entire record and applying the required pragmatic analysis, there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support a determination that Lösch was Watchtower's \"managing\n\nagent\" for purposes of compelling his deposition and granting sanctions for his\n\nnonappearance. The discovery statutes must be construed to ensure fairness and that the\n\nends of justice are served. Because a party may be subject to severe sanctions if a party-\n\naffiliate does not attend a deposition, there must be at least some minimal showing that\n\n\n                                             49\n\fthe party has the ability to induce the deponent to attend the scheduled deposition. A\n\ncontrary conclusion would be unjust and inconsistent with the purposes of discovery\n\nprocedures under California law—to avoid surprise, aid in ensuring all parties are in\n\npossession of relevant facts, and assure fairness to all parties.\n\n                                 III. Terminating Sanctions\n\n       Watchtower also contends the court erred in issuing terminating sanctions.\n\nBecause the court ordered the sanctions issued based on both discovery orders, and we\n\nare reversing one of those orders, the matter must be remanded to the trial court. But\n\ngiven that the issues may arise again on remand and for purposes of judicial efficiency,\n\nwe shall rule on Watchtower's contention.\n\n       California discovery law authorizes a range of penalties for a party's refusal to\n\nobey a discovery order, including monetary sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue\n\nsanctions, and terminating sanctions. (§§ 2023.010, 2023.030; Los Defensores, Inc. v.\n\nGomez (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

A court has broad discretion in selecting the\n\nappropriate penalty, and we must uphold the court's determination absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. (Los Defensores, supra, at p. 390.) We defer to the court's credibility\n\ndecisions and draw all reasonable inferences in support of the court's ruling. (Id. at pp.\n\n390-391.)\n\n       Despite this broad discretion, the courts have long recognized that the terminating\n\nsanction is a drastic penalty and should be used sparingly. (See Newland v. Superior\n\nCourt (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2302895\"><a href=\"/opinion/2302895/newland-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

A trial court must be cautious when\n\n\n                                              50\n\fimposing a terminating sanction because the sanction eliminates a party's fundamental\n\nright to a trial, thus implicating due process rights. (See Lyons v. Wickhorst (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1204541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1204541/lyons-v-wickhorst/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 916; Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at pp. 613-614.) The trial court should\n\nselect a sanction that is \" ' \"tailor[ed] . . . to the harm caused by the withheld\n\ndiscovery.\" ' \" (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) \" '[S]anctions \"should be\n\nappropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the\n\ninterests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.\" ' \" (Ibid.)\n\n       The discovery statutes thus \"evince an incremental approach to discovery\n\nsanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of\n\ntermination.\" (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992, italics added.) Although in\n\nextreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure\n\n(see Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co.

In the January 2 written order, the court required Watchtower to\n\nproduce the documents requested in Lopez's PMQ deposition notice, and the court\n\nrepeated this order at several subsequent hearings, including with respect to the postabuse\n\n\n                                               51\n\freports. Watchtower made no effort to comply with the order, and instead continued to\n\nrepeat its previously unsuccessful objections. The court rejected the credibility of\n\nWatchtower's assertions that it would need to physically inspect each congregation file\n\nand that this inspection would take many years to complete. The court instead credited\n\nthe Watchtower PMQ's deposition testimony that all potentially responsive documents\n\nhave been scanned into a computer system and Lopez's expert's opinion that this\n\ncomputer system has a search function that could assist in identifying the requested\n\ndocuments. The court also repeatedly emphasized Watchtower's failure to take any\n\nsteps—however minimal—toward complying with the court's order.\n\n       On this record, the court had the authority to impose sanctions for Watchtower's\n\nwillful disobedience of its order. But, as Lopez admits, the terminating sanctions order\n\nwas the first and only sanction imposed (along with a monetary sanction for the Lösch\n\ndeposition costs). And the court imposed the sanction within four months of its initial\n\ndocument production order.\n\n       The fundamental flaw with the court's approach is that there is no basis in the\n\nrecord showing the court could not have obtained Watchtower's compliance with lesser\n\nsanctions or that another sanction could not effectively remedy the discovery violation.\n\nTo the contrary, the record supports that the court had numerous tools at its disposal to\n\ncompel compliance before imposing the ultimate sanction. For example, the court could\n\nhave imposed a significant monetary penalty for every day Watchtower did not search for\n\nthe documents and/or for each day the responsive documents were not produced.\n\nAlternatively, the court could have imposed evidentiary or issue sanctions to replace the\n\n\n                                            52\n\finformation that would or could be included within those documents. When a party does\n\nnot produce ordered documents, the court is entitled to infer the documents would contain\n\nevidence damaging to that party's case and instruct the jury accordingly. (See Kuhns v.\n\nState of California (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277635\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277635/kuhns-v-state-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 987-990.) Thus, as Watchtower now\n\nproposes \"the trial court could have . . . ordered an issue sanction that would have\n\nprecluded Watchtower from disputing certain aspects of liability at trial.\" Or—if the case\n\nproceeded to the punitive damage stage—the court could have considered instructing the\n\njury that Watchtower refused to produce documents concerning subsequent child sexual\n\nabuse incidents, and from that the jury could infer Watchtower had engaged in a pattern\n\nand practice of ignoring and/or ratifying sexual abuse by its agents.\n\n       Although the court made a conclusory observation in its written order that it had\n\nconsidered imposing issue or evidentiary sanctions, the record does not contain any basis\n\nto find the court had made a meaningful effort to determine whether the alternatives\n\nwould be effective. The court suggested only that a suitable alternate sanction could not\n\nbe devised because the \"materials requested are relevant to nearly [every] aspect of\n\n[Lopez's] claim[s].\"\n\n       This finding is unsupported. Viewing the record at this stage of the litigation, it is\n\nunlikely the responsive information would relate to at least some of the core issues at\n\ntrial, including whether Lopez was in fact a victim of the abuse, whether Castro was\n\nWatchtower's agent, whether Watchtower's statute of limitations defense applied in this\n\ncase, and the existence and extent of Lopez's economic and/or emotional distress\n\ndamages. Watchtower previously complied with the court's order to produce all\n\n\n                                             53\n\funprivileged documents pertaining to Castro and Watchtower's knowledge of his prior or\n\nsubsequent misconduct, and these documents would have contained information on\n\nseveral of these core issues. Given that there were disputed issues unaffected by the\n\ndocument production and the court and parties made no meaningful effort to at least\n\nconsider and discuss possible alternative sanctions, the court's conclusion that there was\n\nno effective alternate sanction is premature and unsupported.\n\n        We conclude the court erred in ordering terminating sanctions because there was\n\nno evidence that lesser sanctions would have failed to obtain Watchtower's compliance\n\nwith the document production order and because there were other possible sanctions that\n\ncould have effectively remedied the discovery violation. On remand, the court has broad\n\ndiscretion to start with a different sanction that does not wholly eliminate Watchtower's\n\nright to a trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n       We order the court to vacate: (1) the portion of the January 2 order requiring\n\nWatchtower to produce Lösch for his deposition; (2) the order granting terminating and\n\nmonetary sanctions; and (3) the entry of default and the default judgment. Each party to\n\nbear its own costs.\n\n\n                                                                    HALLER, Acting P.
