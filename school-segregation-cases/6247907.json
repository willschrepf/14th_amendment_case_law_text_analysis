Motion for\n                    Rehearing denied September 21, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           Page ix\n\f                  STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n     This Court has jurisdiction under Texas Government Code section\n\n22.001(a)   because   the   case   presents    issues   important    to   the\n\njurisprudence of the state, specifically important issues of statutory\n\ninterpretation that impact state revenue.\n\n     Although Gulf Copper can deduct the contested amounts on its\n\nfederal corporate income tax return or its financial statements, not all\n\nlegitimate business expenses are deductible for margin tax purposes. By\n\nrestricting margin tax deductions and thereby expanding the tax base,\n\nthe Legislature was able to reduce the tax rate from 4.5 percent under\n\nthe former earned surplus tax to one percent or less under the margin\n\ntax. See, Act of May 2, 2006, 79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen.\n\nLaws 1, 8 (former Tex. Tax Code § 171.101(a)), current version at Tex.\n\nTax Code § 171.101(a)(1).\n\n     If, however, the balance between the low margin tax rate and the\n\nlimited deductions is disrupted, there could be a significant revenue\n\nimpact to the State of Texas.      Accordingly, this Court should give\n\nserious consideration to the implications of the Opinion below, which\n\n\n                                                                     Page x\n\fallows service providers to take the cost-of-goods-sold deduction when\n\nthey are not selling goods, and further, allows taxpayers to exclude\n\nrevenues from margin merely because they are paying expenses owed\n\nunder a contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 Page xi\n\f                    ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Do the services performed by Gulf Copper or its subsidiary\n     constitute “furnishing labor or materials to a project for the\n     construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial\n     maintenance ... of real property” such that Gulf Copper may\n     deduct under Tax Code section171.1012(i) its costs of:\n     a. Repairing or upgrading drilling rigs at Gulf Copper’s\n        waterfront facilities, before the commencement of offshore\n        drilling; or\n     b. Surveying marine vessels, including drilling rigs at Gulf\n        Copper’s waterfront facilities?\n\n2.   May Gulf Copper exclude from its total revenue, under Tax Code\n     section 171.1011(g)(3), hourly payments made to subcontractors?\n     This question turns on:\n     a. Whether payments were “made under a contract . . . to\n        provide services, labor, or materials in connection with the\n        actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, or repair\n        of improvements on real property,” when the subcontractor\n        payments were for work repairing or upgrading drilling rigs\n        at Gulf Copper’s waterfront facilities, before the\n        commencement of offshore drilling.\n     b. Whether payments Gulf Copper made to subcontractors are\n        “flow-through funds that are mandated by contract to be\n        distributed to other entities,” when Gulf Copper was not\n        required by contract to use customer payments to pay\n        subcontractors.\n\n3.   [Unbriefed] Gulf Copper had the burden of proof on its cost-of-\n     good-sold claim. Where Gulf Copper put on no evidence of\n     allowable costs according with section 171.1012 or controverting\n     the Comptroller’s cost-by-cost analysis—relying instead on an\n     erroneous legal argument—did the court of appeals err in\n     remanding the case for a new trial on Gulf Copper’s cost-of-\n     goods-sold claim?\n\n\n                                                             Page xii\n\f                        STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n    The margin tax dispute.\n\n      The court of appeals correctly stated the nature of the case as a suit\n\n“seeking a refund of franchise taxes that Gulf Copper paid under protest.”\n\nSpecifically, this franchise or “margin” tax case involves a dispute over\n\n(1) the amounts Gulf Copper may deduct as cost of goods sold, and (2) the\n\namounts that it may exclude from its revenues.\n\n    Gulf Copper’s business.\n\n      The trial court made the following findings of fact regarding Gulf\n\nCopper’s business. Gulf Copper is primarily engaged in the business of\n\nsurveying, manufacturing, upgrading, and repairing offshore drilling\n\nrigs. CR. 296-97[App. B] (Finding of Fact 10). 1 Gulf Copper repairs rigs\n                                                 0F\n\n\n\n\nby removing defective portions, manufacturing replacement components,\n\nand installing the replacement components onto the rigs.

Finding of Fact 12.\n\n      Gulf Copper’s customers are primarily rig owners and drilling\n\ncontractors who use their offshore rigs to drill for oil and gas on behalf\n\nof exploration and production (“E&P”) companies. Finding of Fact 9.\n\nGulf Copper’s work enables the rigs (1) to meet and maintain the\n\ncertification requirements by classification societies, (2) to comply\n\nwith governing regulations, and (3) to satisfy an E&P company’s\n\ncontractual requirement for a specific drilling project. Finding of Fact\n\n16.\n\n      Gulf Copper owns all of the outstanding shares of a subsidiary\n\nnamed Sabine Surveyors. Finding of Fact 1.        Sabine Surveyors is a\n\nlimited partnership primarily engaged in the business of marine vessel\n\nsurveying. Finding of Fact 2. For franchise tax report year 2009 (the\n\naccounting period of May 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008), Gulf Copper, Sabine\n\nSurveyors, and others (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Gulf\n\nCopper”) joined in the filing of combined franchise tax report. Finding of\n\nFact 7.\n\n      With regard to the exclusions from revenue, the trial court made\n\n                                                                   Page 2\n\fthese additional findings of fact. Gulf Copper performs its work using\n\nboth employees and subcontractors. Finding of Fact 22. Gulf Copper’s\n\ncustomers often approve or require Gulf Copper’s use of certain\n\nsubcontractors to complete the work... Finding of Fact 23.\n\n     Gulf Copper charges its customers for subcontractor work using a\n\nformula that is based upon Gulf Copper’s actual cost of the\n\nsubcontractor(s) plus a mark-up. Regardless of how the subcontractor is\n\nbilled, Gulf Copper’s resulting mark-up to the customer is generally\n\nbetween 15-20 percent. Finding of Fact 24. When Gulf Copper’s\n\ncustomers pay Gulf Copper for work performed by subcontractors, Gulf\n\nCopper retains the portion of the payment attributable to its mark-up\n\n(generally between 15- 20 percent) and flows through the remainder of\n\nthe customer’s payment to the subcontractor. Finding of Fact 25. The\n\nsubcontractor payments flow from Gulf Copper’s customer, through Gulf\n\nCopper, to Gulf Copper's subcontractors who performed the work for the\n\ncustomer. Finding of Fact 26.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                Page 3\n\f      Finally, it is undisputed that “[t]he drilling rigs are delivered to\n\nGulf Copper’s facility where Gulf Copper performs the work…” Opinion\n\nat * 4.\n\n\nThe Comptroller’s audit.\n\n      The Comptroller audited Gulf Copper and assessed additional\n\nfranchise taxes in the amount of $692,626.66 (plus interest, for a then\n\ncurrent total of $838,117.84). The two major adjustments were to: (1) the\n\ncost-of-goods-sold deduction and; (2) the exclusion from revenue of\n\nsubcontractor payments.\n\n\n      The Comptroller allowed the cost-of-goods-sold deduction for labor\n\ncosts incurred in the production or “fabrication” of rig components and\n\nparts installed on the rigs (and thus “sold” to the rig owners), plus other\n\ncosts specifically allowable under the statute. See Opinion at * 3; see also\n\nTex. Tax Code § 171.1012(c), (d), (f). But the Comptroller disallowed, as\n\nnon-deductible “services,” Gulf Copper’s labor costs incurred in installing\n\ncomponents, removing defective components, painting, welding, fixing\n\ncranes, sandblasting, and coating—because none of those labor costs\n\nwere shown to be costs of acquiring or producing “goods” for sale. See id.\n\n                                                                    Page 4\n\f§ 171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii) and (c)(1); CR. 297 (Findings of Fact 10, 12, 13\n\n[App. B]; 2.RR.131-32, 188, 192.\n\n\n     The Comptroller auditor also disallowed Sabine Surveyors’ costs in\n\nhis calculation of Gulf Copper’s cost-of-goods-sold deduction—because\n\nsurveying is a service and the costs of surveying are not costs of acquiring\n\nor producing “goods” for sale. 5.RR.11–15.\n\n\n     As to the second audit issue, the Comptroller auditor determined\n\nthat the $79,405,230 in payments to subcontractors did not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements for the exclusion from revenue, and should be\n\nconsidered instead in the calculation of Gulf Copper’s cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction.\n\n\n     Gulf Copper paid the assessment under protest, and these two\n\nadjustments are the principal issues in this Petition for Review.\n\n\n                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n     Cost-of-goods-sold deduction\n\n     There is no evidence in the record to support the contested\n\ndeductions. Gulf Copper does not own or sell drilling rigs – it repairs\n\nand outfits them at its waterfront facility. The repair and outfitting of\n                                                                  Page 5\n\fdrilling rigs is not the sale of “goods.” Therefore, Gulf Copper’s costs in\n\nrepairing and outfitting the rigs are not deductible as costs of acquiring\n\nor producing “goods” under Tax Code § 171.1012(c), (d), or (f).\n\n     Furthermore, in performing rig work at its waterfront facility, Gulf\n\nCopper is not “furnishing labor or materials to a project for the\n\nconstruction,   improvement,      remodeling,    repair,   or     industrial\n\nmaintenance . . . of real property. . .” Rather, it is providing repair and\n\noutfitting services to the owner of equipment, who in turn, contracts with\n\nthe E&P company to provide that equipment for offshore drilling. This\n\nindirect relationship does not qualify Gulf Copper for the cost-of-goods-\n\nsold deduction under Tax Code § 171.1012(i). Gulf Copper’s rig work adds\n\nvalue to the rigs, but it does not add value to any real-property project.\n\n     Gulf Copper’s affiliate, Sabine Surveyors, does not own or sell goods\n\neither. And similarly, Sabine Surveyors is not by virtue of its surveying\n\nservices, furnishing labor or materials “to a project for the construction,\n\nimprovement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance ... of real\n\nproperty,” so as to qualify for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction under Tax\n\nCode § 171.1012(i).\n\n\n                                                                     Page 6\n\f     Revenue exclusion for subcontractor payments\n\n     With regard to the flow-through exclusion from revenue, the\n\npayment of subcontractors for rig repair, before the commencement of\n\ndrilling, does not constitute evidence of payment for “services, labor, or\n\nmaterials in connection with the actual or proposed design, construction,\n\nremodeling, or repair of improvements on real property” under Texas Tax\n\nCode §171.1011(g)(3).\n\n     Furthermore, the flow-through exclusion is proper only where the\n\ntaxpayer is contractually obligated to pay its subcontractors from or\n\nbased on payments that it has received from other parties, and, here,\n\nthere is no such contract in evidence.\n\n                             ARGUMENT\n\nI.   Gulf Copper’s costs in repairing and outfitting drilling rigs,\n     and Sabine Surveyors’ costs in surveying marine vessels,\n     were not deductible as costs-of-goods sold.\n\n     A. Background: Tax Code section 171.1012.\n\n     Gulf Copper determined its “margin” by deducting cost of goods sold\n\nfrom total revenue. Opinion at *3. The cost-of-goods-sold deduction is\n\ngoverned by Tax Code section 171.1012, which permits a business to\n\n\n                                                                   Page 7\n\fsubtract “all direct costs of acquiring or producing the goods.” Tex. Tax\n\nCode § 171.1012(a)(1) and (c).\n\n     “Goods” means “real or tangible personal property sold in the\n\nordinary course of business of a taxable entity.” Id. The definition of\n\n“tangible   personal   property”    expressly    excludes   “services.”   Id.\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii)). Thus, sellers of services are not ordinarily\n\neligible for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction.\n\n     To take a deduction under the cost-of-goods-sold statute, the entity\n\nmust own the “goods” that it sells. Id. § 171.1012(i). Gulf Copper did not\n\nown the drilling rigs that it repaired and outfitted, and Sabine Surveyors\n\ndid not own the marine vessels that it surveyed. The third sentence of\n\nsubsection (i), however, allows certain service providers to subtract their\n\ncosts from revenue as cost-of-goods-sold by “considering” them to be\n\nowners of their labor and materials:\n\n     A taxable entity furnishing labor or materials to a project for\n     the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or\n     industrial maintenance ... of real property is considered to be\n     an owner of that labor or materials and may include the\n     costs, as allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of\n     goods sold.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     Page 8\n\f     B. There was no evidence of section 171.1012(i) costs to\n        support a remand.\n\n     Because there was no evidence supporting application of the\n\nsubsection (i)’s third sentence, the court of appeals erred when it\n\nconcluded that:\n\n     Gulf Copper presented evidence at trial that, to some extent,\n     Gulf Copper’s employees provided labor and materials to\n     projects for improvement of real property (drilling oil wells).\n     The Comptroller was obligated to consider to what extent the\n     activities of Gulf Copper’s employees were essential and\n     direct components of those specific projects.\n\nOpinion at *14.\n\n     Similarly, the court erred when it concluded that “Sabine\n\nSurveyors’ costs should have been analyzed on a cost-by-cost basis to\n\ndetermine which of those costs met the requirement that they be integral,\n\nessential, and direct components of the offshore drilling process.” Id.\n\n     Remand is inappropriate here, because Gulf Copper and its\n\nsubsidiary’s services do not constitute “furnishing labor and materials to\n\na project for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or\n\nindustrial maintenance ... of real property. . .” Thus, their services do\n\nnot qualify for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction under subsection (i). Tex.\n\nTax. Code § 171.1012(i).\n                                                                    Page 9\n\f       Subsection (i)’s phrase “furnishing labor or materials” is nearly\n\nidentical to the Property Code phrase “furnishes labor or materials.” See\n\nTex. Prop. Code § 53.021 (“Persons Entitled to Lien”). Therefore, it is\n\nreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended substantially similar\n\nmeanings.     See, e.g., Sheshunoff v. Sheshunoff, 172 S.W.3d 686, 692\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2005, pet. denied) (“When the same or a similar term\n\nis used in the same connection in different statutes, the term will be\n\ngiven the same meaning in one as in the other, unless there is something\n\nto indicate that a different meaning was intended.”)\n\n       The Property Code provides that a person who “furnishes labor or\n\nmaterials” for the construction, repair, or demolition of a real property\n\nimprovement may establish a lien on the real property to secure payment\n\nfor the labor done or material furnished. See Tex. Prop. Code §§ 53.021\n\nand 53.023 (“Payment Secured by Lien.”). The definitions limit “labor”\n\nand “materials” to those used in the “direct prosecution” of the work. Id.\n\nat § 53.001(3) & (4). 2\n                      1F\n\n\n\n\n2   The Comptroller has proposed rules amending 34 TAC § 3.588, which\nwould use the Property Code definitions to define “labor” and “materials”\nin section 171.1012(i). See 42. Tex. Reg. 5235-36 (Sept. 29, 2017).\n                                                                  Page 10\n\f      Application of the Property Code definitions provides this clear test\n\nfor costs claimed under subsection (i): could Gulf Copper obtain a lien on\n\nthe offshore drilling project? Here, the answer is “no.” Mechanics and\n\nmaterialman’s liens are limited to “running repairs” performed on\n\nequipment while it is being used on the project site. See Tex. Prop. Code\n\n§ 53.001(4)(B). 3\n                2F\n\n\n\n\n      Gulf Copper tendered no evidence that the costs it seeks to deduct\n\nincluded any of these activities. Indeed, to establish its entitlement to\n\nthe disputed deductions, Gulf Copper relied solely on an erroneous legal\n\ninterpretation of subsection 171.1012(h)—which the court of appeals\n\nexpressly rejected. Opinion at *9, 12. This lack of evidence requires a\n\nrendition of judgment regarding section 171.1012 costs rather than\n\nremand.\n\n      The definitions of “labor” and “materials” in the Property Code –\n\nlimiting the terms to labor and materials used in the “direct prosecution”\n\nof a project – accord with subsection (i)’s words and phrases in their\n\n\n\n\n3 Furthermore, mineral property liens under Property Code Chapter 56 are\nlimited to “digging, drilling, torpedoing, operating, completing, maintaining,\nor repairing an oil, gas, or water well.” Tex. Prop. Code § 56.001(1).\n                                                                       Page 11\n\fproper context, as well as with the rules of grammar and usage. See Tex.\n\nGov't Code Ann. § 311.011(a) (West 2013). The phrase “to a project for the\n\nconstruction, improvement . . . of real property” is prepositional phrase\n\nthat functions as an adjective modifying and limiting the antecedent\n\nphrase “furnishing labor or materials.”\n\n     The court of appeals nonetheless concluded that Gulf Copper\n\n“presented evidence at trial that, to some extent” it provided labor or\n\nmaterials that were “essential and direct components” of “specific\n\nprojects.” Opinion at *14. The court’s “essential and direct components”\n\nlanguage comes from its opinion in Newpark. In that case, the court\n\ndistinguished labor that was an “essential and direct component” of the\n\ndrilling project from labor “too far removed” from the project. Opinion\n\nat *14 (citing Combs v. Newpark Resources, Inc., 422 S.W.3d 46, 57 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2013, no pet.)).\n\n     The taxpayer in Newpark was able to obtain the subsection (i)\n\ndeductions for labor furnished in hauling away used drilling mud and\n\nother waste products from oil well drilling sites. 422 S.W.3d at 48. But\n\nthat labor was provided to the oil wells. In contrast, Gulf Copper’s work\n\nwas at least two steps removed from a real-property project. It provided\n                                                                 Page 12\n\foutfitting and repair services to its customers—the rig owners—who, in\n\nturn, contracted with the E&P companies to provide them with the rigs\n\nfor offshore drilling. The E&P companies then used the rigs in projects\n\nfor real-property improvements or construction.\n\n     This Court has never adopted the “essential and direct components”\n\ntest in Newpark. But even if the Court accepts that formulation, the\n\nrepair and outfitting of a rig owned and operated by a third party, prior\n\nto commencement of drilling by yet another third party at a different site\n\noffshore, cannot be viewed as a “direct component” of drilling.        Gulf\n\nCopper’s work is “too far removed” from the construction project.\n\n     Gulf Copper fixed construction equipment. As a matter of law,\n\nfixing or upgrading construction equipment prior to its utilization is\n\nnot “furnishing labor or materials to a project for the construction,\n\nimprovement ... of real property” under subsection (i). Just as fixing\n\na bulldozer before its delivery to and use on a construction site should be\n\nproperly classified as the repair of tangible personal property rather than\n\nreal-property improvements, so Gulf Copper’s rig work at its waterfront\n\nyards constituted the repair and upgrading of tangible personal property,\n\nnot “furnishing labor or materials to” a construction project.        Gulf\n                                                                   Page 13\n\fCopper’s rig work added value to the rigs, but it did not add value to any\n\nreal-property project.\n\n     This analysis applies with equal if not greater force to Sabine\n\nSurveyors, which inspected the rigs and other marine vessels. There is\n\nno evidence the subsidiary inspected offshore drilling operations or any\n\nother real-property improvements.\n\n     C. The court of appeals’ decision regarding section\n       171.1012(i) also defeats other key provisions in the\n       cost-of-goods-sold statute.\n\n     The court’s decision undermines the explicit exclusion of “services”\n\nfrom the definition of “tangible personal property” and thus from the\n\ndefinition of “goods.” See id. § 171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii).    It does so by\n\nallowing the taxpayer to deduct labor costs for installing components,\n\nremoving defective components, painting, welding, fixing cranes,\n\nsandblasting, and coating—even though these services had only an\n\nindirect relationship to the construction or improvement of real property.\n\nCR. 296-97 (Findings of Fact No. 10, 12 and 13)[App. B]; 2.RR.131–32,\n\n188, 192.\n\n     The cost of a service may be allowable in a cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction only if the service is a cost of acquiring or producing a “good”\n\n                                                                  Page 14\n\fthat an entity sells or is labor in the “direct prosecution” of a real-property\n\nproject.   Returning to the example of a bulldozer, this is why under\n\nsection 171.1012, the salaries of employees who paint, repair, upgrade a\n\nbulldozer for sale would be allowable in the seller’s cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction. The salaries are costs of “producing” the equipment “sold.”\n\n      But apart from the acquisition or production expenses for the sale\n\nof the bulldozer, costs of providing services to repair, upgrade, or paint\n\nthe bulldozer are not deductible. And these services do not qualify for the\n\ndeduction simply because the owner of the bulldozer repaired, upgraded\n\nor painted subsequently provides it to a real-property project.           Nor\n\nwould the person performing the repair, upgrade or painting be able to\n\nclaim the deduction.\n\n      Similarly, Gulf Copper is not selling rigs to a third-party, but\n\nrather, is providing repair and outfitting services performed at its\n\nwaterfront facility. 4 That the rigs are then used by another third party\n                    3F\n\n\n\n\n4 Again, the comptroller has already allowed the deduction for the labor costs\nincurred in “producing” “goods”—i.e., parts and components Gulf Copper\ninstalled on the rigs and thus sold.\n                                                                      Page 15\n\fto drill offshore does not transform Gulf Copper’s services into “labor”\n\nused in “direct prosecution” of the project under subsection (i).\n\nII.   Gulf Copper cannot exclude the contested subcontractor\n      payments from revenue under Tax Code §171.1011(g)(3).\n\n      A. Background: Section 171.1011(g)(3)\n\n      Taxpayers such as Gulf Copper must first determine their revenue\n\nbefore deducting cost of goods sold to determine “margin.” In limited\n\ncircumstances, the Texas Legislature has allowed taxpayers to exclude\n\nreceipts that they are obligated by law or contract or fiduciary duty to\n\npass on to another. The theory is that the receipts do not truly represent\n\nthe revenue of the taxpayers. However, taxpayers are not allowed to\n\nexclude receipts merely because the receipts are used to pay the\n\ntaxpayers’ expenses. If that were the case, the “margin” tax would become\n\na net income tax. To prevent just that outcome, Tax Code §171.1011(i)\n\nspecifically provides:\n\n      Except as provided by Subsection (g), a payment made under\n      an ordinary contract for the provision of services in the\n      regular course of business may not be excluded.\n\n      In this case, the question is whether the payments were made\n\nunder an ordinary contract for the provision of services or whether they\n\n\n                                                                    Page 16\n\fwere    flow-through     payments    to   subcontractors    under    section\n\n171.1011(g)(3), which provided during the period at issue:\n\n       A taxable entity shall exclude from its total revenue, to the\n       extent [reported to the IRS as income], only the following flow-\n       through funds that are mandated by contract to be distributed\n       to other entities:\n       ....\n\n         (3) subcontracting payments handled by the taxable entity\n         to provide services, labor, or materials in connection with\n         the actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, or\n         repair of improvements on real property or the location of\n         the boundaries of real property.\n\n\nAct of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch.1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen.\n\nLaws 1, 10 (amended 2013) (“the (g)(3) revenue exclusion”).\n\n       There are two requirements at issue: there must be “flow-\n\nthrough funds that are mandated by contract to be distributed to\n\nother entities,” and the flow-through funds must be for “services,\n\nlabor, or materials in connection with the actual or proposed design,\n\nconstruction, remodeling, or repair of improvements on real\n\nproperty.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    Page 17\n\f     B. There is no evidence that the subcontract work\n     constituted “services, labor, or materials in connection\n     with the actual or proposed design, construction,\n     remodeling, or repair of improvements on real property”\n\n     Finding of Fact 29 reads in part, “Gulf Copper, through its\n\nemployees and subcontractors, provides labor and materials in\n\nconnection with the actual or proposed construction or repair of\n\nimprovements on real property;…” CR.298 [App.2]. This finding tracks\n\nthe statutory language of section 171.1011(g)(3) and is really a conclusion\n\nof law reviewed de novo, without deference. It should be rejected.\n\n     The court of appeals conceded that the phrase “in connection with”\n\nis “one ‘of intentional breadth,’ but not without ‘logical limit.’” Opinion\n\nat *7 (quoting Titan Transp. LP v. Combs, 433 S.W.3d 627, 637-38 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2014, pet. denied)). The “logical limit” has been exceeded\n\nhere for these reasons:\n\n  • Gulf Copper’s work was temporally remote from the projects to\n    improve real property – the work was performed before drilling\n    operations commenced.\n\n  • Gulf Copper’s work was physically remote from the projects to\n    improve real property – the work was performed on tangible\n    personal property at Gulf Copper’s waterfront yards and not at the\n    offshore drilling sites, or oil and gas wells.\n\n                                                                  Page 18\n\f    • Gulf Copper’s work was contractually remote from the projects to\n      improve real property – Gulf Copper’s contracts were with the rig\n      owners, not the project owners, and Gulf Copper was not a\n      subcontractor to the project owners.\n\n      And, when Gulf Copper finished its work, the offshore drilling\n\nprojects had no greater value than before Gulf Copper started. This is\n\nthe “logical limit” of the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. 5 4F\n\n\n\n\n      Of course, the rigs that Gulf Copper repairs and modifies are used\n\nby third parties to construct oil and gas wells, and oil and gas wells are\n\nimprovements to real property.         For this reason, the State does not\n\nchallenge Findings of Fact 20: “Offshore drilling rigs are necessary and\n\nessential to the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells because the wells\n\ncould not be drilled without the drilling rigs”) or Finding of Fact 30 (“The\n\nlabor and materials provided by Gulf Copper through its employees and\n\nsubcontractors are necessary, essential, and integral to the construction\n\n\n5 While this part of the (g)(3) revenue exclusion is similar to the real-property\nproject requirement in the third-sentence of subsection (i), there are\ndifferences. Subsection (i) does not contain the word “services.” It refers to\n“labor or materials furnished “to” a real-property project, rather than “services,\nlabor or materials” provided “in connection with” such projects. Nevertheless,\nGulf Copper’s work does not qualify for the revenue exclusion even under the\nbroader phrasing in subsection (g)(3). It is still too “remote or attenuated” to\nqualify. See Titan Transp. 433 S.W.3d at 638. The court of appeals’ decision\ndoes not account for the use of different words and phrases in these two\nsubsections.\n                                                                         Page 19\n\f… of oil and gas wells.”). CR.298, 299 [App.2].\n\n      But just as narrow focus on necessity or indispensability would\n\nimproperly broaden the statutory test under subsection (i), these findings\n\nare, as a matter of law, insufficient to pull the subcontractor payments\n\ninto the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. The taxpayer’s indispensability\n\nargument—which is really none other than a “but for,” cause-in-fact\n\nargument—“proves too much.” Undoubtedly, there are many necessary\n\nor   essential   preconditions—business    organization,   administrative\n\nservices support, surveying, geoseismic testing, research—for oil wells\n\nand other real-property projects.     And, no doubt, these and other\n\nnecessary preconditions will themselves require the furnishing of labor\n\nor materials.\n\n      But the mere fact that the disputed labor or materials are in the\n\ncausal chain leading up to the real-property project is not evidence\n\nsupporting the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. Another precondition of the\n\nproject would be a written drilling contract between the rig owner and\n\nthe E&P company. Should the law firm that drafted the contract for the\n\nrig owner be able to exclude its expenses because the expenses were\n\nincurred “in connection with” the improvement of real property? Gulf\n                                                                 Page 20\n\fCopper is in the same position as the law firm, providing services to the\n\nrig owner antecedent to the drilling project and not providing any value\n\nto the drilling project itself.\n\n      C. There is no evidence that the subcontractor\n         payments constituted “flow-through funds that are\n         mandated by contract to be distributed to other\n         entities.”\n\n\n      Even if the Court rejects the State’s primary contention and finds\n\nthat the subcontractor payments were made in connection with the\n\nconstruction or improvements of real property, there must still be\n\nevidence that the payments were mandated by contract to be distributed\n\nto the subcontractors.\n\n      Gulf Copper’s two biggest contracts with rig owners, the Pride and\n\nHelix contracts, involved two types of subcontractor labor – hourly and\n\ncost-plus.\n\n      Under the hourly labor provisions, employees of the subcontractor\n\nworked side-by-side with Gulf Copper employees, performing the same\n\nwork. Gulf Copper paid these subcontractors a flat hourly rate. And\n\nunder the Pride and Helix contracts, the rig owners paid Gulf Copper a\n\nhigher flat hourly rate—paying the same rate for regular labor performed\n                                                                 Page 21\n\fby Gulf Copper employees and its subcontractors. 2.RR.110–113.\n\n4.RR.104–05; PX1 at P00220 (Pride Contract) [App.9]; PX2 at P0072\n\n(Helix contract). Indeed, with respect to regular labor, the Pride and\n\nHelix contracts said nothing at all about subcontractors.\n\n     But for the second type of subcontractor labor involving specialty\n\nservices, the Pride and Helix contracts specified that payments were cost\n\nplus 15% (in the case of the Pride contract) and cost plus 20% (in the case\n\nof the Helix contract). PX1 at P00221 [App.9]; PX2 at P00073 [App.10];\n\n2.RR.112. 6\n          5F\n\n\n\n\n     At trial, the State conceded that $32.0 million in subcontractor\n\npayments—reflecting the specialty services governed by the cost-plus\n\nprovisions in the Pride and Helix contracts—were flow-through funds\n\nmandated by contract to be distributed to the subcontractors. But the\n\nState continued to urge that the other payments—reflecting the hourly-\n\nrate subcontractors—were not flow-through funds.          With respect to\n\nthose payments, no contract mandated that any customer payment for\n\n\n\n6 Gulf Copper also made subcontractor payments under six other contracts in\naddition to the Pride and Helix contracts. But none of those six contracts\nwere cost-plus contracts. PX3, PX4, PX5, PX6, PX7, PX8.\n\n                                                                   Page 22\n\flabor be distributed to the subcontractors. The trial court and the court\n\nof appeals erred when they concluded these payments were nonetheless\n\nflow-through funds mandated by contract to be distributed to other\n\nentities. Opinion at *6.\n\n     Though Gulf Copper was contractually obligated to pay the\n\nsubcontractors for “labor,” it was not contractually obligated to pass on\n\nor flow-through customer payments to them. That makes all the\n\ndifference under the plain language of the statute. Neither the court of\n\nappeals nor Gulf Copper pointed to any contractual mandate in the\n\ncustomer contracts or in the subcontracts that required Gulf Copper to\n\nshare customer payments with its subcontractors.\n\n     When examining statutory text, the Code Construction Act\n\nmandates that the Court read words and phrases in context and construe\n\nthem according to the rules of grammar and usage. Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\n\n§ 311.011(a) (West 2013); see also supra at 11-12. The phrase “flow-\n\nthrough funds that are mandated by contract to be distributed to other\n\nentities” is a single unified requirement. The dependent clause “that are\n\nmandated by contract to be distributed to other entities” is an adjective\n\n\n\n                                                                 Page 23\n\fthat specifies and limits the type of flow-through funds excludable from\n\nrevenue.\n\n     The court of appeals’ approach effectively reads out of the statute\n\nthe requirement that a contract mandate that funds be distributed to\n\nother entities. Gulf Copper was not contractually obligated to mark-up\n\nanything or, for that matter, to do anything at all besides paying the\n\nsubcontractors an hourly rate.\n\n     Although the court of appeals relied on Titan Transp., LP v. Combs,\n\n433 S.W.3d 625 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, pet. denied), that case is readily\n\ndistinguishable.   There,   the   taxpayer   had   “contracts   with   its\n\nsubcontractors that required [the taxpayer] to pay 84% of its gross\n\nreceipts [from customers] to independent contractors.” Titan Transp.,\n\n433 S.W.3d at 630.\n\n     Alternatively, in the event of ambiguity, this statute is a tax\n\nexclusion, which like tax exemptions, must be construed strictly against\n\nGulf Copper. See Owens Corning v. Hegar, 04-16-00211-CV, 2017 WL\n\n1244444, at *3 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Apr. 5, 2017, pet. denied)\n\n(holding that the cost-of-goods-sold deduction is a tax exemption for the\n\nsame reason).\n                                                                 Page 24\n\f                              PRAYER\n\nFor these reasons, the court should grant the petition for review and\n\nupon further briefing on the merits, reverse and render judgment.\n\n                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                               KEN PAXTON\n                               Attorney General\n\n                               JEFFREY C.

Findings of Fact\n\nI. Gulf Copper owns all of the o utstanding shares of a subsidiary named Sabine Surveyors.\n\n2 . Sabine Surveyors is a li mited partnership primaril y engaged in the business of marine vessel\n    surveymg.\n\n3. Gulf Copper and Sabine Surveyors share certain physical locations, customers and\n   managerial staff. They a lso refer business to each other.\n\n4. Gulf Copper and Sabine Surveyors are a ffiliated and engaged in a unitary business.\n\n5. Gulf Copper and Sabine Surveyo rs are members o f a co mbined group, which fil es co mbined\n   franchi se tax reports.\n\n6. Gulf Copper serves as the reporting entity fo r the franch ise tax combined group.\n\n7. For franch ise tax report year 2009 (the acco unting period of May I, 2007 to April 30, 2008),\n   Gulf Copper, Sabine Surveyors, and others (herei nafter coll ective ly referred to as \"G ul f\n   Copper\") jo·ned in the filing o f combined franchise tax report.\n\n\n\n\nGu(fCopper & Ma111!/c1cturi11g Corp. v. Hegar, Cause No. D- I -GN- 14-00462 0\nf-inclings of Fact and Co11clusio11s of Law\nPage I of 6\n\f8. Gulf Copper satisfied all procedural prerequisites to maintain a protest suit under Texas Tax\n   Code Chapter 112.\n\n9. Gulf Copper's customers are primarily rig owners and drilling contractors who use their\n   offshore rigs to drill for oil and gas on behalf of exploration and production (\"E&P\")\n   companies.\n\n10. Gulf Copper is primarily engaged in the business of surveying, manufacturing, upgrading,\n    and repairing offshore drilling rigs.\n\n11. Gulf Copper provides everything necessary to satisfy the customer's work order, including\n    all labor, materials, equipment, and supplies.\n\n12. Gulf Copper repairs rigs by removing defective portions, manufacturing replacement\n    components, and installing the replacement components onto the rigs. Gulf Copper also\n    manufactures and installs new components for rigs that do not replace an existing\n    component.\n\n13. Gulf Copper's work is labor-intensive and requires specialized training and experience.\n    Examples of Gulf Copper's employee and subcontractor labor includes: manufacturing (e.g.,\n    steel components, drain systems, and fuel systems); installation; welding; fitting; cutting;\n    blasting, coating, and painting; hot work; analytical stress testing; and electrical and\n    hydraulic work. Gulf Copper's work is complex, requiring precise measurements and several\n    levels of inspection and compliance.\n\n14. In performing its work through its employees and subcontractors, Gulf Copper furnishes\n    materials, including steel, gasket materials, blasting medium, paint, and other industrial\n    materials.\n\n15. In completing its work, Gulf Copper utilizes all aspects and the entire breadth of its facility\n    yards, whether the rig sits on the dry dock, in the yard, or in the water. This includes the lay\n    down areas, the warehouses, the fabrication shops, the welding areas, and the stacking areas.\n\n16. Gulf Copper's work enables the rigs (I) to meet and maintain the certification requirements\n    imposed by classification societies, (2) to comply with governing regulations, and (3) to\n    satisfy an exploration and production (\"E&P\") company's contractual requirements for a\n    specific drilling project.\n\n17. A rig cannot be used for drilling unless it is properly certified, compliant, and satisfies the\n    contractual requirements for the project.\n\n\n\n\nGulf Copper & Manufactur ing C0111. v. Hegar, Cause No. D-I-GN-14-004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 2 of 6\n\f18. Gulf Copper's work increases the rig's value.\n\n19. Rig owners do not hire Gulf Copper to repair or upgrade their rigs or manufacture new\n    components unless they have a revenue-generating contract in place for the drilling of\n    offshore oil and gas wells.\n\n20. Offshore drilling rigs are necessary and essential to the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells\n    because the wells could not be drilled without the drilling rigs.\n\n21. Gulf Copper has elected, for federal income tax purposes, to use the accrual method of\n    accounting. This method matches the costs incurred by Gulf Copper with the revenues\n    generated by those expenses.\n\n22. Gulf Copper performs its work using both employees and subcontractors.\n\n23. Gulf Copper's customers often approve or require Gulf Copper's use of certain\n    subcontractors to complete the work. The customers remain very involved throughout the\n    project. They often have field representatives at Gulf Copper's facilities and monitor the\n    specific deadlines by which the work must be completed.\n\n24. Gulf Copper charges its customers for subcontractor work using a formula that is based upon\n    Gulf Copper's actual cost of the subcontractor(s) plus a mark-up. Regardless of how the\n    subcontractor is billed, Gulf Copper's resulting mark-up to the customer is generally between\n    15-20 percent.\n\n25. When Gulf Copper's customers pay Gulf Copper for work performed by subcontractors, Gulf\n    Copper retains the portion of the payment attributable to its mark-up (generally between 15-\n    20 percent) and flows through the remainder of the customer's payment to the subcontractor.\n\n26. The subcontractor payments flow from Gulf Copper's customer, through Gulf Copper, to\n    Gulf Copper's subcontractors who performed the work for the customer.\n\n27. The subcontractors are legal entities separate from Gulf Copper.\n\n28. Gulf Copper's contractual mandates to distribute flow-through funds to its subcontractors are\n    contained within its customer contracts, its contracts with the subcontractors, supporting\n    invoices, work orders, purchase orders, and other accounting records. They are also\n    embodied in the course of Gulf Copper's dealings with its customers and subcontractors.\n\n29. Gulf Copper, through its employees and subcontractors, provides labor and materials in\n    connection with the actual or proposed construction, or repair of improvements on real\n    property; and to projects for the construction, improvement, repair, or industrial maintenance\n    of real property.\n\n\n\n\nGulf Copper & Manufacturing Corp. v. Hegar, Cause No. D-1-GN-14-004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 3 of 6\n\f30. The labor and materials provided by Gulf Copper through its employees and subcontractors\n    are necessary, essential, and integral to the construction, improvement, repair, and industrial\n    maintenance of oil and gas wells.\n\n31. Gulf Copper's proper apportionment factor is .8808.\n\n32. Gulf Copper manufactures, develops, improves, and installs tangible personal property for its\n    customers.\n\n33. Gulf Copper resells tangible personal property to its customers.\n\n34. Gulf Copper sometimes sells the scrap metal generated by its rig repair work.\n\n35. Gulf Copper owns tangible personal property that it sells in the ordinary course of business.\n\n36. For report year 2009, Gulf Copper incurred expenses eligible to be included in the cost of\n    goods sold subtraction in the amount of $152,116,964.\n\n37. The categories, classifications, locations and amounts of the costs eligible to be included in\n    the cost of goods sold subtraction are accurately stated in Exhibit 56.\n\n38. Any finding of fact that is more properly characterized as a conclusion of law shall be\n    considered a conclusion of law.\n\n\n\n\nGulf Copper & Manufactur ing Corp. v. Hegar. Cause No. D-I-GN-14- 004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 4 of 6\n\f                                      II. Conclusions of Law\n\n1. Gulf Copper consists of a combined group, including Gulf Copper, Sabine Surveyors and\n   others, and this combined group is a single taxable entity for purposes of the Texas franchise\n   tax.\n\n2. Gulf Copper is entitled to exclude from its revenue $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments\n   under Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011 (g)(3 ).\n\n3. Oil and gas wells constitute improvements on real property for purposes of Tex. Tax Code\n   § 171.101 l(g)(3).\n\n4. Texas Tax Code § 171.101 l(g)(3) does not require that the mandate for payment be\n   contained in a customer contract or subcontract. The statutory mandate element is satisfied\n   as long as the taxpayer is legally obligated by contract to pay a portion of the customer funds\n   to the subcontractor.\n\n5. Alternatively, Gulf Copper is entitled to include the $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments\n   in its cost of goods sold subtraction under Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012.\n\n6. Under Tex. Tax Code § 171.1055, Gulf Copper may not include receipts excluded from total\n   revenue in either the numerator or the denominator of its apportionment calculation.\n\n7. Gulf Copper properly excluded from the numerator and denominator of its apportionment\n   factor its subcontractor payments totaling $79,405,230.\n\n8. Gulf Copper properly calculated its franchise tax due amount using an apportionment factor\n   of .8808.\n\n9. Gulf Copper owns goods as required by the first sentence of Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(i).\n\n10. Gulf Copper qualifies for the cost of goods sold subtraction under the second sentence of\n    Tex. Tax Code§ 171.1012(i) and as defined by§ 171.1012(a)(l).\n\n11. Gulf Copper qualifies for the cost of goods sold subtraction under the third sentence of Tex.\n    Tax Code§ 171.1012(i).\n\n12. Oil and gas wells constitute real property for purposes of Tex. Tax Code§ 171.1012(i).\n\n13. The limitations imposed by the Comptroller upon Gulf Copper's cost of goods sold\n    calculation violate Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012.\n\n14. Gulf Copper is entitled to include the costs of Sabine Surveyors in its cost of goods sold\n    subtraction, as allowed by Tex. Tax Code § 171.10 l 2(g)-(h), (c )-(t).\n\n\nGulf Copper & 1\\tlanufacturing Co111. v. Hegar. Cause No. D- l-GN-14-004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 5 of 6\n\f15. As a qualifying owner of goods, Gulf Copper properly included each of the costs shown on\n    Exhibit 56 as costs of goods sold allowed for subtraction under Tex. Tax Code\n    § 171.1012(g)-(h), (c)-(t).\n\n16. In addition to the revenue exclusion stated in Conclusion of Law No. 2, Gulf Copper is\n    entitled to claim a cost of goods sold subtraction in the amount of $72,711,734 for franchise\n    tax report year 2009, as set forth in Exhibit 56.\n\n17. Alternatively, Gulf Copper is entitled to include its $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments in\n    its cost of goods sold subtraction for a total subtraction of $152,116,964 for report year 2009,\n    as set forth in Exhibit 56.\n\n18. Any conclusion of law that is more properly characterized as a finding of fact shall be\n    considered a finding of fact.\n                         th\n\n\n        SIGNED this 11 day of M a r ~ ~ M Y C:.::::EA CHUM\n\n\n\n                                          20 I st District Court,\n                                          Travis County, Texas\n\n\n\n\nGulf Copper & Manufacturing Corp. v.

Tax Code § 171.1011(g)(3)) (excluding certain “flow-\nthrough funds” from taxpayer’s “total revenue”).\n\fpayments as “cost of goods sold” (COGS).2 Gulf Copper also asserted that the State erroneously\n\nexcluded certain costs Gulf Copper had included in its calculation of its COGS deduction, resulting\n\nin a smaller COGS deduction and, correspondingly, Gulf Copper’s owing additional franchise\n\ntaxes. Following a bench trial, the trial court concluded that Gulf Copper was entitled to a revenue\n\nexclusion for the subcontractor payments or, alternatively, was permitted to include the subcontractor\n\npayments in its COGS deduction. The trial court also concluded that Gulf Copper was entitled to\n\ndeduct all of the costs it had included in its original COGS calculation. The court rendered judgment\n\nordering the State to pay Gulf Copper $838,117.84, the entire amount it had paid under protest, plus\n\nstatutory interest and costs allowed by law. On appeal, the State asserts that the trial court erred in\n\nits conclusions regarding both the revenue exclusion and the COGS deduction. We agree with the\n\ntrial court that Gulf Copper was entitled to claim a revenue exclusion for the subcontractor payments.\n\nHowever, because on this record we cannot uphold the trial court’s findings regarding the amount\n\nof Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction, we will reverse the trial court’s judgment and remand the cause\n\nto the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\n                This Court has previously provided overviews of the current Texas franchise-tax\n\nscheme, originally enacted in 2006, which assesses franchise taxes against a taxable entity’s “taxable\n\n\n       2\n         See Act of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex.

App.—Austin 2013, no pet.).\n\nUnder the current franchise-tax scheme, franchise taxes are assessed against a taxable entity’s\n\n“taxable margin.” Tex. Tax Code § 171.002(a). The franchise-tax statute has been substantively\n\namended several times since its enactment, and the provisions applicable to this case are those\n\nthat were in effect on January 1, 2009.3 Under that version of the franchise-tax statute, the taxable\n\nentity first calculates its “total revenue” in the manner directed by Tax Code section 171.1011. See\n\nid. § 171.1011 (determination of total revenue). In general, total revenue is income reported to the\n\nfederal Internal Revenue Service less various categories of revenue that the statute specifies are to\n\nbe excluded, excepted, deducted, or otherwise limited. Id. For example, all taxpayers may deduct\n\ncertain flow-through funds, while only taxable entities in select industries are permitted to exclude\n\nother types of flow-through funds. Compare id. § 171.1011(f), (g) (flow-through-funds exclusions)\n\nwith id. (g-1), (g-3), (g-4) (flow-through-funds exclusions for specific industries); see also In re\n\nNestle USA, Inc., 387 S.W.3d 610, 615 (Tex. 2012) (discussing franchise-tax scheme). “A manifest\n\npurpose of excluding ‘flow-through funds’ is to except from taxation gross receipts that do not\n\nconstitute actual gain or income to the taxpayer.” Titan Transp., 433 S.W.3d at 628.\n\n               After calculating total revenue, the taxpayer computes its “taxable margin” by first\n\ndetermining its “margin.” See Tex. Tax Code § 171.101(a)(1) (“The taxable margin of a taxable\n\nentity is computed by . . . determining the taxable entity’s margin.”). The “margin” is the lesser of\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       Citations in this opinion will be to the current version of the Tax Code when intervening\namendments are not relevant to the disposition of the issues on appeal.\n\n                                                 3\n\f(1) 70% of the taxable entity’s total revenue or (2) the taxable entity’s total revenue minus, at the\n\nentity’s election, either cost of goods sold, as determined under section 171.1012 (the COGS\n\ncalculation) or compensation, as determined under section 171.1013 (the compensation calculation).\n\nSee Act of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch.1, § 5, 2006 Tex.

Tax Code 171.101).4 After applicable deductions have been taken, “taxable\n\nmargin” is determined by apportioning the adjusted revenue between in-state and out-of-state\n\nbusiness and, except for E-Z computation filers, subtracting any other allowable deductions. Id.\n\n§§ 171.101(a)(2), (3), .1016(b)(2), (c). The franchise-tax obligation is determined by multiplying\n\nthe “taxable margin” by the applicable tax rate. Id. § 171.002.\n\n\nNature of Gulf Copper’s Business Activities5\n\n               Gulf Copper is a corporation primarily engaged in the business of surveying,\n\nmanufacturing, upgrading, and repairing offshore drilling rigs. Gulf Copper’s work enables the drilling\n\nrigs to (1) obtain and maintain the certification requirements imposed by marine classification\n\nsocieties;6 (2) comply with regulations, both state and federal, applicable to offshore drilling rigs\n\n\n       4\n         Not relevant to this case is the option to use the E-Z computation method to determine\nmargin for taxable entities whose total revenue is $20 million or less. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1016\n(E-Z computation method and rate for taxpayers with no more than $20 million in total revenue).\n       5\n         The following description of Gulf Copper’s business activities is derived from unchallenged\nfindings of fact made by the trial court and from testimony elicited at trial, which, unless otherwise\nindicated, is undisputed.\n       6\n         A marine classification society is a non-governmental organization that establishes and\nmaintains technical standards for the construction and operation of marine vessels. Steven Hale,\nGulf Copper’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, testified that the International Association of\n\n                                                  4\n\fand their operations;7 and (3) meet the requirements imposed by contracts entered into between\n\nexploration and production companies and the drilling rigs’ owners related to specific drilling\n\nprojects.8 The drilling rigs are delivered to Gulf Copper’s facility where Gulf Copper performs the\n\nwork to satisfy the requirements of the particular classification society certifying the drilling rig,\n\nthe other regulatory authorities involved, the drilling rig’s owner representative, and often a\n\nrepresentative from the exploration and production company for whose project the drilling will be\n\nperformed. Gulf Copper repairs rigs by removing defective portions, manufacturing replacement\n\ncomponents, and installing the replacement components on the rigs. Gulf Copper also manufactures\n\nand installs new components for rigs that do not replace an existing component.\n\n                Gulf Copper also owns all the outstanding shares of a subsidiary named Sabine\n\nSurveyors, a limited partnership primarily engaged in the business of marine vessel surveying. Hale\n\n\n\nClassification Societies promulgates rules and regulations that offshore drilling rigs have to meet\nto operate safely and in an environmentally sound manner. According to Hale, the classification\nstandards are met through a regimen of inspections and surveys on a prescribed, periodic basis to\nensure the integrity and safety of the vessel. That a rig meets classification rules and standards is of\ncritical importance to both an exploration and production company considering using a particular\nrig on its project and to the underwriter who insures the drilling rig.\n       7\n           Hale testified that offshore drilling rigs and their operations are subject to regulations\npromulgated by entities such as the United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency,\nthe International Maritime Organization, and the “Bureau of Offshore Environmental Management.”\nWe assume that the last reference was to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, one of three\nindependent entities created when the federal Minerals Management Service was reorganized in the\nwake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Bureau’s mission is “managing development of the\nnation’s offshore resources in an environmentally and economically responsible way.” See The\nReorganization of the Former MMS, BOEM.GOV, http://www.boem.gov/Reorganization/ (last visited\nJune 15, 2017).\n       8\n          Hale testified that individual wells have “different requirements relative to the equipment\non the rig.”\n\n                                                   5\n\ftestified that Sabine Surveyors inspects marine vessels, including offshore drilling rigs, and cargo.\n\nSurveys are also conducted after a drilling rig is involved in a collision with another vessel while it is\n\noffshore and the owner or underwriter requests an inspection to determine the extent of the damage.\n\nAccording to Hale, in certain circumstances Sabine Surveyors must “separate itself from” Gulf\n\nCopper’s shipyard activities because it might be deemed a conflict of interest for Sabine Surveyors\n\nto refer a job for which Sabine Surveyors represents the drilling rig’s underwriter to Gulf Copper.\n\nHale testified that Sabine Surveyors also prepares “desk appraisals” of drilling rigs for use by\n\nentities with a financial interest in a rig.\n\n\nGulf Copper’s Franchise-Tax Dispute\n\n                 The underlying tax protest concerns Gulf Copper’s 2009 franchise-tax report.\n\nGulf Copper excluded from its total gross revenue $79,405,230 in “flow-through” payments to\n\nsubcontractors, which, along with other exclusions amounting to $163,303,9 reduced its total\n\nrevenue from $173,875,422 to $94,306,889. Gulf Copper then elected to use the COGS deduction\n\nto calculate its margin, subtracting $70,396,219 from its total revenue to arrive at a margin of\n\n$23,910,670. Gulf Copper calculated its apportionment factor at 0.8808, application of which\n\nresulted in a taxable margin of $21,060,518. Accordingly, Gulf Copper reported a franchise-tax\n\nobligation of $210,605.18—1% of its taxable margin—which it timely paid in full.\n\n                 In claiming a revenue exclusion of $79,405,230, Gulf Copper relied on former section\n\n171.1011(g)(3) of the franchise-tax statute, which provided:\n\n\n\n\n        9\n            The Comptroller does not dispute that the $163,303 qualified for a revenue exclusion.\n\n                                                    6\n\f       A taxable entity shall exclude from its total revenue, to the extent [reported to the\n       federal IRS as income], only the following flow-through funds that are mandated by\n       contract to be distributed to other entities:\n\n       AAAA\n\n       (3) subcontracting payments handled by the taxable entity to provide services,\n       labor, or materials in connection with the actual or proposed design, construction,\n       remodeling, or repair of improvements on real property or the location of the\n       boundaries of real property.\n\n\nAct of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch.1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 10 (amended 2013)\n\n(“the (g)(3) revenue exclusion” or “former section 171.1011(g)(3)”). After conducting an audit,\n\nhowever, the Comptroller determined that the $79,405,230 in payments to subcontractors did not\n\nmeet the requirements for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. Instead, the Comptroller determined that\n\nthe subcontractor payments should be considered in the calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS\n\ndeduction. The Comptroller also audited the amount that Gulf Copper had calculated as its COGS\n\ndeduction and significantly pared down the expenses it believed could properly be included in the\n\nCOGS calculation. In essence, the Comptroller concluded that only costs either directly or indirectly\n\nrelated to “fabrication” of goods could properly be included in the calculation of Gulf Copper’s\n\nCOGS deduction.\n\n               After concluding its audit, the Comptroller determined that Gulf Copper had:\n\n(1) $163,303 in allowed revenue exclusions,10 and (2) a total COGS deduction of $77,140,769. As\n\na consequence of moving the subcontractor payments from the (g)(3) revenue exclusion, Gulf\n\n\n       10\n           This number is the difference between the total flow-through revenue exclusions Gulf\nCopper originally took minus the $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments the Comptroller\ndetermined were not properly excluded from revenue as qualifying flow-through funds under the\n(g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n                                                 7\n\fCopper’s apportionment factor increased from 0.8808 to 0.9353. The Comptroller thus calculated\n\nthat Gulf Copper had an additional franchise tax obligation for franchise-tax report year 2009 of\n\n$692,626.66. Gulf Copper paid the assessed deficiency plus interest (a total of $838,118.00) under\n\nprotest. See Tex. Tax Code § 112.051. Along with its protest payment, Gulf Copper submitted\n\na letter to the Comptroller outlining its reasons for claiming the (g)(3) revenue exclusion for\n\nsubcontractor payments and explaining its method of calculating its COGS deduction. Gulf Copper\n\nsubsequently filed the underlying lawsuit, seeking a refund of all amounts paid under protest. Gulf\n\nCopper maintained that it was entitled to take the (g)(3) revenue exclusion based on the nature of its\n\nbusiness activities and its contractual obligations to make the excluded payments to subcontractors\n\nwho were performing activities in connection with oil and gas well construction and improvement.\n\nGulf Copper asserted that the subcontractors were engaged in providing services, labor, and materials\n\nin the form of manufacturing, constructing, developing, improving, creating, and installing\n\ncomponent parts for offshore drilling rigs used to construct, remodel, or repair oil and gas wells,\n\nwhich it contended are improvements on real property. Gulf Copper claimed that the payments to\n\nits subcontractors satisfied the statutory prerequisites for claiming the (g)(3) revenue exclusion\n\nbecause (1) the payments were mandated by contract, (2) to be paid to an entity other than Gulf\n\nCopper (the taxable entity), and (3) the funds paid to the subcontractors were for the provision of\n\n“services, labor, or materials in connection with the actual or proposed . . . construction, remodeling,\n\nremediation, or repair of improvements on real property.” See id. § 171.1011(g)(3).11\n\n\n        11\n          Relatedly, Gulf Copper asserted that, by refusing to allow Gulf Copper to claim the\nsubcontractor payments as a revenue exclusion, the Comptroller had erroneously increased Gulf\nCopper’s apportionment factor from 0.8808 to 0.9353.\n\n                                                   8\n\f               Gulf Copper also asserted that the Comptroller had improperly limited the costs that\n\ncould be included in the calculation of its COGS deduction. Gulf Copper challenged the Comptroller’s\n\nconclusion that none of Gulf Copper’s expenses could be included in COGS pursuant to Texas\n\nTax Code subsection 171.1012(i). This subsection provides that “[a] taxable entity furnishing\n\nlabor or materials to a project for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial\n\nmaintenance [] of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may\n\ninclude the costs, as allowed by [section 171.1012], in the computation of cost of goods sold.” Id.\n\n§ 171.1012(i); see Hegar v. CGG Veritas Servs. (U.S.), Inc., No. 03-14-00713-CV, 2016 WL 1039054,\n\nat *3 (Tex. App.—Austin Mar. 9, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.) (taxable entity that provides “labor and\n\nmaterials” to project for the construction or improvement of real property, which includes oil and\n\ngas wells, is entitled to include costs of that labor and materials, as allowed by section 171.1012, in\n\ncomputation of its cost of goods sold and deduct that amount from its total revenue to calculate its\n\n“margin” for franchise-tax purposes); Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 54-57 (holding that, under Texas\n\nTax Code subsection 171.1012(i), certain labor expenses of subsidiary that does not itself produce\n\n“goods” but that does supply labor to projects for construction of real property improvements may\n\nbe included in combined entity’s COGS calculation, and that term “labor” in statute encompasses\n\nwide range of labor expenses, including those associated with activities that might also be described\n\nas “services”). The Comptroller had concluded that Gulf Copper did not have any expenses that\n\ncould be included in the calculation of the COGS deduction by virtue of being costs of labor or\n\nmaterials furnished to a project for construction or improvement of real property under section\n\n171.1012(i) and, consequently, it could only include in its COGS calculation the direct and some\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\findirect costs of acquiring or producing “goods.”12 See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(c), (d), (f). In\n\nthe Comptroller’s view, each of Gulf Copper’s facilities13 was engaged in both fabrication and non-\n\nfabrication activities and only the costs of labor and materials associated with the fabrication\n\nactivities were “costs of acquiring or producing goods” that could properly be included in calculating\n\nthe COGS deduction.\n\n               At trial, the evidence concerning Gulf Copper’s business operations was essentially\n\nundisputed. The parties joined issue, however, on whether the subcontractor payments qualified for\n\nthe (g)(3) revenue exclusion as payments made “to provide services, labor, or materials in connection\n\nwith the actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, remediation, or repair of improvements\n\non real property.” See id. § 171.1011(g)(3). The Comptroller took the position that the work the\n\nsubcontractors performed was “two steps away” from actual or proposed construction of\n\nimprovements on real property and therefore was too “remote or attenuated” from any actual or\n\nproposed construction to meet the “in connection with” requirement to qualify for the (g)(3) revenue\n\nexclusion. In the alternative, the Comptroller argued that if the subcontractor payments met the “in\n\nconnection with” requirement, only a portion of those payments ($32 million of the $79.4 million\n\ntotal) met the requirement that they be “mandated by contract” to be distributed to other entities. See\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          “Goods” are defined as “real or tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of\nbusiness of a taxable entity.” Tex Tax. Code § 171.1012(a)(1). “Tangible personal property” does\nnot include intangible property or services. Id. § 171.1012(a)(3)(B).\n       13\n          Gulf Copper’s facilities include yards in Galveston, Port Arthur, and Corpus Christi. Gulf\nCopper also owns Sabine Surveyors, which the Comptroller determined provided only services and\nthus did not incur any costs related to acquiring or producing goods that could be included in the\ncalculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction.\n\n                                                  10\n\fid. § 171.1011(g). The parties also continued to be in sharp disagreement about the correct method\n\nfor calculating Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction.\n\n               After a three day bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment in Gulf Copper’s favor\n\nand ordered the State to refund the entire amount paid under protest. The trial court also made the\n\nfollowing relevant findings of fact:\n\n\n       FOF 2: Sabine Surveyors is a limited partnership primarily engaged in the business\n       of marine vessel surveying.\n\n       FOF 9: Gulf Copper’s customers are primarily rig owners and drilling contractors\n       who use their offshore rigs to drill for oil and gas on behalf of exploration and\n       production (“E&P”) companies.\n\n       FOF 10: Gulf Copper is primarily engaged in the business of surveying,\n       manufacturing, upgrading, and repairing offshore drilling rigs.\n\n       FOF 12: Gulf Copper repairs rigs by removing defective portions, manufacturing\n       replacement components, and installing the replacement components onto the rigs.\n       Gulf Copper also manufactures and installs new components for rigs that do not\n       replace an existing component.\n\n       FOF 15: In completing its work, Gulf Copper utilizes all aspects and the entire\n       breadth of its facility yards, whether the rig sits on the dry docks, in the yard, or in\n       the water. This includes the lay down areas, the warehouses, the fabrication shops,\n       the welding areas, and the stacking areas.\n\n       FOF 16: Gulf Copper’s work enables the rigs (1) to meet and maintain the\n       certification requirements imposed by classification societies, (2) to comply with\n       governing regulations, and (3) to satisfy an exploration and production (“E&P”)\n       company’s contractual requirements for a specific drilling project.\n\n       FOF 17: A rig cannot be used for drilling unless it is properly certified, compliant,\n       and satisfies the contractual requirements for the project.\n\n       FOF 19: Rig owners do not hire Gulf Copper to repair or upgrade their rigs or\n       manufacture new components unless they have a revenue-generating contract in\n       place for the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells.\n\n                                                 11\n\f       FOF 20: Offshore drilling rigs are necessary and essential to the drilling of offshore\n       oil and gas wells because the wells could not be drilled without the drilling rigs.\n\n\nThe State then perfected this appeal. The State’s three appellate issues reduce to a challenge to the\n\ntrial court’s judgment on the grounds that (1) the trial court erroneously agreed that Gulf Copper\n\ncould exclude from its revenue the $79.4 million in subcontractor payments pursuant to the (g)(3)\n\nrevenue exclusion and (2) the trial court erred by concluding that Gulf Copper’s COGS calculation\n\nwas correct, leading to an oversized COGS deduction, regardless of whether the subcontractor\n\npayments were considered in the COGS calculation rather than excluded from revenue.\n\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\nEligibility of Subcontractor Payments for the (g)(3) Revenue Exclusion\n\n               The (g)(3) revenue exclusion requires that a taxpayer exclude from total revenue\n\ncertain flow-through funds “that are mandated by contract to be distributed to other entities.”14\n\nDuring franchise tax year 2009, Gulf Copper used subcontractors to perform a significant portion\n\nof the work it did for its customers. There were essentially two types of subcontractors working for\n\n\n       14\n           Effective January 1, 2014, section 171.1011(g)(3) was amended to require the exclusion\nof “flow-through funds that are mandated by contract or subcontract to be distributed to other\nentities” and that are “subcontracting payments made under a contract or subcontract entered\ninto by the taxable entity to provide services, labor, or materials in connection with the actual or\nproposed design, construction, remodeling, remediation, or repair of improvements on real property\nor the location of the boundaries of real property.” Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g)(3) (emphases\nadded). The bill analysis for this enactment indicates that the amendment was proposed in response\nto the Comptroller’s interpretation of section 171.1011(g)(3) as “allowing an entity to exclude\nsubcontracting payments only when the entity has a contract in place that states that a specific\nportion of the work will be subcontracted” because the Comptroller’s interpretation was not\nconsistent with the practices of the affected industry. Senate Research Ctr., Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B.\n2766, 83d Leg., R.S. 2013.\n\n                                                 12\n\fGulf Copper. First, there were “labor” subcontractors that provided workers who performed the\n\nsame types of tasks performed by Gulf Copper’s employees. Hale testified that Gulf Copper used\n\na significant number of workers provided by “labor” subcontractors in franchise tax year 2009\n\nbecause there was both (1) an increased volume of work due to increased offshore drilling activity\n\nand (2) displacement of a portion of Gulf Copper’s regular workforce caused by hurricanes in the\n\narea. According to Hale, Gulf Copper was required to look outside its geographical region and\n\nlocate subcontractors who could provide welders, fitters, and other workers to work alongside\n\nGulf Copper’s employees. The “labor” subcontractors charged Gulf Copper a rate of $35 to $38\n\nper hour per worker.15 Gulf Copper in turn billed its customers for work performed by the “labor”\n\nsubcontractors’ workers at a rate of $54 per hour per worker. Gulf Copper included as “flow-through\n\nfunds” in its (g)(3) revenue exclusion only the $35 to $38 per hour per worker it paid the “labor”\n\nsubcontractor supplying the workers. The remaining $16 to $19 per hour Gulf Copper received\n\nfrom its customers for work done by workers provided by the “labor” subcontractors was not\n\nincluded in the (g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n                The second type of subcontractor was “outside specialty” subcontractors hired to\n\nprovide workers to perform certain specialized tasks such as finishing out the accommodations on\n\na rig or doing electrical work. The “outside specialty” subcontractors were, at times, designated to\n\nbe used for certain tasks by the customers, who had preexisting relationships with those subcontractors.\n\nGulf Copper charged its customers for the work done by the “outside specialty” subcontractors an\n\namount 15 to 20 percent greater than the amount the “outside specialty” subcontractor charged\n\n\n       15\n         The record does not reflect what portion of the hourly rate that the “labor” subcontractors\ncharged Gulf Copper for its workers was ultimately paid to the workers themselves.\n\n                                                  13\n\fGulf Copper. Gulf Copper included as “flow-through funds” in its (g)(3) revenue exclusion only\n\nthe amount it paid to the “outside specialty” subcontractor and did not include the additional revenue\n\nit received from its customers as a result of the 15 to 20 percent upcharge.\n\n               On appeal the State agrees, as it did at trial, that the amounts paid to the “outside\n\nspecialty” subcontractors constitute flow-through funds mandated by contract to be distributed to\n\nother entities and may be included in the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. With respect to payments to the\n\n“labor” subcontractors, however, the State maintains that because Gulf Copper’s contracts with its\n\ncustomers do not “mandate that their payments flow through Gulf Copper to the subcontractors\n\nproviding the regular labor” those payments do not qualify for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n               The State’s position is contrary to the plain language of the statute and to this Court’s\n\nprevious holding in Titan Transportation. The statute requires Gulf Copper to exclude from its total\n\nrevenue calculation certain flow-through funds that were mandated by contract to be distributed to\n\nother entities. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g). As this Court held in Titan Transportation, the\n\n“mandate” may be contained in either a contract with the customer or in a contract with the\n\nsubcontractor. See Titan Transp., 433 S.W.3d at 641. An agreement between Gulf Copper and a\n\n“labor” subcontractor constitutes a contract. The evidence and exhibits admitted at trial, including\n\ncontracts with the “labor” subcontractors who supplied the individuals performing the regular\n\nlabor, establish that Gulf Copper was obligated by those contracts to pay the “labor” subcontractors\n\nfor that labor.16 Thus, Gulf Copper was contractually obligated to pass on to the “labor”\n\n\n       16\n          For example, Gulf Copper’s Master Service Agreement with Maxum Industries, LLC, a\n“labor” subcontractor, contains the following provision:\n\n       [Gulf Copper] shall pay [Maxum Industries, LLC], subject to [Gulf Copper’s]\n\n                                                  14\n\fsubcontractors—other entities of the type referenced in the statute—a fixed portion of the customer’s\n\n$54 per hour per worker payment, typically between $35 and $38 per hour per worker. Gulf Copper’s\n\ncontracts with its “labor” subcontractors satisfy “the statutory requirement that qualifying payments\n\nbe contractually mandated to someone other than the taxpayer.” Id.17\n\n               The Comptroller also maintains that the $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments\n\ndo not qualify for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion because the work done in exchange for those\n\npayments was too remote or attenuated to constitute the provision of “services, labor, or materials\n\nin connection with the actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, remediation, or repair\n\nof improvements on real property.” Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g)(3). Specifically, the Comptroller\n\nargues that, although Gulf Copper’s work on the rigs adds value to the rigs, that work does not itself\n\nadd value to any actual or proposed construction of oil wells, which it concedes are improvements\n\non real property. The Comptroller points out that Gulf Copper does not have contracts with and is\n\nnot liable to the exploration and production companies that actually drill the oil wells and does not\n\n\n\n       verification that [Maxum Industries, LLC] has complied with all terms and conditions\n       of this Agreement and any applicable Purchase Order. In the event [Gulf Copper]\n       should dispute any part of an invoice, undisputed portions thereof shall be paid;\n       and upon resolution of all disputed items, a supplemental invoice will be submitted\n       to [Gulf Copper] for payment.\n\nAn email exchange between principals from Gulf Copper and Maxum Industries, LLC provides the\nhourly rates Gulf Copper was to pay for welders, fitters, superintendents, and leadmen, ranging from\n$36.50 to $37.50 per hour.\n       17\n           As this Court noted in Titan Transportation, “an evident purpose of the (g)(3) revenue\nexclusion is to prevent double taxation of funds that are not truly gain or income to the taxpayer.”\nTitan Transp., LP v. Combs, 433 S.W.3d 625, 641 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, pet. denied). That\npurpose is served when, as here, the taxpayer excludes from its revenue the portion of payments\nreceived that it must pass on to another entity.\n\n                                                 15\n\fperform any work on the oil wells themselves. According to the Comptroller, the fact that Gulf\n\nCopper is “two steps removed” from the construction of the improvement on real property itself (the\n\noil well) precludes it from falling within the “logical limit” the Legislature intended to impose on\n\nthe phrase “in connection with” used in the statute.\n\n               This Court has previously described the phrase “in connection with” as one “of\n\nintentional breadth,” but not without “logical limit.” Titan Transp., 433 S.W.3d at 637. The Court\n\ndelineated the contours of the “in connection with” requirement as follows:\n\n\n       As used in former section 171.1011(g)(3), the phrase “in connection with” can only\n       be read as requiring some reasonable nexus between the services, labor, and materials\n       for which the taxpayer pays a subcontractor and “the actual or proposed design,\n       construction, remodeling, or repair of improvements on real property or the location\n       of boundaries of real property.” [] Given its context, the only plausible interpretation\n       of the “in connection with” language employed in the (g)(3) revenue exclusion is that\n       there must be a reasonable—i.e., more than tangential or incidental—relationship\n       between the activities delineated in the statute and the services, labor, or materials\n       for which the subcontractors receive payment. . . . The critical inquiry [] is whether\n       the services, labor, or materials provided have a reasonable connection to\n       construction, remodeling, design, or repair work on real property.\n\n\nId. at 638-39. The inquiry, then, is whether the activities performed by the subcontractors for Gulf\n\nCopper have a reasonable connection to the construction of oil wells, which we have held, and the\n\nparties do not dispute, are improvements on real property. See Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 53\n\n(drilling of oil and gas well is “project for construction and improvement of real property”).\n\n               The evidence at trial showed that the workers supplied to Gulf Copper by the “labor”\n\nsubcontractors performed essentially the same activities as Gulf Copper’s employees in its\n\nyards. Thus, those workers were engaged in activities that resulted in the offshore drilling rigs’\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f(1) obtaining and maintaining the certification requirements imposed by marine classification\n\nsocieties, (2) complying with regulations, both state and federal, applicable to offshore drilling rigs\n\nand their operations, and (3) meeting the requirements imposed by contracts entered into between\n\nexploration and production companies and the drilling rigs’ owners related to specific drilling\n\nprojects. In our view, it is evident that doing work on offshore drilling rigs—equipment that is\n\nundisputedly integral to drilling offshore wells—that renders them able to perform the drilling\n\nservices required to drill a particular oil well is an activity that is reasonably connected to the\n\nconstruction of that oil well. Thus, at least part of the work done by the subcontractors plainly meets\n\nthe (g)(3) revenue exclusion’s requirement that it be “in connection with” construction of an\n\nimprovement on real property.\n\n               Whether performing work that makes a rig compliant with general requirements\n\nimposed by marine classification societies or with state and federal regulations generally applicable\n\nto offshore drilling rigs and their operations presents a closer question. Arguably, readying an\n\noffshore drilling rig for use on offshore drilling projects generally might not be sufficiently related\n\nto the “actual or proposed” construction of an improvement to real property to meet the (g)(3)\n\nrevenue exclusion requirement. Likewise, it could be argued that a drilling rig’s compliance with\n\nrules and regulations that permit it to operate offshore generally is incidental or tangential to the\n\n“actual or proposed” construction of a particular offshore well. We need not, however, address\n\nsuch arguments here because the Comptroller’s position is that all subcontractor payments were\n\nfor work too attenuated to qualify for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion by virtue of the work being\n\n“two steps” away from the actual drilling of oil wells. The State made no distinctions among the\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fsubcontractors’ various activities but rather took the position that, as a matter of law, Gulf Copper\n\nwas not entitled to take the (g)(3) revenue exclusion at all. Thus, the State has failed to preserve the\n\nargument that while Gulf Copper may have been permitted to claim a (g)(3) revenue exclusion for\n\nsome of its subcontractor payments, other subcontractor payments were for work too attenuated to\n\nan actual or proposed project to qualify. On this record, there is sufficient evidence to support the\n\ntrial court’s conclusion that Gulf Copper was entitled to include the $79,405,230 in payments to\n\nsubcontractors as flow-through funds falling within the (g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n                Having concluded that the subcontractor payments qualified for the (g)(3) revenue\n\nexclusion, we turn now to Gulf Copper’s calculation of its COGS deduction to determine whether\n\nthe trial court’s finding that Gulf Copper was entitled to claim a COGS deduction of $72,711,734\n\nwhen calculating its margin for franchise tax purposes was supported by factually sufficient evidence.\n\n\nGulf Copper’s Calculation of the COGS Deduction\n\n                The COGS deduction is calculated in accordance with Texas Tax Code section\n\n171.1012. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012 (determination of cost of goods sold). Section 171.1012\n\ndefines “goods” to mean “real or tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of business\n\nof a taxable entity” and provides that “tangible personal property” does not include services. Id.\n\n§171.1012(a)(1), (3)(B)(iii). Section 171.1012 provides that an entity may take a COGS deduction\n\nfor “all direct costs of acquiring or producing the goods,” including labor costs, “costs of materials\n\nthat are an integral part of” the goods, “handling costs, including costs attributable to processing,\n\nassembling, repackaging, and inbound transportation costs,” storage costs, and costs of renting,\n\nleasing, maintaining, and repairing equipment, facilities, or real property directly used for production\n\n                                                  18\n\fof the goods. Id. § 171.1012(c).18 A taxable entity may also take a COGS deduction for post-\n\nproduction direct costs, including storage and handling provided for by subsection (c), and for\n\nindirect or administrative overhead costs allocable to the acquisition or production of goods, up to\n\nfour percent of the entity’s total indirect or administrative overhead costs. Id. § 171.1012(d), (f).19\n\nSpecifically excluded from COGS eligibility are the cost of renting or leasing equipment, facilities,\n\nor real property not used for the production of “goods,” “selling costs, including employee expenses\n\nrelated to sales,” “distribution costs, including outbound transportation costs,” and rehandling costs.\n\nId. § 171.1012(e). Also excluded are advertising costs, idle facility expenses, bidding costs, interest,\n\nincome taxes, strike expenses, officer compensation, and compensation paid to undocumented\n\nworkers. Id.\n\n                A COGS deduction is generally available only to the taxable entity that owns\n\nthe “goods” in question. Id. § 171.1012(i). The Legislature has, however, “extended access to the\n\ndeduction in limited circumstances.” See Hegar v. Sunstate Equip. Co., No. 03-15-00738-CV,\n\n\n\n       18\n           Subsection (c) also includes the cost of materials consumed in producing the goods;\ndepreciation, depletion, and amortization associated with and necessary to the production of the\ngoods; research and design activities directly related to the production of the goods; geophysical\ncosts to locate mineral-producing property; taxes paid for materials or services that are direct\nproduction costs; the cost of producing or acquiring electricity sold; and “a contribution to a\npartnership in which the taxable entity owns an interest that is used to fund activities, the costs of\nwhich would otherwise be treated as cost of goods sold of the partnership, but only to the extent that\nthose costs are related to goods distributed to the taxable entity as goods-in-kind in the ordinary\ncourse of production activities rather than being sold.” Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(c).\n       19\n          Subsection (d) also includes insurance for facilities or equipment directly used to produce\nthe goods; insurance on the produced goods; deterioration, obsolescence, spoilage, and abandonment\nof the goods; pre-production direct costs for property held for future production, including storage\nand handling provided for by subsection (c); utilities directly used in producing the goods; quality\ncontrol costs; and licensing or franchise costs. Id. § 171.1012(d).\n\n                                                  19\n\f2017 WL 279602, at *3 (Tex. App.—Austin Jan. 20, 2017, pet. filed) (mem. op.). Relevant to this\n\ncase is that “an entity furnishing labor or materials to a project for the construction, improvement,\n\nremodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance . . . of real property is considered to be an owner of that\n\nlabor and materials and may include the costs, as allowed by [section 171.1012], in the cost of goods\n\nsold.” Id. “The analytic framework for determining whether a particular ‘labor cost’ is includable\n\nas a cost of goods sold under subsection 171.1012(i) [] requires determining whether the particular\n\nactivity is an essential and direct component of the ‘project for the construction . . . of real property.’”\n\nCGG Veritas, 2016 WL 1039054, at *3 (citing Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 56). This Court adopted\n\nthis analytic framework to address the circumstance that (1) the terms “labor” and “service” are not\n\ndefined in the statute, (2) “services” are specifically excluded from the definition of “tangible\n\npersonal property,” (3) “labor” and “services” are not mutually exclusive, and (4) certain labor\n\nexpenses associated with activities that might also be described as a “service” fall within the wide\n\nrange of labor expenses that section 171.1012(i) permits a taxable entity that furnishes labor to a\n\nproject for construction or improvement of real property to deduct. See Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at\n\n55-57; see also CGG Veritas, 2016 WL 1039054, at *3. Thus, provided the activity is “an essential\n\nand direct component” of the project for construction or improvement of real property, the associated\n\ncosts may, through application of subsection 171.1012(i), be included in the COGS deduction even\n\nif the activity might be in the nature of a “service.” See Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 56 (trial court\n\ncould reasonably have concluded that removal and disposal of waste material was labor furnished\n\nto project for construction of oil and gas well based on trial testimony that this activity was essential\n\nto continue drilling of oil and gas well).\n\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f               In calculating its COGS deduction, Gulf Copper did not engage in a cost-by-cost\n\nanalysis of each expense to determine whether it fit into one of the categories of costs the statute\n\nprovides may properly be included in the calculation of cost of goods sold, see Tex. Tax Code\n\n§ 171.1012(c), (d), (f), nor did it employ the analytic framework described above to determine\n\nwhether its particular activities that involved furnishing labor to a project for construction or\n\nimprovement of real property (as opposed to its activities that produced “goods”) were “an essential\n\nand direct component” of a particular project, see id. § 171.1012(i). Rather, Gulf Copper took the\n\nposition that it is a taxable entity “eligible” to take a COGS deduction both because it is the owner\n\nof goods (i.e., tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of its business) and because it\n\nfurnishes labor and materials for the construction or improvement of real property. Then, relying\n\non subsection 171.1012(h), which provides that “[a] taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods\n\nsold, except as otherwise provided by this section, in accordance with the methods used on the\n\nfederal income tax return on which the report under this chapter is based,” id. § 171.1012(h),\n\nGulf Copper used as a “starting point” for its COGS calculation the trial balance (a summary of\n\nall transactions for the accounting year) that it used to prepare its federal income tax return. Gulf\n\nCopper explained: “When Gulf Copper applied its federal income tax methods to its transactional\n\ndata (revenues generated and costs incurred), the result represented Gulf Copper’s COGS for federal\n\nincome tax purposes. [] For federal income tax purposes, Gulf Copper qualifies a [sic] producer of\n\ngoods and, thus, must calculate its federal COGS pursuant to the accounting method imposed\n\nby Internal Revenue Code Section 236A.”20 From the dollar amount of the COGS deduction it\n\n\n       20\n           Gulf Copper states that “it appears our Legislature used the corresponding treasury\nregulation (C.F.R. § 1.236A-1) as an outline to draft the COGS statute.”\n\n                                                 21\n\fcalculated for federal income tax purposes, Gulf Copper excluded costs that it determined constituted\n\ncosts expressly excluded from the state COGS deduction by subsections 171.1012(e) and (f). Id.\n\n§ 171.1012(e) (list of costs in relation to taxable entity’s goods that may not be included in COGS\n\ncalculation); (f) (taxable entity may include only four percent of taxable entity’s total indirect or\n\nadministrative overhead costs in COGS calculation). Gulf Copper stated that it:\n\n\n        did not parse the costs associated with its integrated business activities because doing\n        so would violate (1) its federal income tax methods; (2) the economic realities of\n        Gulf Copper’s business (i.e., it takes all of the activities and their associated costs to\n        generate the taxable revenue); (3) its accounting system (which captures a host of\n        financial data necessary to operate the business but does not segregate its single\n        integrated activity–rig repair–and its costs into component steps; (4) its combined\n        group status; and (5) the Legislature’s goal of taxing margin (because diluting Gulf\n        Copper’s ability to deduct its costs generates a tax on revenue).\n\n\nThus, Gulf Copper’s failure to examine, on an item-by-item basis, whether a cost could properly be\n\nincluded in the COGS calculation under the Texas Tax Code was based on (1) its belief that it was\n\nrequired by section 171.1012(h) to start with its federal COGS calculation and (2) the logistical\n\ndifficulties, given its business model and its accounting systems, of performing that task.\n\n                We first consider whether Texas Tax Code subsection 171.1012(h) directs a taxable\n\nentity to use its federal income tax COGS deduction as the starting point for its calculation of the\n\nTexas franchise tax COGS deduction.21 Texas Tax Code subsection 171.1012(h) provides:\n\n\n        21\n            This presents a question of statutory construction that we review de novo. See State v.\nShumake, 199 S.W.3d 279, 284 (Tex. 2006). Our primary objective in construing statutes is to give\neffect to the Legislature’s intent and, ordinarily, “‘the truest manifestation’ of what lawmakers intended\nis what they enacted.” First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Combs, 258 S.W.3d 627, 632 (Tex. 2008) (quoting\nAlex Sheshunoff Mgmt. Servs. L.P. v. Johnson, 209 S.W.3d 644, 651-52 (Tex. 2006)). The language\nemerging from the legislative process “constitutes the law, and when a statute’s words are\n\n                                                   22\n\f       A taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods sold, except as otherwise provided\n       by [section 171.1012], in accordance with the methods used on the federal income\n       tax return on which the report under this chapter is based. This subsection does not\n       affect the type or category of cost of goods sold that may be subtracted under [section\n       171.1012].\n\n\nTex. Tax Code § 171.1012(h). Contrary to Gulf Copper’s assertion, this provision does not constitute\n\na directive to use the amount of the taxable entity’s federal income tax COGS deduction as a starting\n\npoint for calculating its state franchise tax COGS deduction and to thereby avoid considering\n\nwhether each particular cost corresponds to a subtraction from total revenue permitted by section\n\n171.1012. The text of this subsection plainly states that it “does not affect the type or category of\n\ncost of goods sold that may be subtracted” under section 171.1012. Id. (emphasis added).\n\n               Thus, the plain language of subsection (h) confirms that a taxable entity is permitted\n\nto include in the calculation of its COGS deduction only the types of expenses outlined in\n\nsubsections 171.1012(c), (d), and (f). Indeed, these subsections are prefaced by subsection (b),\n\nwhich expressly provides that “a taxable entity that elects to subtract cost of goods sold for the\n\npurpose of computing its taxable margin shall determine the amount of that cost of goods sold as\n\n\n\nunambiguous and yield but one interpretation, ‘the judge’s inquiry is at an end.’” Combs v. Roark\nAmusement & Vending, L.P., 422 S.W.3d 632, 635 (Tex. 2013) (quoting Johnson, 209 S.W.3d\nat 651-52)). We give an unambiguous statute its plain meaning without resorting to rules of\nconstruction or extrinsic aids. Id.; see also Texas Lottery Comm’n v. First State Bank of DeQueen,\n325 S.W.3d 628, 635, 637 (Tex. 2010) (branding such reliance “improper” because “[w]hen a\nstatute’s language is clear and unambiguous, it is inappropriate to resort to rules of construction or\nextrinsic aids to construe the language”). Rules of construction such as agency deference and strict\nconstruction of tax statutes against the taxing authority are employed only when a statute is ambiguous.\nSee TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Commission on State Emergency Commc’ns, 397 S.W.3d 173, 182\n(Tex. 2013) (“The reach of an ambiguous tax statute must be construed “strictly against the taxing\nauthority and liberally for the taxpayer.” (emphasis added) (quoting Morris v. Houston Indep. Sch.\nDist., 388 S.W.3d 310, 313 (Tex. 2012) (per curiam))).\n\n                                                  23\n\fprovided by this section.” Id. § 171.1012(b) (emphases added). If the Legislature intended for a\n\ntaxable entity to calculate its state franchise tax COGS deduction by simply subtracting certain\n\nexpenses from its federal income tax COGS deduction it would not have needed to include the\n\ndetailed and extensive description of the costs eligible for inclusion in the state COGS deduction\n\nthat are found in subsections 171.1012(c), (d), and (f). See id. § 171.1012(c), (d), (f). Gulf Copper’s\n\ninterpretation of subsection (h) would essentially render subsections (c) and (d) superfluous. While\n\nGulf Copper’s interpretation of subsection (h) may have appeal when that subsection is viewed in\n\nisolation, well settled rules of statutory interpretation require us to “examine the entire act to glean\n\nits meaning” and “to presume that ‘the entire statute is intended to be effective.’” Meritor Auto., Inc.\n\nv. Ruan Leasing Co., 44 S.W.3d 86, 90 (Tex. 2001) (quoting Tex. Gov’t Code § 311.021(2)). And\n\nwe may not interpret a statute in a way that renders any part of it meaningless. Crosstex Energy\n\nServs., L.P. v. Pro Plus, Inc., 430 S.W.3d 384, 390 (Tex. 2014).\n\n               Under well established rules of statutory interpretation, the proper interpretation of\n\nsubsection 171.1012(h) is that it speaks to the specific accounting methods the taxable entity uses\n\nin determining the amount of its cost of goods sold and mandates that the taxable entity use the same\n\naccounting method it used when preparing its federal tax return.22 A review of the statute as a whole\n\n\n       22\n           An entity’s chosen accounting method dictates how the entity’s transactions are recorded\nin its financial books. For example, an entity using the cash-basis accounting method records its\nexpenses in its accounts when it actually pays the cash and books revenues when it actually receives\npayment. An entity using the accrual accounting method records revenue when the transaction is\ncompleted—e.g., when the work specified in a contract between the entity and its customer is\ncompleted—instead of when it actually receives payment. The entity handles expenses in the same\nmanner by recording them when they have been incurred rather than when payment is actually made.\nSee E. McGruder Faris, Jr., Accounting for Lawyers 75-84 (3d ed. 1975). The cash method and the\naccrual method are two of the methods a taxpayer may use to compute its taxable income for federal\n\n                                                  24\n\fconfirms this conclusion. Subsection 171.1012(b) requires that a taxable entity that elects to subtract\n\ncost of goods sold for the purpose of computing its taxable margin “determine the amount of that\n\ncost of goods sold as provided by [section 171.1012],” whereas subsection (h) requires that a taxable\n\nentity “determine its cost of goods sold [] in accordance with the methods used on the federal income\n\ntax return.” Cf. Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(b), with id. § 171.1012(h). Thus, subsection 171.1012(b)\n\naddresses how to calculate the amount of the COGS deduction while subsection (h) clarifies that\n\nthe taxable entity must use the same accounting method—either cash basis or accrual—when\n\ndetermining whether a particular COGS-deduction-eligible expense should be included in that tax\n\nyear’s COGS calculation.23\n\n               We also observe that by using its federal income tax COGS deduction as the “starting\n\npoint,” Gulf Copper offered insufficient evidence that the expenses included in that calculation\n\nactually correspond to the types and categories of expenses permitted to be included in the\n\ncalculation of a taxable entity’s state franchise tax COGS deduction pursuant to section 171.1012.\n\nTo the extent the federal COGS calculation includes expenses that are not eligible for the state\n\nCOGS deduction, such as costs that do not qualify under the state statute as direct costs of “acquiring\n\n\n\ntax purposes. See 26 U.S.C. § 446(c) (taxpayer may compute taxable income under cash receipts and\ndisbursement method, accrual method, any other method permitted by statute, or any combination\nof foregoing methods permitted under regulations prescribed by Secretary of Treasury).\n       23\n           The main difference between accrual and cash basis accounting is the timing of when\nrevenue and expenses are recognized. Under the cash method, the taxable entity generally deducts\nexpenses in the tax year in which it actually paid them. Under the accrual method, expenses may\nbe deducted when they are incurred. See 26 C.F.R. § 1.466-1 (general rule for methods of\naccounting). Thus, an expense that might be recognized and included in the COGS deduction\ncalculation in a particular tax year when using the accrual accounting method might not qualify for\ninclusion in the same tax year when using the cash basis accounting method.\n\n                                                  25\n\for producing” the “goods,” the result of using that calculation as a starting point is the overinclusion\n\nof expenses in the calculation of the COGS deduction for state franchise tax purposes. Gulf Copper’s\n\nmethod for calculating its state COGS deduction fails to provide evidence that the expenses included\n\nin its starting point (the federal COGS deduction) are deductions that are also permitted to be\n\nincluded in the calculation of the COGS deduction under the state statute.\n\n                Also unpersuasive is Gulf Copper’s argument that its interpretation permits it to\n\navoid the “incredibly burdensome” task of identifying which of the expenses of its integrated business\n\nactivities actually constitute a cost of “acquiring or producing” a “good” such that it is eligible to be\n\nincluded in the calculation of its COGS deduction. Our interpretation of the Texas Tax Code is\n\nnot guided by the accounting systems used by taxable entities. Cf. Combs v. Roark Amusement &\n\nVending, L.P., 422 S.W.3d 632, 637 (Tex. 2013) (statutory determinations in tax disputes should\n\nreflect economic realities of transactions at issue). The supreme court has explained that it has never\n\nsuggested that, “in the guise of considering the economic realities or essence of the transaction,\n\ncourts were authorized to impose an entirely new requirement” that is not found in the language of\n\nthe tax statute. Combs v. Health Care Servs. Corp., 401 S.W.3d 623, 627 n.8 (Tex. 2013). Rather,\n\nwe must take the Legislature “at its word and giv[e] the statute its plain meaning.” Id. at 627. A\n\ntaxable entity is offered three alternative methods for determining its margin under the Texas franchise\n\ntax statute: (1) 70% of total revenue from the entity’s total business; (2) subtracting from total\n\nrevenue the costs of goods sold as determined under section 171.1012; or (3) subtracting from total\n\nrevenue compensation as determined under section 171.1013. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.101(a).\n\nGulf Copper’s choice was to subtract from its calculation of total revenue its COGS deduction. The\n\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fburden on Gulf Copper of calculating the proper amount of that deduction may be an indication that\n\none of the different methods of determining its taxable margin is the better choice. The burden on\n\nthe entity making the calculation cannot dictate the applicability or the amount of the deduction\n\nallowed; we must enforce the statute as written.\n\n                The plain language of section 171.1012 confirms that calculating the COGS deduction\n\nfor Texas franchise tax purposes requires a cost-by-cost analysis to determine whether the cost fits\n\none of the types and categories eligible for inclusion in the calculation. “[T]he Cost of Goods Sold\n\nincludes ‘all direct costs of acquiring or producing goods,’ some indirect costs like insurance, utilities,\n\nand quality control, and up to 4% of other ‘indirect or administrative overhead costs.’” In re Nestle\n\nUSA, 387 S.W.3d at 615 (citations omitted). Because Gulf Copper’s calculation of its COGS\n\ndeduction did not conform to the statute, we reverse the trial court’s finding that for report year\n\n2009, Gulf Copper incurred expenses eligible to be included in the cost of goods sold subtraction\n\nin the amount of $152,116,96424 as lacking factually sufficient evidentiary support.25 We also\n\nreverse the finding that “[t]he categories, classifications, locations and amounts of the costs eligible\n\nto be included in the cost of goods subtraction are accurately stated in Exhibit 56.”\n\n\n\n\n        24\n           This number assumes that the subcontractor payments are not excluded from total revenue\nbut, instead, are included in the COGS deduction.\n        25\n          Although the State did not frame its appellate issue as a factual sufficiency challenge, the\nComptroller has acknowledged that Gulf Copper is entitled to take a COGS deduction of some\namount. The State requested that, in the event this Court does not accept the Comptroller’s method\nof calculating Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction, we remand the case to the trial court for further\nproceedings to determine Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction by application of a proper interpretation\nof section 171.1012 to the evidence before the trial court.\n\n                                                    27\n\f                Our analysis of the COGS deduction issue does not end here, however, because the\n\nState likewise presented the trial court with a flawed view of what qualifies for inclusion in Gulf\n\nCopper’s calculation of its COGS deduction, as explained below.\n\n\nThe Comptroller’s Calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS Deduction\n\n                The Comptroller performed its own calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction\n\nas follows. First, the Comptroller determined that Gulf Copper had no expenses that qualified for\n\nthe COGS deduction by virtue of subsection 171.1012(i). That is, it concluded that none of Gulf\n\nCopper’s costs were associated with labor and materials “furnished to a project for the construction,\n\nimprovement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance of real property.” See Tex. Tax Code\n\n§ 171.1012(i). Thus, the Comptroller did not consider whether any of Gulf Copper’s costs were for\n\nlabor and materials furnished to a qualifying project or were associated with activities that might\n\notherwise be viewed as “services” but might nevertheless be eligible for inclusion in the COGS\n\ndeduction calculation because they were an “essential and direct component of the ‘project for\n\nconstruction . . . of real property.’” See id.; CGG Veritas, 2016 WL 1039054, at *3; Newpark Res.,\n\n422 S.W.3d at 56. Next, the Comptroller determined that only activities involving “fabrication” of\n\nitems sold to Gulf Copper’s customers should be included in the COGS calculation. Because Gulf\n\nCopper’s accounting records did not differentiate between the costs of what the Comptroller deemed\n\nto be “fabrication” and what it deemed to be simply “installation” or other non-production related\n\nactivities,26 the Comptroller decided to use Gulf Copper’s labor records as a proxy for all of its costs\n\n\n       26\n         The Legislature recently amended the definition of “production” contained in Texas Tax\nCode section 171.1012(a). See Act of May 19, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., ch. 377, § 1, 2017 Tex.\n\n                                                  28\n\fand asked Gulf Copper to review its labor costs to come up with a percentage to apply to each of\n\nGulf Copper’s facilities that would represent the percentage of its costs that were related to\n\n“fabrication.” The Comptroller assigned the following percentages for each of Gulf Copper’s\n\nfacilities: (1) 50% at Port Arthur, (2) 50% at Galveston, and (3) 5% at Corpus Christi. The\n\nComptroller then reviewed each type of Gulf Copper’s expenses for each facility and, if the\n\nComptroller concluded that the type of expense was one that was generally eligible for inclusion in\n\nthe COGS calculation it allowed it on the percentage basis assigned to the facility where the activity\n\ngenerating the expense occurred. For example, the Comptroller allowed 50% of the labor costs\n\nassociated with the Port Arthur facility because labor is identified in subsection 171.1012(c) as a cost\n\nof goods sold, but only to the extent it is a direct cost of acquiring or producing a good. Having\n\ndetermined that 50% of the Port Arthur yard activities were “fabrication,” the Comptroller\n\ndetermined that 50% of the labor costs at that facility were a direct cost of producing a good. The\n\nComptroller analyzed all of Gulf Copper’s expenses in this general manner unless it was apparent\n\nthat the expense was entirely related to producing goods, such as cost of materials. The Comptroller\n\n\n\n\nSess. Law Serv. ch. 377 (to be codified as an amendment to Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(a)(2)).\nThe amendment provides that, effective September 1, 2017, “‘production’ means construction,\nmanufacture, development, mining, extraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth.” Id. The\npre-amendment definition provides that production “includes construction, installation, manufacture,\ndevelopment, mining, extraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth.” The amended version\nreplaces the word “includes” with the word “means” and eliminates “installation” from the\ndefinition of “production.” The Legislature’s note to the amendment states that the amendment “is\na clarification of existing law and does not imply that Section 171.1012, Tax Code, before the\namendment made by this Act may be construed as inconsistent with Section 171.1012, Tax\nCode, as amended by this Act.” Act of May 19, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., ch. 377, § 2, 2107 Tex. Sess.\nLaw Serv. ch. 377.\n\n                                                  29\n\fdid not allow any of the costs incurred by Sabine Surveyors because it determined that this entity\n\nperformed only services.27\n\n               The trial court concluded that “[t]he limitations imposed by the Comptroller upon\n\nGulf Copper’s cost of goods sold calculation violate Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012.” We agree. The\n\nComptroller’s calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction is inconsonant with section 171.1012\n\nin two ways. First, we do not agree with the Comptroller that none of Gulf Copper’s expenses\n\nqualify for inclusion in its COGS calculation by virtue of subsection 171.1012(i). For example, Gulf\n\nCopper presented evidence at trial that, to some extent, Gulf Copper’s employees provided labor\n\nand materials to projects for improvement of real property (drilling oil wells). The Comptroller was\n\nobligated to consider to what extent the activities of Gulf Copper’s employees were essential and\n\ndirect components of those specific projects. See CGG Veritas, 2016 WL 1039054, at *3. Sabine\n\nSurveyors also performed activities that, while constituting activities that might be described as a\n\n“service,” are an “essential and direct component” of a project for construction of real property.\n\nSuch activities include conducting surveys of rigs in order to ensure compliance with requirements\n\nspecific to a particular drilling project. Other of Sabine Surveyors’ activities, such as performing\n\nvessel surveys for underwriters, might be so attenuated that the costs of those activities would not\n\nconstitute the cost of furnishing labor and materials to a project. Sabine Surveyors’ costs should\n\nhave been analyzed on a cost-by-cost basis to determine which of those costs met the requirement\n\nthat they be integral, essential, and direct components of the offshore drilling process and which\n\n\n       27\n          Implicit in the 0% assigned to Sabine Surveyors is the Comptroller’s determination that\nnone of its costs could be included in Gulf Copper’s COGS calculation by virtue of subsection\n171.1012(i).\n\n                                                30\n\fmight be “too far removed from the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial\n\nmaintenance of real property to qualify for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction under section\n\n171.1012(i).” Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 57.\n\n               Second, the Comptroller did not calculate the COGS deduction using a cost-by-cost\n\nanalysis but, rather, developed percentages that it then applied to disallow and remove certain costs\n\nfrom the COGS deduction. This methodology is contrary to the cost-by-cost analysis required to\n\ndetermine whether a certain cost fits into a type or category identified in section 171.1012. The\n\nComptroller’s percentages were derived by using labor costs as a proxy for other costs and,\n\nconsequently, there is an insufficient basis for the Comptroller’s allocation of costs as deductible\n\ndirect costs of producing goods.\n\n               Applying a proper construction of section 171.1012, the trial court’s findings that\n\nGulf Copper was entitled to include the entire $152,116,964 amount of its costs in the calculation\n\nof its COGS deduction is erroneous as a matter of law. Gulf Copper did, however, present some\n\nevidence, and the Comptroller does not dispute, that it was entitled to take a COGS deduction and\n\nexclude from its taxable margin a significant amount of its costs. The trial court correctly found that\n\nthe limitations the Comptroller placed on Gulf Copper’s cost of goods sold calculation were contrary\n\nto section 171.1012 for the reasons stated above. The Comptroller’s calculation may not serve as\n\nthe basis for determining Gulf Copper’s taxable margin or, consequently, the amount of any refund\n\nto which it may be entitled. Further proceedings are therefore required to correctly calculate Gulf\n\nCopper’s COGS deduction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\f                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated in this opinion, we conclude that, on this record, Gulf Copper\n\nwas entitled to include the entire $79,405,230 of subcontractor payments in its (g)(3) revenue\n\nexclusion. We also conclude that (1) factually insufficient evidence supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding that Gulf Copper was entitled to include the entire $152,116,964 of its costs in its COGS\n\ndeduction and (2) the Comptroller’s calculation of that deduction is incorrect as a matter of law.\n\nConsequently, we reverse the trial court’s judgment ordering the State to pay Gulf Copper the full\n\namount it paid under protest and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings to\n\ndetermine the exact amount of refund to which Gulf Copper is entitled.\n\n\n\n                                             __________________________________________\n\n                                             Scott K.

By\n\nrestricting margin tax deductions and thereby expanding the tax base,\n\nthe Legislature was able to reduce the tax rate from 4.5 percent under\n\nthe former earned surplus tax to one percent or less under the margin\n\ntax. See, Act of May 2, 2006, 79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen.\n\nLaws 1, 8 (former Tex. Tax Code § 171.101(a)), current version at Tex.\n\nTax Code § 171.101(a)(1).\n\n     If, however, the balance between the low margin tax rate and the\n\nlimited deductions is disrupted, there could be a significant revenue\n\nimpact to the State of Texas.      Accordingly, this Court should give\n\nserious consideration to the implications of the Opinion below, which\n\n\n                                                                     Page x\n\fallows service providers to take the cost-of-goods-sold deduction when\n\nthey are not selling goods, and further, allows taxpayers to exclude\n\nrevenues from margin merely because they are paying expenses owed\n\nunder a contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 Page xi\n\f                    ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Do the services performed by Gulf Copper or its subsidiary\n     constitute “furnishing labor or materials to a project for the\n     construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial\n     maintenance ... of real property” such that Gulf Copper may\n     deduct under Tax Code section171.1012(i) its costs of:\n     a. Repairing or upgrading drilling rigs at Gulf Copper’s\n        waterfront facilities, before the commencement of offshore\n        drilling; or\n     b. Surveying marine vessels, including drilling rigs at Gulf\n        Copper’s waterfront facilities?\n\n2.   May Gulf Copper exclude from its total revenue, under Tax Code\n     section 171.1011(g)(3), hourly payments made to subcontractors?\n     This question turns on:\n     a. Whether payments were “made under a contract . . . to\n        provide services, labor, or materials in connection with the\n        actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, or repair\n        of improvements on real property,” when the subcontractor\n        payments were for work repairing or upgrading drilling rigs\n        at Gulf Copper’s waterfront facilities, before the\n        commencement of offshore drilling.\n     b. Whether payments Gulf Copper made to subcontractors are\n        “flow-through funds that are mandated by contract to be\n        distributed to other entities,” when Gulf Copper was not\n        required by contract to use customer payments to pay\n        subcontractors.\n\n3.   [Unbriefed] Gulf Copper had the burden of proof on its cost-of-\n     good-sold claim. Where Gulf Copper put on no evidence of\n     allowable costs according with section 171.1012 or controverting\n     the Comptroller’s cost-by-cost analysis—relying instead on an\n     erroneous legal argument—did the court of appeals err in\n     remanding the case for a new trial on Gulf Copper’s cost-of-\n     goods-sold claim?\n\n\n                                                             Page xii\n\f                        STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n    The margin tax dispute.\n\n      The court of appeals correctly stated the nature of the case as a suit\n\n“seeking a refund of franchise taxes that Gulf Copper paid under protest.”\n\nSpecifically, this franchise or “margin” tax case involves a dispute over\n\n(1) the amounts Gulf Copper may deduct as cost of goods sold, and (2) the\n\namounts that it may exclude from its revenues.\n\n    Gulf Copper’s business.\n\n      The trial court made the following findings of fact regarding Gulf\n\nCopper’s business. Gulf Copper is primarily engaged in the business of\n\nsurveying, manufacturing, upgrading, and repairing offshore drilling\n\nrigs. CR. 296-97[App. B] (Finding of Fact 10). 1 Gulf Copper repairs rigs\n                                                 0F\n\n\n\n\nby removing defective portions, manufacturing replacement components,\n\nand installing the replacement components onto the rigs. Gulf Copper\n\nalso manufactures and installs new components for rigs that do not\n\n\n\n\n1 Although Gulf Copper manufactures components for the rigs, it is undisputed\nthat it does not own, manufacture or sell the rigs themselves. 3.RR.39–40; see\nalso Opinion at *4-5.\n                                                                      Page 1\n\freplace an existing component. Finding of Fact 12.\n\n      Gulf Copper’s customers are primarily rig owners and drilling\n\ncontractors who use their offshore rigs to drill for oil and gas on behalf\n\nof exploration and production (“E&P”) companies. Finding of Fact 9.\n\nGulf Copper’s work enables the rigs (1) to meet and maintain the\n\ncertification requirements by classification societies, (2) to comply\n\nwith governing regulations, and (3) to satisfy an E&P company’s\n\ncontractual requirement for a specific drilling project. Finding of Fact\n\n16.\n\n      Gulf Copper owns all of the outstanding shares of a subsidiary\n\nnamed Sabine Surveyors. Finding of Fact 1.        Sabine Surveyors is a\n\nlimited partnership primarily engaged in the business of marine vessel\n\nsurveying. Finding of Fact 2. For franchise tax report year 2009 (the\n\naccounting period of May 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008), Gulf Copper, Sabine\n\nSurveyors, and others (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Gulf\n\nCopper”) joined in the filing of combined franchise tax report. Finding of\n\nFact 7.\n\n      With regard to the exclusions from revenue, the trial court made\n\n                                                                   Page 2\n\fthese additional findings of fact. Gulf Copper performs its work using\n\nboth employees and subcontractors. Finding of Fact 22. Gulf Copper’s\n\ncustomers often approve or require Gulf Copper’s use of certain\n\nsubcontractors to complete the work... Finding of Fact 23.\n\n     Gulf Copper charges its customers for subcontractor work using a\n\nformula that is based upon Gulf Copper’s actual cost of the\n\nsubcontractor(s) plus a mark-up. Regardless of how the subcontractor is\n\nbilled, Gulf Copper’s resulting mark-up to the customer is generally\n\nbetween 15-20 percent. Finding of Fact 24. When Gulf Copper’s\n\ncustomers pay Gulf Copper for work performed by subcontractors, Gulf\n\nCopper retains the portion of the payment attributable to its mark-up\n\n(generally between 15- 20 percent) and flows through the remainder of\n\nthe customer’s payment to the subcontractor. Finding of Fact 25. The\n\nsubcontractor payments flow from Gulf Copper’s customer, through Gulf\n\nCopper, to Gulf Copper's subcontractors who performed the work for the\n\ncustomer. Finding of Fact 26.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                Page 3\n\f      Finally, it is undisputed that “[t]he drilling rigs are delivered to\n\nGulf Copper’s facility where Gulf Copper performs the work…” Opinion\n\nat * 4.\n\n\nThe Comptroller’s audit.\n\n      The Comptroller audited Gulf Copper and assessed additional\n\nfranchise taxes in the amount of $692,626.66 (plus interest, for a then\n\ncurrent total of $838,117.84). The two major adjustments were to: (1) the\n\ncost-of-goods-sold deduction and; (2) the exclusion from revenue of\n\nsubcontractor payments.\n\n\n      The Comptroller allowed the cost-of-goods-sold deduction for labor\n\ncosts incurred in the production or “fabrication” of rig components and\n\nparts installed on the rigs (and thus “sold” to the rig owners), plus other\n\ncosts specifically allowable under the statute. See Opinion at * 3; see also\n\nTex. Tax Code § 171.1012(c), (d), (f). But the Comptroller disallowed, as\n\nnon-deductible “services,” Gulf Copper’s labor costs incurred in installing\n\ncomponents, removing defective components, painting, welding, fixing\n\ncranes, sandblasting, and coating—because none of those labor costs\n\nwere shown to be costs of acquiring or producing “goods” for sale. See id.\n\n                                                                    Page 4\n\f§ 171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii) and (c)(1); CR. 297 (Findings of Fact 10, 12, 13\n\n[App. B]; 2.RR.131-32, 188, 192.\n\n\n     The Comptroller auditor also disallowed Sabine Surveyors’ costs in\n\nhis calculation of Gulf Copper’s cost-of-goods-sold deduction—because\n\nsurveying is a service and the costs of surveying are not costs of acquiring\n\nor producing “goods” for sale. 5.RR.11–15.\n\n\n     As to the second audit issue, the Comptroller auditor determined\n\nthat the $79,405,230 in payments to subcontractors did not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements for the exclusion from revenue, and should be\n\nconsidered instead in the calculation of Gulf Copper’s cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction.\n\n\n     Gulf Copper paid the assessment under protest, and these two\n\nadjustments are the principal issues in this Petition for Review.\n\n\n                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n     Cost-of-goods-sold deduction\n\n     There is no evidence in the record to support the contested\n\ndeductions. Gulf Copper does not own or sell drilling rigs – it repairs\n\nand outfits them at its waterfront facility. The repair and outfitting of\n                                                                  Page 5\n\fdrilling rigs is not the sale of “goods.” Therefore, Gulf Copper’s costs in\n\nrepairing and outfitting the rigs are not deductible as costs of acquiring\n\nor producing “goods” under Tax Code § 171.1012(c), (d), or (f).\n\n     Furthermore, in performing rig work at its waterfront facility, Gulf\n\nCopper is not “furnishing labor or materials to a project for the\n\nconstruction,   improvement,      remodeling,    repair,   or     industrial\n\nmaintenance . . . of real property. . .” Rather, it is providing repair and\n\noutfitting services to the owner of equipment, who in turn, contracts with\n\nthe E&P company to provide that equipment for offshore drilling. This\n\nindirect relationship does not qualify Gulf Copper for the cost-of-goods-\n\nsold deduction under Tax Code § 171.1012(i). Gulf Copper’s rig work adds\n\nvalue to the rigs, but it does not add value to any real-property project.\n\n     Gulf Copper’s affiliate, Sabine Surveyors, does not own or sell goods\n\neither. And similarly, Sabine Surveyors is not by virtue of its surveying\n\nservices, furnishing labor or materials “to a project for the construction,\n\nimprovement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance ... of real\n\nproperty,” so as to qualify for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction under Tax\n\nCode § 171.1012(i).\n\n\n                                                                     Page 6\n\f     Revenue exclusion for subcontractor payments\n\n     With regard to the flow-through exclusion from revenue, the\n\npayment of subcontractors for rig repair, before the commencement of\n\ndrilling, does not constitute evidence of payment for “services, labor, or\n\nmaterials in connection with the actual or proposed design, construction,\n\nremodeling, or repair of improvements on real property” under Texas Tax\n\nCode §171.1011(g)(3).\n\n     Furthermore, the flow-through exclusion is proper only where the\n\ntaxpayer is contractually obligated to pay its subcontractors from or\n\nbased on payments that it has received from other parties, and, here,\n\nthere is no such contract in evidence.\n\n                             ARGUMENT\n\nI.   Gulf Copper’s costs in repairing and outfitting drilling rigs,\n     and Sabine Surveyors’ costs in surveying marine vessels,\n     were not deductible as costs-of-goods sold.\n\n     A. Background: Tax Code section 171.1012.\n\n     Gulf Copper determined its “margin” by deducting cost of goods sold\n\nfrom total revenue. Opinion at *3. The cost-of-goods-sold deduction is\n\ngoverned by Tax Code section 171.1012, which permits a business to\n\n\n                                                                   Page 7\n\fsubtract “all direct costs of acquiring or producing the goods.” Tex. Tax\n\nCode § 171.1012(a)(1) and (c).\n\n     “Goods” means “real or tangible personal property sold in the\n\nordinary course of business of a taxable entity.” Id. The definition of\n\n“tangible   personal   property”    expressly    excludes   “services.”   Id.\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii)). Thus, sellers of services are not ordinarily\n\neligible for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction.\n\n     To take a deduction under the cost-of-goods-sold statute, the entity\n\nmust own the “goods” that it sells. Id. § 171.1012(i). Gulf Copper did not\n\nown the drilling rigs that it repaired and outfitted, and Sabine Surveyors\n\ndid not own the marine vessels that it surveyed. The third sentence of\n\nsubsection (i), however, allows certain service providers to subtract their\n\ncosts from revenue as cost-of-goods-sold by “considering” them to be\n\nowners of their labor and materials:\n\n     A taxable entity furnishing labor or materials to a project for\n     the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or\n     industrial maintenance ... of real property is considered to be\n     an owner of that labor or materials and may include the\n     costs, as allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of\n     goods sold.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     Page 8\n\f     B. There was no evidence of section 171.1012(i) costs to\n        support a remand.\n\n     Because there was no evidence supporting application of the\n\nsubsection (i)’s third sentence, the court of appeals erred when it\n\nconcluded that:\n\n     Gulf Copper presented evidence at trial that, to some extent,\n     Gulf Copper’s employees provided labor and materials to\n     projects for improvement of real property (drilling oil wells).\n     The Comptroller was obligated to consider to what extent the\n     activities of Gulf Copper’s employees were essential and\n     direct components of those specific projects.\n\nOpinion at *14.\n\n     Similarly, the court erred when it concluded that “Sabine\n\nSurveyors’ costs should have been analyzed on a cost-by-cost basis to\n\ndetermine which of those costs met the requirement that they be integral,\n\nessential, and direct components of the offshore drilling process.” Id.\n\n     Remand is inappropriate here, because Gulf Copper and its\n\nsubsidiary’s services do not constitute “furnishing labor and materials to\n\na project for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or\n\nindustrial maintenance ... of real property. . .” Thus, their services do\n\nnot qualify for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction under subsection (i). Tex.\n\nTax. Code § 171.1012(i).\n                                                                    Page 9\n\f       Subsection (i)’s phrase “furnishing labor or materials” is nearly\n\nidentical to the Property Code phrase “furnishes labor or materials.” See\n\nTex. Prop. Code § 53.021 (“Persons Entitled to Lien”). Therefore, it is\n\nreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended substantially similar\n\nmeanings.     See, e.g., Sheshunoff v.

App.—Austin 2005, pet. denied) (“When the same or a similar term\n\nis used in the same connection in different statutes, the term will be\n\ngiven the same meaning in one as in the other, unless there is something\n\nto indicate that a different meaning was intended.”)\n\n       The Property Code provides that a person who “furnishes labor or\n\nmaterials” for the construction, repair, or demolition of a real property\n\nimprovement may establish a lien on the real property to secure payment\n\nfor the labor done or material furnished. See Tex. Prop. Code §§ 53.021\n\nand 53.023 (“Payment Secured by Lien.”). The definitions limit “labor”\n\nand “materials” to those used in the “direct prosecution” of the work. Id.\n\nat § 53.001(3) & (4). 2\n                      1F\n\n\n\n\n2   The Comptroller has proposed rules amending 34 TAC § 3.588, which\nwould use the Property Code definitions to define “labor” and “materials”\nin section 171.1012(i). See 42. Tex. Reg. 5235-36 (Sept. 29, 2017).\n                                                                  Page 10\n\f      Application of the Property Code definitions provides this clear test\n\nfor costs claimed under subsection (i): could Gulf Copper obtain a lien on\n\nthe offshore drilling project? Here, the answer is “no.” Mechanics and\n\nmaterialman’s liens are limited to “running repairs” performed on\n\nequipment while it is being used on the project site. See Tex. Prop. Code\n\n§ 53.001(4)(B). 3\n                2F\n\n\n\n\n      Gulf Copper tendered no evidence that the costs it seeks to deduct\n\nincluded any of these activities. Indeed, to establish its entitlement to\n\nthe disputed deductions, Gulf Copper relied solely on an erroneous legal\n\ninterpretation of subsection 171.1012(h)—which the court of appeals\n\nexpressly rejected. Opinion at *9, 12.

See Tex.\n\nGov't Code Ann. § 311.011(a) (West 2013). The phrase “to a project for the\n\nconstruction, improvement . . . of real property” is prepositional phrase\n\nthat functions as an adjective modifying and limiting the antecedent\n\nphrase “furnishing labor or materials.”\n\n     The court of appeals nonetheless concluded that Gulf Copper\n\n“presented evidence at trial that, to some extent” it provided labor or\n\nmaterials that were “essential and direct components” of “specific\n\nprojects.” Opinion at *14. The court’s “essential and direct components”\n\nlanguage comes from its opinion in Newpark. In that case, the court\n\ndistinguished labor that was an “essential and direct component” of the\n\ndrilling project from labor “too far removed” from the project. Opinion\n\nat *14 (citing Combs v. Newpark Resources, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2013, no pet.)).\n\n     The taxpayer in Newpark was able to obtain the subsection (i)\n\ndeductions for labor furnished in hauling away used drilling mud and\n\nother waste products from oil well drilling sites. 422 S.W.3d at 48. But\n\nthat labor was provided to the oil wells. In contrast, Gulf Copper’s work\n\nwas at least two steps removed from a real-property project. It provided\n                                                                 Page 12\n\foutfitting and repair services to its customers—the rig owners—who, in\n\nturn, contracted with the E&P companies to provide them with the rigs\n\nfor offshore drilling. The E&P companies then used the rigs in projects\n\nfor real-property improvements or construction.\n\n     This Court has never adopted the “essential and direct components”\n\ntest in Newpark. But even if the Court accepts that formulation, the\n\nrepair and outfitting of a rig owned and operated by a third party, prior\n\nto commencement of drilling by yet another third party at a different site\n\noffshore, cannot be viewed as a “direct component” of drilling.        Gulf\n\nCopper’s work is “too far removed” from the construction project.\n\n     Gulf Copper fixed construction equipment. As a matter of law,\n\nfixing or upgrading construction equipment prior to its utilization is\n\nnot “furnishing labor or materials to a project for the construction,\n\nimprovement ... of real property” under subsection (i). Just as fixing\n\na bulldozer before its delivery to and use on a construction site should be\n\nproperly classified as the repair of tangible personal property rather than\n\nreal-property improvements, so Gulf Copper’s rig work at its waterfront\n\nyards constituted the repair and upgrading of tangible personal property,\n\nnot “furnishing labor or materials to” a construction project.        Gulf\n                                                                   Page 13\n\fCopper’s rig work added value to the rigs, but it did not add value to any\n\nreal-property project.\n\n     This analysis applies with equal if not greater force to Sabine\n\nSurveyors, which inspected the rigs and other marine vessels. There is\n\nno evidence the subsidiary inspected offshore drilling operations or any\n\nother real-property improvements.\n\n     C. The court of appeals’ decision regarding section\n       171.1012(i) also defeats other key provisions in the\n       cost-of-goods-sold statute.\n\n     The court’s decision undermines the explicit exclusion of “services”\n\nfrom the definition of “tangible personal property” and thus from the\n\ndefinition of “goods.” See id. § 171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii).    It does so by\n\nallowing the taxpayer to deduct labor costs for installing components,\n\nremoving defective components, painting, welding, fixing cranes,\n\nsandblasting, and coating—even though these services had only an\n\nindirect relationship to the construction or improvement of real property.\n\nCR. 296-97 (Findings of Fact No. 10, 12 and 13)[App. B]; 2.RR.131–32,\n\n188, 192.\n\n     The cost of a service may be allowable in a cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction only if the service is a cost of acquiring or producing a “good”\n\n                                                                  Page 14\n\fthat an entity sells or is labor in the “direct prosecution” of a real-property\n\nproject.   Returning to the example of a bulldozer, this is why under\n\nsection 171.1012, the salaries of employees who paint, repair, upgrade a\n\nbulldozer for sale would be allowable in the seller’s cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction. The salaries are costs of “producing” the equipment “sold.”\n\n      But apart from the acquisition or production expenses for the sale\n\nof the bulldozer, costs of providing services to repair, upgrade, or paint\n\nthe bulldozer are not deductible. And these services do not qualify for the\n\ndeduction simply because the owner of the bulldozer repaired, upgraded\n\nor painted subsequently provides it to a real-property project.           Nor\n\nwould the person performing the repair, upgrade or painting be able to\n\nclaim the deduction.\n\n      Similarly, Gulf Copper is not selling rigs to a third-party, but\n\nrather, is providing repair and outfitting services performed at its\n\nwaterfront facility. 4 That the rigs are then used by another third party\n                    3F\n\n\n\n\n4 Again, the comptroller has already allowed the deduction for the labor costs\nincurred in “producing” “goods”—i.e., parts and components Gulf Copper\ninstalled on the rigs and thus sold.\n                                                                      Page 15\n\fto drill offshore does not transform Gulf Copper’s services into “labor”\n\nused in “direct prosecution” of the project under subsection (i).\n\nII.   Gulf Copper cannot exclude the contested subcontractor\n      payments from revenue under Tax Code §171.1011(g)(3).\n\n      A. Background: Section 171.1011(g)(3)\n\n      Taxpayers such as Gulf Copper must first determine their revenue\n\nbefore deducting cost of goods sold to determine “margin.” In limited\n\ncircumstances, the Texas Legislature has allowed taxpayers to exclude\n\nreceipts that they are obligated by law or contract or fiduciary duty to\n\npass on to another. The theory is that the receipts do not truly represent\n\nthe revenue of the taxpayers. However, taxpayers are not allowed to\n\nexclude receipts merely because the receipts are used to pay the\n\ntaxpayers’ expenses. If that were the case, the “margin” tax would become\n\na net income tax. To prevent just that outcome, Tax Code §171.1011(i)\n\nspecifically provides:\n\n      Except as provided by Subsection (g), a payment made under\n      an ordinary contract for the provision of services in the\n      regular course of business may not be excluded.\n\n      In this case, the question is whether the payments were made\n\nunder an ordinary contract for the provision of services or whether they\n\n\n                                                                    Page 16\n\fwere    flow-through     payments    to   subcontractors    under    section\n\n171.1011(g)(3), which provided during the period at issue:\n\n       A taxable entity shall exclude from its total revenue, to the\n       extent [reported to the IRS as income], only the following flow-\n       through funds that are mandated by contract to be distributed\n       to other entities:\n       ....\n\n         (3) subcontracting payments handled by the taxable entity\n         to provide services, labor, or materials in connection with\n         the actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, or\n         repair of improvements on real property or the location of\n         the boundaries of real property.\n\n\nAct of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch.1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen.\n\nLaws 1, 10 (amended 2013) (“the (g)(3) revenue exclusion”).\n\n       There are two requirements at issue: there must be “flow-\n\nthrough funds that are mandated by contract to be distributed to\n\nother entities,” and the flow-through funds must be for “services,\n\nlabor, or materials in connection with the actual or proposed design,\n\nconstruction, remodeling, or repair of improvements on real\n\nproperty.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    Page 17\n\f     B. There is no evidence that the subcontract work\n     constituted “services, labor, or materials in connection\n     with the actual or proposed design, construction,\n     remodeling, or repair of improvements on real property”\n\n     Finding of Fact 29 reads in part, “Gulf Copper, through its\n\nemployees and subcontractors, provides labor and materials in\n\nconnection with the actual or proposed construction or repair of\n\nimprovements on real property;…” CR.298 [App.2]. This finding tracks\n\nthe statutory language of section 171.1011(g)(3) and is really a conclusion\n\nof law reviewed de novo, without deference. It should be rejected.\n\n     The court of appeals conceded that the phrase “in connection with”\n\nis “one ‘of intentional breadth,’ but not without ‘logical limit.’” Opinion\n\nat *7 (quoting Titan Transp. LP v. Combs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637-38 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2014, pet. denied)). The “logical limit” has been exceeded\n\nhere for these reasons:\n\n  • Gulf Copper’s work was temporally remote from the projects to\n    improve real property – the work was performed before drilling\n    operations commenced.\n\n  • Gulf Copper’s work was physically remote from the projects to\n    improve real property – the work was performed on tangible\n    personal property at Gulf Copper’s waterfront yards and not at the\n    offshore drilling sites, or oil and gas wells.\n\n                                                                  Page 18\n\f    • Gulf Copper’s work was contractually remote from the projects to\n      improve real property – Gulf Copper’s contracts were with the rig\n      owners, not the project owners, and Gulf Copper was not a\n      subcontractor to the project owners.\n\n      And, when Gulf Copper finished its work, the offshore drilling\n\nprojects had no greater value than before Gulf Copper started. This is\n\nthe “logical limit” of the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. 5 4F\n\n\n\n\n      Of course, the rigs that Gulf Copper repairs and modifies are used\n\nby third parties to construct oil and gas wells, and oil and gas wells are\n\nimprovements to real property.         For this reason, the State does not\n\nchallenge Findings of Fact 20: “Offshore drilling rigs are necessary and\n\nessential to the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells because the wells\n\ncould not be drilled without the drilling rigs”) or Finding of Fact 30 (“The\n\nlabor and materials provided by Gulf Copper through its employees and\n\nsubcontractors are necessary, essential, and integral to the construction\n\n\n5 While this part of the (g)(3) revenue exclusion is similar to the real-property\nproject requirement in the third-sentence of subsection (i), there are\ndifferences. Subsection (i) does not contain the word “services.” It refers to\n“labor or materials furnished “to” a real-property project, rather than “services,\nlabor or materials” provided “in connection with” such projects. Nevertheless,\nGulf Copper’s work does not qualify for the revenue exclusion even under the\nbroader phrasing in subsection (g)(3). It is still too “remote or attenuated” to\nqualify. See Titan Transp. 433 S.W.3d at 638. The court of appeals’ decision\ndoes not account for the use of different words and phrases in these two\nsubsections.\n                                                                         Page 19\n\f… of oil and gas wells.”). CR.298, 299 [App.2].\n\n      But just as narrow focus on necessity or indispensability would\n\nimproperly broaden the statutory test under subsection (i), these findings\n\nare, as a matter of law, insufficient to pull the subcontractor payments\n\ninto the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. The taxpayer’s indispensability\n\nargument—which is really none other than a “but for,” cause-in-fact\n\nargument—“proves too much.” Undoubtedly, there are many necessary\n\nor   essential   preconditions—business    organization,   administrative\n\nservices support, surveying, geoseismic testing, research—for oil wells\n\nand other real-property projects.     And, no doubt, these and other\n\nnecessary preconditions will themselves require the furnishing of labor\n\nor materials.\n\n      But the mere fact that the disputed labor or materials are in the\n\ncausal chain leading up to the real-property project is not evidence\n\nsupporting the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. Another precondition of the\n\nproject would be a written drilling contract between the rig owner and\n\nthe E&P company. Should the law firm that drafted the contract for the\n\nrig owner be able to exclude its expenses because the expenses were\n\nincurred “in connection with” the improvement of real property? Gulf\n                                                                 Page 20\n\fCopper is in the same position as the law firm, providing services to the\n\nrig owner antecedent to the drilling project and not providing any value\n\nto the drilling project itself.\n\n      C. There is no evidence that the subcontractor\n         payments constituted “flow-through funds that are\n         mandated by contract to be distributed to other\n         entities.”\n\n\n      Even if the Court rejects the State’s primary contention and finds\n\nthat the subcontractor payments were made in connection with the\n\nconstruction or improvements of real property, there must still be\n\nevidence that the payments were mandated by contract to be distributed\n\nto the subcontractors.\n\n      Gulf Copper’s two biggest contracts with rig owners, the Pride and\n\nHelix contracts, involved two types of subcontractor labor – hourly and\n\ncost-plus.\n\n      Under the hourly labor provisions, employees of the subcontractor\n\nworked side-by-side with Gulf Copper employees, performing the same\n\nwork. Gulf Copper paid these subcontractors a flat hourly rate. And\n\nunder the Pride and Helix contracts, the rig owners paid Gulf Copper a\n\nhigher flat hourly rate—paying the same rate for regular labor performed\n                                                                 Page 21\n\fby Gulf Copper employees and its subcontractors. 2.RR.110–113.\n\n4.RR.104–05; PX1 at P00220 (Pride Contract) [App.9]; PX2 at P0072\n\n(Helix contract). Indeed, with respect to regular labor, the Pride and\n\nHelix contracts said nothing at all about subcontractors.\n\n     But for the second type of subcontractor labor involving specialty\n\nservices, the Pride and Helix contracts specified that payments were cost\n\nplus 15% (in the case of the Pride contract) and cost plus 20% (in the case\n\nof the Helix contract). PX1 at P00221 [App.9]; PX2 at P00073 [App.10];\n\n2.RR.112. 6\n          5F\n\n\n\n\n     At trial, the State conceded that $32.0 million in subcontractor\n\npayments—reflecting the specialty services governed by the cost-plus\n\nprovisions in the Pride and Helix contracts—were flow-through funds\n\nmandated by contract to be distributed to the subcontractors. But the\n\nState continued to urge that the other payments—reflecting the hourly-\n\nrate subcontractors—were not flow-through funds.          With respect to\n\nthose payments, no contract mandated that any customer payment for\n\n\n\n6 Gulf Copper also made subcontractor payments under six other contracts in\naddition to the Pride and Helix contracts. But none of those six contracts\nwere cost-plus contracts. PX3, PX4, PX5, PX6, PX7, PX8.\n\n                                                                   Page 22\n\flabor be distributed to the subcontractors. The trial court and the court\n\nof appeals erred when they concluded these payments were nonetheless\n\nflow-through funds mandated by contract to be distributed to other\n\nentities. Opinion at *6.\n\n     Though Gulf Copper was contractually obligated to pay the\n\nsubcontractors for “labor,” it was not contractually obligated to pass on\n\nor flow-through customer payments to them. That makes all the\n\ndifference under the plain language of the statute. Neither the court of\n\nappeals nor Gulf Copper pointed to any contractual mandate in the\n\ncustomer contracts or in the subcontracts that required Gulf Copper to\n\nshare customer payments with its subcontractors.\n\n     When examining statutory text, the Code Construction Act\n\nmandates that the Court read words and phrases in context and construe\n\nthem according to the rules of grammar and usage. Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\n\n§ 311.011(a) (West 2013); see also supra at 11-12. The phrase “flow-\n\nthrough funds that are mandated by contract to be distributed to other\n\nentities” is a single unified requirement. The dependent clause “that are\n\nmandated by contract to be distributed to other entities” is an adjective\n\n\n\n                                                                 Page 23\n\fthat specifies and limits the type of flow-through funds excludable from\n\nrevenue.\n\n     The court of appeals’ approach effectively reads out of the statute\n\nthe requirement that a contract mandate that funds be distributed to\n\nother entities. Gulf Copper was not contractually obligated to mark-up\n\nanything or, for that matter, to do anything at all besides paying the\n\nsubcontractors an hourly rate.\n\n     Although the court of appeals relied on Titan Transp., LP v. Combs,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

Gulf Copper satisfied all procedural prerequisites to maintain a protest suit under Texas Tax\n   Code Chapter 112.\n\n9. Gulf Copper's customers are primarily rig owners and drilling contractors who use their\n   offshore rigs to drill for oil and gas on behalf of exploration and production (\"E&P\")\n   companies.\n\n10. Gulf Copper is primarily engaged in the business of surveying, manufacturing, upgrading,\n    and repairing offshore drilling rigs.\n\n11. Gulf Copper provides everything necessary to satisfy the customer's work order, including\n    all labor, materials, equipment, and supplies.\n\n12. Gulf Copper repairs rigs by removing defective portions, manufacturing replacement\n    components, and installing the replacement components onto the rigs. Gulf Copper also\n    manufactures and installs new components for rigs that do not replace an existing\n    component.\n\n13. Gulf Copper's work is labor-intensive and requires specialized training and experience.\n    Examples of Gulf Copper's employee and subcontractor labor includes: manufacturing (e.g.,\n    steel components, drain systems, and fuel systems); installation; welding; fitting; cutting;\n    blasting, coating, and painting; hot work; analytical stress testing; and electrical and\n    hydraulic work. Gulf Copper's work is complex, requiring precise measurements and several\n    levels of inspection and compliance.\n\n14. In performing its work through its employees and subcontractors, Gulf Copper furnishes\n    materials, including steel, gasket materials, blasting medium, paint, and other industrial\n    materials.\n\n15. In completing its work, Gulf Copper utilizes all aspects and the entire breadth of its facility\n    yards, whether the rig sits on the dry dock, in the yard, or in the water. This includes the lay\n    down areas, the warehouses, the fabrication shops, the welding areas, and the stacking areas.\n\n16. Gulf Copper's work enables the rigs (I) to meet and maintain the certification requirements\n    imposed by classification societies, (2) to comply with governing regulations, and (3) to\n    satisfy an exploration and production (\"E&P\") company's contractual requirements for a\n    specific drilling project.\n\n17. A rig cannot be used for drilling unless it is properly certified, compliant, and satisfies the\n    contractual requirements for the project.\n\n\n\n\nGulf Copper & Manufactur ing C0111. v. Hegar, Cause No. D-I-GN-14-004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 2 of 6\n\f18. Gulf Copper's work increases the rig's value.\n\n19. Rig owners do not hire Gulf Copper to repair or upgrade their rigs or manufacture new\n    components unless they have a revenue-generating contract in place for the drilling of\n    offshore oil and gas wells.\n\n20. Offshore drilling rigs are necessary and essential to the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells\n    because the wells could not be drilled without the drilling rigs.\n\n21. Gulf Copper has elected, for federal income tax purposes, to use the accrual method of\n    accounting. This method matches the costs incurred by Gulf Copper with the revenues\n    generated by those expenses.\n\n22. Gulf Copper performs its work using both employees and subcontractors.\n\n23. Gulf Copper's customers often approve or require Gulf Copper's use of certain\n    subcontractors to complete the work. The customers remain very involved throughout the\n    project. They often have field representatives at Gulf Copper's facilities and monitor the\n    specific deadlines by which the work must be completed.\n\n24. Gulf Copper charges its customers for subcontractor work using a formula that is based upon\n    Gulf Copper's actual cost of the subcontractor(s) plus a mark-up. Regardless of how the\n    subcontractor is billed, Gulf Copper's resulting mark-up to the customer is generally between\n    15-20 percent.\n\n25. When Gulf Copper's customers pay Gulf Copper for work performed by subcontractors, Gulf\n    Copper retains the portion of the payment attributable to its mark-up (generally between 15-\n    20 percent) and flows through the remainder of the customer's payment to the subcontractor.\n\n26. The subcontractor payments flow from Gulf Copper's customer, through Gulf Copper, to\n    Gulf Copper's subcontractors who performed the work for the customer.\n\n27. The subcontractors are legal entities separate from Gulf Copper.\n\n28. Gulf Copper's contractual mandates to distribute flow-through funds to its subcontractors are\n    contained within its customer contracts, its contracts with the subcontractors, supporting\n    invoices, work orders, purchase orders, and other accounting records. They are also\n    embodied in the course of Gulf Copper's dealings with its customers and subcontractors.\n\n29. Gulf Copper, through its employees and subcontractors, provides labor and materials in\n    connection with the actual or proposed construction, or repair of improvements on real\n    property; and to projects for the construction, improvement, repair, or industrial maintenance\n    of real property.\n\n\n\n\nGulf Copper & Manufacturing Corp. v. Hegar, Cause No. D-1-GN-14-004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 3 of 6\n\f30. The labor and materials provided by Gulf Copper through its employees and subcontractors\n    are necessary, essential, and integral to the construction, improvement, repair, and industrial\n    maintenance of oil and gas wells.\n\n31. Gulf Copper's proper apportionment factor is .8808.\n\n32. Gulf Copper manufactures, develops, improves, and installs tangible personal property for its\n    customers.\n\n33. Gulf Copper resells tangible personal property to its customers.\n\n34. Gulf Copper sometimes sells the scrap metal generated by its rig repair work.\n\n35. Gulf Copper owns tangible personal property that it sells in the ordinary course of business.\n\n36. For report year 2009, Gulf Copper incurred expenses eligible to be included in the cost of\n    goods sold subtraction in the amount of $152,116,964.\n\n37. The categories, classifications, locations and amounts of the costs eligible to be included in\n    the cost of goods sold subtraction are accurately stated in Exhibit 56.\n\n38.

Gulf Copper consists of a combined group, including Gulf Copper, Sabine Surveyors and\n   others, and this combined group is a single taxable entity for purposes of the Texas franchise\n   tax.\n\n2. Gulf Copper is entitled to exclude from its revenue $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments\n   under Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011 (g)(3 ).\n\n3. Oil and gas wells constitute improvements on real property for purposes of Tex. Tax Code\n   § 171.101 l(g)(3).\n\n4. Texas Tax Code § 171.101 l(g)(3) does not require that the mandate for payment be\n   contained in a customer contract or subcontract. The statutory mandate element is satisfied\n   as long as the taxpayer is legally obligated by contract to pay a portion of the customer funds\n   to the subcontractor.\n\n5. Alternatively, Gulf Copper is entitled to include the $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments\n   in its cost of goods sold subtraction under Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012.\n\n6. Under Tex. Tax Code § 171.1055, Gulf Copper may not include receipts excluded from total\n   revenue in either the numerator or the denominator of its apportionment calculation.\n\n7. Gulf Copper properly excluded from the numerator and denominator of its apportionment\n   factor its subcontractor payments totaling $79,405,230.\n\n8. Gulf Copper properly calculated its franchise tax due amount using an apportionment factor\n   of .8808.\n\n9. Gulf Copper owns goods as required by the first sentence of Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(i).\n\n10. Gulf Copper qualifies for the cost of goods sold subtraction under the second sentence of\n    Tex. Tax Code§ 171.1012(i) and as defined by§ 171.1012(a)(l).\n\n11. Gulf Copper qualifies for the cost of goods sold subtraction under the third sentence of Tex.\n    Tax Code§ 171.1012(i).\n\n12. Oil and gas wells constitute real property for purposes of Tex. Tax Code§ 171.1012(i).\n\n13. The limitations imposed by the Comptroller upon Gulf Copper's cost of goods sold\n    calculation violate Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012.\n\n14. Gulf Copper is entitled to include the costs of Sabine Surveyors in its cost of goods sold\n    subtraction, as allowed by Tex. Tax Code § 171.10 l 2(g)-(h), (c )-(t).\n\n\nGulf Copper & 1\\tlanufacturing Co111. v. Hegar. Cause No. D- l-GN-14-004620\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nPage 5 of 6\n\f15.

D-1-GN-14-004620, HONORABLE AMY CLARK MEACHUM, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n\n                Gulf Copper and Manufacturing Corporation sued Glenn Hegar, Comptroller of\n\nPublic Accounts of the State of Texas, and Ken Paxton, Attorney General of the State of Texas\n\n(collectively, the State), seeking a refund of franchise taxes that Gulf Copper paid under protest.\n\nSee Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 403.201-.221 (governing protest suit after payment under protest); Tex. Tax\n\nCode §§ 112.001-.156 (governing taxpayer suits). Gulf Copper asserted that the State erroneously\n\ndenied it a revenue exclusion it had claimed for payments made to its subcontractors during the\n\nrelevant tax year.1 In the alternative, Gulf Copper asserted it was entitled to deduct the subcontractor\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          See Act of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 10\n(amended 2013) (current version at Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g)(3)) (excluding certain “flow-\nthrough funds” from taxpayer’s “total revenue”).\n\fpayments as “cost of goods sold” (COGS).2 Gulf Copper also asserted that the State erroneously\n\nexcluded certain costs Gulf Copper had included in its calculation of its COGS deduction, resulting\n\nin a smaller COGS deduction and, correspondingly, Gulf Copper’s owing additional franchise\n\ntaxes. Following a bench trial, the trial court concluded that Gulf Copper was entitled to a revenue\n\nexclusion for the subcontractor payments or, alternatively, was permitted to include the subcontractor\n\npayments in its COGS deduction. The trial court also concluded that Gulf Copper was entitled to\n\ndeduct all of the costs it had included in its original COGS calculation. The court rendered judgment\n\nordering the State to pay Gulf Copper $838,117.84, the entire amount it had paid under protest, plus\n\nstatutory interest and costs allowed by law. On appeal, the State asserts that the trial court erred in\n\nits conclusions regarding both the revenue exclusion and the COGS deduction. We agree with the\n\ntrial court that Gulf Copper was entitled to claim a revenue exclusion for the subcontractor payments.\n\nHowever, because on this record we cannot uphold the trial court’s findings regarding the amount\n\nof Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction, we will reverse the trial court’s judgment and remand the cause\n\nto the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\n                This Court has previously provided overviews of the current Texas franchise-tax\n\nscheme, originally enacted in 2006, which assesses franchise taxes against a taxable entity’s “taxable\n\n\n       2\n         See Act of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex.

The franchise-tax statute has been substantively\n\namended several times since its enactment, and the provisions applicable to this case are those\n\nthat were in effect on January 1, 2009.3 Under that version of the franchise-tax statute, the taxable\n\nentity first calculates its “total revenue” in the manner directed by Tax Code section 171.1011. See\n\nid. § 171.1011 (determination of total revenue). In general, total revenue is income reported to the\n\nfederal Internal Revenue Service less various categories of revenue that the statute specifies are to\n\nbe excluded, excepted, deducted, or otherwise limited. Id. For example, all taxpayers may deduct\n\ncertain flow-through funds, while only taxable entities in select industries are permitted to exclude\n\nother types of flow-through funds. Compare id. § 171.1011(f), (g) (flow-through-funds exclusions)\n\nwith id.

Id. § 171.002.\n\n\nNature of Gulf Copper’s Business Activities5\n\n               Gulf Copper is a corporation primarily engaged in the business of surveying,\n\nmanufacturing, upgrading, and repairing offshore drilling rigs. Gulf Copper’s work enables the drilling\n\nrigs to (1) obtain and maintain the certification requirements imposed by marine classification\n\nsocieties;6 (2) comply with regulations, both state and federal, applicable to offshore drilling rigs\n\n\n       4\n         Not relevant to this case is the option to use the E-Z computation method to determine\nmargin for taxable entities whose total revenue is $20 million or less. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1016\n(E-Z computation method and rate for taxpayers with no more than $20 million in total revenue).\n       5\n         The following description of Gulf Copper’s business activities is derived from unchallenged\nfindings of fact made by the trial court and from testimony elicited at trial, which, unless otherwise\nindicated, is undisputed.\n       6\n         A marine classification society is a non-governmental organization that establishes and\nmaintains technical standards for the construction and operation of marine vessels. Steven Hale,\nGulf Copper’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, testified that the International Association of\n\n                                                  4\n\fand their operations;7 and (3) meet the requirements imposed by contracts entered into between\n\nexploration and production companies and the drilling rigs’ owners related to specific drilling\n\nprojects.8 The drilling rigs are delivered to Gulf Copper’s facility where Gulf Copper performs the\n\nwork to satisfy the requirements of the particular classification society certifying the drilling rig,\n\nthe other regulatory authorities involved, the drilling rig’s owner representative, and often a\n\nrepresentative from the exploration and production company for whose project the drilling will be\n\nperformed. Gulf Copper repairs rigs by removing defective portions, manufacturing replacement\n\ncomponents, and installing the replacement components on the rigs. Gulf Copper also manufactures\n\nand installs new components for rigs that do not replace an existing component.\n\n                Gulf Copper also owns all the outstanding shares of a subsidiary named Sabine\n\nSurveyors, a limited partnership primarily engaged in the business of marine vessel surveying. Hale\n\n\n\nClassification Societies promulgates rules and regulations that offshore drilling rigs have to meet\nto operate safely and in an environmentally sound manner. According to Hale, the classification\nstandards are met through a regimen of inspections and surveys on a prescribed, periodic basis to\nensure the integrity and safety of the vessel. That a rig meets classification rules and standards is of\ncritical importance to both an exploration and production company considering using a particular\nrig on its project and to the underwriter who insures the drilling rig.\n       7\n           Hale testified that offshore drilling rigs and their operations are subject to regulations\npromulgated by entities such as the United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency,\nthe International Maritime Organization, and the “Bureau of Offshore Environmental Management.”\nWe assume that the last reference was to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, one of three\nindependent entities created when the federal Minerals Management Service was reorganized in the\nwake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Bureau’s mission is “managing development of the\nnation’s offshore resources in an environmentally and economically responsible way.” See The\nReorganization of the Former MMS, BOEM.GOV, http://www.boem.gov/Reorganization/ (last visited\nJune 15, 2017).\n       8\n          Hale testified that individual wells have “different requirements relative to the equipment\non the rig.”\n\n                                                   5\n\ftestified that Sabine Surveyors inspects marine vessels, including offshore drilling rigs, and cargo.\n\nSurveys are also conducted after a drilling rig is involved in a collision with another vessel while it is\n\noffshore and the owner or underwriter requests an inspection to determine the extent of the damage.\n\nAccording to Hale, in certain circumstances Sabine Surveyors must “separate itself from” Gulf\n\nCopper’s shipyard activities because it might be deemed a conflict of interest for Sabine Surveyors\n\nto refer a job for which Sabine Surveyors represents the drilling rig’s underwriter to Gulf Copper.\n\nHale testified that Sabine Surveyors also prepares “desk appraisals” of drilling rigs for use by\n\nentities with a financial interest in a rig.\n\n\nGulf Copper’s Franchise-Tax Dispute\n\n                 The underlying tax protest concerns Gulf Copper’s 2009 franchise-tax report.\n\nGulf Copper excluded from its total gross revenue $79,405,230 in “flow-through” payments to\n\nsubcontractors, which, along with other exclusions amounting to $163,303,9 reduced its total\n\nrevenue from $173,875,422 to $94,306,889. Gulf Copper then elected to use the COGS deduction\n\nto calculate its margin, subtracting $70,396,219 from its total revenue to arrive at a margin of\n\n$23,910,670. Gulf Copper calculated its apportionment factor at 0.8808, application of which\n\nresulted in a taxable margin of $21,060,518. Accordingly, Gulf Copper reported a franchise-tax\n\nobligation of $210,605.18—1% of its taxable margin—which it timely paid in full.\n\n                 In claiming a revenue exclusion of $79,405,230, Gulf Copper relied on former section\n\n171.1011(g)(3) of the franchise-tax statute, which provided:\n\n\n\n\n        9\n            The Comptroller does not dispute that the $163,303 qualified for a revenue exclusion.\n\n                                                    6\n\f       A taxable entity shall exclude from its total revenue, to the extent [reported to the\n       federal IRS as income], only the following flow-through funds that are mandated by\n       contract to be distributed to other entities:\n\n       AAAA\n\n       (3) subcontracting payments handled by the taxable entity to provide services,\n       labor, or materials in connection with the actual or proposed design, construction,\n       remodeling, or repair of improvements on real property or the location of the\n       boundaries of real property.\n\n\nAct of May 19, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch.1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 10 (amended 2013)\n\n(“the (g)(3) revenue exclusion” or “former section 171.1011(g)(3)”). After conducting an audit,\n\nhowever, the Comptroller determined that the $79,405,230 in payments to subcontractors did not\n\nmeet the requirements for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. Instead, the Comptroller determined that\n\nthe subcontractor payments should be considered in the calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS\n\ndeduction. The Comptroller also audited the amount that Gulf Copper had calculated as its COGS\n\ndeduction and significantly pared down the expenses it believed could properly be included in the\n\nCOGS calculation. In essence, the Comptroller concluded that only costs either directly or indirectly\n\nrelated to “fabrication” of goods could properly be included in the calculation of Gulf Copper’s\n\nCOGS deduction.\n\n               After concluding its audit, the Comptroller determined that Gulf Copper had:\n\n(1) $163,303 in allowed revenue exclusions,10 and (2) a total COGS deduction of $77,140,769. As\n\na consequence of moving the subcontractor payments from the (g)(3) revenue exclusion, Gulf\n\n\n       10\n           This number is the difference between the total flow-through revenue exclusions Gulf\nCopper originally took minus the $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments the Comptroller\ndetermined were not properly excluded from revenue as qualifying flow-through funds under the\n(g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n                                                 7\n\fCopper’s apportionment factor increased from 0.8808 to 0.9353. The Comptroller thus calculated\n\nthat Gulf Copper had an additional franchise tax obligation for franchise-tax report year 2009 of\n\n$692,626.66. Gulf Copper paid the assessed deficiency plus interest (a total of $838,118.00) under\n\nprotest. See Tex. Tax Code § 112.051. Along with its protest payment, Gulf Copper submitted\n\na letter to the Comptroller outlining its reasons for claiming the (g)(3) revenue exclusion for\n\nsubcontractor payments and explaining its method of calculating its COGS deduction. Gulf Copper\n\nsubsequently filed the underlying lawsuit, seeking a refund of all amounts paid under protest. Gulf\n\nCopper maintained that it was entitled to take the (g)(3) revenue exclusion based on the nature of its\n\nbusiness activities and its contractual obligations to make the excluded payments to subcontractors\n\nwho were performing activities in connection with oil and gas well construction and improvement.\n\nGulf Copper asserted that the subcontractors were engaged in providing services, labor, and materials\n\nin the form of manufacturing, constructing, developing, improving, creating, and installing\n\ncomponent parts for offshore drilling rigs used to construct, remodel, or repair oil and gas wells,\n\nwhich it contended are improvements on real property. Gulf Copper claimed that the payments to\n\nits subcontractors satisfied the statutory prerequisites for claiming the (g)(3) revenue exclusion\n\nbecause (1) the payments were mandated by contract, (2) to be paid to an entity other than Gulf\n\nCopper (the taxable entity), and (3) the funds paid to the subcontractors were for the provision of\n\n“services, labor, or materials in connection with the actual or proposed . . . construction, remodeling,\n\nremediation, or repair of improvements on real property.” See id. § 171.1011(g)(3).11\n\n\n        11\n          Relatedly, Gulf Copper asserted that, by refusing to allow Gulf Copper to claim the\nsubcontractor payments as a revenue exclusion, the Comptroller had erroneously increased Gulf\nCopper’s apportionment factor from 0.8808 to 0.9353.\n\n                                                   8\n\f               Gulf Copper also asserted that the Comptroller had improperly limited the costs that\n\ncould be included in the calculation of its COGS deduction. Gulf Copper challenged the Comptroller’s\n\nconclusion that none of Gulf Copper’s expenses could be included in COGS pursuant to Texas\n\nTax Code subsection 171.1012(i). This subsection provides that “[a] taxable entity furnishing\n\nlabor or materials to a project for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial\n\nmaintenance [] of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may\n\ninclude the costs, as allowed by [section 171.1012], in the computation of cost of goods sold.” Id.\n\n§ 171.1012(i); see Hegar v.

(taxable entity that provides “labor and\n\nmaterials” to project for the construction or improvement of real property, which includes oil and\n\ngas wells, is entitled to include costs of that labor and materials, as allowed by section 171.1012, in\n\ncomputation of its cost of goods sold and deduct that amount from its total revenue to calculate its\n\n“margin” for franchise-tax purposes); Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 54-57 (holding that, under Texas\n\nTax Code subsection 171.1012(i), certain labor expenses of subsidiary that does not itself produce\n\n“goods” but that does supply labor to projects for construction of real property improvements may\n\nbe included in combined entity’s COGS calculation, and that term “labor” in statute encompasses\n\nwide range of labor expenses, including those associated with activities that might also be described\n\nas “services”). The Comptroller had concluded that Gulf Copper did not have any expenses that\n\ncould be included in the calculation of the COGS deduction by virtue of being costs of labor or\n\nmaterials furnished to a project for construction or improvement of real property under section\n\n171.1012(i) and, consequently, it could only include in its COGS calculation the direct and some\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\findirect costs of acquiring or producing “goods.”12 See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(c), (d), (f). In\n\nthe Comptroller’s view, each of Gulf Copper’s facilities13 was engaged in both fabrication and non-\n\nfabrication activities and only the costs of labor and materials associated with the fabrication\n\nactivities were “costs of acquiring or producing goods” that could properly be included in calculating\n\nthe COGS deduction.\n\n               At trial, the evidence concerning Gulf Copper’s business operations was essentially\n\nundisputed. The parties joined issue, however, on whether the subcontractor payments qualified for\n\nthe (g)(3) revenue exclusion as payments made “to provide services, labor, or materials in connection\n\nwith the actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, remediation, or repair of improvements\n\non real property.” See id. § 171.1011(g)(3). The Comptroller took the position that the work the\n\nsubcontractors performed was “two steps away” from actual or proposed construction of\n\nimprovements on real property and therefore was too “remote or attenuated” from any actual or\n\nproposed construction to meet the “in connection with” requirement to qualify for the (g)(3) revenue\n\nexclusion. In the alternative, the Comptroller argued that if the subcontractor payments met the “in\n\nconnection with” requirement, only a portion of those payments ($32 million of the $79.4 million\n\ntotal) met the requirement that they be “mandated by contract” to be distributed to other entities. See\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          “Goods” are defined as “real or tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of\nbusiness of a taxable entity.” Tex Tax. Code § 171.1012(a)(1). “Tangible personal property” does\nnot include intangible property or services. Id. § 171.1012(a)(3)(B).\n       13\n          Gulf Copper’s facilities include yards in Galveston, Port Arthur, and Corpus Christi. Gulf\nCopper also owns Sabine Surveyors, which the Comptroller determined provided only services and\nthus did not incur any costs related to acquiring or producing goods that could be included in the\ncalculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction.\n\n                                                  10\n\fid. § 171.1011(g). The parties also continued to be in sharp disagreement about the correct method\n\nfor calculating Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction.\n\n               After a three day bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment in Gulf Copper’s favor\n\nand ordered the State to refund the entire amount paid under protest. The trial court also made the\n\nfollowing relevant findings of fact:\n\n\n       FOF 2: Sabine Surveyors is a limited partnership primarily engaged in the business\n       of marine vessel surveying.\n\n       FOF 9: Gulf Copper’s customers are primarily rig owners and drilling contractors\n       who use their offshore rigs to drill for oil and gas on behalf of exploration and\n       production (“E&P”) companies.\n\n       FOF 10: Gulf Copper is primarily engaged in the business of surveying,\n       manufacturing, upgrading, and repairing offshore drilling rigs.\n\n       FOF 12: Gulf Copper repairs rigs by removing defective portions, manufacturing\n       replacement components, and installing the replacement components onto the rigs.\n       Gulf Copper also manufactures and installs new components for rigs that do not\n       replace an existing component.\n\n       FOF 15: In completing its work, Gulf Copper utilizes all aspects and the entire\n       breadth of its facility yards, whether the rig sits on the dry docks, in the yard, or in\n       the water. This includes the lay down areas, the warehouses, the fabrication shops,\n       the welding areas, and the stacking areas.\n\n       FOF 16: Gulf Copper’s work enables the rigs (1) to meet and maintain the\n       certification requirements imposed by classification societies, (2) to comply with\n       governing regulations, and (3) to satisfy an exploration and production (“E&P”)\n       company’s contractual requirements for a specific drilling project.\n\n       FOF 17: A rig cannot be used for drilling unless it is properly certified, compliant,\n       and satisfies the contractual requirements for the project.\n\n       FOF 19: Rig owners do not hire Gulf Copper to repair or upgrade their rigs or\n       manufacture new components unless they have a revenue-generating contract in\n       place for the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells.\n\n                                                 11\n\f       FOF 20: Offshore drilling rigs are necessary and essential to the drilling of offshore\n       oil and gas wells because the wells could not be drilled without the drilling rigs.\n\n\nThe State then perfected this appeal. The State’s three appellate issues reduce to a challenge to the\n\ntrial court’s judgment on the grounds that (1) the trial court erroneously agreed that Gulf Copper\n\ncould exclude from its revenue the $79.4 million in subcontractor payments pursuant to the (g)(3)\n\nrevenue exclusion and (2) the trial court erred by concluding that Gulf Copper’s COGS calculation\n\nwas correct, leading to an oversized COGS deduction, regardless of whether the subcontractor\n\npayments were considered in the COGS calculation rather than excluded from revenue.\n\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\nEligibility of Subcontractor Payments for the (g)(3) Revenue Exclusion\n\n               The (g)(3) revenue exclusion requires that a taxpayer exclude from total revenue\n\ncertain flow-through funds “that are mandated by contract to be distributed to other entities.”14\n\nDuring franchise tax year 2009, Gulf Copper used subcontractors to perform a significant portion\n\nof the work it did for its customers. There were essentially two types of subcontractors working for\n\n\n       14\n           Effective January 1, 2014, section 171.1011(g)(3) was amended to require the exclusion\nof “flow-through funds that are mandated by contract or subcontract to be distributed to other\nentities” and that are “subcontracting payments made under a contract or subcontract entered\ninto by the taxable entity to provide services, labor, or materials in connection with the actual or\nproposed design, construction, remodeling, remediation, or repair of improvements on real property\nor the location of the boundaries of real property.” Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g)(3) (emphases\nadded). The bill analysis for this enactment indicates that the amendment was proposed in response\nto the Comptroller’s interpretation of section 171.1011(g)(3) as “allowing an entity to exclude\nsubcontracting payments only when the entity has a contract in place that states that a specific\nportion of the work will be subcontracted” because the Comptroller’s interpretation was not\nconsistent with the practices of the affected industry. Senate Research Ctr., Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B.\n2766, 83d Leg., R.S. 2013.\n\n                                                 12\n\fGulf Copper. First, there were “labor” subcontractors that provided workers who performed the\n\nsame types of tasks performed by Gulf Copper’s employees. Hale testified that Gulf Copper used\n\na significant number of workers provided by “labor” subcontractors in franchise tax year 2009\n\nbecause there was both (1) an increased volume of work due to increased offshore drilling activity\n\nand (2) displacement of a portion of Gulf Copper’s regular workforce caused by hurricanes in the\n\narea. According to Hale, Gulf Copper was required to look outside its geographical region and\n\nlocate subcontractors who could provide welders, fitters, and other workers to work alongside\n\nGulf Copper’s employees. The “labor” subcontractors charged Gulf Copper a rate of $35 to $38\n\nper hour per worker.15 Gulf Copper in turn billed its customers for work performed by the “labor”\n\nsubcontractors’ workers at a rate of $54 per hour per worker. Gulf Copper included as “flow-through\n\nfunds” in its (g)(3) revenue exclusion only the $35 to $38 per hour per worker it paid the “labor”\n\nsubcontractor supplying the workers. The remaining $16 to $19 per hour Gulf Copper received\n\nfrom its customers for work done by workers provided by the “labor” subcontractors was not\n\nincluded in the (g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n                The second type of subcontractor was “outside specialty” subcontractors hired to\n\nprovide workers to perform certain specialized tasks such as finishing out the accommodations on\n\na rig or doing electrical work. The “outside specialty” subcontractors were, at times, designated to\n\nbe used for certain tasks by the customers, who had preexisting relationships with those subcontractors.\n\nGulf Copper charged its customers for the work done by the “outside specialty” subcontractors an\n\namount 15 to 20 percent greater than the amount the “outside specialty” subcontractor charged\n\n\n       15\n         The record does not reflect what portion of the hourly rate that the “labor” subcontractors\ncharged Gulf Copper for its workers was ultimately paid to the workers themselves.\n\n                                                  13\n\fGulf Copper. Gulf Copper included as “flow-through funds” in its (g)(3) revenue exclusion only\n\nthe amount it paid to the “outside specialty” subcontractor and did not include the additional revenue\n\nit received from its customers as a result of the 15 to 20 percent upcharge.\n\n               On appeal the State agrees, as it did at trial, that the amounts paid to the “outside\n\nspecialty” subcontractors constitute flow-through funds mandated by contract to be distributed to\n\nother entities and may be included in the (g)(3) revenue exclusion. With respect to payments to the\n\n“labor” subcontractors, however, the State maintains that because Gulf Copper’s contracts with its\n\ncustomers do not “mandate that their payments flow through Gulf Copper to the subcontractors\n\nproviding the regular labor” those payments do not qualify for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n               The State’s position is contrary to the plain language of the statute and to this Court’s\n\nprevious holding in Titan Transportation. The statute requires Gulf Copper to exclude from its total\n\nrevenue calculation certain flow-through funds that were mandated by contract to be distributed to\n\nother entities. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g). As this Court held in Titan Transportation, the\n\n“mandate” may be contained in either a contract with the customer or in a contract with the\n\nsubcontractor. See Titan Transp., 433 S.W.3d at 641. An agreement between Gulf Copper and a\n\n“labor” subcontractor constitutes a contract. The evidence and exhibits admitted at trial, including\n\ncontracts with the “labor” subcontractors who supplied the individuals performing the regular\n\nlabor, establish that Gulf Copper was obligated by those contracts to pay the “labor” subcontractors\n\nfor that labor.16 Thus, Gulf Copper was contractually obligated to pass on to the “labor”\n\n\n       16\n          For example, Gulf Copper’s Master Service Agreement with Maxum Industries, LLC, a\n“labor” subcontractor, contains the following provision:\n\n       [Gulf Copper] shall pay [Maxum Industries, LLC], subject to [Gulf Copper’s]\n\n                                                  14\n\fsubcontractors—other entities of the type referenced in the statute—a fixed portion of the customer’s\n\n$54 per hour per worker payment, typically between $35 and $38 per hour per worker. Gulf Copper’s\n\ncontracts with its “labor” subcontractors satisfy “the statutory requirement that qualifying payments\n\nbe contractually mandated to someone other than the taxpayer.” Id.17\n\n               The Comptroller also maintains that the $79,405,230 in subcontractor payments\n\ndo not qualify for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion because the work done in exchange for those\n\npayments was too remote or attenuated to constitute the provision of “services, labor, or materials\n\nin connection with the actual or proposed design, construction, remodeling, remediation, or repair\n\nof improvements on real property.” Tex. Tax Code § 171.1011(g)(3). Specifically, the Comptroller\n\nargues that, although Gulf Copper’s work on the rigs adds value to the rigs, that work does not itself\n\nadd value to any actual or proposed construction of oil wells, which it concedes are improvements\n\non real property. The Comptroller points out that Gulf Copper does not have contracts with and is\n\nnot liable to the exploration and production companies that actually drill the oil wells and does not\n\n\n\n       verification that [Maxum Industries, LLC] has complied with all terms and conditions\n       of this Agreement and any applicable Purchase Order. In the event [Gulf Copper]\n       should dispute any part of an invoice, undisputed portions thereof shall be paid;\n       and upon resolution of all disputed items, a supplemental invoice will be submitted\n       to [Gulf Copper] for payment.\n\nAn email exchange between principals from Gulf Copper and Maxum Industries, LLC provides the\nhourly rates Gulf Copper was to pay for welders, fitters, superintendents, and leadmen, ranging from\n$36.50 to $37.50 per hour.\n       17\n           As this Court noted in Titan Transportation, “an evident purpose of the (g)(3) revenue\nexclusion is to prevent double taxation of funds that are not truly gain or income to the taxpayer.”\nTitan Transp., LP v. Combs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, pet. denied). That\npurpose is served when, as here, the taxpayer excludes from its revenue the portion of payments\nreceived that it must pass on to another entity.\n\n                                                 15\n\fperform any work on the oil wells themselves. According to the Comptroller, the fact that Gulf\n\nCopper is “two steps removed” from the construction of the improvement on real property itself (the\n\noil well) precludes it from falling within the “logical limit” the Legislature intended to impose on\n\nthe phrase “in connection with” used in the statute.\n\n               This Court has previously described the phrase “in connection with” as one “of\n\nintentional breadth,” but not without “logical limit.” Titan Transp., 433 S.W.3d at 637. The Court\n\ndelineated the contours of the “in connection with” requirement as follows:\n\n\n       As used in former section 171.1011(g)(3), the phrase “in connection with” can only\n       be read as requiring some reasonable nexus between the services, labor, and materials\n       for which the taxpayer pays a subcontractor and “the actual or proposed design,\n       construction, remodeling, or repair of improvements on real property or the location\n       of boundaries of real property.” [] Given its context, the only plausible interpretation\n       of the “in connection with” language employed in the (g)(3) revenue exclusion is that\n       there must be a reasonable—i.e., more than tangential or incidental—relationship\n       between the activities delineated in the statute and the services, labor, or materials\n       for which the subcontractors receive payment. . . . The critical inquiry [] is whether\n       the services, labor, or materials provided have a reasonable connection to\n       construction, remodeling, design, or repair work on real property.\n\n\nId. at 638-39. The inquiry, then, is whether the activities performed by the subcontractors for Gulf\n\nCopper have a reasonable connection to the construction of oil wells, which we have held, and the\n\nparties do not dispute, are improvements on real property. See Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 53\n\n(drilling of oil and gas well is “project for construction and improvement of real property”).\n\n               The evidence at trial showed that the workers supplied to Gulf Copper by the “labor”\n\nsubcontractors performed essentially the same activities as Gulf Copper’s employees in its\n\nyards. Thus, those workers were engaged in activities that resulted in the offshore drilling rigs’\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f(1) obtaining and maintaining the certification requirements imposed by marine classification\n\nsocieties, (2) complying with regulations, both state and federal, applicable to offshore drilling rigs\n\nand their operations, and (3) meeting the requirements imposed by contracts entered into between\n\nexploration and production companies and the drilling rigs’ owners related to specific drilling\n\nprojects. In our view, it is evident that doing work on offshore drilling rigs—equipment that is\n\nundisputedly integral to drilling offshore wells—that renders them able to perform the drilling\n\nservices required to drill a particular oil well is an activity that is reasonably connected to the\n\nconstruction of that oil well. Thus, at least part of the work done by the subcontractors plainly meets\n\nthe (g)(3) revenue exclusion’s requirement that it be “in connection with” construction of an\n\nimprovement on real property.\n\n               Whether performing work that makes a rig compliant with general requirements\n\nimposed by marine classification societies or with state and federal regulations generally applicable\n\nto offshore drilling rigs and their operations presents a closer question. Arguably, readying an\n\noffshore drilling rig for use on offshore drilling projects generally might not be sufficiently related\n\nto the “actual or proposed” construction of an improvement to real property to meet the (g)(3)\n\nrevenue exclusion requirement. Likewise, it could be argued that a drilling rig’s compliance with\n\nrules and regulations that permit it to operate offshore generally is incidental or tangential to the\n\n“actual or proposed” construction of a particular offshore well. We need not, however, address\n\nsuch arguments here because the Comptroller’s position is that all subcontractor payments were\n\nfor work too attenuated to qualify for the (g)(3) revenue exclusion by virtue of the work being\n\n“two steps” away from the actual drilling of oil wells. The State made no distinctions among the\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fsubcontractors’ various activities but rather took the position that, as a matter of law, Gulf Copper\n\nwas not entitled to take the (g)(3) revenue exclusion at all. Thus, the State has failed to preserve the\n\nargument that while Gulf Copper may have been permitted to claim a (g)(3) revenue exclusion for\n\nsome of its subcontractor payments, other subcontractor payments were for work too attenuated to\n\nan actual or proposed project to qualify. On this record, there is sufficient evidence to support the\n\ntrial court’s conclusion that Gulf Copper was entitled to include the $79,405,230 in payments to\n\nsubcontractors as flow-through funds falling within the (g)(3) revenue exclusion.\n\n                Having concluded that the subcontractor payments qualified for the (g)(3) revenue\n\nexclusion, we turn now to Gulf Copper’s calculation of its COGS deduction to determine whether\n\nthe trial court’s finding that Gulf Copper was entitled to claim a COGS deduction of $72,711,734\n\nwhen calculating its margin for franchise tax purposes was supported by factually sufficient evidence.\n\n\nGulf Copper’s Calculation of the COGS Deduction\n\n                The COGS deduction is calculated in accordance with Texas Tax Code section\n\n171.1012. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012 (determination of cost of goods sold). Section 171.1012\n\ndefines “goods” to mean “real or tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of business\n\nof a taxable entity” and provides that “tangible personal property” does not include services. Id.\n\n§171.1012(a)(1), (3)(B)(iii). Section 171.1012 provides that an entity may take a COGS deduction\n\nfor “all direct costs of acquiring or producing the goods,” including labor costs, “costs of materials\n\nthat are an integral part of” the goods, “handling costs, including costs attributable to processing,\n\nassembling, repackaging, and inbound transportation costs,” storage costs, and costs of renting,\n\nleasing, maintaining, and repairing equipment, facilities, or real property directly used for production\n\n                                                  18\n\fof the goods. Id. § 171.1012(c).18 A taxable entity may also take a COGS deduction for post-\n\nproduction direct costs, including storage and handling provided for by subsection (c), and for\n\nindirect or administrative overhead costs allocable to the acquisition or production of goods, up to\n\nfour percent of the entity’s total indirect or administrative overhead costs. Id. § 171.1012(d), (f).19\n\nSpecifically excluded from COGS eligibility are the cost of renting or leasing equipment, facilities,\n\nor real property not used for the production of “goods,” “selling costs, including employee expenses\n\nrelated to sales,” “distribution costs, including outbound transportation costs,” and rehandling costs.\n\nId. § 171.1012(e). Also excluded are advertising costs, idle facility expenses, bidding costs, interest,\n\nincome taxes, strike expenses, officer compensation, and compensation paid to undocumented\n\nworkers. Id.\n\n                A COGS deduction is generally available only to the taxable entity that owns\n\nthe “goods” in question. Id. § 171.1012(i).

Thus, provided the activity is “an essential\n\nand direct component” of the project for construction or improvement of real property, the associated\n\ncosts may, through application of subsection 171.1012(i), be included in the COGS deduction even\n\nif the activity might be in the nature of a “service.” See Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 56 (trial court\n\ncould reasonably have concluded that removal and disposal of waste material was labor furnished\n\nto project for construction of oil and gas well based on trial testimony that this activity was essential\n\nto continue drilling of oil and gas well).\n\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f               In calculating its COGS deduction, Gulf Copper did not engage in a cost-by-cost\n\nanalysis of each expense to determine whether it fit into one of the categories of costs the statute\n\nprovides may properly be included in the calculation of cost of goods sold, see Tex. Tax Code\n\n§ 171.1012(c), (d), (f), nor did it employ the analytic framework described above to determine\n\nwhether its particular activities that involved furnishing labor to a project for construction or\n\nimprovement of real property (as opposed to its activities that produced “goods”) were “an essential\n\nand direct component” of a particular project, see id. § 171.1012(i). Rather, Gulf Copper took the\n\nposition that it is a taxable entity “eligible” to take a COGS deduction both because it is the owner\n\nof goods (i.e., tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of its business) and because it\n\nfurnishes labor and materials for the construction or improvement of real property. Then, relying\n\non subsection 171.1012(h), which provides that “[a] taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods\n\nsold, except as otherwise provided by this section, in accordance with the methods used on the\n\nfederal income tax return on which the report under this chapter is based,” id. § 171.1012(h),\n\nGulf Copper used as a “starting point” for its COGS calculation the trial balance (a summary of\n\nall transactions for the accounting year) that it used to prepare its federal income tax return. Gulf\n\nCopper explained: “When Gulf Copper applied its federal income tax methods to its transactional\n\ndata (revenues generated and costs incurred), the result represented Gulf Copper’s COGS for federal\n\nincome tax purposes. [] For federal income tax purposes, Gulf Copper qualifies a [sic] producer of\n\ngoods and, thus, must calculate its federal COGS pursuant to the accounting method imposed\n\nby Internal Revenue Code Section 236A.”20 From the dollar amount of the COGS deduction it\n\n\n       20\n           Gulf Copper states that “it appears our Legislature used the corresponding treasury\nregulation (C.F.R. § 1.236A-1) as an outline to draft the COGS statute.”\n\n                                                 21\n\fcalculated for federal income tax purposes, Gulf Copper excluded costs that it determined constituted\n\ncosts expressly excluded from the state COGS deduction by subsections 171.1012(e) and (f). Id.\n\n§ 171.1012(e) (list of costs in relation to taxable entity’s goods that may not be included in COGS\n\ncalculation); (f) (taxable entity may include only four percent of taxable entity’s total indirect or\n\nadministrative overhead costs in COGS calculation). Gulf Copper stated that it:\n\n\n        did not parse the costs associated with its integrated business activities because doing\n        so would violate (1) its federal income tax methods; (2) the economic realities of\n        Gulf Copper’s business (i.e., it takes all of the activities and their associated costs to\n        generate the taxable revenue); (3) its accounting system (which captures a host of\n        financial data necessary to operate the business but does not segregate its single\n        integrated activity–rig repair–and its costs into component steps; (4) its combined\n        group status; and (5) the Legislature’s goal of taxing margin (because diluting Gulf\n        Copper’s ability to deduct its costs generates a tax on revenue).\n\n\nThus, Gulf Copper’s failure to examine, on an item-by-item basis, whether a cost could properly be\n\nincluded in the COGS calculation under the Texas Tax Code was based on (1) its belief that it was\n\nrequired by section 171.1012(h) to start with its federal COGS calculation and (2) the logistical\n\ndifficulties, given its business model and its accounting systems, of performing that task.\n\n                We first consider whether Texas Tax Code subsection 171.1012(h) directs a taxable\n\nentity to use its federal income tax COGS deduction as the starting point for its calculation of the\n\nTexas franchise tax COGS deduction.21 Texas Tax Code subsection 171.1012(h) provides:\n\n\n        21\n            This presents a question of statutory construction that we review de novo.

For example, an entity using the cash-basis accounting method records its\nexpenses in its accounts when it actually pays the cash and books revenues when it actually receives\npayment. An entity using the accrual accounting method records revenue when the transaction is\ncompleted—e.g., when the work specified in a contract between the entity and its customer is\ncompleted—instead of when it actually receives payment. The entity handles expenses in the same\nmanner by recording them when they have been incurred rather than when payment is actually made.\nSee E. McGruder Faris, Jr., Accounting for Lawyers 75-84 (3d ed. 1975). The cash method and the\naccrual method are two of the methods a taxpayer may use to compute its taxable income for federal\n\n                                                  24\n\fconfirms this conclusion. Subsection 171.1012(b) requires that a taxable entity that elects to subtract\n\ncost of goods sold for the purpose of computing its taxable margin “determine the amount of that\n\ncost of goods sold as provided by [section 171.1012],” whereas subsection (h) requires that a taxable\n\nentity “determine its cost of goods sold [] in accordance with the methods used on the federal income\n\ntax return.” Cf. Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012(b), with id. § 171.1012(h). Thus, subsection 171.1012(b)\n\naddresses how to calculate the amount of the COGS deduction while subsection (h) clarifies that\n\nthe taxable entity must use the same accounting method—either cash basis or accrual—when\n\ndetermining whether a particular COGS-deduction-eligible expense should be included in that tax\n\nyear’s COGS calculation.23\n\n               We also observe that by using its federal income tax COGS deduction as the “starting\n\npoint,” Gulf Copper offered insufficient evidence that the expenses included in that calculation\n\nactually correspond to the types and categories of expenses permitted to be included in the\n\ncalculation of a taxable entity’s state franchise tax COGS deduction pursuant to section 171.1012.\n\nTo the extent the federal COGS calculation includes expenses that are not eligible for the state\n\nCOGS deduction, such as costs that do not qualify under the state statute as direct costs of “acquiring\n\n\n\ntax purposes. See 26 U.S.C. § 446(c) (taxpayer may compute taxable income under cash receipts and\ndisbursement method, accrual method, any other method permitted by statute, or any combination\nof foregoing methods permitted under regulations prescribed by Secretary of Treasury).\n       23\n           The main difference between accrual and cash basis accounting is the timing of when\nrevenue and expenses are recognized. Under the cash method, the taxable entity generally deducts\nexpenses in the tax year in which it actually paid them. Under the accrual method, expenses may\nbe deducted when they are incurred. See 26 C.F.R. § 1.466-1 (general rule for methods of\naccounting). Thus, an expense that might be recognized and included in the COGS deduction\ncalculation in a particular tax year when using the accrual accounting method might not qualify for\ninclusion in the same tax year when using the cash basis accounting method.\n\n                                                  25\n\for producing” the “goods,” the result of using that calculation as a starting point is the overinclusion\n\nof expenses in the calculation of the COGS deduction for state franchise tax purposes. Gulf Copper’s\n\nmethod for calculating its state COGS deduction fails to provide evidence that the expenses included\n\nin its starting point (the federal COGS deduction) are deductions that are also permitted to be\n\nincluded in the calculation of the COGS deduction under the state statute.\n\n                Also unpersuasive is Gulf Copper’s argument that its interpretation permits it to\n\navoid the “incredibly burdensome” task of identifying which of the expenses of its integrated business\n\nactivities actually constitute a cost of “acquiring or producing” a “good” such that it is eligible to be\n\nincluded in the calculation of its COGS deduction.

A\n\ntaxable entity is offered three alternative methods for determining its margin under the Texas franchise\n\ntax statute: (1) 70% of total revenue from the entity’s total business; (2) subtracting from total\n\nrevenue the costs of goods sold as determined under section 171.1012; or (3) subtracting from total\n\nrevenue compensation as determined under section 171.1013. See Tex. Tax Code § 171.101(a).\n\nGulf Copper’s choice was to subtract from its calculation of total revenue its COGS deduction. The\n\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fburden on Gulf Copper of calculating the proper amount of that deduction may be an indication that\n\none of the different methods of determining its taxable margin is the better choice. The burden on\n\nthe entity making the calculation cannot dictate the applicability or the amount of the deduction\n\nallowed; we must enforce the statute as written.\n\n                The plain language of section 171.1012 confirms that calculating the COGS deduction\n\nfor Texas franchise tax purposes requires a cost-by-cost analysis to determine whether the cost fits\n\none of the types and categories eligible for inclusion in the calculation. “[T]he Cost of Goods Sold\n\nincludes ‘all direct costs of acquiring or producing goods,’ some indirect costs like insurance, utilities,\n\nand quality control, and up to 4% of other ‘indirect or administrative overhead costs.’” In re Nestle\n\nUSA, 387 S.W.3d at 615 (citations omitted). Because Gulf Copper’s calculation of its COGS\n\ndeduction did not conform to the statute, we reverse the trial court’s finding that for report year\n\n2009, Gulf Copper incurred expenses eligible to be included in the cost of goods sold subtraction\n\nin the amount of $152,116,96424 as lacking factually sufficient evidentiary support.25 We also\n\nreverse the finding that “[t]he categories, classifications, locations and amounts of the costs eligible\n\nto be included in the cost of goods subtraction are accurately stated in Exhibit 56.”\n\n\n\n\n        24\n           This number assumes that the subcontractor payments are not excluded from total revenue\nbut, instead, are included in the COGS deduction.\n        25\n          Although the State did not frame its appellate issue as a factual sufficiency challenge, the\nComptroller has acknowledged that Gulf Copper is entitled to take a COGS deduction of some\namount. The State requested that, in the event this Court does not accept the Comptroller’s method\nof calculating Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction, we remand the case to the trial court for further\nproceedings to determine Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction by application of a proper interpretation\nof section 171.1012 to the evidence before the trial court.\n\n                                                    27\n\f                Our analysis of the COGS deduction issue does not end here, however, because the\n\nState likewise presented the trial court with a flawed view of what qualifies for inclusion in Gulf\n\nCopper’s calculation of its COGS deduction, as explained below.\n\n\nThe Comptroller’s Calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS Deduction\n\n                The Comptroller performed its own calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction\n\nas follows. First, the Comptroller determined that Gulf Copper had no expenses that qualified for\n\nthe COGS deduction by virtue of subsection 171.1012(i). That is, it concluded that none of Gulf\n\nCopper’s costs were associated with labor and materials “furnished to a project for the construction,\n\nimprovement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance of real property.” See Tex. Tax Code\n\n§ 171.1012(i). Thus, the Comptroller did not consider whether any of Gulf Copper’s costs were for\n\nlabor and materials furnished to a qualifying project or were associated with activities that might\n\notherwise be viewed as “services” but might nevertheless be eligible for inclusion in the COGS\n\ndeduction calculation because they were an “essential and direct component of the ‘project for\n\nconstruction . . . of real property.’” See id.; CGG Veritas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1039054</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3; Newpark Res.,\n\n422 S.W.3d at 56. Next, the Comptroller determined that only activities involving “fabrication” of\n\nitems sold to Gulf Copper’s customers should be included in the COGS calculation. Because Gulf\n\nCopper’s accounting records did not differentiate between the costs of what the Comptroller deemed\n\nto be “fabrication” and what it deemed to be simply “installation” or other non-production related\n\nactivities,26 the Comptroller decided to use Gulf Copper’s labor records as a proxy for all of its costs\n\n\n       26\n         The Legislature recently amended the definition of “production” contained in Texas Tax\nCode section 171.1012(a).

The\n\nComptroller then reviewed each type of Gulf Copper’s expenses for each facility and, if the\n\nComptroller concluded that the type of expense was one that was generally eligible for inclusion in\n\nthe COGS calculation it allowed it on the percentage basis assigned to the facility where the activity\n\ngenerating the expense occurred. For example, the Comptroller allowed 50% of the labor costs\n\nassociated with the Port Arthur facility because labor is identified in subsection 171.1012(c) as a cost\n\nof goods sold, but only to the extent it is a direct cost of acquiring or producing a good. Having\n\ndetermined that 50% of the Port Arthur yard activities were “fabrication,” the Comptroller\n\ndetermined that 50% of the labor costs at that facility were a direct cost of producing a good. The\n\nComptroller analyzed all of Gulf Copper’s expenses in this general manner unless it was apparent\n\nthat the expense was entirely related to producing goods, such as cost of materials.

Tax Code § 171.1012(a)(2)).\nThe amendment provides that, effective September 1, 2017, “‘production’ means construction,\nmanufacture, development, mining, extraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth.” Id. The\npre-amendment definition provides that production “includes construction, installation, manufacture,\ndevelopment, mining, extraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth.” The amended version\nreplaces the word “includes” with the word “means” and eliminates “installation” from the\ndefinition of “production.” The Legislature’s note to the amendment states that the amendment “is\na clarification of existing law and does not imply that Section 171.1012, Tax Code, before the\namendment made by this Act may be construed as inconsistent with Section 171.1012, Tax\nCode, as amended by this Act.” Act of May 19, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., ch. 377, § 2, 2107 Tex. Sess.\nLaw Serv. ch. 377.\n\n                                                  29\n\fdid not allow any of the costs incurred by Sabine Surveyors because it determined that this entity\n\nperformed only services.27\n\n               The trial court concluded that “[t]he limitations imposed by the Comptroller upon\n\nGulf Copper’s cost of goods sold calculation violate Tex. Tax Code § 171.1012.” We agree. The\n\nComptroller’s calculation of Gulf Copper’s COGS deduction is inconsonant with section 171.1012\n\nin two ways. First, we do not agree with the Comptroller that none of Gulf Copper’s expenses\n\nqualify for inclusion in its COGS calculation by virtue of subsection 171.1012(i). For example, Gulf\n\nCopper presented evidence at trial that, to some extent, Gulf Copper’s employees provided labor\n\nand materials to projects for improvement of real property (drilling oil wells). The Comptroller was\n\nobligated to consider to what extent the activities of Gulf Copper’s employees were essential and\n\ndirect components of those specific projects. See CGG Veritas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1039054</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. Sabine\n\nSurveyors also performed activities that, while constituting activities that might be described as a\n\n“service,” are an “essential and direct component” of a project for construction of real property.\n\nSuch activities include conducting surveys of rigs in order to ensure compliance with requirements\n\nspecific to a particular drilling project. Other of Sabine Surveyors’ activities, such as performing\n\nvessel surveys for underwriters, might be so attenuated that the costs of those activities would not\n\nconstitute the cost of furnishing labor and materials to a project. Sabine Surveyors’ costs should\n\nhave been analyzed on a cost-by-cost basis to determine which of those costs met the requirement\n\nthat they be integral, essential, and direct components of the offshore drilling process and which\n\n\n       27\n          Implicit in the 0% assigned to Sabine Surveyors is the Comptroller’s determination that\nnone of its costs could be included in Gulf Copper’s COGS calculation by virtue of subsection\n171.1012(i).\n\n                                                30\n\fmight be “too far removed from the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial\n\nmaintenance of real property to qualify for the cost-of-goods-sold deduction under section\n\n171.1012(i).” Newpark Res., 422 S.W.3d at 57.\n\n               Second, the Comptroller did not calculate the COGS deduction using a cost-by-cost\n\nanalysis but, rather, developed percentages that it then applied to disallow and remove certain costs\n\nfrom the COGS deduction. This methodology is contrary to the cost-by-cost analysis required to\n\ndetermine whether a certain cost fits into a type or category identified in section 171.1012. The\n\nComptroller’s percentages were derived by using labor costs as a proxy for other costs and,\n\nconsequently, there is an insufficient basis for the Comptroller’s allocation of costs as deductible\n\ndirect costs of producing goods.\n\n               Applying a proper construction of section 171.1012, the trial court’s findings that\n\nGulf Copper was entitled to include the entire $152,116,964 amount of its costs in the calculation\n\nof its COGS deduction is erroneous as a matter of law. Gulf Copper did, however, present some\n\nevidence, and the Comptroller does not dispute, that it was entitled to take a COGS deduction and\n\nexclude from its taxable margin a significant amount of its costs. The trial court correctly found that\n\nthe limitations the Comptroller placed on Gulf Copper’s cost of goods sold calculation were contrary\n\nto section 171.1012 for the reasons stated above. The Comptroller’s calculation may not serve as\n\nthe basis for determining Gulf Copper’s taxable margin or, consequently, the amount of any refund\n\nto which it may be entitled. Further proceedings are therefore required to correctly calculate Gulf\n\nCopper’s COGS deduction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\f                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated in this opinion, we conclude that, on this record, Gulf Copper\n\nwas entitled to include the entire $79,405,230 of subcontractor payments in its (g)(3) revenue\n\nexclusion. We also conclude that (1) factually insufficient evidence supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding that Gulf Copper was entitled to include the entire $152,116,964 of its costs in its COGS\n\ndeduction and (2) the Comptroller’s calculation of that deduction is incorrect as a matter of law.\n\nConsequently, we reverse the trial court’s judgment ordering the State to pay Gulf Copper the full\n\namount it paid under protest and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings to\n\ndetermine the exact amount of refund to which Gulf Copper is entitled.\n\n\n\n                                             __________________________________________\n\n                                             Scott K.

Section 3.357) of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or\nmaterials and may include the costs, as allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of goods sold. Solely for\npurposes of this section, a taxable entity shall be treated as the owner of goods being manufactured or produced by the\nentity under a contract with the federal government, including any subcontracts that support a contract with the federal\ngovernment, notwithstanding that the Federal Acquisition Regulation may require that title or risk of loss with respect to\nthose goods be transferred to the federal government before the manufacture or production of those goods is complete.\n\n\n(j) A taxable entity may not make a subtraction under this section for cost of goods sold to the extent the cost of goods\nsold was funded by partner contributions and deducted under Subsection (c)(13).\n\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution that offers loans\nto the public and elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity, other than an entity primarily engaged in an activity\ndescribed by category 5932 of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of\nManagement and Budget, may subtract as a cost of goods sold an amount equal to interest expense. For purposes of this\nsubsection, an entity engaged in lending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production offers loans to the public.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters.

The term does not include the chemical or biological transformation of those materials.\n\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a payment made by one member of an affiliated group to another\nmember of that affiliated group not included in the combined group may be subtracted as a cost of goods sold only if\nit is a transaction made at arm's length.\n\n\n(m) In this section, “arm's length” means the standard of conduct under which entities that are not related parties and\nthat have substantially equal bargaining power, each acting in its own interest, would negotiate or carry out a particular\ntransaction.\n\n\n(n) In this section, “related party” means a person, corporation, or other entity, including an entity that is treated as a\npass-through or disregarded entity for purposes of federal taxation, whether the person, corporation, or entity is subject\nto the tax under this chapter or not, in which one person, corporation, or entity, or set of related persons, corporations,\nor entities, directly or indirectly owns or controls a controlling interest in another entity.\n\n\n(o) If a taxable entity, including a taxable entity with respect to which cost of goods sold is determined pursuant to Section\n171.1014(e)(1), whose principal business activity is film or television production or broadcasting or the distribution of\ntangible personal property described by Subsection (a)(3)(A)(ii), or any combination of these activities, elects to subtract\ncost of goods sold, the cost of goods sold for the taxable entity shall be the costs described in this section in relation to\nthe property and include depreciation, amortization, and other expenses directly related to the acquisition, production,\nor use of the property, including expenses for the right to broadcast or use the property.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters.
