Cloutier, Third-Year Law Student, James Lathrop, Third-\nYear Law Student, WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW, Winston-Salem,\nNorth Carolina, for Appellant.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       James Lester Roudabush, Jr., appeals the district court’s order dismissing his claims\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of\n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), against Appellees Captain F. Milano, Sergeant\n\nRichardson, Deputy Ryan Stern, Sheriff D. Lawhorne, Counselor Graham, Ms. Hilton of\n\nthe United States Marshals Service, and Chief Stearns. The district court granted motions\n\nto dismiss filed by defendants Milano, Lawhorne, Richardson, Graham, and Deputy Stearn,\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and dismissed Roudabush’s claims against\n\nHilton and Chief Stearns pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We affirm in part,\n\nreverse in part, and remand to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       Roudabush is an inmate housed at the Alexandria Detention Center (“ADC”) in\n\nVirginia. He brought this pro se complaint, alleging, inter alia, that the defendants\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his race, engaged in a civil conspiracy to place\n\nhim in administrative segregation when he complained about his disparate treatment, and\n\ndenied him procedural due process by placing him in protective custody in violation of\n\nADC policy without a hearing. *\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         Roudabush originally filed a pro se appeal of the district court’s decisions. We\nappointed counsel to represent him, received additional briefing on the equal protection,\ncivil conspiracy, and due process claims from counsel, and scheduled the case for oral\nargument.\n\n                                              3\n\f       Roudabush’s complaint generally alleges widespread racial discrimination at the\n\nADC against white and Hispanic inmates and in favor of black inmates. According to\n\nRoudabush, black inmates are allowed to have outside food and extra food from the prison\n\nkitchen, are given preferential status on the trustee list, and are given extra and better\n\nrecreational times. In particular, Roudabush alleges that defendant Graham assigns white\n\nand Hispanic inmates to recreation breaks between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., and gives black\n\ninmates recreation time when they want it and with the inmates of their choice. Roudabush\n\nalleges that black inmates are also allowed to choose and change their cells at will and to\n\nhave private cells, whereas white inmates are not allowed to choose their cells, and no\n\nwhite inmates have private cells except when on lockdown. For example, Roudabush\n\nalleges that on September 4, 2013, he was arbitrarily moved from his assigned cell, where\n\nhe could see the television, to an inferior and unclean cell where he could not see the\n\ntelevision, because a black inmate wanted his cell. Roudabush alleges that he complained\n\nto the defendants about this disparate treatment beginning in April 2013, but to no avail.\n\nHe alleges that on September 22, 2013, several black inmates began threatening him and\n\nthat, on September 26, 2013, he was transferred from his unit at ADC to protective custody,\n\nin retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We review a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo. See King v.\n\nRubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016). When evaluating the complaint, the court\n\nmust construe all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Smith\n\nv. Smith, 589 F.3d 736, 738 (4th Cir. 2009). In addition, when a plaintiff files a complaint\n\n                                              4\n\fpro se, the court must construe the pleading requirements liberally. See id. For a complaint\n\nto survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, its “‘[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right\n\nto relief above the speculative level’—that is, the complaint must contain ‘enough facts to\n\nstate a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.’” King, 825 F.3d at 214 (quoting Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570 (2007)); see also De’lonta v. Johnson, 708\n\nF.3d 520, 524 (4th Cir. 2013) (explaining that standards for dismissal under § 1915A for\n\nfailure to state a claim are the same as for Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)). “Bare legal conclusions\n\n‘are not entitled to the assumption of truth’ and are insufficient to state a claim.” King, 825\n\nF.3d at 214 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).\n\n       To succeed on his equal protection claim, Roudabush must first allege facts showing\n\nthat he was treated differently from others who were similarly situated and that such\n\nunequal treatment resulted from intentional or purposeful discrimination. See Veney v.\n\nWyche, 293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir. 2002). Once “he makes this showing, the court\n\nproceeds to determine whether the disparity in treatment can be justified under the requisite\n\nlevel of scrutiny.” Id. at 731 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The district court rejected Roudabush’s racial discrimination claim, stating that\n\nRoudabush’s “only assertion that relates to the treatment that [he] himself received is that\n\nhe was moved from his cell, where the television was visible, to a corner cell, where the\n\ntelevision was not visible,” so that it could be “given to a black inmate who wanted to be\n\nable to view the television.” J.A. 80. As noted above, however, this was not Roudabush’s\n\nonly complaint of disparate treatment. Roudabush also included several allegations that\n\nblack inmates, but not white inmates, were allowed to pick and choose their cells, that\n\n                                              5\n\fwhite and Hispanic inmates were provided with severely restricted recreation times in\n\ncomparison to the black inmates, and that black inmates alone were allowed outside food\n\nand extra food. We are satisfied that these allegations, liberally construed, are sufficient to\n\nallege that the denial of privileges to white inmates, including Roudabush, were racially\n\nmotivated, so as to “nudge [his equal protection claim] across the line from conceivable to\n\nplausible.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred\n\nin dismissing Roudabush’s equal protection claim.\n\n       With regard to Roudabush’s appeal of the district court’s dismissal of his remaining\n\nclaims, including his claims of civil conspiracy and for violation of his due process rights,\n\nwe affirm the district court’s dismissal. Roudabush’s conclusory allegations offered in\n\nsupport of these claims were plainly insufficient to survive the defendants’ motions to\n\ndismiss. See King, 825 F.3d at 214; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s dismissal of Roudabush’s equal\n\nprotection claim and remand for further proceedings. We affirm the district court’s\n\ndismissal of Roudabush’s remaining claims.\n\n                         AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f",
