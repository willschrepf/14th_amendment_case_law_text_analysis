Norman Acker, III, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina, for Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fWYNN, Circuit Judge:\n\n      Plaintiff Paul Scinto, Sr. (“Plaintiff”), a former federal\n\nprisoner,        sued    several     federal       prison    officials       pursuant      to\n\nBivens      v.    Six     Unknown     Named       Agents     of    Federal       Bureau     of\n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging a number of violations\n\nunder    the     Fourth,       Fifth,      Eighth,    and    Fourteenth         Amendments.\n\nDefendants        are    Dr.    Derick     Phillip     (“Dr.      Phillip”);       Patricia\n\nStansberry, former Federal Prison Camp Butner Warden (“Warden\n\nStansberry”);           and     Susan       McClintock,        former      Butner         Camp\n\nAdministrator (“Administrator McClintock”).                        Collectively, these\n\nDefendants successfully moved for summary judgment on all of\n\nPlaintiff’s claims.\n\n      On appeal, Plaintiff limits his arguments to the district\n\ncourt’s      dismissal         of    three        claims     that    Defendants           were\n\ndeliberately indifferent to his medical needs, in violation of\n\nthe   Eighth      Amendment.          Plaintiff       argues      that,    in    dismissing\n\nthese claims, the district court made credibility determinations\n\nand weighed the parties’ evidence, thus violating the summary\n\njudgment standard.\n\n      For      the      reasons     that    follow,     we     reverse     the     district\n\ncourt’s disposition of the two Eighth Amendment claims against\n\nDr.     Phillip         and    Administrator         McClintock      but        affirm    its\n\nresolution of the claim against Warden Stansberry.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                             I.\n\n     The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of “cruel and\n\nunusual        punishments.”          U.S.        Const.     amend.         VIII.          This\n\nprohibition           “proscribes      more        than      physically             barbarous\n\npunishments.”          Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102 (1976).                          It\n\nalso encompasses “the treatment a prisoner receives in prison\n\nand the conditions under which he is confined.”                                 Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (1993).                        In particular, the Eighth\n\nAmendment imposes a duty on prison officials to “provide humane\n\nconditions       of     confinement     . . .       [and]        ensure      that     inmates\n\nreceive    adequate       food,    clothing,       shelter,       and       medical    care.”\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).                              To that end, a\n\nprison    official’s       “deliberate       indifference         to    serious       medical\n\nneeds     of    prisoners        constitutes       the     unnecessary         and     wanton\n\ninfliction       of      pain    proscribed        by      the    Eighth       Amendment.”\n\nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 104 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).        Prisoners alleging that they have been subjected to\n\nunconstitutional          conditions    of        confinement       must      satisfy       the\n\nSupreme Court’s two-pronged test set forth in Farmer v. Brennan,\n\n511 U.S. 825 (1994).\n\n     First,       Farmer’s       “objective”       prong    requires         plaintiffs      to\n\ndemonstrate       that    “the    deprivation       alleged       [was],      objectively,\n\n‘sufficiently         serious.’”       Farmer,       511     U.S.      at    834     (quoting\n\nWilson     v.     Seiter,       501   U.S.        294,     298     (1991)).           To    be\n\n                                             4\n\f“sufficiently        serious,”       the     deprivation        must    be     “extreme”--\n\nmeaning      that   it     poses    “a    serious    or      significant      physical    or\n\nemotional injury resulting from the challenged conditions,” or\n\n“a substantial risk of such serious harm resulting from . . .\n\nexposure to the challenged conditions.”                         De’Lonta v. Angelone,\n\n330 F.3d 630, 634 (4th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).               In medical needs cases, like the case at\n\nbar,    the     Farmer       test        requires    plaintiffs         to     demonstrate\n\nofficials’ deliberate indifference to a “serious” medical need\n\nthat   has    either      “been     diagnosed       by   a    physician      as   mandating\n\ntreatment or . . . is so obvious that even a lay person would\n\neasily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.”                                Iko\n\nv. Shreve, 535 F.3d 225, 241 (4th Cir. 2008).\n\n       Second, under Farmer’s “subjective” prong, plaintiffs must\n\nshow that prison officials acted with a “sufficiently culpable\n\nstate of mind.”             Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (quoting Wilson, 501 U.S. at 297).                            In conditions\n\nof confinement cases, the requisite state of mind is deliberate\n\nindifference.        Id.     To prove deliberate indifference, plaintiffs\n\nmust   show    that       “the    official    kn[ew]       of   and    disregard[ed]      an\n\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety.”                           Id. at 837.        Put\n\ndifferently,        the    plaintiff       must     show     that     the    official    was\n\n“aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed], and . . . dr[ew]\n\n                                              5\n\fth[at]     inference.”              Id.      (emphasis           added).             Deliberate\n\nindifference is “more than mere negligence,” but “less than acts\n\nor omissions [done] for the very purpose of causing harm or with\n\nknowledge     that     harm   will        result.”             Id.    at     835.      It   “lies\n\nsomewhere between negligence and purpose or knowledge: namely,\n\nrecklessness     of     the       subjective        type       used     in       criminal   law.”\n\nBrice v. Va. Beach Corr. Ctr., 58 F.3d 101, 105 (4th Cir. 1995)\n\n(citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835).                          Under this standard, mere\n\n“[d]isagreements        between        an   inmate        and     a    physician       over    the\n\ninmate’s      proper       medical        care”       are       not        actionable       absent\n\nexceptional circumstances.                Wright v. Collins, 766 F.2d 841, 849\n\n(4th Cir. 1985) (citing Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1, 6\n\n(3d Cir. 1970)).\n\n       In deliberate indifference to medical needs cases, Farmer’s\n\nsubjective     prong       requires         proof        of     the    official’s       “actual\n\nsubjective     knowledge          of    both       the        inmate’s       serious    medical\n\ncondition     and    the     excessive         risk      posed        by    [the    official’s]\n\naction or inaction.”               Jackson v. Lightsey, 775 F.3d 170, 178\n\n(4th   Cir.    2014)       (citing       Farmer,         511     U.S.       at    837–39).      A\n\nplaintiff can meet the subjective knowledge requirement through\n\ndirect   evidence       of    a    prison      official’s             actual       knowledge    or\n\ncircumstantial       evidence          tending      to    establish          such    knowledge,\n\nincluding evidence “that a prison official knew of a substantial\n\nrisk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.”                                 Makdessi v.\n\n                                               6\n\fFields, 789 F.3d 126, 133 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Farmer, 511\n\nU.S. at 842).\n\n       A plaintiff also makes out a prima facie case of deliberate\n\nindifference when he demonstrates “that a substantial risk of\n\n[serious harm] was longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or\n\nexpressly      noted    by    prison    officials     in     the   past,   and    the\n\ncircumstances suggest that the defendant-official . . . had been\n\nexposed to information concerning the risk and thus must have\n\nknown about it . . . .”              Parrish ex rel. Lee v. Cleveland, 372\n\nF.3d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 2004) (first alteration in original)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n842).     Similarly, a prison official’s “[f]ailure to respond to\n\nan     inmate’s   known       medical    needs    raises     an    inference     [of]\n\ndeliberate indifference to those needs.”                   Miltier v. Beorn, 896\n\nF.2d    848,   853     (4th   Cir.     1990),    overruled    in   part    on    other\n\ngrounds by Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.               However, even officials who\n\nacted with deliberate indifference may be “free from liability\n\nif they responded reasonably to the risk.”                   Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n844.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                                        II.\n\n      Plaintiff entered federal custody at Federal Prison Camp\n\nSeymour Johnson in October 2002. 1             At that time, he suffered from\n\nmyriad     medical    conditions,      including         hepatitis       C,     a    knee\n\ninfection, insulin-dependent diabetes, and high blood pressure.\n\nIn the years that followed, Plaintiff was confined in various\n\nfederal prison facilities.             In particular, from June 2005 to\n\nMarch 2006, Plaintiff was incarcerated at Federal Prison Camp\n\nButner in Butner, North Carolina.                 During that time, several\n\nincidents       purportedly     occurred   and    gave    rise    to    a    number     of\n\nconstitutional claims.           Following a circuitous journey through\n\nthe federal judicial system, the present appeal addresses only a\n\nsubset of these claims.\n\n      On February 28, 2008, Plaintiff filed a Bivens action pro\n\nse   in   the    United   States    District     Court    for     the    District       of\n\nColumbia.         Plaintiff’s     original     complaint     sought         relief    for\n\nalleged    violations      of    his   rights     under     the    Fourth,          Fifth,\n\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, naming as defendants various\n\nfederal officials, including the Bureau of Prisons, then-Bureau\n\nDirector    Harley     Lappin,     Regional      Director    Kim       White,       Warden\n\n\n\n      1After pleading guilty to maintaining a place for the\npurpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using phencyclidine,\nPlaintiff was sentenced to 78 months’ imprisonment. The nature\nof his conviction and sentence are irrelevant to this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fStansberry,       Administrator      McClintock,         and    Butner    Correctional\n\nOfficer    Richard      Holt    (“Officer       Holt”).         After     dismissing    a\n\nnumber of these claims on jurisdictional and sovereign immunity\n\ngrounds,    the    district       court   transferred      Plaintiff’s          remaining\n\nclaims against Warden Stansberry, Administrator McClintock, and\n\nOfficer Holt to the United States District Court for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of North Carolina.               Scinto v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons,\n\n608 F. Supp. 2d 4, 10 (D.D.C.), aff’d, 352 F. App’x 448 (D.C.\n\nCir.    2009).       Following       a    second     appeal      in     this     Circuit,\n\nPlaintiff     successfully          amended       his     complaint       to     include\n\nadditional       Eighth    Amendment        claims       against       defendants     Dr.\n\nPhillip and Butner Correctional Officer Lawrence Coor (“Officer\n\nCoor”).     Scinto v. Stansberry, 507 F. App’x 311 (4th Cir. 2013)\n\n(per curiam).        Cross-motions for summary judgment followed and,\n\non   September     9,   2014,      the    district      court    denied    Plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants on each of Plaintiff’s claims.\n\n       Plaintiff appeals only three of the claims dismissed on\n\nsummary    judgment,       each     arising      under    the    Eighth        Amendment.\n\nThese include: (1) Plaintiff’s claim against Dr. Phillip for\n\nallegedly denying Plaintiff insulin to treat his diabetes; (2)\n\nPlaintiff’s       claims       against     Dr.     Phillip       and     Administrator\n\nMcClintock for allegedly failing to provide aid in a medical\n\nemergency; and (3) Plaintiff’s claim against Warden Stansberry\n\n                                            9\n\ffor her alleged failure to provide Plaintiff with a diabetic\n\ndiet     during         Plaintiff’s       incarceration            in     administrative\n\nsegregation (the “Special Housing Unit”).                         We address the facts\n\nrelevant to each claim below.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        “We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nde     novo,    viewing       the   facts     and     the    reasonable         inferences\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”\n\nBonds v. Leavitt, 629 F.3d 369, 380 (4th Cir. 2011).                               Summary\n\njudgment must be granted “if the movant shows that there is no\n\ngenuine      dispute     as    to   any   material      fact       and    the   movant    is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”                               Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a).     To survive summary judgment, “there must be evidence on\n\nwhich    the     jury    could      reasonably      find     for    the    [nonmovant].”\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).\n\n                                             A.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       Plaintiff’s first claim alleges that Dr. Phillip violated\n\nPlaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights by denying Plaintiff insulin\n\nto   treat      his   diabetes.        Dr.    Phillip       was    Plaintiff’s      prison\n\ndoctor    at    Federal       Prison   Camp   Butner        and    treated      several   of\n\nPlaintiff’s medical conditions, including his diabetes.                                   On\n\nJune 5, 2005, shortly after Plaintiff’s arrival at Butner, Dr.\n\nPhillip        prescribed       Plaintiff         morning    and        evening    insulin\n\n                                             10\n\finjections,         as    well    as     supplemental      insulin       injections       based\n\nupon a “sliding scale” keyed to his blood sugar.                                According to\n\nthat        sliding      scale,    Plaintiff        was    prescribed       two    units     of\n\ninsulin when his blood sugar was between 141 and 150 milligrams\n\n(“mg”) per deciliter (“dL”), four units when his blood sugar was\n\nbetween 151 and 200mg/dL, and so on.\n\n       On June 14, 2005, Plaintiff requested from Dr. Phillip and\n\nother        medical      personnel       at   Federal      Medical       Camp     Butner     a\n\nsupplemental          insulin      injection        because      his    blood     sugar     was\n\n200mg/dL.           Based on the sliding scale Dr. Phillip prescribed,\n\nPlaintiff should have received four units of insulin.                                 At the\n\ntime of his request, Plaintiff admits that he was “angry”--at\n\nleast in part because his blood sugar was high.                                  The parties\n\nagree       that,     rather      than    providing       four   units     of     insulin   as\n\ndictated       by     Plaintiff’s        prescription,        Dr.      Phillip    terminated\n\nPlaintiff’s visit to the medical clinic and declined to provide\n\nhim with insulin.            Instead, Dr. Phillip developed an alternative\n\nplan to monitor Plaintiff’s blood sugar levels at mealtimes and\n\nto   “cover      each     meal     with    short     acting      insulin”    if    Plaintiff\n\ndesired.       J.A. 521. 2\n\n\n\n\n        2\n       Citations to “J.A. __” refer to the Joint Appendix filed\nby the parties in this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f      According to Plaintiff’s evidence, the June 14 incident was\n\nnot   the    first    time     Dr.   Phillip     denied    Plaintiff       prescribed\n\ninsulin injections.            Nor, according to Plaintiff, was it the\n\nlast.       Although medical records reflect Dr. Phillip’s plan to\n\nmonitor Plaintiff’s blood sugar and provide supplemental insulin\n\nat mealtimes, Plaintiff filed two Inmate Request to Staff forms\n\n(“cop-outs”) that suggest this plan was never followed.                          First,\n\non June 22, 2005, Plaintiff directed a cop-out to Dr. Phillip\n\n“request[ing] insulin coverage whenever my blood glucose levels\n\nrise above 200mg/dl.”          J.A. 88.        And on July 27, 2005, Plaintiff\n\naddressed another cop-out to Dr. Phillip referencing his June 22\n\nrequest     for     supplemental     insulin     (along    with     several      other,\n\nunrelated requests for medical attention) and stating that his\n\nconditions        “remain   untreated    [and]     uncured.”        J.A.   82.      Dr.\n\nPhillip admits that he did not provide Plaintiff with insulin\n\nduring the June 14 appointment, but asserts that the denial was\n\njustified based on Plaintiff’s threatening behavior and that his\n\ntreatment of Plaintiff’s diabetes before and after this incident\n\nwas appropriate.\n\n      Plaintiff       claims     that    Dr.     Phillip’s     alleged       repeated\n\ndenials      of    supplemental       insulin     resulted     in    an    unhealthy\n\nincrease     in     Plaintiff’s      blood   sugar   and     his    hemoglobin      A1C\n\nlevels, which rose from approximately 7 (within the normal range\n\nfor diabetics) to 9.8 (an unhealthy level for diabetics) from\n\n                                          12\n\fJanuary to September 2005.              More generally, Plaintiff claims\n\nthat     the    inadequate    treatment          of     his    diabetes     resulted       in\n\n“unnecessary       exacerbation        of        his     serious        diabetic     . . .\n\ncondition[],       causing    serious       harm        to     the     Plaintiff     [that]\n\nresulted in damage to the Plaintiff’s kidney’s [sic], eyesight,\n\nnervous system, . . . and psychological well being.”                         J.A. 165.\n\n                                            2.\n\n       Contrary to the district court’s holding, Plaintiff adduced\n\nsufficient evidence to establish a genuine dispute of fact as to\n\nboth Farmer’s objective and subjective prongs.\n\n       Regarding      the    objective           prong,        Plaintiff’s         evidence\n\nestablished that he suffers from a serious medical condition:\n\ninsulin-dependent          diabetes.             This        medical     condition        was\n\ndiagnosed by a medical professional, and Dr. Phillip provided\n\ntreatment for the condition by prescribing Plaintiff’s insulin\n\nregimen.        Moreover, Plaintiff has created a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether Dr. Phillip’s failure to provide\n\nhim with insulin was an “extreme deprivation” resulting in “a\n\nserious    or    significant    physical          or     emotional       injury”     or    “a\n\nsubstantial risk” thereof actionable under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nSee De’Lonta, 330 F.3d at 634.                        Dr. Phillip admits that he\n\ndenied    Plaintiff    a    supplemental         dose     of    insulin    on   June      14,\n\n2005, at a time when Plaintiff’s blood sugar was 200mg/dL.                             This\n\nmay be sufficient alone to meet the objective test set forth in\n\n                                            13\n\fFarmer.     See, e.g., Lolli v. Cty. of Orange, 351 F.3d 410, 420\n\n(9th Cir. 2003) (“Leaving a diabetic . . . without proper food\n\nor   insulin       when     it      is        needed      creates          an     objectively,\n\nsufficiently serious risk of harm.” (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n     Even    without      drawing        this       conclusion,       however,          Plaintiff\n\nraises a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the\n\ndeprivation of his prescribed insulin caused serious injury or a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious injury as required by the objective\n\nprong.     He does so by pointing to his deposition testimony and\n\nmedical    records     showing        an      increase     in       his    blood     sugar      and\n\nhemoglobin     A1C   values        from       January     to    September         2005,       which\n\nencompasses the period from June to August 2005 during which Dr.\n\nPhillip was assigned to treat Plaintiff’s diabetes.                                      Viewing\n\nthese facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there are\n\ngenuine     disputes      of     material          fact   as    to        whether       (1)    this\n\nincrease     is    itself      a    serious         injury      and       (2)     the    act     of\n\nwithholding       insulin      from      an    insulin-dependent             diabetic         alone\n\ncreates a serious injury or a substantial risk of such injury.\n\n     Plaintiff’s       evidence          also       created     a    genuine        dispute     of\n\nmaterial fact as to Farmer’s subjective prong.                                  As Plaintiff’s\n\nprison doctor, Dr. Phillip knew of Plaintiff’s serious medical\n\ncondition.        Indeed, Dr. Phillip prescribed the insulin regimen\n\nunder     which    Plaintiff        was       to     receive        supplemental          insulin\n\n                                               14\n\finjections       when       his     blood      sugar       was    above       140mg/dL.            This\n\nevidence    establishes             that      Dr.       Phillip    was      aware      of     facts--\n\nPlaintiff’s diabetes and his blood sugar value at the time of\n\nhis    request        for    insulin--giving              rise    to     an      inference         that\n\nfailing     to     provide          insulin        could     result,        at     least,         in     a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\n\n       Moreover, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff,\n\nPlaintiff’s           lengthy       prison      medical          records       show        that        his\n\ndiabetes         diagnosis           was       “longstanding,               pervasive,            well-\n\ndocumented, [and] expressly noted by prison officials,” Parrish,\n\n372 F.3d at 303--including by Dr. Phillip himself.                                           This is\n\nsufficient        to        prove       a     prima       facie     case         of     deliberate\n\nindifference.          Id.      Furthermore, as in Miltier, Dr. Phillip knew\n\nof    Plaintiff’s        medical        need    for      insulin       at    the      time    of       the\n\nrequest and failed to respond to that known need, raising an\n\ninference        of     deliberate           indifference.              896      F.2d        at    853,\n\noverruled in part on other grounds by Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\n\nThe    district        court      erred       in    failing       to     apply        the     Parrish\n\npresumption and infer deliberate indifference from Dr. Phillip’s\n\nknowledge    of        Plaintiff’s           diabetes       and    disregard          of     his       own\n\nprescription designed to manage that condition.\n\n       Notwithstanding            the       factual      disputes      outlined        above,          the\n\ndistrict court granted Dr. Phillip’s motion for summary judgment\n\nfor two principal reasons.                     First, the court found fault with\n\n                                                   15\n\fPlaintiff’s failure to offer medical expert testimony (a) that\n\nhis blood sugar level during the June 14 appointment “created a\n\nsubstantial harm” under the objective prong of Farmer and (b)\n\nthat       Dr.   Phillip’s     failure    to     provide      insulin   during     the\n\nappointment “resulted in some substantial harm” sufficient to\n\nsatisfy the objective prong. 3            J.A. 956.           Second, the district\n\ncourt concluded that Dr. Phillip had no obligation under the\n\nEighth Amendment to provide Plaintiff, “an angry and hostile\n\npatient,” with the requested insulin.                    J.A. 956.      Accordingly,\n\nthe        district    court      held,        Dr.      Phillip    satisfied       his\n\nconstitutional burden by ordering staff to monitor Plaintiff’s\n\ncondition and provide supplemental insulin at mealtimes.                            We\n\ndisagree with both conclusions.\n\n       Regarding      the      absence    of         expert   medical     testimony,\n\nplaintiffs        alleging     deliberate       indifference      must,    “[a]t     a\n\n       3\n       We emphasize that the correct standard to apply when\nconsidering the objective prong of deliberate indifference\nclaims is whether there is an “extreme deprivation” and “a\nserious or significant physical or emotional injury resulting\nfrom the challenged conditions or . . . a substantial risk of\nsuch serious harm resulting from . . . exposure to the\nchallenged conditions.”     De’Lonta, 330 F.3d at 634.       The\ndistrict court’s reference to a “substantial harm” requirement\ndoes not change this analysis substantively, but does alter\nunnecessarily   the  language   set  forth   in  Fourth  Circuit\nprecedent. We caution that the “serious or significant” injury\nor “substantial risk” standard, not the district court’s\n“substantial harm” standard, should be used when instructing the\njury on the objective prong of the Farmer test.\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fminimum, . . . specifically describe not only the injury but\n\nalso its relation to the allegedly unconstitutional condition.”\n\nStrickler v. Waters, 989 F.2d 1375, 1381 n.9 (4th Cir. 1993).\n\nThere     is    no    requirement,          however,     that       a   plaintiff       alleging\n\ndeliberate indifference present expert testimony to support his\n\nallegations of serious injury or substantial risk of serious\n\ninjury.        Rather, the Federal Rules of Evidence apply, and expert\n\ntestimony is necessary--indeed, permissible--only when it will\n\n“help     the    trier        of    fact    to   understand          the    evidence      or    to\n\ndetermine       a     fact    in    issue.”           Fed.    R.    Evid.      702(a).        When\n\nlaypersons are just “as capable of comprehending the primary\n\nfacts     and    of    drawing       correct      conclusions           from    them”    as    are\n\nexperts, expert testimony may properly be excluded.                                     Salem v.\n\nU.S. Lines Co., 370 U.S. 31, 35 (1962).                             As a result, when the\n\nseriousness of an injury or illness and the risk of leaving that\n\ninjury or illness untreated would be apparent to a layperson,\n\nexpert     testimony         is    not     necessary     to     establish       a   deliberate\n\nindifference claim.                See, e.g., Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cty., 390\n\nF.3d 890, 899–900 (6th Cir. 2004); Boring v. Kozakiewicz, 833\n\nF.2d 468, 473 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\n         Recognizing that it is a “[w]ell-known” fact that diabetes\n\nis   a    “common       yet       serious    illness         that    can    produce      harmful\n\nconsequences if left untreated for even a short period of time,”\n\nseveral of our Sister Circuits have denied defendants summary\n\n                                                 17\n\fjudgment     on    Eighth       Amendment            claims        alleging       that    prison\n\nofficials deprived diabetic inmates of insulin, even when those\n\nclaims were not supported by expert testimony.

Camden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 582–83 (3d Cir.\n\n2003)    (holding,       in    the       absence     of   expert          testimony,      that    a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that prison officials who knew\n\nthe    inmate     was     diabetic        and    needed       insulin          regularly       were\n\ndeliberately       indifferent            in    denying       insulin          for    nonmedical\n\nreasons).         We     agree:      a    jury       is   capable         of    understanding,\n\nunaided, the risks of failing to provide insulin to a diabetic\n\nand of a trained doctor’s denial of a diabetic’s known need for\n\ninsulin.     Accordingly, we reject the district court’s contention\n\nthat    Plaintiff        was    required        to    adduce        expert       testimony       to\n\ndemonstrate an objectively serious deprivation giving rise to a\n\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n       Regarding Dr. Phillip’s response to Plaintiff’s request for\n\ninsulin,     we    agree       that--even          when    both       Farmer         prongs    are\n\nsatisfied--a prison official who responds reasonably in the face\n\nof a known, serious risk of harm to an inmate may be “free from\n\nliability”       under    the     Eighth        Amendment          even    if    harm     is    not\n\navoided.     Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844.                     But even assuming arguendo\n\n                                                18\n\fthat it was reasonable for Dr. Phillip to decline to provide\n\nPlaintiff        insulin    in    the    face     of   his   “angry”      demands    and,\n\ninstead, to plan to monitor Plaintiff’s blood sugar and provide\n\nsupplemental           insulin   at    mealtimes,      Plaintiff     nonetheless      has\n\nestablished a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Dr. Phillip\n\nfollowed through with that plan.                       In particular, Plaintiff’s\n\nJune 22 and July 27, 2005, cop-outs raise a reasonable inference\n\nthat       Dr.   Phillip    failed      to   provide     supplemental       insulin    as\n\nproposed by his alternative plan.                  Therefore, the district court\n\nerred in concluding that there was no genuine dispute of fact as\n\nto   whether       Dr.     Phillip      reasonably      responded    to    Plaintiff’s\n\nmedical needs.\n\n                                             B.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       We now turn to Plaintiff’s second Eighth Amendment claim,\n\nwhich arises out of Dr. Phillip’s and Administrator McClintock’s\n\nalleged failure to provide aid to Plaintiff during a medical\n\nemergency.        On    August   24,     2005,    Plaintiff    was     locked   in    his\n\nhousing unit while prison officials conducted a “census count.” 4\n\nDuring that time, the flow of water to Plaintiff’s unit was\n\ndiscontinued           because   maintenance       workers    were     repairing      the\n\n       4\n       During a census count, inmates must remain in place while\nprison officials conduct a count to ensure that all inmates are\nin their assigned locations.\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\funit’s showers.         While locked down and unable to access water,\n\nPlaintiff began experiencing “extreme [stomach] pain . . . was\n\nthrowing up vomit and blood . . . [and] became incontinent.”\n\nJ.A. 846.      In this state, Plaintiff used an emergency phone in\n\nthe unit to call for help by dialing a “deuces alarm” (2-2-2).\n\n       The    parties     dispute    Plaintiff’s        reason      for   using   the\n\nemergency phone.          Plaintiff claims that he used the phone to\n\nreport his illness, saying “I’m sick.                       The water is off.      I\n\ncan’t get anything to drink.               I can’t wash up.         I’ve got blood\n\nall over me.”           J.A. 848–49.        By contrast, in a now-expunged\n\nincident report arising from the phone use, prison officials\n\nrecorded that Plaintiff used the phone to complain about the\n\nlack    of    water.       According       to   prison       officials,    Plaintiff\n\ncomplained that he “ha[d] to get a shower” before reporting to\n\nhis work shift that afternoon.                  J.A. 327.       Plaintiff asserts\n\nthat    the    officials’     explanation        is     unfounded     since   prison\n\nrecords show that he worked only the morning shift on the day in\n\nquestion.\n\n       When   prison     officials       responded     to   Plaintiff’s    emergency\n\ncall, they offered no assistance even though Plaintiff points to\n\nseveral      “outward    signs”     of    his   need    for    medical    attention,\n\nincluding that his cell “reeked to high heaven” and that his\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fface was covered with partially wiped-up vomit and blood. 5                     J.A.\n\n867–68.      Despite his distressed state, Plaintiff claims that Dr.\n\nPhillip simply “looked at [Plaintiff] in disgust and turned his\n\nhead and started to walk away,” providing no medical aid.                       J.A.\n\n858.         According      to    Plaintiff’s       evidence,      Administrator\n\nMcClintock also failed to provide Plaintiff with treatment or\n\ncall for medical assistance, instead ordering prison guards to\n\n“lock      him   up”   in   the   Special    Housing     Unit.     J.A.    858–59.\n\nThereafter, prison officials removed Plaintiff to the Special\n\nHousing Unit, where he was confined for six months.\n\n       Plaintiff’s evidence indicates he did not receive medical\n\nattention until at least two days after the August 24 incident,\n\nwith the only related entry in his medical record appearing on\n\nAugust 29, 2005--five days after the purported emergency.                        In\n\ncourt      documents,    Plaintiff   attributes     his    emergency      to   acute\n\ncholelithiasis          (gallstones),       signs   of     which    were       first\n\ndocumented in his medical record on July 20, 2005, over one\n\nmonth prior to the incident.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       In recounting their version of events, prison officials\nmake no mention of Plaintiff’s physical appearance or medical\ncondition.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f                                            2.\n\n       Again, Plaintiff’s evidence establishes genuine disputes of\n\nmaterial fact as to both Farmer prongs.                            First, there is a\n\ngenuine        dispute      regarding        whether          Dr.     Phillip’s           and\n\nAdministrator McClintock’s failure to provide aid to Plaintiff\n\nafter he used the emergency phone constituted an “objectively,\n\nsufficiently serious” deprivation.                  Viewing the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff, as we must, Plaintiff was\n\nsuffering from a serious, visible medical need at the time Dr.\n\nPhillip and Administrator McClintock responded to his emergency\n\ncall.     In particular, Plaintiff was experiencing “extreme pain\n\nin    [his]    stomach,     . . .    throwing     up    vomit       and       blood[,   and]\n\nbecame incontinent.”             J.A. 846.       This is the sort of serious\n\nmedical       condition    “so    obvious    that      even    a    lay       person    would\n\neasily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.”                               Iko,\n\n535    F.3d    at   241    (internal    quotation       marks       omitted)         (quoting\n\nHenderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 846 (7th Cir. 1999)).\n\n       Further, Plaintiff’s evidence creates a genuine dispute of\n\nfact as to whether the denial of medical attention during this\n\nemergency resulted in serious injury or a substantial risk of\n\nserious injury.           A juror could reasonably infer that failing to\n\ntreat, for two to five days, an inmate who is vomiting blood and\n\nexperiencing        evident      physical   distress      creates         a    substantial\n\nrisk    that    serious     bodily     injury    will    result       or       has   already\n\n                                            22\n\foccurred.       This conclusion is supported by Plaintiff’s medical\n\nrecords,      which    indicate        that,       at    the   time    of        the   alleged\n\nemergency, he may have been experiencing complications arising\n\nfrom an earlier gallstone diagnosis.\n\n        Plaintiff also has raised a genuine issue of material fact\n\non   the   subjective         prong    of    Farmer--whether           Dr.       Phillip      and\n\nAdministrator McClintock acted with deliberate indifference in\n\nfailing to provide assistance in the face of Plaintiff’s alleged\n\nmedical       emergency.          In     particular,           there        is    sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence to suggest that Defendants were aware of\n\nfacts giving rise to an inference that their decision to send\n\nPlaintiff to the Special Housing Unit without providing medical\n\naid created a substantial risk of serious injury.\n\n        Plaintiff’s testimony that his cell “reeked” and his face\n\nexhibited       visible        signs        of     illness,      as      well          as     his\n\ncontemporaneous account of his symptoms create a genuine factual\n\ndispute    about      whether    his    need       for    medical     attention         was    so\n\nobvious that an official observing the scene would have both\n\nknown    of    the    facts    giving       rise    to    a    risk    of    serious        harm\n\nresulting from failure to provide medical attention and inferred\n\nthat such a substantial risk was present.                           In addition, these\n\noutward    signs      of   Plaintiff’s           need    for   medical      attention         and\n\nDefendants’ contemporaneous failure to offer aid give rise to an\n\ninference of deliberate indifference sufficient for Plaintiff’s\n\n                                             23\n\fclaim to survive summary judgment.           See Miltier, 896 F.3d at 853\n\n(“Failure to respond to an inmate’s known medical needs raises\n\nan inference [of] deliberate indifference to those needs.”).\n\n                                       C.\n\n                                       1.\n\n      Plaintiff’s final Eighth Amendment claim is against Warden\n\nStansberry and alleges a denial of a proper diabetic diet during\n\nhis   six-month    confinement       in     the    Special     Housing    Unit.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff’s evidence, the only meals available to\n\nPlaintiff in the Special Housing Unit were those served to every\n\nother inmate in the unit--meals high in sugar and accompanied by\n\na sugary drink.\n\n      Plaintiff    used    several      channels        of   communication     to\n\ncomplain   to   Warden    Stansberry      about   the    unavailability   of   a\n\ndiabetic diet.    First, Plaintiff complained to the Warden during\n\nher weekly rounds in the unit.          Second, Plaintiff submitted cop-\n\nouts to Warden Stansberry seeking redress for his complaints.\n\nThird, Plaintiff wrote to his congressman, asking him to inquire\n\nwith prison officials about the deficiencies in his diet.                 After\n\nthe congressman forwarded this correspondence to the Bureau of\n\nPrisons, Warden Stansberry addressed the allegations in a reply\n\nletter.    She acknowledged that inmates in the Special Housing\n\nUnit did not receive special diets but maintained that inmates\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\fwere educated about how to select foods appropriate for their\n\nmedical conditions.\n\n       Because of the alleged deficiencies in the diet offered in\n\nthe Special Housing Unit, Plaintiff claims to have suffered an\n\nincrease in his blood sugar and A1C levels.                                       Prison medical\n\nofficials     sought       to     combat          these      symptoms       by    increasing        his\n\ninsulin dosage.             This treatment purportedly “resulted in the\n\nloss   of    . . .       diabetic       control          . . .      and    severe      painful      and\n\ndestructive         episodes           of        diabetic          hypoglycemia          and    . . .\n\nhyperglycemia.”          J.A. 626.\n\n       The district court assumed without deciding that Plaintiff\n\nraised a genuine issue of material fact on Farmer’s objective\n\nprong:      that     the        lack        of     a     diabetic         diet    constituted        a\n\nsufficiently        serious        deprivation.                    The    court        went    on   to\n\nconclude, however, that there was no genuine dispute regarding\n\nwhether Warden Stansberry knew of and disregarded Plaintiff’s\n\nneed for a special diet.                         The court based its conclusion on\n\nPlaintiff’s        log    of     interactions               with   prison     officials,        which\n\nrevealed     that        Plaintiff          was        “mainly      focused       on     pursuing    a\n\ncollateral attack on his criminal conviction and on defending\n\nagainst     his     disciplinary                 charge,      rather       than     on     informing\n\nStansberry     of    the        conditions”            he    considered      unconstitutional.\n\nJ.A. 964.      The court went on to note that even if there were a\n\ngenuine     dispute        of    material           fact      on    this    subjective         prong,\n\n                                                    25\n\fPlaintiff’s acknowledgement that he otherwise received adequate\n\nmedical treatment for his diabetes while confined in the Special\n\nHousing    Unit    rendered      a   finding        of    deliberate       indifference\n\nuntenable.\n\n                                          2.\n\n     We affirm the district court’s award of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Warden Stansberry on this claim, but for a different\n\nreason.      Viewing     the    record    in   the       light    most    favorable   to\n\nPlaintiff, we conclude that Plaintiff failed to raise a genuine\n\ndispute of material fact regarding whether, in this case, the\n\nlack of a diabetic diet was a sufficiently serious deprivation\n\nto be actionable under the Eighth Amendment.                       Warden Stansberry\n\nconceded   in     her   deposition    and      in    her    letter   to     Plaintiff’s\n\ncongressman that there was no diabetic diet provided to inmates\n\nin the Special Housing Unit.              Even so, Warden Stansberry stated\n\non at least two occasions that all inmates were educated about\n\nhow to select from the available meals foods appropriate for\n\ntheir medical conditions.\n\n     In    Farmer,      the     Supreme    Court         stated    that     the    Eighth\n\nAmendment imposes a duty on prison officials to provide inmates\n\nwith “adequate food.”           Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832.                 Several of our\n\nSister Circuits have reasoned, albeit in unpublished decisions,\n\nthat this duty includes an obligation to provide a medically\n\nappropriate     diet     when    necessary.           For    instance,       the   Tenth\n\n                                          26\n\fCircuit has stated that the Eighth Amendment “requires officials\n\nto provide inmates with a special diet if such an accommodation\n\nis medically necessary.”             Frazier v. Dep’t of Corr., No. 97-\n\n2086, 1997 WL 603773, at *1 (10th Cir. Oct. 1, 1997) (citing\n\nByrd v. Wilson, 701 F.2d 592, 595 (6th Cir. 1983)).                       Similarly,\n\nthe   Seventh      Circuit     has   noted    that    the    Amendment      “assures\n\nprisoners a medically and nutritionally sound diet.”                      Jackson v.\n\nHanlon, Nos. 89-2144, 89-2368, 1991 WL 3056, at *1 (7th Cir.\n\nJan. 14, 1991).         Likewise, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that\n\n“officials must provide inmates with a special diet if such an\n\naccommodation      is    obviously    medically      necessary.”           Miller    v.\n\nCleek, No. 99-5145, 1999 WL 1045156, at *2 (6th Cir. Nov. 9,\n\n1999) (citing Byrd, 701 F.2d at 594–95).              We agree.\n\n      Yet    the    Eighth     Amendment’s     requirement         that    prisoners\n\nreceive special diets when medically appropriate is not without\n\nlimit.      Courts      have   consistently    held    that    prison      officials\n\ncomply with this mandate when they provide some food that the\n\ncomplaining prisoner is able to eat without compromising his\n\nhealth.     For instance, in Frazier, the Tenth Circuit rejected a\n\nprisoner’s    deliberate       indifference     claim       when   he     “d[id]    not\n\ncontend that he [wa]s unable to eat any of the food provided by\n\nthe correctional facility” and conceded that he was “able to eat\n\ncertain items on the facility’s menu.”               Frazier, 1997 WL 603773,\n\nat *1.      The same was true in Miller, where the Sixth Circuit\n\n                                        27\n\faffirmed dismissal of an inmate’s inadequate diet claim based in\n\npart on the lack of “evidence that [he] could not maintain his\n\nhealth based on the diet provided and [the fact that he] d[id]\n\nnot contend that he was unable to eat any of the food provided\n\nby the jail.”      Miller, 1999 WL 1045156, at *2.\n\n     Likewise, courts have found that inmates who are denied\n\nspecial diets suffer no constitutional harm so long as they are\n\ninstead given instruction on how to eat the available meals in a\n\nway that satisfies their medical needs.                    For example, the Tenth\n\nCircuit has found that an inmate who was served a universal,\n\ncafeteria-style     diet    but    could      use    “nutritional        break    down\n\ncards”   to   determine    what    foods      were   amenable       to   his   medical\n\ncondition could not claim deliberate indifference based on the\n\nlack of a special diet.           Moore v. Perrill, No. 94-1377, 1995 WL\n\n139407, at *1 (10th Cir. Mar. 31, 1995); see also Williams v.\n\nHartz,   43   F.   App’x   964,    966   (7th    Cir.       2002)   (affirming     the\n\ndistrict court’s award of summary judgment when the complaining\n\nprisoner was not given a special diet, but was “instructed” on\n\nmedically     appropriate    food    choices         and    given    “snacks”     when\n\nnecessary to raise his blood sugar).\n\n     And a California district court held that a prisoner who\n\nreceived the “Heart Healthy” diet provided to all inmates in the\n\nstate prison system and failed to present evidence that he could\n\nnot eat certain menu items or that the “overall percentage” of\n\n                                         28\n\fsuch       items    in    each   meal    was    significant       could     not    survive\n\nsummary judgment on his deliberate indifference claim.                            Baird v.\n\nAlameida, 407 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1140–41 (C.D. Cal. 2005).\n\n       We    find     these      decisions      persuasive.        Only     an    “extreme\n\ndeprivation”             is   actionable        under     the     Eighth      Amendment.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, the meals in the Special Housing Unit\n\nincluded “a bread, a meat product[,] a vegetable[,] and a sweet\n\ndessert.”          J.A. 279.        Plaintiff has not offered evidence that\n\nthere was no combination of foods in each meal that would have\n\nprovided him with adequate sustenance without causing adverse\n\nmedical consequences, instead asserting only that the meals were\n\nhigh in sugar and accompanied by a sugary drink.                         Plaintiff also\n\ndoes       not     contradict       prison     officials’       claims     that   he   was\n\neducated on how to eat the available meals (which were from the\n\n“national diet” “approved for all” inmates, J.A. 462, 539) in a\n\nway    that        would      not     exacerbate        his     diabetic     condition. 6\n\nAccordingly,          the     district       court      properly     awarded        Warden\n\n\n\n\n       6\n       Because Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether there was a sufficiently serious\ndeprivation, we need not consider whether he has sufficiently\nestablished the subjective, deliberate indifference prong.   See\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–23 (1986) (requiring\nthe nonmovant to “make a sufficient showing on” every essential\nelement to survive summary judgment).\n\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fStansberry summary judgment on Plaintiff’s diet and nutrition\n\nclaim. 7\n\n                                      IV.\n\n      Having    determined   that     Plaintiff’s     claims       against   Dr.\n\nPhillip and Administrator McClintock should go forward, we must\n\naddress Defendants’ argument that they are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.       Defendants   raised      qualified   immunity       before   the\n\ndistrict court, but because the court ruled for Defendants on\n\nthe   merits,   it   did   not   reach      the   question    of    Defendants’\n\nentitlement     to   qualified   immunity.        Qualified    immunity      may\n\nprovide a basis for affirming the district court.                  R.R. ex rel.\n\nR. v. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 338 F.3d 325, 332 (4th Cir. 2003)\n\n(“[W]e may affirm the district court’s judgment on any ground\n\nproperly raised below.”) (citing Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Cty. of\n\nKent, 510 U.S. 355, 364 (1994)).\n\n      Qualified immunity shields “government officials performing\n\ndiscretionary functions . . . from liability for civil damages\n\n\n\n      7Though we affirm the district court’s award of summary\njudgment on Plaintiff’s diet and nutrition claim, we reject the\ndistrict court’s reasoning that because Plaintiff received some\nadequate treatment for his diabetes while in the Special Housing\nUnit he cannot complain about other aspects of that treatment.\nTo the contrary, this court has held that “just because [prison\nofficials] have provided [an inmate] with some treatment . . .\nit does not follow that they have necessarily provided h[im]\nwith constitutionally adequate treatment.” See De’lonta v.\nJohnson, 708 F.3d 520, 526 (4th Cir. 2013).\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\finsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\n\nwould have known.”              Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n\n(1982).     In determining whether defendant government officials\n\nare protected by qualified immunity, the court considers both\n\n“whether    a    constitutional         right     [was]    violated     on   the    facts\n\nalleged” and “whether the right was clearly established” at the\n\ntime of the conduct in question.                Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,\n\n200 (2001), overruled in part by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S.\n\n223 (2009).\n\n     As     explained        previously,        Plaintiff      has    alleged       facts\n\nsufficient       for     a   reasonable         jury      to   conclude      that     his\n\nconstitutional         rights    were    violated       when   Dr.    Phillip      denied\n\nPlaintiff       his    prescribed       insulin    and     when   Dr.    Phillip      and\n\nAdministrator         McClintock    failed        to    aid    Plaintiff     during     a\n\nmedical emergency.           See supra Parts III.A, B.               Although a jury\n\nmay ultimately decide that Defendants’ version of events is more\n\ncredible, we are barred from making such a determination when\n\ndeciding whether to grant summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity.       See Meyers v. Balt. Cty., 713 F.3d 723, 733 (4th Cir.\n\n2013).\n\n     To determine whether the right was clearly established, we\n\nfirst must define the right at issue.                   Occupy Columbia v. Haley,\n\n738 F.3d 107, 118 (4th Cir. 2013).                     Dr. Phillip maintains that\n\n                                           31\n\fwe   should     frame    our       analysis           of    qualified        immunity        as    to\n\nPlaintiff’s insulin claim as whether it is “clearly established\n\nthat    a    prison     medical          provider          runs     afoul    of     the      Eighth\n\nAmendment when he does not give one single dose of insulin to a\n\nfederal      inmate,    after       the     inmate         becomes     angry       and     hostile\n\n. . ., and the doctor implements a plan to monitor the inmate\n\nthereafter.”      Appellees’ Br. at 44.                     Similarly, Dr. Phillip and\n\nAdministrator McClintock assert that we should consider their\n\nqualified     immunity        as   to     Plaintiff’s             medical    emergency        claim\n\nbased   on    whether     a    reasonable             official       would       have    known     it\n\nviolated a clearly established constitutional right to follow\n\nprotocol by placing an inmate in administrative detention after\n\nhe receives an incident report.\n\n       But    “[f]or      a        constitutional             right         to     be     clearly\n\nestablished, its contours ‘must be sufficiently clear that a\n\nreasonable     official        would       understand         that     what       he    is   doing\n\nviolates that right.’”              Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002)\n\n(quoting     Anderson     v.       Creighton,          483    U.S.     635,       640     (1987)).\n\nThere is no requirement that the “very action in question [must\n\nhave] previously been held unlawful” for a reasonable official\n\nto   have    notice     that       his    conduct          violated     that      right.          Id.\n\nAccordingly,      we      reject           Dr.        Phillip’s        and        Administrator\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fMcClintock’s        invitations      to    define    the     rights     at   issue    in\n\naccordance with the “very action[s] in question.” 8\n\n       Rather, we define the right in question as the right of\n\nprisoners to receive adequate medical care and to be free from\n\nofficials’ deliberate indifference to their known medical needs.\n\nThis        definition     is     consistent        with     previous        deliberate\n\nindifference cases from this Circuit.                      For example, in Iko v.\n\nShreve--a case in which a prisoner alleged government officials\n\nfailed to conduct a medical evaluation after pepper-spraying him\n\nto compel compliance during a cell removal--this Court defined\n\nthe right at issue as “the right to adequate medical care.”                          535\n\nF.3d at 243 n.12.               This definition also accords with Supreme\n\nCourt jurisprudence, which has long dictated that the Eighth\n\nAmendment confers a duty upon prison officials to ensure that\n\nprisoners “receive adequate . . . medical care.”                         Farmer, 511\n\nU.S. at 832.\n\n       A prisoner’s right to adequate medical care and freedom\n\nfrom deliberate indifference to medical needs has been clearly\n\nestablished by the Supreme Court and this Circuit since at least\n\n1976       and,   thus,   was    clearly   established       at   the   time    of   the\n\n       8We reject Dr. Phillip’s and Administrator McClintock’s\nframing of the right at issue in Plaintiff’s medical emergency\nclaim for the additional reason that it would require us to make\na   credibility  determination  inappropriate  at   the  summary\njudgment stage of litigation.\n\n\n\n                                           33\n\fevents in question.            See, e.g., Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104–05 (“We\n\ntherefore          conclude    that   deliberate    indifference    to   serious\n\nmedical      needs     of     prisoners   constitutes   the    ‘unnecessary   and\n\nwanton infliction of pain’ proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.”\n\n(citation omitted) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 182–\n\n83 (1976))); Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832 (“[P]rison officials must\n\nensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter,\n\nand medical care.”); Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th\n\nCir.       1977)    (“This     circuit    has   consistently   adhered   to   the\n\nprevailing view in requiring reasonable medical treatment [for\n\ninmates].”) (citing authorities).\n\n       Because we conclude that there is sufficient evidence that\n\nPlaintiff’s Eighth Amendment right to adequate medical care and\n\nfreedom from officials’ deliberate indifference to his medical\n\nneeds was violated and that the right was clearly established,\n\nDr. Phillip and Administrator McClintock are not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity. 9\n\n\n\n       9\n       Although we need not reach the issue here, we note once\nagain the “special problem” of “‘applying an objective qualified\nimmunity standard in the context of an Eighth Amendment claim\nthat is satisfied only by a showing of deliberate indifference’-\n-that is, a knowing violation of the law.”    Cox v. Quinn, 828\nF.3d 227, 238 n.4 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Rish v. Johnson, 131\nF.3d 1092, 1098 n.6 (4th Cir. 1997)).\n\n     Some Circuits have resolved this problem by concluding that\nqualified immunity is unavailable when the plaintiff presents a\ngenuine dispute of material fact regarding the defendant’s\n(Continued)\n                                           34\n\f                                      V.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\ndisposition of Plaintiff’s deliberate indifference claim against\n\nWarden Stansberry, reverse its resolution of the claims against\n\nDr.   Phillip   and    Administrator        McClintock,   and   reject   Dr.\n\nPhillip’s   and       Administrator        McClintock’s   invocations     of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\n\n\n\n\ndeliberate indifference.  The Seventh Circuit, for example, has\nheld that the subjective prong of the Farmer test and the\nobjective, clearly established prong of the qualified immunity\ntest “effectively collapse into one” when the plaintiff raises\ngenuine factual disputes regarding the defendant’s deliberate\nindifference. Walker v. Benjamin, 293 F.3d 1030, 1037 (7th Cir.\n2002).    That court explained that when a plaintiff raises\ngenuine disputes of fact on Farmer’s subjective prong, “a\ndefendant may not avoid trial on the grounds of qualified\nimmunity” even though qualified immunity protects covered\ngovernment officials from suit, not merely from liability. Id.;\nsee also, e.g., Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, 256 F.3d 120, 142 n.15\n(3d Cir. 2001) (“[T]o the extent that the plaintiffs have made a\nshowing sufficient to overcome summary judgment on the merits\n[of their deliberate indifference claim], they have also made a\nshowing   sufficient   to  overcome   any  claim   to  qualified\nimmunity.”). But see Estate of Ford v. Ramirez-Palmer, 301 F.3d\n1043, 1049–50 (9th Cir. 2002) (rejecting the view that the\ndeliberate   indifference  and   clearly  established  inquiries\nmerge).\n\n\n\n                                      35\n\f",

Dr.    Phillip       was    Plaintiff’s      prison\n\ndoctor    at    Federal       Prison   Camp   Butner        and    treated      several   of\n\nPlaintiff’s medical conditions, including his diabetes.                                   On\n\nJune 5, 2005, shortly after Plaintiff’s arrival at Butner, Dr.\n\nPhillip        prescribed       Plaintiff         morning    and        evening    insulin\n\n                                             10\n\finjections,         as    well    as     supplemental      insulin       injections       based\n\nupon a “sliding scale” keyed to his blood sugar.                                According to\n\nthat        sliding      scale,    Plaintiff        was    prescribed       two    units     of\n\ninsulin when his blood sugar was between 141 and 150 milligrams\n\n(“mg”) per deciliter (“dL”), four units when his blood sugar was\n\nbetween 151 and 200mg/dL, and so on.\n\n       On June 14, 2005, Plaintiff requested from Dr. Phillip and\n\nother        medical      personnel       at   Federal      Medical       Camp     Butner     a\n\nsupplemental          insulin      injection        because      his    blood     sugar     was\n\n200mg/dL.           Based on the sliding scale Dr. Phillip prescribed,\n\nPlaintiff should have received four units of insulin.                                 At the\n\ntime of his request, Plaintiff admits that he was “angry”--at\n\nleast in part because his blood sugar was high.                                  The parties\n\nagree       that,     rather      than    providing       four   units     of     insulin   as\n\ndictated       by     Plaintiff’s        prescription,        Dr.      Phillip    terminated\n\nPlaintiff’s visit to the medical clinic and declined to provide\n\nhim with insulin.            Instead, Dr. Phillip developed an alternative\n\nplan to monitor Plaintiff’s blood sugar levels at mealtimes and\n\nto   “cover      each     meal     with    short     acting      insulin”    if    Plaintiff\n\ndesired.

Nor, according to Plaintiff, was it the\n\nlast.       Although medical records reflect Dr. Phillip’s plan to\n\nmonitor Plaintiff’s blood sugar and provide supplemental insulin\n\nat mealtimes, Plaintiff filed two Inmate Request to Staff forms\n\n(“cop-outs”) that suggest this plan was never followed.                          First,\n\non June 22, 2005, Plaintiff directed a cop-out to Dr. Phillip\n\n“request[ing] insulin coverage whenever my blood glucose levels\n\nrise above 200mg/dl.”          J.A. 88.        And on July 27, 2005, Plaintiff\n\naddressed another cop-out to Dr. Phillip referencing his June 22\n\nrequest     for     supplemental     insulin     (along    with     several      other,\n\nunrelated requests for medical attention) and stating that his\n\nconditions        “remain   untreated    [and]     uncured.”        J.A.   82.      Dr.\n\nPhillip admits that he did not provide Plaintiff with insulin\n\nduring the June 14 appointment, but asserts that the denial was\n\njustified based on Plaintiff’s threatening behavior and that his\n\ntreatment of Plaintiff’s diabetes before and after this incident\n\nwas appropriate.\n\n      Plaintiff       claims     that    Dr.     Phillip’s     alleged       repeated\n\ndenials      of    supplemental       insulin     resulted     in    an    unhealthy\n\nincrease     in     Plaintiff’s      blood   sugar   and     his    hemoglobin      A1C\n\nlevels, which rose from approximately 7 (within the normal range\n\nfor diabetics) to 9.8 (an unhealthy level for diabetics) from\n\n                                          12\n\fJanuary to September 2005.              More generally, Plaintiff claims\n\nthat     the    inadequate    treatment          of     his    diabetes     resulted       in\n\n“unnecessary       exacerbation        of        his     serious        diabetic     . . .\n\ncondition[],       causing    serious       harm        to     the     Plaintiff     [that]\n\nresulted in damage to the Plaintiff’s kidney’s [sic], eyesight,\n\nnervous system, . . . and psychological well being.”                         J.A. 165.\n\n                                            2.\n\n       Contrary to the district court’s holding, Plaintiff adduced\n\nsufficient evidence to establish a genuine dispute of fact as to\n\nboth Farmer’s objective and subjective prongs.\n\n       Regarding      the    objective           prong,        Plaintiff’s         evidence\n\nestablished that he suffers from a serious medical condition:\n\ninsulin-dependent          diabetes.             This        medical     condition        was\n\ndiagnosed by a medical professional, and Dr. Phillip provided\n\ntreatment for the condition by prescribing Plaintiff’s insulin\n\nregimen.        Moreover, Plaintiff has created a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether Dr. Phillip’s failure to provide\n\nhim with insulin was an “extreme deprivation” resulting in “a\n\nserious    or    significant    physical          or     emotional       injury”     or    “a\n\nsubstantial risk” thereof actionable under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nSee De’Lonta, 330 F.3d at 634.

He does so by pointing to his deposition testimony and\n\nmedical    records     showing        an      increase     in       his    blood     sugar      and\n\nhemoglobin     A1C   values        from       January     to    September         2005,       which\n\nencompasses the period from June to August 2005 during which Dr.\n\nPhillip was assigned to treat Plaintiff’s diabetes.                                      Viewing\n\nthese facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there are\n\ngenuine     disputes      of     material          fact   as    to        whether       (1)    this\n\nincrease     is    itself      a    serious         injury      and       (2)     the    act     of\n\nwithholding       insulin      from      an    insulin-dependent             diabetic         alone\n\ncreates a serious injury or a substantial risk of such injury.\n\n     Plaintiff’s       evidence          also       created     a    genuine        dispute     of\n\nmaterial fact as to Farmer’s subjective prong.                                  As Plaintiff’s\n\nprison doctor, Dr. Phillip knew of Plaintiff’s serious medical\n\ncondition.        Indeed, Dr. Phillip prescribed the insulin regimen\n\nunder     which    Plaintiff        was       to     receive        supplemental          insulin\n\n                                               14\n\finjections       when       his     blood      sugar       was    above       140mg/dL.            This\n\nevidence    establishes             that      Dr.       Phillip    was      aware      of     facts--\n\nPlaintiff’s diabetes and his blood sugar value at the time of\n\nhis    request        for    insulin--giving              rise    to     an      inference         that\n\nfailing     to     provide          insulin        could     result,        at     least,         in     a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\n\n       Moreover, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff,\n\nPlaintiff’s           lengthy       prison      medical          records       show        that        his\n\ndiabetes         diagnosis           was       “longstanding,               pervasive,            well-\n\ndocumented, [and] expressly noted by prison officials,” Parrish,\n\n372 F.3d at 303--including by Dr. Phillip himself.                                           This is\n\nsufficient        to        prove       a     prima       facie     case         of     deliberate\n\nindifference.          Id.      Furthermore, as in Miltier, Dr. Phillip knew\n\nof    Plaintiff’s        medical        need    for      insulin       at    the      time    of       the\n\nrequest and failed to respond to that known need, raising an\n\ninference        of     deliberate           indifference.              896      F.2d        at    853,\n\noverruled in part on other grounds by Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\n\nThe    district        court      erred       in    failing       to     apply        the     Parrish\n\npresumption and infer deliberate indifference from Dr. Phillip’s\n\nknowledge    of        Plaintiff’s           diabetes       and    disregard          of     his       own\n\nprescription designed to manage that condition.\n\n       Notwithstanding            the       factual      disputes      outlined        above,          the\n\ndistrict court granted Dr. Phillip’s motion for summary judgment\n\nfor two principal reasons.                     First, the court found fault with\n\n                                                   15\n\fPlaintiff’s failure to offer medical expert testimony (a) that\n\nhis blood sugar level during the June 14 appointment “created a\n\nsubstantial harm” under the objective prong of Farmer and (b)\n\nthat       Dr.   Phillip’s     failure    to     provide      insulin   during     the\n\nappointment “resulted in some substantial harm” sufficient to\n\nsatisfy the objective prong. 3            J.A. 956.           Second, the district\n\ncourt concluded that Dr. Phillip had no obligation under the\n\nEighth Amendment to provide Plaintiff, “an angry and hostile\n\npatient,” with the requested insulin.                    J.A. 956.      Accordingly,\n\nthe        district    court      held,        Dr.      Phillip    satisfied       his\n\nconstitutional burden by ordering staff to monitor Plaintiff’s\n\ncondition and provide supplemental insulin at mealtimes.                            We\n\ndisagree with both conclusions.\n\n       Regarding      the      absence    of         expert   medical     testimony,\n\nplaintiffs        alleging     deliberate       indifference      must,    “[a]t     a\n\n       3\n       We emphasize that the correct standard to apply when\nconsidering the objective prong of deliberate indifference\nclaims is whether there is an “extreme deprivation” and “a\nserious or significant physical or emotional injury resulting\nfrom the challenged conditions or . . . a substantial risk of\nsuch serious harm resulting from . . . exposure to the\nchallenged conditions.”     De’Lonta, 330 F.3d at 634.       The\ndistrict court’s reference to a “substantial harm” requirement\ndoes not change this analysis substantively, but does alter\nunnecessarily   the  language   set  forth   in  Fourth  Circuit\nprecedent. We caution that the “serious or significant” injury\nor “substantial risk” standard, not the district court’s\n“substantial harm” standard, should be used when instructing the\njury on the objective prong of the Farmer test.\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fminimum, . . . specifically describe not only the injury but\n\nalso its relation to the allegedly unconstitutional condition.”\n\nStrickler v.

We     agree:      a    jury       is   capable         of    understanding,\n\nunaided, the risks of failing to provide insulin to a diabetic\n\nand of a trained doctor’s denial of a diabetic’s known need for\n\ninsulin.     Accordingly, we reject the district court’s contention\n\nthat    Plaintiff        was    required        to    adduce        expert       testimony       to\n\ndemonstrate an objectively serious deprivation giving rise to a\n\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n       Regarding Dr. Phillip’s response to Plaintiff’s request for\n\ninsulin,     we    agree       that--even          when    both       Farmer         prongs    are\n\nsatisfied--a prison official who responds reasonably in the face\n\nof a known, serious risk of harm to an inmate may be “free from\n\nliability”       under    the     Eighth        Amendment          even    if    harm     is    not\n\navoided.     Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844.                     But even assuming arguendo\n\n                                                18\n\fthat it was reasonable for Dr. Phillip to decline to provide\n\nPlaintiff        insulin    in    the    face     of   his   “angry”      demands    and,\n\ninstead, to plan to monitor Plaintiff’s blood sugar and provide\n\nsupplemental           insulin   at    mealtimes,      Plaintiff     nonetheless      has\n\nestablished a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Dr. Phillip\n\nfollowed through with that plan.                       In particular, Plaintiff’s\n\nJune 22 and July 27, 2005, cop-outs raise a reasonable inference\n\nthat       Dr.   Phillip    failed      to   provide     supplemental       insulin    as\n\nproposed by his alternative plan.                  Therefore, the district court\n\nerred in concluding that there was no genuine dispute of fact as\n\nto   whether       Dr.     Phillip      reasonably      responded    to    Plaintiff’s\n\nmedical needs.\n\n                                             B.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       We now turn to Plaintiff’s second Eighth Amendment claim,\n\nwhich arises out of Dr. Phillip’s and Administrator McClintock’s\n\nalleged failure to provide aid to Plaintiff during a medical\n\nemergency.        On    August   24,     2005,    Plaintiff    was     locked   in    his\n\nhousing unit while prison officials conducted a “census count.” 4\n\nDuring that time, the flow of water to Plaintiff’s unit was\n\ndiscontinued           because   maintenance       workers    were     repairing      the\n\n       4\n       During a census count, inmates must remain in place while\nprison officials conduct a count to ensure that all inmates are\nin their assigned locations.\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\funit’s showers.         While locked down and unable to access water,\n\nPlaintiff began experiencing “extreme [stomach] pain . . . was\n\nthrowing up vomit and blood . . . [and] became incontinent.”\n\nJ.A. 846.      In this state, Plaintiff used an emergency phone in\n\nthe unit to call for help by dialing a “deuces alarm” (2-2-2).\n\n       The    parties     dispute    Plaintiff’s        reason      for   using   the\n\nemergency phone.          Plaintiff claims that he used the phone to\n\nreport his illness, saying “I’m sick.                       The water is off.      I\n\ncan’t get anything to drink.               I can’t wash up.         I’ve got blood\n\nall over me.”           J.A. 848–49.        By contrast, in a now-expunged\n\nincident report arising from the phone use, prison officials\n\nrecorded that Plaintiff used the phone to complain about the\n\nlack    of    water.       According       to   prison       officials,    Plaintiff\n\ncomplained that he “ha[d] to get a shower” before reporting to\n\nhis work shift that afternoon.                  J.A. 327.       Plaintiff asserts\n\nthat    the    officials’     explanation        is     unfounded     since   prison\n\nrecords show that he worked only the morning shift on the day in\n\nquestion.\n\n       When   prison     officials       responded     to   Plaintiff’s    emergency\n\ncall, they offered no assistance even though Plaintiff points to\n\nseveral      “outward    signs”     of    his   need    for    medical    attention,\n\nincluding that his cell “reeked to high heaven” and that his\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fface was covered with partially wiped-up vomit and blood. 5                     J.A.\n\n867–68.      Despite his distressed state, Plaintiff claims that Dr.\n\nPhillip simply “looked at [Plaintiff] in disgust and turned his\n\nhead and started to walk away,” providing no medical aid.                       J.A.\n\n858.         According      to    Plaintiff’s       evidence,      Administrator\n\nMcClintock also failed to provide Plaintiff with treatment or\n\ncall for medical assistance, instead ordering prison guards to\n\n“lock      him   up”   in   the   Special    Housing     Unit.     J.A.    858–59.\n\nThereafter, prison officials removed Plaintiff to the Special\n\nHousing Unit, where he was confined for six months.\n\n       Plaintiff’s evidence indicates he did not receive medical\n\nattention until at least two days after the August 24 incident,\n\nwith the only related entry in his medical record appearing on\n\nAugust 29, 2005--five days after the purported emergency.                        In\n\ncourt      documents,    Plaintiff   attributes     his    emergency      to   acute\n\ncholelithiasis          (gallstones),       signs   of     which    were       first\n\ndocumented in his medical record on July 20, 2005, over one\n\nmonth prior to the incident.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       In recounting their version of events, prison officials\nmake no mention of Plaintiff’s physical appearance or medical\ncondition.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f                                            2.\n\n       Again, Plaintiff’s evidence establishes genuine disputes of\n\nmaterial fact as to both Farmer prongs.                            First, there is a\n\ngenuine        dispute      regarding        whether          Dr.     Phillip’s           and\n\nAdministrator McClintock’s failure to provide aid to Plaintiff\n\nafter he used the emergency phone constituted an “objectively,\n\nsufficiently serious” deprivation.                  Viewing the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff, as we must, Plaintiff was\n\nsuffering from a serious, visible medical need at the time Dr.\n\nPhillip and Administrator McClintock responded to his emergency\n\ncall.     In particular, Plaintiff was experiencing “extreme pain\n\nin    [his]    stomach,     . . .    throwing     up    vomit       and       blood[,   and]\n\nbecame incontinent.”             J.A. 846.

A juror could reasonably infer that failing to\n\ntreat, for two to five days, an inmate who is vomiting blood and\n\nexperiencing        evident      physical   distress      creates         a    substantial\n\nrisk    that    serious     bodily     injury    will    result       or       has   already\n\n                                            22\n\foccurred.       This conclusion is supported by Plaintiff’s medical\n\nrecords,      which    indicate        that,       at    the   time    of        the   alleged\n\nemergency, he may have been experiencing complications arising\n\nfrom an earlier gallstone diagnosis.\n\n        Plaintiff also has raised a genuine issue of material fact\n\non   the   subjective         prong    of    Farmer--whether           Dr.       Phillip      and\n\nAdministrator McClintock acted with deliberate indifference in\n\nfailing to provide assistance in the face of Plaintiff’s alleged\n\nmedical       emergency.          In     particular,           there        is    sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence to suggest that Defendants were aware of\n\nfacts giving rise to an inference that their decision to send\n\nPlaintiff to the Special Housing Unit without providing medical\n\naid created a substantial risk of serious injury.\n\n        Plaintiff’s testimony that his cell “reeked” and his face\n\nexhibited       visible        signs        of     illness,      as      well          as     his\n\ncontemporaneous account of his symptoms create a genuine factual\n\ndispute    about      whether    his    need       for    medical     attention         was    so\n\nobvious that an official observing the scene would have both\n\nknown    of    the    facts    giving       rise    to    a    risk    of    serious        harm\n\nresulting from failure to provide medical attention and inferred\n\nthat such a substantial risk was present.                           In addition, these\n\noutward    signs      of   Plaintiff’s           need    for   medical      attention         and\n\nDefendants’ contemporaneous failure to offer aid give rise to an\n\ninference of deliberate indifference sufficient for Plaintiff’s\n\n                                             23\n\fclaim to survive summary judgment.           See Miltier, 896 F.3d at 853\n\n(“Failure to respond to an inmate’s known medical needs raises\n\nan inference [of] deliberate indifference to those needs.”).\n\n                                       C.\n\n                                       1.\n\n      Plaintiff’s final Eighth Amendment claim is against Warden\n\nStansberry and alleges a denial of a proper diabetic diet during\n\nhis   six-month    confinement       in     the    Special     Housing    Unit.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff’s evidence, the only meals available to\n\nPlaintiff in the Special Housing Unit were those served to every\n\nother inmate in the unit--meals high in sugar and accompanied by\n\na sugary drink.\n\n      Plaintiff    used    several      channels        of   communication     to\n\ncomplain   to   Warden    Stansberry      about   the    unavailability   of   a\n\ndiabetic diet.    First, Plaintiff complained to the Warden during\n\nher weekly rounds in the unit.          Second, Plaintiff submitted cop-\n\nouts to Warden Stansberry seeking redress for his complaints.\n\nThird, Plaintiff wrote to his congressman, asking him to inquire\n\nwith prison officials about the deficiencies in his diet.                 After\n\nthe congressman forwarded this correspondence to the Bureau of\n\nPrisons, Warden Stansberry addressed the allegations in a reply\n\nletter.    She acknowledged that inmates in the Special Housing\n\nUnit did not receive special diets but maintained that inmates\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\fwere educated about how to select foods appropriate for their\n\nmedical conditions.\n\n       Because of the alleged deficiencies in the diet offered in\n\nthe Special Housing Unit, Plaintiff claims to have suffered an\n\nincrease in his blood sugar and A1C levels.                                       Prison medical\n\nofficials     sought       to     combat          these      symptoms       by    increasing        his\n\ninsulin dosage.             This treatment purportedly “resulted in the\n\nloss   of    . . .       diabetic       control          . . .      and    severe      painful      and\n\ndestructive         episodes           of        diabetic          hypoglycemia          and    . . .\n\nhyperglycemia.”          J.A. 626.\n\n       The district court assumed without deciding that Plaintiff\n\nraised a genuine issue of material fact on Farmer’s objective\n\nprong:      that     the        lack        of     a     diabetic         diet    constituted        a\n\nsufficiently        serious        deprivation.                    The    court        went    on   to\n\nconclude, however, that there was no genuine dispute regarding\n\nwhether Warden Stansberry knew of and disregarded Plaintiff’s\n\nneed for a special diet.                         The court based its conclusion on\n\nPlaintiff’s        log    of     interactions               with   prison     officials,        which\n\nrevealed     that        Plaintiff          was        “mainly      focused       on     pursuing    a\n\ncollateral attack on his criminal conviction and on defending\n\nagainst     his     disciplinary                 charge,      rather       than     on     informing\n\nStansberry     of    the        conditions”            he    considered      unconstitutional.\n\nJ.A. 964.      The court went on to note that even if there were a\n\ngenuine     dispute        of    material           fact      on    this    subjective         prong,\n\n                                                    25\n\fPlaintiff’s acknowledgement that he otherwise received adequate\n\nmedical treatment for his diabetes while confined in the Special\n\nHousing    Unit    rendered      a   finding        of    deliberate       indifference\n\nuntenable.\n\n                                          2.\n\n     We affirm the district court’s award of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Warden Stansberry on this claim, but for a different\n\nreason.      Viewing     the    record    in   the       light    most    favorable   to\n\nPlaintiff, we conclude that Plaintiff failed to raise a genuine\n\ndispute of material fact regarding whether, in this case, the\n\nlack of a diabetic diet was a sufficiently serious deprivation\n\nto be actionable under the Eighth Amendment.                       Warden Stansberry\n\nconceded   in     her   deposition    and      in    her    letter   to     Plaintiff’s\n\ncongressman that there was no diabetic diet provided to inmates\n\nin the Special Housing Unit.              Even so, Warden Stansberry stated\n\non at least two occasions that all inmates were educated about\n\nhow to select from the available meals foods appropriate for\n\ntheir medical conditions.\n\n     In    Farmer,      the     Supreme    Court         stated    that     the    Eighth\n\nAmendment imposes a duty on prison officials to provide inmates\n\nwith “adequate food.”           Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832.                 Several of our\n\nSister Circuits have reasoned, albeit in unpublished decisions,\n\nthat this duty includes an obligation to provide a medically\n\nappropriate     diet     when    necessary.           For    instance,       the   Tenth\n\n                                          26\n\fCircuit has stated that the Eighth Amendment “requires officials\n\nto provide inmates with a special diet if such an accommodation\n\nis medically necessary.”             Frazier v.

Courts      have   consistently    held    that    prison      officials\n\ncomply with this mandate when they provide some food that the\n\ncomplaining prisoner is able to eat without compromising his\n\nhealth.

Only     an    “extreme\n\ndeprivation”             is   actionable        under     the     Eighth      Amendment.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, the meals in the Special Housing Unit\n\nincluded “a bread, a meat product[,] a vegetable[,] and a sweet\n\ndessert.”          J.A. 279.        Plaintiff has not offered evidence that\n\nthere was no combination of foods in each meal that would have\n\nprovided him with adequate sustenance without causing adverse\n\nmedical consequences, instead asserting only that the meals were\n\nhigh in sugar and accompanied by a sugary drink.                         Plaintiff also\n\ndoes       not     contradict       prison     officials’       claims     that   he   was\n\neducated on how to eat the available meals (which were from the\n\n“national diet” “approved for all” inmates, J.A. 462, 539) in a\n\nway    that        would      not     exacerbate        his     diabetic     condition. 6\n\nAccordingly,          the     district       court      properly     awarded        Warden\n\n\n\n\n       6\n       Because Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether there was a sufficiently serious\ndeprivation, we need not consider whether he has sufficiently\nestablished the subjective, deliberate indifference prong.

Similarly, Dr. Phillip and\n\nAdministrator McClintock assert that we should consider their\n\nqualified     immunity        as   to     Plaintiff’s             medical    emergency        claim\n\nbased   on    whether     a    reasonable             official       would       have    known     it\n\nviolated a clearly established constitutional right to follow\n\nprotocol by placing an inmate in administrative detention after\n\nhe receives an incident report.\n\n       But    “[f]or      a        constitutional             right         to     be     clearly\n\nestablished, its contours ‘must be sufficiently clear that a\n\nreasonable     official        would       understand         that     what       he    is   doing\n\nviolates that right.’”              Hope v.

For example, in Iko v.\n\nShreve--a case in which a prisoner alleged government officials\n\nfailed to conduct a medical evaluation after pepper-spraying him\n\nto compel compliance during a cell removal--this Court defined\n\nthe right at issue as “the right to adequate medical care.”                          535\n\nF.3d at 243 n.12.               This definition also accords with Supreme\n\nCourt jurisprudence, which has long dictated that the Eighth\n\nAmendment confers a duty upon prison officials to ensure that\n\nprisoners “receive adequate . . . medical care.”                         Farmer, 511\n\nU.S. at 832.\n\n       A prisoner’s right to adequate medical care and freedom\n\nfrom deliberate indifference to medical needs has been clearly\n\nestablished by the Supreme Court and this Circuit since at least\n\n1976       and,   thus,   was    clearly   established       at   the   time    of   the\n\n       8We reject Dr. Phillip’s and Administrator McClintock’s\nframing of the right at issue in Plaintiff’s medical emergency\nclaim for the additional reason that it would require us to make\na   credibility  determination  inappropriate  at   the  summary\njudgment stage of litigation.\n\n\n\n                                           33\n\fevents in question.            See, e.g., Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104–05 (“We\n\ntherefore          conclude    that   deliberate    indifference    to   serious\n\nmedical      needs     of     prisoners   constitutes   the    ‘unnecessary   and\n\nwanton infliction of pain’ proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.”\n\n(citation omitted) (quoting Gregg v.

The Seventh Circuit, for example, has\nheld that the subjective prong of the Farmer test and the\nobjective, clearly established prong of the qualified immunity\ntest “effectively collapse into one” when the plaintiff raises\ngenuine factual disputes regarding the defendant’s deliberate\nindifference. Walker v.

That court explained that when a plaintiff raises\ngenuine disputes of fact on Farmer’s subjective prong, “a\ndefendant may not avoid trial on the grounds of qualified\nimmunity” even though qualified immunity protects covered\ngovernment officials from suit, not merely from liability.
