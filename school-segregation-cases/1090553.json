In 2009, Plaintiff-Appellant Archie Donald\n\n(“Donald”) was fired from his position as a sample-room technician at Defendant-Appellee Buckman\n\nLaboratories, Inc. (“Buckman”). Donald subsequently filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and then a civil action, alleging that his termination, as well as\n\nother actions, were discriminatory and retaliatory. The EEOC dismissed his complaint, and the\n\ndistrict court ultimately entered judgment in favor of Buckman after granting its motion to dismiss\n\nand its motion for summary judgment. Donald appeals the district court’s summary-judgment order.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Donald was employed at Buckman in the Technical Services Department from 1990 until his\n\ntermination on October 30, 2009. R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. 69:4–17) (Page ID #184); R. 26-1\n\n(Donald Decl. at ¶¶ 1, 12) (Page ID #379, 382). In 2009, Buckman began a reorganization of the\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nTechnical Services Department that divided the employees into a chemists group and a support-\n\npersonnel group. R. 21-4 (Thompson Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 11) (Page ID #282, 284). Donald, as a sample-\n\nroom technician, was placed in the support-personnel group, which was under the management of\n\nJon Thompson (“Thompson”). Id. ¶ 11 (Page ID #284). Thompson sent an email announcing the\n\ntransition and explaining that Buckman would hold a workshop on the transition, at which the\n\nchemists group and the support-personnel group would meet separately. R. 21-1, Ex. 4 (Emails at\n\n2–3) (Page ID #235–36).\n\n       In response, Donald sent the following email:\n\n       I’m hearing, and because all technical services were not copied on this thread, that\n       the transition workshop for our department is going to be separate. If this is the case,\n       I am totally dissatisfied with this arrangement. In your message below you state that\n       []we will be holding “our” Technical Services transition Alignment Workshop. If\n       we are one department “our” Technical Services Transition and Alignment\n       Workshop should include everyone in the Technical Services department.\n\nId. at 2 (Page ID #235) (emphasis omitted). Jairus Winfrey, a chemist at Buckman, responded to\n\nDonald’s email, noting that although the separate workshops were necessary for certain aspects of\n\nthe transition, he believed that “the structure of these workshops appear to be causing some\n\nsegregation within the teaming platform.” Id. Donald responded, stating “My point exactly!\n\nBuckman is supposed to be a diversified company, but when I peer inside, I’ve seen and still see\n\nracial discrimination.” Id. at 1 (Page ID #234). This email was reviewed by Human Resources\n\n(“HR”), which ultimately determined that the claims of discrimination were meritless. Id. Donald\n\nthen filed a complaint with the EEOC. R. 1, Ex. A (EEOC Compl. at 1) (Page ID #11).\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n       After the workshop, Thompson received training on a program that tracks the hours worked\n\nby non-salaried employees. R. 21-1, Ex. 3 (Pendleton Tr. at 109:3–10) (Page ID #230); R. 21-2\n\n(Damrell Decl. at ¶¶ 12–16) (Page ID #251). During the course of this training, it was discovered\n\nthat Donald had been arriving frequently after 9:00 a.m. for his 8:30 a.m. shift. R. 21-1, Ex. 3\n\n(Pendleton Tr. at 111:4–6) (Page ID #231). Thompson approached Donald about this pattern, and\n\nDonald explained that he had made an arrangement with previous managers to arrive thirty minutes\n\nlate on days that he needed to drive his daughter to school. R. 21-1 (Donald Tr. at 100:6–24) (Page\n\nID #193). Donald avers that “[w]hen Thompson took over as supervisor, I addressed my schedule\n\nand he did not tell me there was any problem with my start time.” R. 26-1 (Donald Decl. at ¶ 4)\n\n(Page ID #380). On September 18, 2009, after Donald had arrived late sixteen out of the previous\n\ntwenty-eight days, Thompson verbally warned Donald that if he did not arrive at 8:30 a.m., he would\n\nface further disciplinary action. R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. 144:3–15) (Page ID #214).\n\n       On October 25, 2009, Thompson sent Donald and other support personnel a reminder email\n\nfor an October 29, 2009 meeting. R. 21-1, Ex. 4 (Emails at 4) (Page ID #237). An hour before this\n\nmeeting, Donald sent an email to HR:\n\n       I will not be attending. I spoke with Karen [Damrell, an HR generalist,] and she\n       informed me that she nor Brenda [Pendleton, an HR generalist,] knew anything about\n       this meeting; therefore, I will not be attending this meeting today because Jon\n       [Thompson] and I together without Human Resource supervision is not acceptable.\n       Arrangements need to be made to reschedule me for this meeting with another\n       facilitator at another time.\n\nId. The following day, Thompson and Pendleton met with Donald. Thompson explained that this\n\nmeeting was convened to discuss Donald’s email, as well as his performance generally during the\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nthird quarter. R. 21-1, Ex. 2 (Thompson Tr. at 54:4–6) (Page ID #225). It remains disputed what\n\nwas said during this meeting.\n\n       After the meeting, Thompson and Pendleton informed Charles Westbrook, the Vice President\n\nof HR, that “Donald made a direct threat to his supervisor Jon Thompson in the presence of Brenda\n\nPendleton.” R. 21-3 (Westbrook Decl. at ¶ 9) (Page ID #258). They also reported that Donald\n\n“leaned forward in his chair in an aggressive manner, squinted his eyes at Mr. Thompson and said\n\nthe reason he would not deal directly with Mr. Thompson was to ‘keep both you [pause] and me\n\n[pause] safe.’” Id. ¶ 11 (Page ID #259). Westbrook attests that “[a] collaborative decision was made\n\nto immediately suspend Mr. Donald and send him home. After considering all the facts and\n\ncircumstances, a decision was made to terminate Mr. Donald’s employment.” Id. ¶ 14. The written\n\nnotice of termination listed insubordination and communicating a threat to a supervisor as the\n\nreasons for his termination. R. 21-3, Ex. D (Termination Letter at 1) (Page ID #274).\n\n       Donald amended his complaint with the EEOC in February 2010 to include his termination.\n\nR.1, Ex. A (EEOC Compl. at 2) (Page ID #12). The EEOC dismissed Donald’s complaint and\n\nissued a right-to-sue letter on August 30, 2010. R. 1, Ex. B (Right to Sue Letter at 1) (Page ID #15).\n\nDonald filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on\n\nOctober 27, 2010, alleging violations of the Tennessee Human Rights Act and Title VII. R. 1\n\n(Compl. at 1) (Page ID #1). Specifically, Donald alleged claims of race discrimination, hostile work\n\nenvironment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and outrageous conduct, and retaliation.\n\nId. at 5–7 (Page ID #5–7). On May 21, 2012, the district court granted, in two orders, Buckman’s\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nmotion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment for Buckman. Donald\n\nv. Buckman Labs., No. 10-2773-STA-tmp, 2012 WL 1856413 (W.D. Tenn. May 21, 2012); Donald\n\nv. Buckman Labs., No. 10-2773-STA-tmp, 2012 WL 1856473 (W.D. Tenn. May 21, 2012). Donald\n\nappeals the district court’s summary-judgment order. Reply Br. at 6.\n\n                                  II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        “We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment.” Dye v. Office of the\n\nRacing Comm’n, 702 F.3d 286, 294 (6th Cir. 2012). “We review the evidence and draw all\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to [Donald] as the nonmoving part[y].” Id. Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\n\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED . R. CIV . P. 56(a).\n\n                                         III. DISCUSSION\n\n        Donald appeals the district court’s decision to grant summary judgment to Buckman on his\n\nrace-discrimination, hostile-work-environment, and retaliation claims, each of which arise under\n\nTitle VII.1 “Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with\n\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such\n\nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Singfield v. Akron Metro. Hous. Auth., 389\n\nF.3d 555, 561 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Donald relies on\n\ncircumstantial evidence in each of his claims, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework\n\n\n        1\n        Insofar as Donald’s discrimination and retaliation claims are also raised under the Tennessee\nHuman Rights Act, the analysis is the same. Newman v. Fed. Express Corp., 266 F.3d 401, 406 (6th\nCir. 2001).\n\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\napplies. White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 533 F.3d 381, 391 (6th Cir. 2008). Under this\n\nframework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a burden that is easily\n\nmet. Singfield, 389 F.3d at 563. If the plaintiff satisfies his burden, “the burden shifts to the\n\ndefendant to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.” Mickey v. Zeidler Tool & Die\n\nCo., 516 F.3d 516, 526 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). “If the defendant\n\narticulates such a reason, the plaintiff may then show that the defendant’s stated reason is merely a\n\npretext for discrimination.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA. Race-Discrimination Claim\n\n        A plaintiff must establish four elements in order to satisfy his burden at the prima facie stage\n\nof a race-discrimination claim: “(1) that he is a member of a protected group; (2) that he was subject\n\nto an adverse employment action; (3) that he was qualified for the position from which he was fired;\n\nand (4) that he was treated differently than employees outside of the protected class for the same or\n\nsimilar conduct.” Singfield, 389 F.3d at 561. The district court concluded that Donald had not\n\nproffered evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case. Donald, 2012 WL 1856473, at *9–11.\n\nSpecifically, the district court determined that Donald had not opposed Buckman’s argument\n\nconcerning the failure-to-promote allegation; that he failed to show that Beverly Richmond, his\n\nidentified comparator, was similarly situated; and that he had not presented evidence that the\n\nreorganization was designed to segregate employees based on race.2 Id. at *7, 9–11.\n\n\n        2\n         The only mention of this purported segregation in Donald’s opening brief is in his statement\nof facts: “Based on the Plaintiff’s observation Plaintiff contends that black employees in the\nlaboratory were separated by race and that blacks worked under one supervisor and non-protected\n\n                                                   6\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n       On appeal, Donald first argues that the district court erred in determining that Richmond was\n\nnot similarly situated. Appellant Br. at 12.3 Richmond is a white employee who also worked in the\n\nTechnical Services Department and who was eventually allowed to modify her start time for personal\n\nreasons. R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. at 96:3–21) (Page ID #191); R. 21-2 (Damrell Decl. at ¶¶ 9–10)\n\n(Page ID #250–51). Donald avers that he “raised concern about [Richmond] who clocked in at\n\ndifferent . . . times then [sic] the regular schedule and after this meeting Richmond’s schedule was\n\nchanged too. Afterward, Richmond expressed her displeasure to me by saying ‘thanks for getting\n\nmy schedule changed too.’” R. 26-1 (Donald Decl. at ¶ 4) (Page ID #380). Donald further explained\n\nthat he “was told by other[] employees that worked at Buckman that Beverly Richmond who also\n\nhad a different start and end time was allowed to continue her different schedule of clock in after I\n\nleft.” Id. Damrell asserted that in November 2009, Richmond submitted a request to HR for a\n\nschedule modification “allowing her to arrive at work one hour earlier,” which “was approved by\n\nher supervisor Jon Thompson.” R. 21-2 (Damrell Decl. at ¶¶ 9–10) (Page ID #250–51).\n\n\n\n\nemployees worked under another supervisor.” Appellant Br. at 4 (citing R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 10) (Page\nID #3)). Donald has not made any argument or produced any evidence in support of this statement,\nand it is not included as one of his five stated issues on appeal. Donald has thus waived this claim\non appeal. Hunter v. Sec’y of U.S. Army, 565 F.3d 986, 995 (6th Cir. 2009). Similarly, Donald has\nwaived the argument that the district court failed to address Donald’s termination as it related to his\nrace-discrimination claim. Id. Although Donald references termination as part of his race-\ndiscrimination claim in his brief, he does not address the district court’s omission or explain how\nit might have erred. Appellant Br. at 16.\n       3\n          Donald also argues that Richard Clark was similarly situated. Appellant Br. at 13. As this\nis the first mention of Richard Clark in any of Donald’s filings, this argument has been forfeited.\n\n                                                  7\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n        The district court concluded that, rather than demonstrating disparity, the evidence shows that\n\nDonald “and his comparator were actually treated in the same manner: both were instructed that they\n\nneeded to work a normal shift beginning at 8:30 a.m., and both employees complied.” Donald, 2012\n\nWL 1856473, at *11. The district court further focused on the following distinction between the\n\ntwo, which it found critical: “Richmond made a formal request to be allowed to arrive early and\n\nexplained her circumstances to her supervisor and HR. There is no evidence that [Donald] ever\n\nmade a similar request or that his own circumstances were substantially similar to Richmond’s\n\nsituation.” Id.\n\n        We agree with the reasoning of the district court. In order for a plaintiff to establish that an\n\nemployee is similarly situated, “the plaintiff and the employee with whom the plaintiff seeks to\n\ncompare himself or herself must be similar in all of the relevant aspects.” Singfield, 389 F.3d at 562\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Richmond complied with the initial change in policy and then\n\nmade a formal request to modify her schedule, whereas Donald continued to arrive late without\n\npermission to alter his hours. Additionally, both Richmond and Donald were initially required to\n\nconform to the standard workplace hours. Richmond and Donald are thus not similarly situated in\n\nall relevant respects.\n\n        Donald also challenges the district court’s determination that he did not oppose Buckman’s\n\nfailure-to-promote argument, noting that he “alleges in the Complaint, through his deposition\n\ntestimony and through his Declaration that he applied for two positions in other areas.” Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nBr. at 14. A review of Donald’s opposition brief reveals that Donald included the following in his\n\nstatement of facts:\n\n        Plaintiff was made aware after his termination that a white employee named Les\n        Timbs was placed in the position of entry level Assistant Operator an entry level\n        position in the Chemical plant that on information from . . . Westbrook . . . , required\n        some chemical plant experience. Plaintiff had previously sought to apply for the\n        position in the Chemical Plant but was discouraged from applying as he was told that\n        he had to have chemical plant experience to apply. Furthermore, Plaintiff was told\n        by Charles Westbrook that if he wanted a position in the plant he would have to leave\n        Buckman, work for another company in a plant environment.\n\n                Plaintiff ultimately did apply for the Assistant Operator job but was not\n        selected for the position.\n\nR. 26 (Pl.’s Opp’n at 4–5) (Page ID #360–61). Donald did not, however, make any argument\n\nincorporating these facts or explain how this sequence of events supported a claim of race\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n        Even assuming that the district court erred in determining that Donald failed to oppose\n\nBuckman’s motion for summary judgment on this issue, Donald has failed to produce sufficient\n\nevidence to satisfy his burden at the prima facie stage. Although Donald has established in his\n\ndeclaration that he “was told a white employee named Les Timbs was placed in the position of entry\n\nlevel Assistant Operator an entry level position in the Chemical plant that . . . Westbrook . . . told\n\nme required some chemical plant experience,” there is no evidence in the record indicating what\n\nexperience Timbs did or did not have at the time he was hired as an operator. R. 26-1 (Donald Decl.\n\nat ¶ 15) (Page ID #382) (emphasis omitted). Donald has not shown that he and Timbs are similarly\n\nsituated.\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n       Because Donald has failed to establish a prima facie case, we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to Buckman on Donald’s race-discrimination claim.\n\nB. Hostile-Work-Environment Claim\n\n       In order to prevail at the prima facie stage of his hostile-work-environment claim, Donald\n\nmust show “1) that he is a member of a protected class; 2) that he was subjected to unwelcome racial\n\nharassment; 3) that the harassment was based on race; 4) that the harassment had the effect of\n\nunreasonably interfering with his work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive\n\nwork environment; and 5) the existence of employer liability.” Newman v. Fed. Express Corp., 266\n\nF.3d 401, 405 (6th Cir. 2001). “In determining whether an environment is one that a reasonable\n\nperson would find hostile or abusive and that the plaintiff in fact did perceive to be so, courts look\n\nat all of the circumstances . . . .” Hafford v. Seidner, 183 F.3d 506, 512 (6th Cir. 1999). “These may\n\ninclude the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening\n\nor humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an\n\nemployee’s work performance.” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993).\n\n       The district court concluded that Donald “has failed to come forward with any evidence that\n\nhe was harassed on the basis of his race, let alone that such harassment was objectively hostile or\n\nextreme.” Donald, 2012 WL 1856473, at *12. The district court further reasoned that Donald could\n\npoint only to discrete actions taken by Buckman and could not “demonstrate[] that his workplace\n\nwas permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that was sufficiently severe and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment.”\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n        On appeal, Donald argues cursorily that “the Plaintiff was a member of a protected class . . . ,\n\nthere is no dispute that the Defendant[’s] actions were changing his work start times . . . , in failing\n\nto require consistent standards for applying for positions from all applicants regardless of race and\n\nin ultimately terminating his employment was based on Plaintiff’s race [sic].” Appellant Br. at 32.\n\nThe only evidence in the record specific to the hostile-work-environment claim is Donald’s\n\ndeposition testimony and declaration detailing the emotional distress resulting from the purported\n\ndiscriminatory acts: “Now I have to be on pins and needles now. I have to work under like so-called\n\npins and needles, be here at this time, do this, don’t do that, do this.” R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. at\n\n91:20–23) (Page ID #188). Donald also testified that he went to two doctors for his emotional\n\ndistress and was prescribed Ambien to help him sleep. Id. at 93:7–94:22 (Page ID #189–90).\n\n        This type of distress, however, is insufficient to establish the requisite severity of a hostile-\n\nwork-environment claim. See, e.g., Michael v. Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp., 496 F.3d 584, 601 (6th\n\nCir. 2007) (“She instead admits that no one at Caterpillar ever made overtly racist remarks or threats\n\nto her, that Henry never raised her voice or made a threat apart from what allegedly took place at the\n\nJanuary 20, 2004 meeting, and that the only ‘harassment’ she experienced was the imposition of the\n\ndisciplinary action taken against her.”); Clay v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 501 F.3d 695, 708 (6th Cir.\n\n2007) (“We note that the failure to remove Moss from the boxline charger position did result in her\n\ngroin injury which kept her out of work for six months. This is a serious matter. However, this\n\n\n                                                   11\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nincident, standing either alone or in conjunction with the alleged offensive utterances, does not\n\nconstitute a hostile work environment.”). We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to Buckman on Donald’s hostile-work-environment claim.\n\nC. Retaliation Claim\n\n       After reviewing the evidence presented by Donald, the district court assumed for the purposes\n\nof summary judgment that both Donald and Buckman had met their respective burdens under the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.          Donald, 2012 WL 1856473, at *15–16.\n\nNonetheless, the district court reasoned that Buckman was entitled to summary judgment on this\n\nclaim under the honest-belief rule, which holds that “as long as an employer has an honest belief in\n\nits proffered nondiscriminatory reason for discharging an employee, the employee cannot establish\n\nthat the reason was pretextual simply because it is ultimately shown to be incorrect.” Majewski v.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing, Inc., 274 F.3d 1106, 1117 (6th Cir. 2001). In other words, an\n\nemployee’s “disagreement with the facts . . . does not create a genuine issue of material fact that\n\nwould defeat summary judgment as long as an employer has an honest belief in its proffered\n\nnondiscriminatory reason.” Michael, 496 F.3d at 598 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       However, “[w]hen the employee is able to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the\n\nemployer failed to make a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking its adverse\n\nemployment action, thereby making its decisional process ‘unworthy of credence,’ then any reliance\n\nplaced by the employer in such a process cannot be said to be honestly held.” Smith v. Chrysler\n\nCorp., 155 F.3d 799, 807–08 (6th Cir. 1998). Here, Donald argues that the district court erred\n\n\n                                                12\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nbecause “[n]ot only was Buckman Laboratories’ proffered reasons for firing Plaintiff pretextual, but\n\nBuckman Laboratories was motivated to by its improper motive after the Plaintiff filed his internal\n\ncomplaint of racial discrimination that it took less than (24) twenty-four hours to investigate.”\n\nAppellant Br. at 27 (emphasis omitted). Donald further contends that he “did in fact present\n\nevidence sufficient for a jury to believe that Buckman Laboratories’ reasons for firing [Donald] had\n\nno basis in fact; and, that its reasons did not actually motivate the decision to fire [Donald].” Id. at\n\n30.\n\n       The evidence that Donald provides in support of these arguments, however, relates to\n\nDonald’s underlying retaliation claim—specifically, whether Donald established pretext—rather than\n\nto Buckman’s decision-making process. Appellant Br. at 22–26. As we have explained previously,\n\n“[t]he key inquiry in assessing whether an employer holds such an honest belief is whether the\n\nemployer made a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking the complained-of\n\naction.” Michael, 496 F.3d at 598–99 (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the critical\n\nissue here is whether Buckman engaged in a reasoned decision-making process prior to suspending,\n\nand ultimately terminating, Donald.\n\n       Despite his arguments that Buckman based its decision on an improper motive, Donald has\n\nnot pointed to any evidence controverting Buckman’s proffered evidence that it engaged in a\n\nreasoned decision-making process with respect to its decision to terminate Donald and that it held\n\nan honest belief that Donald had threatened Thompson. Rather, Donald focuses on disputing the\n\nsequence of events between himself and Thompson leading up to and during the meeting. Appellant\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nBr. at 22–26. Because Donald has not refuted Buckman’s evidence relating to its decision-making\n\nprocess, we must AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Buckman on Donald’s\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f",

In 2009, Plaintiff-Appellant Archie Donald\n\n(“Donald”) was fired from his position as a sample-room technician at Defendant-Appellee Buckman\n\nLaboratories, Inc. (“Buckman”). Donald subsequently filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and then a civil action, alleging that his termination, as well as\n\nother actions, were discriminatory and retaliatory. The EEOC dismissed his complaint, and the\n\ndistrict court ultimately entered judgment in favor of Buckman after granting its motion to dismiss\n\nand its motion for summary judgment. Donald appeals the district court’s summary-judgment order.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Donald was employed at Buckman in the Technical Services Department from 1990 until his\n\ntermination on October 30, 2009. R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. 69:4–17) (Page ID #184); R. 26-1\n\n(Donald Decl. at ¶¶ 1, 12) (Page ID #379, 382). In 2009, Buckman began a reorganization of the\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nTechnical Services Department that divided the employees into a chemists group and a support-\n\npersonnel group. R. 21-4 (Thompson Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 11) (Page ID #282, 284). Donald, as a sample-\n\nroom technician, was placed in the support-personnel group, which was under the management of\n\nJon Thompson (“Thompson”). Id. ¶ 11 (Page ID #284). Thompson sent an email announcing the\n\ntransition and explaining that Buckman would hold a workshop on the transition, at which the\n\nchemists group and the support-personnel group would meet separately. R. 21-1, Ex. 4 (Emails at\n\n2–3) (Page ID #235–36).\n\n       In response, Donald sent the following email:\n\n       I’m hearing, and because all technical services were not copied on this thread, that\n       the transition workshop for our department is going to be separate. If this is the case,\n       I am totally dissatisfied with this arrangement. In your message below you state that\n       []we will be holding “our” Technical Services transition Alignment Workshop. If\n       we are one department “our” Technical Services Transition and Alignment\n       Workshop should include everyone in the Technical Services department.\n\nId. at 2 (Page ID #235) (emphasis omitted). Jairus Winfrey, a chemist at Buckman, responded to\n\nDonald’s email, noting that although the separate workshops were necessary for certain aspects of\n\nthe transition, he believed that “the structure of these workshops appear to be causing some\n\nsegregation within the teaming platform.” Id. Donald responded, stating “My point exactly!\n\nBuckman is supposed to be a diversified company, but when I peer inside, I’ve seen and still see\n\nracial discrimination.” Id. at 1 (Page ID #234). This email was reviewed by Human Resources\n\n(“HR”), which ultimately determined that the claims of discrimination were meritless. Id. Donald\n\nthen filed a complaint with the EEOC. R. 1, Ex. A (EEOC Compl. at 1) (Page ID #11).\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n       After the workshop, Thompson received training on a program that tracks the hours worked\n\nby non-salaried employees. R. 21-1, Ex. 3 (Pendleton Tr. at 109:3–10) (Page ID #230); R. 21-2\n\n(Damrell Decl. at ¶¶ 12–16) (Page ID #251). During the course of this training, it was discovered\n\nthat Donald had been arriving frequently after 9:00 a.m. for his 8:30 a.m. shift. R. 21-1, Ex. 3\n\n(Pendleton Tr. at 111:4–6) (Page ID #231). Thompson approached Donald about this pattern, and\n\nDonald explained that he had made an arrangement with previous managers to arrive thirty minutes\n\nlate on days that he needed to drive his daughter to school. R. 21-1 (Donald Tr. at 100:6–24) (Page\n\nID #193). Donald avers that “[w]hen Thompson took over as supervisor, I addressed my schedule\n\nand he did not tell me there was any problem with my start time.” R. 26-1 (Donald Decl. at ¶ 4)\n\n(Page ID #380). On September 18, 2009, after Donald had arrived late sixteen out of the previous\n\ntwenty-eight days, Thompson verbally warned Donald that if he did not arrive at 8:30 a.m., he would\n\nface further disciplinary action. R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. 144:3–15) (Page ID #214).\n\n       On October 25, 2009, Thompson sent Donald and other support personnel a reminder email\n\nfor an October 29, 2009 meeting. R. 21-1, Ex. 4 (Emails at 4) (Page ID #237). An hour before this\n\nmeeting, Donald sent an email to HR:\n\n       I will not be attending. I spoke with Karen [Damrell, an HR generalist,] and she\n       informed me that she nor Brenda [Pendleton, an HR generalist,] knew anything about\n       this meeting; therefore, I will not be attending this meeting today because Jon\n       [Thompson] and I together without Human Resource supervision is not acceptable.\n       Arrangements need to be made to reschedule me for this meeting with another\n       facilitator at another time.\n\nId. The following day, Thompson and Pendleton met with Donald. Thompson explained that this\n\nmeeting was convened to discuss Donald’s email, as well as his performance generally during the\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nthird quarter. R. 21-1, Ex. 2 (Thompson Tr. at 54:4–6) (Page ID #225). It remains disputed what\n\nwas said during this meeting.\n\n       After the meeting, Thompson and Pendleton informed Charles Westbrook, the Vice President\n\nof HR, that “Donald made a direct threat to his supervisor Jon Thompson in the presence of Brenda\n\nPendleton.” R. 21-3 (Westbrook Decl. at ¶ 9) (Page ID #258). They also reported that Donald\n\n“leaned forward in his chair in an aggressive manner, squinted his eyes at Mr. Thompson and said\n\nthe reason he would not deal directly with Mr. Thompson was to ‘keep both you [pause] and me\n\n[pause] safe.’” Id. ¶ 11 (Page ID #259). Westbrook attests that “[a] collaborative decision was made\n\nto immediately suspend Mr. Donald and send him home. After considering all the facts and\n\ncircumstances, a decision was made to terminate Mr. Donald’s employment.” Id. ¶ 14. The written\n\nnotice of termination listed insubordination and communicating a threat to a supervisor as the\n\nreasons for his termination. R. 21-3, Ex. D (Termination Letter at 1) (Page ID #274).\n\n       Donald amended his complaint with the EEOC in February 2010 to include his termination.\n\nR.1, Ex. A (EEOC Compl. at 2) (Page ID #12). The EEOC dismissed Donald’s complaint and\n\nissued a right-to-sue letter on August 30, 2010. R. 1, Ex. B (Right to Sue Letter at 1) (Page ID #15).\n\nDonald filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on\n\nOctober 27, 2010, alleging violations of the Tennessee Human Rights Act and Title VII. R. 1\n\n(Compl. at 1) (Page ID #1). Specifically, Donald alleged claims of race discrimination, hostile work\n\nenvironment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and outrageous conduct, and retaliation.\n\nId. at 5–7 (Page ID #5–7). On May 21, 2012, the district court granted, in two orders, Buckman’s\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v.

DISCUSSION\n\n        Donald appeals the district court’s decision to grant summary judgment to Buckman on his\n\nrace-discrimination, hostile-work-environment, and retaliation claims, each of which arise under\n\nTitle VII.1 “Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with\n\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such\n\nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Singfield v.

Because Donald relies on\n\ncircumstantial evidence in each of his claims, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework\n\n\n        1\n        Insofar as Donald’s discrimination and retaliation claims are also raised under the Tennessee\nHuman Rights Act, the analysis is the same. Newman v. Fed. Express Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775010\"><a href=\"/opinion/775010/robert-newman-v-federal-express-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (6th\nCir. 2001).\n\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v.

Under this\n\nframework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a burden that is easily\n\nmet. Singfield, 389 F.3d at 563. If the plaintiff satisfies his burden, “the burden shifts to the\n\ndefendant to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.” Mickey v. Zeidler Tool & Die\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262003\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262003/mickey-v-zeidler-tool-and-die-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). “If the defendant\n\narticulates such a reason, the plaintiff may then show that the defendant’s stated reason is merely a\n\npretext for discrimination.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA. Race-Discrimination Claim\n\n        A plaintiff must establish four elements in order to satisfy his burden at the prima facie stage\n\nof a race-discrimination claim: “(1) that he is a member of a protected group; (2) that he was subject\n\nto an adverse employment action; (3) that he was qualified for the position from which he was fired;\n\nand (4) that he was treated differently than employees outside of the protected class for the same or\n\nsimilar conduct.” Singfield, 389 F.3d at 561. The district court concluded that Donald had not\n\nproffered evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case. Donald, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1856473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9–11.\n\nSpecifically, the district court determined that Donald had not opposed Buckman’s argument\n\nconcerning the failure-to-promote allegation; that he failed to show that Beverly Richmond, his\n\nidentified comparator, was similarly situated; and that he had not presented evidence that the\n\nreorganization was designed to segregate employees based on race.2 Id. at *7, 9–11.\n\n\n        2\n         The only mention of this purported segregation in Donald’s opening brief is in his statement\nof facts: “Based on the Plaintiff’s observation Plaintiff contends that black employees in the\nlaboratory were separated by race and that blacks worked under one supervisor and non-protected\n\n                                                   6\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n       On appeal, Donald first argues that the district court erred in determining that Richmond was\n\nnot similarly situated. Appellant Br. at 12.3 Richmond is a white employee who also worked in the\n\nTechnical Services Department and who was eventually allowed to modify her start time for personal\n\nreasons. R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. at 96:3–21) (Page ID #191); R. 21-2 (Damrell Decl. at ¶¶ 9–10)\n\n(Page ID #250–51). Donald avers that he “raised concern about [Richmond] who clocked in at\n\ndifferent . . . times then [sic] the regular schedule and after this meeting Richmond’s schedule was\n\nchanged too. Afterward, Richmond expressed her displeasure to me by saying ‘thanks for getting\n\nmy schedule changed too.’” R. 26-1 (Donald Decl. at ¶ 4) (Page ID #380). Donald further explained\n\nthat he “was told by other[] employees that worked at Buckman that Beverly Richmond who also\n\nhad a different start and end time was allowed to continue her different schedule of clock in after I\n\nleft.” Id. Damrell asserted that in November 2009, Richmond submitted a request to HR for a\n\nschedule modification “allowing her to arrive at work one hour earlier,” which “was approved by\n\nher supervisor Jon Thompson.” R. 21-2 (Damrell Decl. at ¶¶ 9–10) (Page ID #250–51).\n\n\n\n\nemployees worked under another supervisor.” Appellant Br. at 4 (citing R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 10) (Page\nID #3)). Donald has not made any argument or produced any evidence in support of this statement,\nand it is not included as one of his five stated issues on appeal. Donald has thus waived this claim\non appeal. Hunter v. Sec’y of U.S. Army, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1211432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1211432/hunter-v-secretary-of-us-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995 (6th Cir. 2009). Similarly, Donald has\nwaived the argument that the district court failed to address Donald’s termination as it related to his\nrace-discrimination claim. Id. Although Donald references termination as part of his race-\ndiscrimination claim in his brief, he does not address the district court’s omission or explain how\nit might have erred. Appellant Br. at 16.\n       3\n          Donald also argues that Richard Clark was similarly situated. Appellant Br. at 13. As this\nis the first mention of Richard Clark in any of Donald’s filings, this argument has been forfeited.\n\n                                                  7\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n        The district court concluded that, rather than demonstrating disparity, the evidence shows that\n\nDonald “and his comparator were actually treated in the same manner: both were instructed that they\n\nneeded to work a normal shift beginning at 8:30 a.m., and both employees complied.” Donald, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1856473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11. The district court further focused on the following distinction between the\n\ntwo, which it found critical: “Richmond made a formal request to be allowed to arrive early and\n\nexplained her circumstances to her supervisor and HR. There is no evidence that [Donald] ever\n\nmade a similar request or that his own circumstances were substantially similar to Richmond’s\n\nsituation.” Id.\n\n        We agree with the reasoning of the district court. In order for a plaintiff to establish that an\n\nemployee is similarly situated, “the plaintiff and the employee with whom the plaintiff seeks to\n\ncompare himself or herself must be similar in all of the relevant aspects.” Singfield, 389 F.3d at 562\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Richmond complied with the initial change in policy and then\n\nmade a formal request to modify her schedule, whereas Donald continued to arrive late without\n\npermission to alter his hours. Additionally, both Richmond and Donald were initially required to\n\nconform to the standard workplace hours. Richmond and Donald are thus not similarly situated in\n\nall relevant respects.\n\n        Donald also challenges the district court’s determination that he did not oppose Buckman’s\n\nfailure-to-promote argument, noting that he “alleges in the Complaint, through his deposition\n\ntestimony and through his Declaration that he applied for two positions in other areas.” Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nBr. at 14. A review of Donald’s opposition brief reveals that Donald included the following in his\n\nstatement of facts:\n\n        Plaintiff was made aware after his termination that a white employee named Les\n        Timbs was placed in the position of entry level Assistant Operator an entry level\n        position in the Chemical plant that on information from . . . Westbrook . . . , required\n        some chemical plant experience. Plaintiff had previously sought to apply for the\n        position in the Chemical Plant but was discouraged from applying as he was told that\n        he had to have chemical plant experience to apply. Furthermore, Plaintiff was told\n        by Charles Westbrook that if he wanted a position in the plant he would have to leave\n        Buckman, work for another company in a plant environment.\n\n                Plaintiff ultimately did apply for the Assistant Operator job but was not\n        selected for the position.\n\nR. 26 (Pl.’s Opp’n at 4–5) (Page ID #360–61). Donald did not, however, make any argument\n\nincorporating these facts or explain how this sequence of events supported a claim of race\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n        Even assuming that the district court erred in determining that Donald failed to oppose\n\nBuckman’s motion for summary judgment on this issue, Donald has failed to produce sufficient\n\nevidence to satisfy his burden at the prima facie stage. Although Donald has established in his\n\ndeclaration that he “was told a white employee named Les Timbs was placed in the position of entry\n\nlevel Assistant Operator an entry level position in the Chemical plant that . . . Westbrook . . . told\n\nme required some chemical plant experience,” there is no evidence in the record indicating what\n\nexperience Timbs did or did not have at the time he was hired as an operator. R. 26-1 (Donald Decl.\n\nat ¶ 15) (Page ID #382) (emphasis omitted). Donald has not shown that he and Timbs are similarly\n\nsituated.\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\n       Because Donald has failed to establish a prima facie case, we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to Buckman on Donald’s race-discrimination claim.\n\nB. Hostile-Work-Environment Claim\n\n       In order to prevail at the prima facie stage of his hostile-work-environment claim, Donald\n\nmust show “1) that he is a member of a protected class; 2) that he was subjected to unwelcome racial\n\nharassment; 3) that the harassment was based on race; 4) that the harassment had the effect of\n\nunreasonably interfering with his work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive\n\nwork environment; and 5) the existence of employer liability.” Newman v. Fed. Express Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775010\"><a href=\"/opinion/775010/robert-newman-v-federal-express-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (6th Cir. 2001). “In determining whether an environment is one that a reasonable\n\nperson would find hostile or abusive and that the plaintiff in fact did perceive to be so, courts look\n\nat all of the circumstances . . . .” Hafford v. Seidner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765123\"><a href=\"/opinion/765123/van-m-hafford-v-larry-seidner-warden-lorain-correctional-institution/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 512 (6th Cir. 1999). “These may\n\ninclude the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening\n\nor humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an\n\nemployee’s work performance.” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1993).\n\n       The district court concluded that Donald “has failed to come forward with any evidence that\n\nhe was harassed on the basis of his race, let alone that such harassment was objectively hostile or\n\nextreme.” Donald, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1856473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12. The district court further reasoned that Donald could\n\npoint only to discrete actions taken by Buckman and could not “demonstrate[] that his workplace\n\nwas permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that was sufficiently severe and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment.”\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n        On appeal, Donald argues cursorily that “the Plaintiff was a member of a protected class . . . ,\n\nthere is no dispute that the Defendant[’s] actions were changing his work start times . . . , in failing\n\nto require consistent standards for applying for positions from all applicants regardless of race and\n\nin ultimately terminating his employment was based on Plaintiff’s race [sic].” Appellant Br. at 32.\n\nThe only evidence in the record specific to the hostile-work-environment claim is Donald’s\n\ndeposition testimony and declaration detailing the emotional distress resulting from the purported\n\ndiscriminatory acts: “Now I have to be on pins and needles now. I have to work under like so-called\n\npins and needles, be here at this time, do this, don’t do that, do this.” R. 21-1, Ex. 1 (Donald Tr. at\n\n91:20–23) (Page ID #188). Donald also testified that he went to two doctors for his emotional\n\ndistress and was prescribed Ambien to help him sleep. Id. at 93:7–94:22 (Page ID #189–90).\n\n        This type of distress, however, is insufficient to establish the requisite severity of a hostile-\n\nwork-environment claim. See, e.g., Michael v. Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454051\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454051/michael-v-caterpillar-financial-services-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 601 (6th\n\nCir. 2007) (“She instead admits that no one at Caterpillar ever made overtly racist remarks or threats\n\nto her, that Henry never raised her voice or made a threat apart from what allegedly took place at the\n\nJanuary 20, 2004 meeting, and that the only ‘harassment’ she experienced was the imposition of the\n\ndisciplinary action taken against her.”); Clay v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460562/clay-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (6th Cir.\n\n2007) (“We note that the failure to remove Moss from the boxline charger position did result in her\n\ngroin injury which kept her out of work for six months. This is a serious matter. However, this\n\n\n                                                   11\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nincident, standing either alone or in conjunction with the alleged offensive utterances, does not\n\nconstitute a hostile work environment.”). We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to Buckman on Donald’s hostile-work-environment claim.\n\nC. Retaliation Claim\n\n       After reviewing the evidence presented by Donald, the district court assumed for the purposes\n\nof summary judgment that both Donald and Buckman had met their respective burdens under the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.          Donald, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1856473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15–16.\n\nNonetheless, the district court reasoned that Buckman was entitled to summary judgment on this\n\nclaim under the honest-belief rule, which holds that “as long as an employer has an honest belief in\n\nits proffered nondiscriminatory reason for discharging an employee, the employee cannot establish\n\nthat the reason was pretextual simply because it is ultimately shown to be incorrect.” Majewski v.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775921\"><a href=\"/opinion/775921/ronald-c-majewski-v-automatic-data-processing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1117 (6th Cir. 2001). In other words, an\n\nemployee’s “disagreement with the facts . . . does not create a genuine issue of material fact that\n\nwould defeat summary judgment as long as an employer has an honest belief in its proffered\n\nnondiscriminatory reason.” Michael, 496 F.3d at 598 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       However, “[w]hen the employee is able to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the\n\nemployer failed to make a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking its adverse\n\nemployment action, thereby making its decisional process ‘unworthy of credence,’ then any reliance\n\nplaced by the employer in such a process cannot be said to be honestly held.” Smith v. Chrysler\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757800\"><a href=\"/opinion/757800/james-p-smith-v-chrysler-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807–08 (6th Cir. 1998). Here, Donald argues that the district court erred\n\n\n                                                12\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nbecause “[n]ot only was Buckman Laboratories’ proffered reasons for firing Plaintiff pretextual, but\n\nBuckman Laboratories was motivated to by its improper motive after the Plaintiff filed his internal\n\ncomplaint of racial discrimination that it took less than (24) twenty-four hours to investigate.”\n\nAppellant Br. at 27 (emphasis omitted). Donald further contends that he “did in fact present\n\nevidence sufficient for a jury to believe that Buckman Laboratories’ reasons for firing [Donald] had\n\nno basis in fact; and, that its reasons did not actually motivate the decision to fire [Donald].” Id. at\n\n30.\n\n       The evidence that Donald provides in support of these arguments, however, relates to\n\nDonald’s underlying retaliation claim—specifically, whether Donald established pretext—rather than\n\nto Buckman’s decision-making process. Appellant Br. at 22–26. As we have explained previously,\n\n“[t]he key inquiry in assessing whether an employer holds such an honest belief is whether the\n\nemployer made a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking the complained-of\n\naction.” Michael, 496 F.3d at 598–99 (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the critical\n\nissue here is whether Buckman engaged in a reasoned decision-making process prior to suspending,\n\nand ultimately terminating, Donald.\n\n       Despite his arguments that Buckman based its decision on an improper motive, Donald has\n\nnot pointed to any evidence controverting Buckman’s proffered evidence that it engaged in a\n\nreasoned decision-making process with respect to its decision to terminate Donald and that it held\n\nan honest belief that Donald had threatened Thompson. Rather, Donald focuses on disputing the\n\nsequence of events between himself and Thompson leading up to and during the meeting. Appellant\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fNo. 12-5708\nDonald v. Buckman Labs., Inc.\n\n\nBr. at 22–26. Because Donald has not refuted Buckman’s evidence relating to its decision-making\n\nprocess, we must AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Buckman on Donald’s\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f</pre>",
