Therefore, we have no need to restate them.2\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n   18 Pa.C.S.A.        §§    2502(c),     903(c),   6106(a)(1),   and   6105(a)(1),\nrespectively.\n2\n  We observe the local courts were closed from September 22, 2015, until\nSeptember 29, 2015, for the Papal visit to Philadelphia. Therefore, the post-\nsentence motion Appellant filed on September 29, 2015, was timely.\n\fJ-S79009-16\n\n\n      Appellant raises the following issue for our review:\n\n          WAS THE EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN\n          [APPELLANT]’S   CONVICTION[S]     SINCE   THE\n          COMMONWEALTH’S EVIDENCE WAS SO FRAUGHT WITH\n          INCONSISTENCIES   AMONG    THE   COMMONWEALTH\n          WITNESSES, THAT A VERDICT BASED UPON IT WAS\n          INHERENTLY UNRELIABLE AND COULD AMOUNT TO NO\n          MORE THAN SURMISE OR CONJECTURE?\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 3).\n\n      With respect to a sufficiency claim:\n\n          The standard we apply in reviewing the sufficiency of the\n          evidence is whether viewing all the evidence admitted at\n          trial in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, there\n          is sufficient evidence to enable the fact-finder to find every\n          element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In\n          applying [the above] test, we may not weigh the evidence\n          and substitute our judgment for the fact-finder.            In\n          addition, we note that the facts and circumstances\n          established by the Commonwealth need not preclude every\n          possibility of innocence.        Any doubts regarding a\n          defendant’s guilt may be resolved by the fact-finder unless\n          the evidence is so weak and inconclusive that as a matter\n          of law no probability of fact may be drawn from the\n          combined circumstances. The Commonwealth may sustain\n          its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a\n          reasonable doubt by means of wholly circumstantial\n          evidence. Moreover, in applying the above test, the entire\n          record must be evaluated and all evidence actually\n          received must be considered. Finally, the [finder] of fact\n          while passing upon the credibility of witnesses and the\n          weight of the evidence produced, is free to believe all, part\n          or none of the evidence.\n\nCommonwealth v. Jones, 874 A.2d 108, 120-21 (Pa.Super. 2005)\n\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Bullick, 830 A.2d 998, 1000 (Pa.Super.\n\n2003)).\n\n      After a thorough review of the record, the briefs of the parties, the\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-S79009-16\n\n\napplicable law, and the well-reasoned opinion of the Honorable Barbara A.\n\nMcDermott, we conclude Appellant’s issues merit no relief. The trial court\n\nopinion comprehensively discusses and properly disposes of the questions\n\npresented.    (See Trial Court Opinion, filed January 15, 2016, at 7-11)\n\n(finding: Appellant communicated with cohort, his brother, less than one\n\nhour before shooting; Appellant met on day in question with his brother and\n\nanother individual, who, Appellant observed, cleaned and prepared firearms;\n\nwhile armed, Appellant and several others went to confront intended victim\n\nat apartment, where Appellant heard TV and voices inside, and kicked\n\napartment door several times; knowing apartment was occupied, Appellant\n\nand his brother fired several shots into apartment through door and walls,\n\nfatally wounding victim; Appellant acted recklessly and demonstrated\n\nextreme indifference to human life; sufficient evidence supported third-\n\ndegree murder and conspiracy convictions; one of Appellant’s cohorts\n\ntestified Appellant concealed firearm before he walked to scene; two cohorts\n\nof Appellant testified that Appellant fired through apartment door with\n\npreviously concealed weapon; Commonwealth offered certificate of non-\n\nlicensure into evidence; sufficient evidence supported carrying firearms\n\nwithout   license   conviction;   additionally,   Appellant   stipulated   he   was\n\npreviously convicted of offense that prohibits him from possessing firearm;\n\nsufficient evidence supported possession of firearm prohibited conviction).\n\nThe record supports the trial court’s reasoning.       Accordingly, we affirm on\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJ-S79009-16\n\n\nthe basis of the trial court opinion.3\n\n       Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

January 15, 2016\n\nProcedural History\n\n          In February 2013, the Defendant, Edwin Davis, along with co-defendants Evan Davis, Paul\n\n White, and Michelle White, was arrested and charged with Murder and related offenses. On\n\n December 23, 2013, co-defendant Michelle White appeared before the Honorable Benjamin Lerner\n\n and entered into an open guilty plea to Third-Degree Murder and Conspiracy.'\n\n          On June 29, 2015, the Defendant, Evan Davis, and Paul White appeared before this Court and\n\n elected to be tried by a jury. On July 2, 2015, the jury found the Defendant guilty of Third-Degree\n\n Murder, Conspiracy, and Firearms Not to be Carried Without a License. That same day, at a\n\n bifurcated trial, the Defendant waived his right to a jury and this Court found the Defendant guilty of\n\n Possession of a Firearm Prohibited.2\n\n           Sentencing was deferred for completion of pre-sentence and mental health reports. On\n\n September 18, 2015, this Court sentenced the Defendant to twenty to forty years of imprisonment for\n\n\n\n  1 Sentencing in Michelle White's matter, CP-51-CR-005484-2013,       has been deferred until adjudication of co-defendant\n  Evan Davis' matter in CP-51-CR-0005486-2013.\n  2 The jury returned a not-guilty verdict as to Carrying a Firearm on a Public Street in Philadelphia. The remaining\n\n· charges were no/le prossed.\n\fThird-Degree Murder, a consecutive term of five to ten years for Possession of a Firearm Prohibited,\n\nand concurrent terms of ten to twenty years for Conspiracy and three to six years for Firearms Not to\n\nbe Carried Without a License, for a total sentence of twenty-five to fifty years of imprisonment.\n\n       On September 29, 2015, the Defendant filed a Post-Sentence Motion for Reconsideration of\n\nSentence. On October 13, 2015, this Court denied this motion. On October 21, 2015, the Defendant\n\nfiled a timely Notice of Appeal. On October 23, this Court ordered the Defendant to submit a\n\nStatement of Matters Complained of on Appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n       On November 6, 2015, trial counsel James A. Lammendola, Esquire filed a Petition for\n\nExtension of Time to File a Response. On November 23, this Court ordered trial counsel to submit a\n\ntimely 1925(b) Statement by November 30, 2015. On November 30, 2015, trial counsel failed to\n\nsubmit at timely 1925(b) Statement, and filed a second Petition for Extension of Time.\n\n       On December 15, 2015, this Court removed James A. Lammendola, Esquire as counsel,\n\nappointed James F. Berardinelli, Esquire, and ordered the defendant to submit a 1925(b) Statement\n\nthrough new counsel. On January 11, 2016, the Defendant filed a timely 1925(b) Statement.\n\n\n\n\n       Between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. on February 6, 2013, co-defendant Michelle White and her\n\nhousemate Marlieta Cowan, left their home at 5427 Walker Street and walked two to three blocks to\n\nthe apartment complex at 5728 Cottage Street, where co-defendant Paul White, Michelle White's\n\nfather, lived. From outside the apartment complex, Michelle White and Cowan observed a verbal\n\naltercation inside the complex's main hallway between Paul White, Omar Simmons, Tony Crawford,\n\nand Richard Boykin about an alleged $20 debt. The argument quickly turned physical and spilled\n\noutside, where Simmons and Paul White exchanged punches. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 233-239, 244; N.T.\n\n6/30/2015 at 69-76, 95-97.\n\n\n                                                                                                        2\n\f          Cowan and Michelle White separated Simmons and Paul White, breaking up the fight.\n\nMichelle White then approached Simmons and shouted, \"If you want to fight, I can call my brother\n\nand you could fight one of my brothers,\" referring to her brothers-in-law, the Defendant Edwin Davis\n\nand co-defendant Evan Davis.3 Incensed, Michelle and Paul White argued with Simmons, Crawford,\n\nand Boykin, whereupon Michelle White reiterated that she could call her brothers to fight Simmons.\n\nN.T. 6/29/2015 at 242-247; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 75-76.\n\n          After the argument ended, Simmons returned to 5728 Walker Street and entered apartment\n\nB3, where Krystal Evans and the victim Khiry Harris lived. Evans, Simmons, and the victim smoked\n\nmarijuana and fell asleep inside the apartment. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 82-84, 92, 97, 107.\n\n          At a nearby grocery store, Michelle White unsuccessfully attempted to contact the Defendant\n\nand Evan Davis via phone. At this time, Paul White stated that the Defendant and Evan Davis \"need\n\nto come,\" and \"they need to handle this.\" N.T. 6/29/2015 at 248-250; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 76-77.\n\nMichelle White, Paul White, and Cowan walked to Paul White's apartment, where they encountered\n\nPaul White's neighbor Richard Boyle. Within Boyle and Cowan's presence, Paul and Michelle\n\nWhite discussed bringing Defendant and Evan Davis over to \"take care of' Simmons and \"handle\"\n\nthe situation. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 251-253; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 77; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 12.\n\n           Between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., Cowan and Michelle White returned to 5427 Walker Street,\n\nwhere Michelle White spoke to Evan Davis on the phone. Although Michelle White was not struck\n\nduring the altercation with Simmons, Crawford, and Boykin, she told Evan Davis that Simmons\n\npunched her. At approximately 9:13 p.m., Evan Davis and his friend \"Hasan\" arrived at 5427 Walker\n\nStreet. Evan Davis and Hasan began cleaning two semi-automatic pistols, using rubber gloves and\n\ntowels supplied by Michelle White. Shortly thereafter, the Defendant and an unidentified individual\n\n\n\n3   Michelle White is married to the Defendant and Evan Davis' older brother, Ernest Davis.\n\n                                                                                                        3\n\farrived at the home and watched Evan Davis and Hasan prepare the weapons. N.T. 6/29/2015 at\n\n255-262; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 78-81, 98-99.\n\n        At approximately 9:50 p.m., the Defendant, armed with a concealed handgun, walked to Paul\n\nWhite's apartment, accompanied by Evan Davis, Michelle White, Hasan, and the unidentified\n\nindividual. Upon their arrival, Paul White told the Defendant that Simmons was in the victim's\n\napartment and directed him to Boyle's apartment. At Boyle's apartment, Paul White asked Boyle to\n\nknock on the door of apartment B3. Boyle led the group to apartment B3 and knocked on the door,\n\nbut received no response. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 263; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 82-84, 117, 120; N.T. 7/1/2015\n\nat 12-15.\n\n       From outside the apartment door, Boyle heard a television and the sound of voices coming\n\nfrom inside the apartment. After several knocks, the Defendant and Evan Davis pushed Boyle away\n\nand began kicking the apartment door. Upon hearing an unidentified sound, the Defendant and Evan\n\nDavis drew their weapons and fired several shots into the apartment door and surrounding wall. N.T.\n\n6/30/2015 at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 15-16, 18.\n\n       Inside the apartment, Krystal Evans woke to the sound of gunfire and observed Simmons\n\nbreak a window and attempt to escape. Evans quickly discovered the victim on the floor near the\n\napartment's bathroom, convulsing and struggling to breathe. Evans immediately checked the victim,\n\nobserved two profusely-bleeding gunshot wounds, and called 911. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 84-87.\n\n        At 9:58 p.m., Officers Philip Lanz and Mark Swierczynski received a radio call for a person\n\nshot at 5728 Cottage Street. At 10:00 p.m., the officers arrived at the scene, observed four bullet\n\nholes in the apartment's entryway door, and discovered the victim inside, lying in a pool of blood.\n\nAfter securing the scene, the officers escorted Simmons and Evans to homicide for questioning. N.T.\n\n6/29/2015 at 50-57, 61.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      4\n\f        At 10:10 p.m., medics arrived and pronounced the victim dead at the scene. At trial, Deputy\n\nMedical Examiner Dr. Albert Chu, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that the victim suffered\n\nfrom a perforating gunshot wound and a penetrating gunshot wound that entered the victim's central\n\nchest and the victim's lower abdomen, respectively. The perforating gunshot wound's projectile\n\ntravelled through the victim's right lung, heart, and liver, exiting his left back. The penetrating\n\ngunshot wound's projectile travelled through the victim's colon and was recovered from the victim's\n\nright pelvis. Each gunshot wound was fatal. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 55, 199-208.\n\n        Immediately after the shooting, the Defendant, Evan Davis, Michelle White, Hasan, and the\n\nunidentified individual returned to 5427 Walker Street. As Michelle White returned, Cowan\n\nobserved that she \"looked like she was a ghost,\" and otherwise seemed distraught. Michelle White\n\ntold Cowan that the Defendant and Evan Davis \"lit up the place.\" N.T. 6/29/2015 at 263-265.\n\n         At 11 :15 p.m., Officer Robert Flade of the Philadelphia Crime Scene unit arrived at 5728\n\nCottage Street. In the hallway, Officer Flade discovered three .380 caliber and five .9mm caliber\n\nfired cartridge casings (\"FCCs\"). Inside the apartment, Officer Flade discovered twelve strike marks,\n\ninserted probes to determine the direction of travel, and recovered two projectiles. At trial, Officer\n\nFlade testified that the trajectory of the bullets was consistent with shots fired in the apartment\n\nhallway from two different guns located at two different angles respective to the apartment door.\n\nN.T. 6/29/2015 at 127-150, 166.\n\n         After an investigation, firearms expert Officer Raymond Andruczak determined, to a\n\nreasonable degree of scientific certainty, that two of the .380 caliber FCCs and five of the .9mm\n\n caliber FCCs were fired from the same .380 caliber and .9mm caliber semi-automatic pistol,\n\n respectively.4 N.T. 6/29/2015 at 152-162.\n\n\n 4 Officer Andruczak's analysis of a .380 cal. FCC was inconclusive as to whether it was fired from the same weapon as\n the others.\n                                                                                                                         5\n\f       On February 7, 2013, in an interview with Detective Gregory Singleton, Michelle White\n\nadmitted her involvement in the shooting and identified the Defendant and Evan Davis as the\n\nshooters. On that same date, Detectives Griffin and Spotwood interviewed Boyle, who also identified\n\nthe Defendant and Evan Davis as the shooters. N.T. 6/30/2015 at 85, 89; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 16-19.\n\n       On February 8, 2013, Officer Mark Jerden arrested the Defendant and recovered his black and\n\ngrey cell phone, numbered (267) 897-7551. Detectives did not retrieve the associated cell phone\n\nrecords. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 80-81; see also Commonwealth Exhibit C-118.\n\n       Officer Daniel Williams arrested Evan Davis on February 8, 2013. After the arrest,\n\nDetective Singleton recovered Evan Davis' cell phone and executed a valid search warrant to obtain\n\nthe phone's records. Special Agent William Shute of the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation, an expert\n\nin historical cell cite analysis, analyzed the phone records and discovered that the phone associated\n\nwith Evan Davis called the phone associated with the Defendant three times between 9:05 p.m. and\n\n9: 13 p.m. on the night of the murder. By cross-referencing the phone records with historical cell site\n\ndata, Agent Shute determined that between 9:05 to 9: 13 p.m., the phone associated with Evan Davis\n\ntravelled towards 5427 Walker Street, and that at the time of the murder, the cell phone was in the\n\ngeneral vicinity of5728 Cottage Street. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 79-82, 104-116.\n\n        On December 23, 2013, Michelle White pled guilty to Third-Degree Murder and Conspiracy\n\nfor the death of Khiry Harris. As part of her plea, Michelle White agreed to testify truthfully against\n\nthe Defendant and his co-conspirators in exchange for consideration at sentencing. N.T. 6/29/2015 at\n\n23; Commonwealth Exhibit C-100.\n\n        On July 2, 2015, in a trial held immediately after the jury had rendered its verdict, the\n\nDefendant stipulated that he had been previously convicted of two enumerated offenses under 18\n\nPa.C.S. § 6105. N.T. 7/2/2015 at 100.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          6\n\fDiscussion\n\n       The Defendant raises two issues on appeal. The Defendant claims that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to sustain the verdict and this Court imposed an excessive sentence.\n\n\n                                        Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       The Defendant challenges each of his convictions on the basis of inconsistent and unreliable\n\ntestimony. Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction when, viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe Commonwealth as verdict winner, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom\n\nsupport the jury's finding of all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCommonwealth v. Mattison, 82 A.3d 386, 392 (Pa. 2013) (citing Commonwealth v. Montalvo, 956\n\nA.2d 926, 932 (Pa. 2008)). In applying this standard, Pennsylvania courts acknowledge that \"the\n\nCommonwealth may sustain its burden by means of wholly circumstantial evidence.\" Montalvo, 956\n\nA.2d at 932 (citing Commonwealth v. Diggs, 949 A.2d 873, 877 (Pa. 2008)). The facts and\n\ncircumstances established by the Commonwealth need not preclude every possibility of innocence, as\n\nany doubts regarding a defendant's guilt may be resolved by the fact finder unless the evidence is so\n\ninconclusive that, as a matter of law, no probability of guilt may be drawn. Commonwealth v.\n\nDevine, 26 A.3d 1139, 1145 (Pa. Super. 2011) (quoting Commonwealth v. Jones, 874 A.2d 108, 120-\n\n121 (Pa. Super. 2005)). The fact finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. Id\n\n        Murder in the Third Degree is any unlawful killing committed with malice, but without the .\n\nspecific intent to kill nor committed in the commission of a felonious act. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(c);\n\nCommonwealth v. Dunphy, 20 A.3d 1215, 1219 (Pa. Super 2011); see also Commonwealth v. Santos,\n\n876 A.2d 360, 363-364 (2005). Malice aforethought may be established by showing a defendant's\n\nparticular ill-will, wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, recklessness of consequences, and a\n\nmind regardless of social duty, characterizing an extreme indifference to human life. Commonwealth\n\n\n                                                                                                         7\n\fv. Santos, 876 A.2d 360, 363-364 (Pa. 2005) (citing Commonwealth v. Ludwig, 874 A.2d 623, 631-\n\n632 (Pa. 2005); Commonwealth v. Taylor, 337 A.2d 545, 548 (Pa. 1975)). Malice can be inferred\n\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim's body. Commonwealth v. Thomas, 54\n\nA.3d 332, 335-336 (Pa. 2012).\n\n       In the instant case, multiple eyewitnesses testified that the Defendant rendezvoused with Evan\n\nDavis at 5427 Walker Street, where he observed Evan Davis and Hasan prepare firearms. Shortly\n\nthereafter, the Defendant carried a weapon to 5728 Cottage Street in order to confront Simmons. At\n\napartment B3, the Defendant heard a television and voices from inside the apartment, and kicked the\n\ndoor several times. The Defendant fired several shots into the door and the surrounding walls despite\n\nknowing that the apartment was occupied. N.T. 6/30/2015 at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 21, 45. By\n\nrepeatedly firing a weapon into a knowingly occupied apartment, the Defendant acted recklessly to\n\nthe consequences of his conduct and demonstrated an extreme indifference to the value of human life.\n\nThe fatal wounds to vital parts of the victim's body-the middle chest and lower abdomen-further\n\ninfer the Defendant's malice.   N.T. 6/29/2015 at 204-208. This evidence is sufficient to support the\n\nDefendant's Third-Degree Murder conviction.\n\n       To sustain a conviction for Criminal Conspiracy, the Commonwealth must establish that the\n\ndefendant (1) entered into an agreement to commit or aid in an unlawful act with another person or\n\npersons, (2) with a shared criminal intent and (3) an overt act was done in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy. Commonwealth v. McCall, 911 A.2d 992, 996 (Pa. Super. 2006) (citing Commonwealth\n\nv. Hennigan, 753 A.2d 245, 253 (Pa. Super. 2000)). An explicit or formal agreement to commit\n\ncrimes can seldom, if ever, be proved, but a conspiracy may be inferred where it is demonstrated that\n\nthe relation, conduct, or circumstances of the parties, and the overt acts of the co-conspirators\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        8\n\fsufficiently prove the formation of a criminal confederation. Commonwealth v. Perez, 931 A.2d 703,\n\n708-709 (Pa. Super. 2007); Commonwealth v. Jones, 874 A.2d 108, 121-122 (Pa. Super. 2005).\n\n       The Superior Court has identified four factors to be considered in determining the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence supporting the existence of a conspiracy: \"(1) an association between alleged\n\nconspirators; (2) knowledge of the commission of the crime; (3) presence at the scene of the crime;\n\nand (4) in some situations, participation in the object of the conspiracy.\" Commonwealth v. Lambert,\n\n795 A.2d 1010, 1016 (Pa. Super. 2002).\n\n       The Defendant communicated with the co-conspirator Evan Davis less than one hour before\n\nthe shooting. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 104-105. The Defendant travelled to the meet location, 5427 Walker\n\nStreet, and observed Evan Davis cleaning and preparing firearms. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 261-262. The\n\nDefendant and several co-conspirators walked to Paul White's residence to confront Simmons, and\n\nkicked the victim's apartment door in furtherance of that purpose. Id. at 262-263; N.T. 6/30/2015 at\n\n82-84. While under the impression that someone was at the apartment door, the Defendant and Evan\n\nDavis both drew guns and simultaneously fired into the victim's apartment. Id at 84-85; N.T.\n\n7/1/2015 at 17-18. These facts, taken in order, establish association, knowledge, presence, and\n\nparticipation, respectively. The evidence is therefore sufficient to support the Defendant's\n\nConspiracy conviction.\n\n        In order to convict a defendant of Carrying a Firearm Without a License, the Commonwealth\n\nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the weapon was a firearm; (2) the firearm was\n\nunlicensed; and (3) the firearm was concealed on or about the defendant's person, outside his home\n\nor place of business. Commonwealth v. Coto, 932 A.2d 933, 939 (Pa. Super. 2007) (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. Parker, 847 A.2d 745, 750 (Pa. Super. 2004)); 18 Pa.C.S. § 6106(a)(l).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        9\n\fConcealment is an issue determined by the trier of fact, based on the particular circumstances in each\n\ncase. Commonwealth v. Scott, 436 A.2d 607, 608 (Pa. 1981) (citation omitted).\n\n       In Commonwealth v. Scott, the appellant shot the decedent on a public street. Two\n\nCommonwealth witnesses testified that they saw the appellant pull something resembling a firearm\n\nfrom his waistband. Appellant claimed that he approached the victim gun in hand. Appellant argued\n\nthat since the Commonwealth offered no proof of concealment, the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport his conviction. In rejecting the appellant's contention, the Supreme Court held that the\n\nCommonwealth witness' testimony was sufficient to sustain the jury's conclusion that the appellant\n\nhad concealed his weapon. Id. at 608-609.\n\n       The instant case presents similar circumstances to those found in Scott. At trial, Michelle\n\nWhite testified that the Defendant concealed the firearm sometime before he walked to the victim's\n\napartment. N.T. 6/30/2015 at 117, 120. Michelle White and Boyle both testified that the Defendant\n\ndrew his previously unseen weapon and fired through the victim's door. Id. at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015\n\nat 15-16, 21. At the conclusion of testimony, the Commonwealth offered a Certificate ofNon-\n\nLicensure into evidence. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 128; see Commonwealth Exhibit C-123. The Defendant\n\ndid not challenge the certificate's admissibility. These facts are sufficient to sustain the\n\nCommonwealth's burden of proof.\n\n        To sustain a conviction for Possession of a Firearm Prohibited, the Commonwealth must\n\nprove that a defendant possessed a firearm and was previously convicted of an offense enumerated in\n\n 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(b). Commonwealth v. Williams, 911 A.2d 548, 550-551 (Pa. Super. 2006).\n\nPossession may be proved entirely through circumstantial evidence. Commonwealth v. Buford, 101\n\nA.3d 1182, 1189-1190 (Pa. Super. 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     10\n\f       Under the Superior Court's holding in Commonwealth v. Antidormi, 84 A.3d 736 (Pa. Super.\n\n2014), a co-defendant's testimony is sufficient to prove possession. InAntidormi, the appellant fired\n\none shot into a private residence while joyriding, and no firearms were recovered incident to his\n\narrest. At trial, a co-defendant testified that the appellant possessed a shotgun at the time of the\n\nshooting. The Superior Court found the single co-defendant's testimony sufficient to sustain the\n\nappellant's conviction, on the grounds that the jury was free to believe or disbelieve the co-\n\ndefendant's testimony. Id. at 743-757.\n\n          This case presents far stronger evidence of possession than what the Superior Court sustained\n\nin Antidormi. Two Commonwealth witnesses, Michelle White and Boyle, offered non-contradicted\n\ntestimony that the Defendant possessed a pistol and fired it into the victim's apartment. N.T.\n\n6/30/2015 at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 15-16, 21. In a bifurcated hearing, the Defendant stipulated\n\nthat he had been previously convicted of an enumerated offense under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(b). N.T.\n\n7/2/2015 at 99-100. This evidence is sufficient to sustain the Defendant's conviction.\n\n\n                                        Reconsideration of Sentence\n\n          The Defendant challenges the discretionary aspects of aggregated sentence total sentence.\n\nSentencing is a matter vested in the sound discretion of the sentencing judge, and a sentence will not\n\nbe disturbed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Bricker, 41 A.3d\n\n872, 875 (Pa. Super. 2012) (citing Commonwealth v. Cunningham, 805 A.2d 566, 575 (Pa. Super.\n\n2002)).     An abus~ of discretion is more than just an error in judgement, and the trial court will not be\n\nfound to have abused its discretion unless the record discloses that the judgment exercised was\n\nmanifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will. Commonwealth v.\n\n Clarke, 70 A.3d 1281, 1287 (Pa. Super. 2013) (citation omitted). \"A sentencing court generally has\n\ndiscretion to impose multiple sentences concurrently or consecutively, and a challenge to the exercise\n\n\n                                                                                                         11\n\fof that discretion does not ordinarily raise a substantial question.\" Commonwealth v. Reyes-\n\nRodriguez, 111 A.3d 775, 784-785 (Pa. Super. 2015) (quoting Commonwealth v. Raven, 97 A.3d\n\n1244, 1253 (Pa. Super. 2014)).\n\n       To prevail, a defendant must raise a \"substantial question\" by articulating clear reasons why\n\nthe sentence issued \"compromises the sentencing scheme as a whole.\" Dunphy, 20 A.3d at 1222 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2011) (citing Commonwealth v. Dalberto, 648 A.2d 16, 22 (Pa. Super. 1994)). An appellant\n\nbears the burden of showing that the actions by the sentencing court were \"inconsistent with the\n\nSentencing Code or contrary to the fundamental norms underlying the sentencing process.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Titus, 816 A.2d 251, 255 (Pa. Super. 2003). Ordinarily, a claim that a sentencing\n\ncourt failed to accord proper weight to a specific sentencing factor does not raise a substantial\n\nquestion. Commonwealth v. Swope, 123 A.3d 333, 339 (Pa. Super. 2015).\n\n        The Defendant avers that this Court failed to consider the defendants character in imposing a\n\nmanifestly excessive sentence. This Court reviewed the Defendant's pre-sentence and mental health\n\nreports prior to sentencing. Prior to his arrest in this matter, the Defendant had five convictions-\n\nincluding Possession of an Instrument of Crime, Harassment, and drug charges-four probation\n\nviolations, and two revocations, for a prior record score of four. N.T. 9/18/2015 at 3-4. This crime\n\nviolated the terms of the Defendant's supervision under the Honorable Alfred DiBona and the\n\nHonorable Holly Ford. Id at 4. Although the Defendant earned his high school diploma and was\n\nemployed at the time of the murder, the Defendant incurred three disciplinary infractions in prison\n\n since his arrest, including a fifteen day segregation for controlled substance/alcohol abuse in May\n\n 2014 and a seven day cell lockdown in March 2015. Id. at 16-21.\n\n        At sentencing, this Court heard testimony from the Defendant's father, sister, and his middle\n\n school dean, who all informed this Court that the Defendant was a good father and devout Christian.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        12\n\fId. at 6-16, 22-28. The Defendant addressed this Court and apologized to the victim's family while\n\nmaintaining his innocence. Id. at 33-37. The Court considered each of these factors, as well. as the\n\ncontents of the presentence and mental health reports, before imposing the sentence. Id at 36-39.\n\n       The offense gravity score for Third-Degree Murder is fourteen and the standard range period\n\nof minimum confinement is fourteen years to twenty years. The offense gravity score for Possession\n\nof a Firearm Prohibited is ten and the standard range period of minimum confinement is four to five\n\nyears. This Court imposed consecutive standard range sentences of twenty to forty years and five to\n\nten years for Third-Degree Murder and Possession of a Firearm Prohibited, respectively, for an\n\naggregate sentence of twenty-five to fifty years imprisonment. Because the Defendant willfully\n\nescalated events leading to the victim's murder and has continued to engage in troubling behavior\n\npost-incarceration, the Defendant poses a substantial risk to society. The Defendant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that this Court neglected to consider mitigating factors or otherwise acted inconsistent\n\nwith the Sentencing Code. The protection of the Commonwealth's citizens calls for no less than the\n\nsentence imposed.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the decision ofthis Court should be affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                             BY THE COURT,\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Barbara A.

Therefore, we have no need to restate them.2\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n   18 Pa.C.S.A.        §§    2502(c),     903(c),   6106(a)(1),   and   6105(a)(1),\nrespectively.\n2\n  We observe the local courts were closed from September 22, 2015, until\nSeptember 29, 2015, for the Papal visit to Philadelphia. Therefore, the post-\nsentence motion Appellant filed on September 29, 2015, was timely.\n\fJ-S79009-16\n\n\n      Appellant raises the following issue for our review:\n\n          WAS THE EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN\n          [APPELLANT]’S   CONVICTION[S]     SINCE   THE\n          COMMONWEALTH’S EVIDENCE WAS SO FRAUGHT WITH\n          INCONSISTENCIES   AMONG    THE   COMMONWEALTH\n          WITNESSES, THAT A VERDICT BASED UPON IT WAS\n          INHERENTLY UNRELIABLE AND COULD AMOUNT TO NO\n          MORE THAN SURMISE OR CONJECTURE?\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 3).\n\n      With respect to a sufficiency claim:\n\n          The standard we apply in reviewing the sufficiency of the\n          evidence is whether viewing all the evidence admitted at\n          trial in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, there\n          is sufficient evidence to enable the fact-finder to find every\n          element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In\n          applying [the above] test, we may not weigh the evidence\n          and substitute our judgment for the fact-finder.            In\n          addition, we note that the facts and circumstances\n          established by the Commonwealth need not preclude every\n          possibility of innocence.        Any doubts regarding a\n          defendant’s guilt may be resolved by the fact-finder unless\n          the evidence is so weak and inconclusive that as a matter\n          of law no probability of fact may be drawn from the\n          combined circumstances. The Commonwealth may sustain\n          its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a\n          reasonable doubt by means of wholly circumstantial\n          evidence. Moreover, in applying the above test, the entire\n          record must be evaluated and all evidence actually\n          received must be considered. Finally, the [finder] of fact\n          while passing upon the credibility of witnesses and the\n          weight of the evidence produced, is free to believe all, part\n          or none of the evidence.\n\nCommonwealth v.

(See Trial Court Opinion, filed January 15, 2016, at 7-11)\n\n(finding: Appellant communicated with cohort, his brother, less than one\n\nhour before shooting; Appellant met on day in question with his brother and\n\nanother individual, who, Appellant observed, cleaned and prepared firearms;\n\nwhile armed, Appellant and several others went to confront intended victim\n\nat apartment, where Appellant heard TV and voices inside, and kicked\n\napartment door several times; knowing apartment was occupied, Appellant\n\nand his brother fired several shots into apartment through door and walls,\n\nfatally wounding victim; Appellant acted recklessly and demonstrated\n\nextreme indifference to human life; sufficient evidence supported third-\n\ndegree murder and conspiracy convictions; one of Appellant’s cohorts\n\ntestified Appellant concealed firearm before he walked to scene; two cohorts\n\nof Appellant testified that Appellant fired through apartment door with\n\npreviously concealed weapon; Commonwealth offered certificate of non-\n\nlicensure into evidence; sufficient evidence supported carrying firearms\n\nwithout   license   conviction;   additionally,   Appellant   stipulated   he   was\n\npreviously convicted of offense that prohibits him from possessing firearm;\n\nsufficient evidence supported possession of firearm prohibited conviction).\n\nThe record supports the trial court’s reasoning.       Accordingly, we affirm on\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJ-S79009-16\n\n\nthe basis of the trial court opinion.3\n\n       Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

January 15, 2016\n\nProcedural History\n\n          In February 2013, the Defendant, Edwin Davis, along with co-defendants Evan Davis, Paul\n\n White, and Michelle White, was arrested and charged with Murder and related offenses. On\n\n December 23, 2013, co-defendant Michelle White appeared before the Honorable Benjamin Lerner\n\n and entered into an open guilty plea to Third-Degree Murder and Conspiracy.'\n\n          On June 29, 2015, the Defendant, Evan Davis, and Paul White appeared before this Court and\n\n elected to be tried by a jury. On July 2, 2015, the jury found the Defendant guilty of Third-Degree\n\n Murder, Conspiracy, and Firearms Not to be Carried Without a License. That same day, at a\n\n bifurcated trial, the Defendant waived his right to a jury and this Court found the Defendant guilty of\n\n Possession of a Firearm Prohibited.2\n\n           Sentencing was deferred for completion of pre-sentence and mental health reports. On\n\n September 18, 2015, this Court sentenced the Defendant to twenty to forty years of imprisonment for\n\n\n\n  1 Sentencing in Michelle White's matter, CP-51-CR-005484-2013,       has been deferred until adjudication of co-defendant\n  Evan Davis' matter in CP-51-CR-0005486-2013.\n  2 The jury returned a not-guilty verdict as to Carrying a Firearm on a Public Street in Philadelphia. The remaining\n\n· charges were no/le prossed.\n\fThird-Degree Murder, a consecutive term of five to ten years for Possession of a Firearm Prohibited,\n\nand concurrent terms of ten to twenty years for Conspiracy and three to six years for Firearms Not to\n\nbe Carried Without a License, for a total sentence of twenty-five to fifty years of imprisonment.\n\n       On September 29, 2015, the Defendant filed a Post-Sentence Motion for Reconsideration of\n\nSentence. On October 13, 2015, this Court denied this motion. On October 21, 2015, the Defendant\n\nfiled a timely Notice of Appeal. On October 23, this Court ordered the Defendant to submit a\n\nStatement of Matters Complained of on Appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n       On November 6, 2015, trial counsel James A. Lammendola, Esquire filed a Petition for\n\nExtension of Time to File a Response. On November 23, this Court ordered trial counsel to submit a\n\ntimely 1925(b) Statement by November 30, 2015. On November 30, 2015, trial counsel failed to\n\nsubmit at timely 1925(b) Statement, and filed a second Petition for Extension of Time.\n\n       On December 15, 2015, this Court removed James A. Lammendola, Esquire as counsel,\n\nappointed James F. Berardinelli, Esquire, and ordered the defendant to submit a 1925(b) Statement\n\nthrough new counsel. On January 11, 2016, the Defendant filed a timely 1925(b) Statement.\n\n\n\n\n       Between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. on February 6, 2013, co-defendant Michelle White and her\n\nhousemate Marlieta Cowan, left their home at 5427 Walker Street and walked two to three blocks to\n\nthe apartment complex at 5728 Cottage Street, where co-defendant Paul White, Michelle White's\n\nfather, lived. From outside the apartment complex, Michelle White and Cowan observed a verbal\n\naltercation inside the complex's main hallway between Paul White, Omar Simmons, Tony Crawford,\n\nand Richard Boykin about an alleged $20 debt. The argument quickly turned physical and spilled\n\noutside, where Simmons and Paul White exchanged punches. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 233-239, 244; N.T.\n\n6/30/2015 at 69-76, 95-97.\n\n\n                                                                                                        2\n\f          Cowan and Michelle White separated Simmons and Paul White, breaking up the fight.\n\nMichelle White then approached Simmons and shouted, \"If you want to fight, I can call my brother\n\nand you could fight one of my brothers,\" referring to her brothers-in-law, the Defendant Edwin Davis\n\nand co-defendant Evan Davis.3 Incensed, Michelle and Paul White argued with Simmons, Crawford,\n\nand Boykin, whereupon Michelle White reiterated that she could call her brothers to fight Simmons.\n\nN.T. 6/29/2015 at 242-247; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 75-76.\n\n          After the argument ended, Simmons returned to 5728 Walker Street and entered apartment\n\nB3, where Krystal Evans and the victim Khiry Harris lived. Evans, Simmons, and the victim smoked\n\nmarijuana and fell asleep inside the apartment. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 82-84, 92, 97, 107.\n\n          At a nearby grocery store, Michelle White unsuccessfully attempted to contact the Defendant\n\nand Evan Davis via phone. At this time, Paul White stated that the Defendant and Evan Davis \"need\n\nto come,\" and \"they need to handle this.\" N.T. 6/29/2015 at 248-250; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 76-77.\n\nMichelle White, Paul White, and Cowan walked to Paul White's apartment, where they encountered\n\nPaul White's neighbor Richard Boyle. Within Boyle and Cowan's presence, Paul and Michelle\n\nWhite discussed bringing Defendant and Evan Davis over to \"take care of' Simmons and \"handle\"\n\nthe situation. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 251-253; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 77; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 12.\n\n           Between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., Cowan and Michelle White returned to 5427 Walker Street,\n\nwhere Michelle White spoke to Evan Davis on the phone. Although Michelle White was not struck\n\nduring the altercation with Simmons, Crawford, and Boykin, she told Evan Davis that Simmons\n\npunched her. At approximately 9:13 p.m., Evan Davis and his friend \"Hasan\" arrived at 5427 Walker\n\nStreet. Evan Davis and Hasan began cleaning two semi-automatic pistols, using rubber gloves and\n\ntowels supplied by Michelle White. Shortly thereafter, the Defendant and an unidentified individual\n\n\n\n3   Michelle White is married to the Defendant and Evan Davis' older brother, Ernest Davis.\n\n                                                                                                        3\n\farrived at the home and watched Evan Davis and Hasan prepare the weapons. N.T. 6/29/2015 at\n\n255-262; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 78-81, 98-99.\n\n        At approximately 9:50 p.m., the Defendant, armed with a concealed handgun, walked to Paul\n\nWhite's apartment, accompanied by Evan Davis, Michelle White, Hasan, and the unidentified\n\nindividual. Upon their arrival, Paul White told the Defendant that Simmons was in the victim's\n\napartment and directed him to Boyle's apartment. At Boyle's apartment, Paul White asked Boyle to\n\nknock on the door of apartment B3. Boyle led the group to apartment B3 and knocked on the door,\n\nbut received no response. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 263; N.T. 6/30/2015 at 82-84, 117, 120; N.T. 7/1/2015\n\nat 12-15.\n\n       From outside the apartment door, Boyle heard a television and the sound of voices coming\n\nfrom inside the apartment. After several knocks, the Defendant and Evan Davis pushed Boyle away\n\nand began kicking the apartment door. Upon hearing an unidentified sound, the Defendant and Evan\n\nDavis drew their weapons and fired several shots into the apartment door and surrounding wall. N.T.\n\n6/30/2015 at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 15-16, 18.\n\n       Inside the apartment, Krystal Evans woke to the sound of gunfire and observed Simmons\n\nbreak a window and attempt to escape. Evans quickly discovered the victim on the floor near the\n\napartment's bathroom, convulsing and struggling to breathe. Evans immediately checked the victim,\n\nobserved two profusely-bleeding gunshot wounds, and called 911. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 84-87.\n\n        At 9:58 p.m., Officers Philip Lanz and Mark Swierczynski received a radio call for a person\n\nshot at 5728 Cottage Street. At 10:00 p.m., the officers arrived at the scene, observed four bullet\n\nholes in the apartment's entryway door, and discovered the victim inside, lying in a pool of blood.\n\nAfter securing the scene, the officers escorted Simmons and Evans to homicide for questioning. N.T.\n\n6/29/2015 at 50-57, 61.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      4\n\f        At 10:10 p.m., medics arrived and pronounced the victim dead at the scene. At trial, Deputy\n\nMedical Examiner Dr. Albert Chu, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that the victim suffered\n\nfrom a perforating gunshot wound and a penetrating gunshot wound that entered the victim's central\n\nchest and the victim's lower abdomen, respectively. The perforating gunshot wound's projectile\n\ntravelled through the victim's right lung, heart, and liver, exiting his left back. The penetrating\n\ngunshot wound's projectile travelled through the victim's colon and was recovered from the victim's\n\nright pelvis. Each gunshot wound was fatal. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 55, 199-208.\n\n        Immediately after the shooting, the Defendant, Evan Davis, Michelle White, Hasan, and the\n\nunidentified individual returned to 5427 Walker Street. As Michelle White returned, Cowan\n\nobserved that she \"looked like she was a ghost,\" and otherwise seemed distraught. Michelle White\n\ntold Cowan that the Defendant and Evan Davis \"lit up the place.\" N.T. 6/29/2015 at 263-265.\n\n         At 11 :15 p.m., Officer Robert Flade of the Philadelphia Crime Scene unit arrived at 5728\n\nCottage Street. In the hallway, Officer Flade discovered three .380 caliber and five .9mm caliber\n\nfired cartridge casings (\"FCCs\"). Inside the apartment, Officer Flade discovered twelve strike marks,\n\ninserted probes to determine the direction of travel, and recovered two projectiles. At trial, Officer\n\nFlade testified that the trajectory of the bullets was consistent with shots fired in the apartment\n\nhallway from two different guns located at two different angles respective to the apartment door.\n\nN.T. 6/29/2015 at 127-150, 166.\n\n         After an investigation, firearms expert Officer Raymond Andruczak determined, to a\n\nreasonable degree of scientific certainty, that two of the .380 caliber FCCs and five of the .9mm\n\n caliber FCCs were fired from the same .380 caliber and .9mm caliber semi-automatic pistol,\n\n respectively.4 N.T. 6/29/2015 at 152-162.\n\n\n 4 Officer Andruczak's analysis of a .380 cal. FCC was inconclusive as to whether it was fired from the same weapon as\n the others.\n                                                                                                                         5\n\f       On February 7, 2013, in an interview with Detective Gregory Singleton, Michelle White\n\nadmitted her involvement in the shooting and identified the Defendant and Evan Davis as the\n\nshooters. On that same date, Detectives Griffin and Spotwood interviewed Boyle, who also identified\n\nthe Defendant and Evan Davis as the shooters. N.T. 6/30/2015 at 85, 89; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 16-19.\n\n       On February 8, 2013, Officer Mark Jerden arrested the Defendant and recovered his black and\n\ngrey cell phone, numbered (267) 897-7551. Detectives did not retrieve the associated cell phone\n\nrecords. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 80-81; see also Commonwealth Exhibit C-118.\n\n       Officer Daniel Williams arrested Evan Davis on February 8, 2013. After the arrest,\n\nDetective Singleton recovered Evan Davis' cell phone and executed a valid search warrant to obtain\n\nthe phone's records. Special Agent William Shute of the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation, an expert\n\nin historical cell cite analysis, analyzed the phone records and discovered that the phone associated\n\nwith Evan Davis called the phone associated with the Defendant three times between 9:05 p.m. and\n\n9: 13 p.m. on the night of the murder. By cross-referencing the phone records with historical cell site\n\ndata, Agent Shute determined that between 9:05 to 9: 13 p.m., the phone associated with Evan Davis\n\ntravelled towards 5427 Walker Street, and that at the time of the murder, the cell phone was in the\n\ngeneral vicinity of5728 Cottage Street. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 79-82, 104-116.\n\n        On December 23, 2013, Michelle White pled guilty to Third-Degree Murder and Conspiracy\n\nfor the death of Khiry Harris. As part of her plea, Michelle White agreed to testify truthfully against\n\nthe Defendant and his co-conspirators in exchange for consideration at sentencing. N.T. 6/29/2015 at\n\n23; Commonwealth Exhibit C-100.\n\n        On July 2, 2015, in a trial held immediately after the jury had rendered its verdict, the\n\nDefendant stipulated that he had been previously convicted of two enumerated offenses under 18\n\nPa.C.S. § 6105. N.T. 7/2/2015 at 100.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          6\n\fDiscussion\n\n       The Defendant raises two issues on appeal. The Defendant claims that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to sustain the verdict and this Court imposed an excessive sentence.\n\n\n                                        Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       The Defendant challenges each of his convictions on the basis of inconsistent and unreliable\n\ntestimony. Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction when, viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe Commonwealth as verdict winner, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom\n\nsupport the jury's finding of all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Shortly\n\nthereafter, the Defendant carried a weapon to 5728 Cottage Street in order to confront Simmons. At\n\napartment B3, the Defendant heard a television and voices from inside the apartment, and kicked the\n\ndoor several times. The Defendant fired several shots into the door and the surrounding walls despite\n\nknowing that the apartment was occupied. N.T. 6/30/2015 at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 21, 45. By\n\nrepeatedly firing a weapon into a knowingly occupied apartment, the Defendant acted recklessly to\n\nthe consequences of his conduct and demonstrated an extreme indifference to the value of human life.\n\nThe fatal wounds to vital parts of the victim's body-the middle chest and lower abdomen-further\n\ninfer the Defendant's malice.   N.T. 6/29/2015 at 204-208. This evidence is sufficient to support the\n\nDefendant's Third-Degree Murder conviction.\n\n       To sustain a conviction for Criminal Conspiracy, the Commonwealth must establish that the\n\ndefendant (1) entered into an agreement to commit or aid in an unlawful act with another person or\n\npersons, (2) with a shared criminal intent and (3) an overt act was done in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.

Super. 2002).\n\n       The Defendant communicated with the co-conspirator Evan Davis less than one hour before\n\nthe shooting. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 104-105. The Defendant travelled to the meet location, 5427 Walker\n\nStreet, and observed Evan Davis cleaning and preparing firearms. N.T. 6/29/2015 at 261-262. The\n\nDefendant and several co-conspirators walked to Paul White's residence to confront Simmons, and\n\nkicked the victim's apartment door in furtherance of that purpose. Id. at 262-263; N.T. 6/30/2015 at\n\n82-84. While under the impression that someone was at the apartment door, the Defendant and Evan\n\nDavis both drew guns and simultaneously fired into the victim's apartment. Id at 84-85; N.T.\n\n7/1/2015 at 17-18. These facts, taken in order, establish association, knowledge, presence, and\n\nparticipation, respectively. The evidence is therefore sufficient to support the Defendant's\n\nConspiracy conviction.\n\n        In order to convict a defendant of Carrying a Firearm Without a License, the Commonwealth\n\nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the weapon was a firearm; (2) the firearm was\n\nunlicensed; and (3) the firearm was concealed on or about the defendant's person, outside his home\n\nor place of business.

Scott, the appellant shot the decedent on a public street. Two\n\nCommonwealth witnesses testified that they saw the appellant pull something resembling a firearm\n\nfrom his waistband. Appellant claimed that he approached the victim gun in hand. Appellant argued\n\nthat since the Commonwealth offered no proof of concealment, the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport his conviction. In rejecting the appellant's contention, the Supreme Court held that the\n\nCommonwealth witness' testimony was sufficient to sustain the jury's conclusion that the appellant\n\nhad concealed his weapon. Id. at 608-609.\n\n       The instant case presents similar circumstances to those found in Scott. At trial, Michelle\n\nWhite testified that the Defendant concealed the firearm sometime before he walked to the victim's\n\napartment. N.T. 6/30/2015 at 117, 120. Michelle White and Boyle both testified that the Defendant\n\ndrew his previously unseen weapon and fired through the victim's door. Id. at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015\n\nat 15-16, 21. At the conclusion of testimony, the Commonwealth offered a Certificate ofNon-\n\nLicensure into evidence. N.T. 7/1/2015 at 128; see Commonwealth Exhibit C-123. The Defendant\n\ndid not challenge the certificate's admissibility. These facts are sufficient to sustain the\n\nCommonwealth's burden of proof.\n\n        To sustain a conviction for Possession of a Firearm Prohibited, the Commonwealth must\n\nprove that a defendant possessed a firearm and was previously convicted of an offense enumerated in\n\n 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(b).

Super.\n\n2014), a co-defendant's testimony is sufficient to prove possession. InAntidormi, the appellant fired\n\none shot into a private residence while joyriding, and no firearms were recovered incident to his\n\narrest. At trial, a co-defendant testified that the appellant possessed a shotgun at the time of the\n\nshooting. The Superior Court found the single co-defendant's testimony sufficient to sustain the\n\nappellant's conviction, on the grounds that the jury was free to believe or disbelieve the co-\n\ndefendant's testimony. Id. at 743-757.\n\n          This case presents far stronger evidence of possession than what the Superior Court sustained\n\nin Antidormi. Two Commonwealth witnesses, Michelle White and Boyle, offered non-contradicted\n\ntestimony that the Defendant possessed a pistol and fired it into the victim's apartment. N.T.\n\n6/30/2015 at 84-85; N.T. 7/1/2015 at 15-16, 21. In a bifurcated hearing, the Defendant stipulated\n\nthat he had been previously convicted of an enumerated offense under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(b). N.T.\n\n7/2/2015 at 99-100.

This Court reviewed the Defendant's pre-sentence and mental health\n\nreports prior to sentencing. Prior to his arrest in this matter, the Defendant had five convictions-\n\nincluding Possession of an Instrument of Crime, Harassment, and drug charges-four probation\n\nviolations, and two revocations, for a prior record score of four. N.T. 9/18/2015 at 3-4. This crime\n\nviolated the terms of the Defendant's supervision under the Honorable Alfred DiBona and the\n\nHonorable Holly Ford. Id at 4. Although the Defendant earned his high school diploma and was\n\nemployed at the time of the murder, the Defendant incurred three disciplinary infractions in prison\n\n since his arrest, including a fifteen day segregation for controlled substance/alcohol abuse in May\n\n 2014 and a seven day cell lockdown in March 2015. Id. at 16-21.\n\n        At sentencing, this Court heard testimony from the Defendant's father, sister, and his middle\n\n school dean, who all informed this Court that the Defendant was a good father and devout Christian.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        12\n\fId. at 6-16, 22-28. The Defendant addressed this Court and apologized to the victim's family while\n\nmaintaining his innocence. Id. at 33-37. The Court considered each of these factors, as well. as the\n\ncontents of the presentence and mental health reports, before imposing the sentence. Id at 36-39.\n\n       The offense gravity score for Third-Degree Murder is fourteen and the standard range period\n\nof minimum confinement is fourteen years to twenty years. The offense gravity score for Possession\n\nof a Firearm Prohibited is ten and the standard range period of minimum confinement is four to five\n\nyears. This Court imposed consecutive standard range sentences of twenty to forty years and five to\n\nten years for Third-Degree Murder and Possession of a Firearm Prohibited, respectively, for an\n\naggregate sentence of twenty-five to fifty years imprisonment. Because the Defendant willfully\n\nescalated events leading to the victim's murder and has continued to engage in troubling behavior\n\npost-incarceration, the Defendant poses a substantial risk to society. The Defendant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that this Court neglected to consider mitigating factors or otherwise acted inconsistent\n\nwith the Sentencing Code. The protection of the Commonwealth's citizens calls for no less than the\n\nsentence imposed.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the decision ofthis Court should be affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                             BY THE COURT,\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Barbara A.
