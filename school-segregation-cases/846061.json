It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.\n\n        After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel\nhas determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material\nassistance in the determination of this matter. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a); 10th\nCir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n      1\n             Because he is a pro se litigant, Mr. Kenney’s filings are entitled to\nliberal construction. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per\ncuriam); Van Deelen v. Johnson, 497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\f                                   I. Background\n\n       Mr. Kenney filed suit against defendants AG Equipment Company (“AG”)\n\nand Laura Laurence on October 3, 2011, claiming violations of “Tital [sic] IV of\n\n[the] 1964 Civil Rights . . . Act[],” R. at 3 (Pl.’s Compl., filed Oct. 3, 2011)\n\n(capitalization altered), based upon the defendants’ alleged failure to hire him\n\ndespite his having attained the requisite certifications for employment, see, e.g.,\n\nid. at 6 (EEOC Intake Questionnaire, dated Sept. 23, 2011) (noting AG’s “failer\n\n[sic] to hire”).\n\n       The district court granted Mr. Kenney’s request to proceed in forma\n\npauperis (“IFP”) on October 5, 2011. See id. at 11 (Order Granting App. to\n\nProceed IFP, filed Oct. 5, 2011). However, on the same day, it dismissed the\n\ncomplaint sua sponte on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief could be granted. See id. at 12–13 (Dist. Ct. Order, filed Oct. 5, 2011).\n\nThe district court determined that Title IV of the Civil Rights Act primarily\n\naddresses school desegregation, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000c–2000c-9, and that the\n\n“limited factual allegations that Plaintiff presents in the complaint do not support\n\na claim alleging school segregation,” R. at 13. Moreover, liberally construing Mr.\n\nKenney’s filings, the court found that, to the extent that he intended to plead a\n\ncause of action for employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e–2000e-17, “he has failed to allege any basis on which he\n\nbelieves he was subjected to discrimination,” R. at 13.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      Additionally, the district court noted that Mr. Kenney is subject to filing\n\nrestrictions in the Northern District of Oklahoma. It considered the instant\n\nlawsuit an attempt to circumvent those filing restrictions, and thus concluded that\n\nit was unlikely that venue would be appropriate in the Western District.\n\nConsequently, it dismissed the complaint and simultaneously entered judgment.\n\n      A few weeks later, on October 27, Mr. Kenney filed a document titled,\n\n“Motion to Amend Complaint,” id. at 15 (Mot. to Am. Compl., filed Oct. 27,\n\n2011) (capitalization altered), which was denied by the court on November 4,\n\n2011, as an “essentially incomprehensible request for leave to amend,” id. at 17\n\n(Dist. Ct. Order, filed Nov. 4, 2011). Mr. Kenney filed a handwritten document\n\npurporting to be a notice of appeal on November 30, 2011.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n      The district court dismissed Mr. Kenney’s complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). 2 “We apply the same standard of\n\nreview for dismissals under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) that we employ for Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.” Kay\n\nv. Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007). That is, we review the propriety\n\n\n      2\n             Because the district court granted IFP status, it utilized the general\nprovisions of § 1915 in screening the complaint. “Section 1915(a) applies to all\npersons applying for IFP status, and not just to prisoners.” Lister v. Dep’t of\nTreasury, 408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added); see also Lopez\nv. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1126 n.7 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[S]ection 1915(e) applies to\nall in forma pauperis complaints . . . .”).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fof dismissal de novo. See, e.g., ClearOne Commc’ns, Inc. v. Biamp Sys., 653\n\nF.3d 1163, 1171 (10th Cir. 2011) (“[W]e review de novo a district court’s ruling\n\non a motion to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.”). Moreover, in assessing the propriety of\n\nthe district court’s dismissal, we apply “the same legal standard as the district\n\ncourt.” Jordan-Arapahoe, LLP v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs, 633 F.3d 1022, 1025\n\n(10th Cir. 2011). In that vein, we must accept as true “all well-pleaded factual\n\nallegations in a complaint and view these allegations in the light most favorable\n\nto the plaintiff.” Smith v. United States, 561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\nBut the plaintiff must allege facts that make his stated claim to relief facially\n\nplausible. See Jordan-Arapahoe, 633 F.3d at 1025. “A claim has facial\n\nplausibility when the [pleaded] factual content . . . allows the court to draw the\n\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id.\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937,\n\n1940 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA.    Jurisdiction\n\n      As a threshold matter, it is not clear whether Mr. Kenney is appealing from\n\nthe district court’s October 5, 2011, Order or its November 4 Order denying him\n\nan opportunity to amend. “[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case\n\nis a jurisdictional requirement.” De Leon v. Marcos, 659 F.3d 1276, 1280 (10th\n\nCir. 2011) (alteration in original) (quoting Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214\n\n                                          -4-\n\f(2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, ordinarily “a notice of\n\nappeal in a civil action ‘must be filed . . . within 30 days after the judgment or\n\norder appealed from is entered.’” Id. (quoting Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A)).\n\nOtherwise, we have no jurisdiction to assess the merits of the appeal.\n\n      It appears that Mr. Kenney filed his handwritten “notice of appeal” more\n\nthan thirty days after the district court’s original order dismissing his complaint.\n\nHowever, upon a careful review, we construe Mr. Kenney’s October 27 “Motion\n\nto Amend Complaint” as the functional equivalent of a timely filed notice of\n\nappeal. The document provided adequate notice of Mr. Kenney’s intention to file\n\nan appeal; notably, it requested that the court “accept notice of appeal to the 10th\n\nCircuit Court of Denver.” R. at 15 (capitalization altered); see Smith v. Barry,\n\n502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992) (“[T]he notice afforded by a document, not the\n\nlitigant’s motivation in filing it, determines the document’s sufficiency as a notice\n\nof appeal.”); accord United States v. Smith, 182 F.3d 733, 735 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nBecause of our policy to liberally construe pro se filings, see Van Deelen, 497\n\nF.3d at 1153 n.1, we therefore conclude that Mr. Kenney—through his motion to\n\namend—filed the functional equivalent of a timely notice of appeal with respect\n\nto the district court’s October 5 Order dismissing his complaint.\n\nB.    Merits\n\n      Nonetheless, we, like the district court, find Mr. Kenney’s complaint vague\n\nand unsupported by any facts that would entitle him to relief. He merely states\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthat the defendants failed to give him a job despite his personal qualifications.\n\nHowever, he does not aver in the complaint that he experienced any actionable\n\ndiscrimination. And while he attached an EEOC intake questionnaire to the\n\ncomplaint, in which he checked a box noting that “Race” was the basis for his\n\ngeneral allegations of employment discrimination, see R. at 6, he has not offered\n\na single fact supporting this assertion.\n\n      “A dismissal . . . is appropriate where a complaint fails to state a claim . . .\n\nand granting leave to amend would be futile.” Brereton v. Bountiful City Corp.,\n\n434 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir. 2006); see also Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106,\n\n1109–10 (10th Cir. 1991) (“Although dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) typically\n\nfollow a motion to dismiss, giving plaintiff notice and opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint, a court may dismiss sua sponte when it is patently obvious that the\n\nplaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity\n\nto amend his complaint would be futile.” (quoting McKinney v. Oklahoma, 925\n\nF.2d 363, 365 (10th Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in concluding that Mr. Kenney’s complaint should be\n\ndismissed without granting further leave to amend. Mr. Kenney has offered no\n\nallegations of discrimination in any of his filings—including his “Motion to\n\nAmend Complaint”—that come close to stating a plausible claim for relief.\n\n      And there is even less in the way of substance (or explanation) in his\n\nappellate filing. Specifically, his brief presents two issues for review: (1)\n\n                                           -6-\n\f“[d]ening [sic] reemployment”; and (2) “[f]iling same issues since 1989.” Aplt.\n\nOpening Br. at 3. However, it contains no supporting facts that make a start at\n\nexplaining why the district court erred in dismissing his complaint, how the\n\ndefendants otherwise engaged in impermissible discrimination, or how a further\n\namendment to the complaint could cure its glaring deficiencies. Although “we\n\nmust construe [Mr. Kenney’s] arguments liberally[,] this rule of liberal\n\nconstruction stops . . . at the point at which we begin to serve as his advocate.”\n\nUnited States v. Pinson, 584 F.3d 972, 975 (10th Cir. 2009); see also 5B Charles\n\nAlan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1357, at\n\n772–77 (3d ed. 2004) (“[While] the appellate court will accept the facts pleaded\n\nas true and read the complaint in the light most favorable to the pleader[, it] has\n\nno obligation to conjure up unpleaded allegations.” (footnote omitted)). In sum,\n\nbecause we discern no factual allegations by Mr. Kenney that would constitute\n\neven a colorable claim for relief (much less a plausible one), the district court did\n\nnot err in dismissing his complaint without granting leave to amend.\n\n                                  III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s order\n\ndismissing Mr. Kenney’s complaint. We further DENY as moot Mr. Kenney’s\n\nmotion to proceed IFP on appeal because he has already received prior approval\n\nfrom the district court. See Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3); see also United States v.\n\nDeClerck, 252 F. App’x 220, 221 n.2 (10th Cir. 2007) (“DeClerck has filed a\n\n                                          -7-\n\fmotion to proceed [IFP]. The district court previously granted [his] request to\n\nproceed [IFP] . . . . [His] motion to this court, therefore, is unnecessary.”).\n\n\n\n                                        Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                        JEROME A.

Ct. Order, filed Nov. 4, 2011). Mr. Kenney filed a handwritten document\n\npurporting to be a notice of appeal on November 30, 2011.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n      The district court dismissed Mr. Kenney’s complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). 2 “We apply the same standard of\n\nreview for dismissals under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) that we employ for Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.” Kay\n\nv.

That is, we review the propriety\n\n\n      2\n             Because the district court granted IFP status, it utilized the general\nprovisions of § 1915 in screening the complaint. “Section 1915(a) applies to all\npersons applying for IFP status, and not just to prisoners.” Lister v.

Jurisdiction\n\n      As a threshold matter, it is not clear whether Mr. Kenney is appealing from\n\nthe district court’s October 5, 2011, Order or its November 4 Order denying him\n\nan opportunity to amend. “[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case\n\nis a jurisdictional requirement.” De Leon v. Marcos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"616375\"><a href=\"/opinion/616375/de-leon-v-marcos/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1280 (10th\n\nCir. 2011) (alteration in original) (quoting Bowles v. Russell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145714\"><a href=\"/opinion/145714/bowles-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214\n\n                                          -4-\n\f(2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, ordinarily “a notice of\n\nappeal in a civil action ‘must be filed . . . within 30 days after the judgment or\n\norder appealed from is entered.’” Id. (quoting Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A)).\n\nOtherwise, we have no jurisdiction to assess the merits of the appeal.\n\n      It appears that Mr. Kenney filed his handwritten “notice of appeal” more\n\nthan thirty days after the district court’s original order dismissing his complaint.\n\nHowever, upon a careful review, we construe Mr. Kenney’s October 27 “Motion\n\nto Amend Complaint” as the functional equivalent of a timely filed notice of\n\nappeal. The document provided adequate notice of Mr. Kenney’s intention to file\n\nan appeal; notably, it requested that the court “accept notice of appeal to the 10th\n\nCircuit Court of Denver.” R. at 15 (capitalization altered); see Smith v. Barry,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112673\"><a href=\"/opinion/112673/smith-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1992) (“[T]he notice afforded by a document, not the\n\nlitigant’s motivation in filing it, determines the document’s sufficiency as a notice\n\nof appeal.”); accord United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158138\"><a href=\"/opinion/158138/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nBecause of our policy to liberally construe pro se filings, see Van Deelen, 497\n\nF.3d at 1153 n.1, we therefore conclude that Mr. Kenney—through his motion to\n\namend—filed the functional equivalent of a timely notice of appeal with respect\n\nto the district court’s October 5 Order dismissing his complaint.\n\nB.    Merits\n\n      Nonetheless, we, like the district court, find Mr. Kenney’s complaint vague\n\nand unsupported by any facts that would entitle him to relief. He merely states\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthat the defendants failed to give him a job despite his personal qualifications.\n\nHowever, he does not aver in the complaint that he experienced any actionable\n\ndiscrimination. And while he attached an EEOC intake questionnaire to the\n\ncomplaint, in which he checked a box noting that “Race” was the basis for his\n\ngeneral allegations of employment discrimination, see R. at 6, he has not offered\n\na single fact supporting this assertion.\n\n      “A dismissal . . . is appropriate where a complaint fails to state a claim . . .\n\nand granting leave to amend would be futile.” Brereton v. Bountiful City Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166989\"><a href=\"/opinion/166989/brereton-v-bountiful-city-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (10th Cir. 2006); see also Hall v. Bellmon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562712\"><a href=\"/opinion/562712/kenneth-e-hall-jr-v-henry-bellmon-governor-robert-h-henry-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1109–10 (10th Cir. 1991) (“Although dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) typically\n\nfollow a motion to dismiss, giving plaintiff notice and opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint, a court may dismiss sua sponte when it is patently obvious that the\n\nplaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity\n\nto amend his complaint would be futile.” (quoting McKinney v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555558\"><a href=\"/opinion/555558/robert-dale-mckinney-v-state-of-oklahoma-department-of-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365 (10th Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in concluding that Mr. Kenney’s complaint should be\n\ndismissed without granting further leave to amend. Mr. Kenney has offered no\n\nallegations of discrimination in any of his filings—including his “Motion to\n\nAmend Complaint”—that come close to stating a plausible claim for relief.\n\n      And there is even less in the way of substance (or explanation) in his\n\nappellate filing. Specifically, his brief presents two issues for review: (1)\n\n                                           -6-\n\f“[d]ening [sic] reemployment”; and (2) “[f]iling same issues since 1989.” Aplt.\n\nOpening Br. at 3. However, it contains no supporting facts that make a start at\n\nexplaining why the district court erred in dismissing his complaint, how the\n\ndefendants otherwise engaged in impermissible discrimination, or how a further\n\namendment to the complaint could cure its glaring deficiencies. Although “we\n\nmust construe [Mr. Kenney’s] arguments liberally[,] this rule of liberal\n\nconstruction stops . . . at the point at which we begin to serve as his advocate.”\n\nUnited States v. Pinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172793\"><a href=\"/opinion/172793/united-states-v-pinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975 (10th Cir. 2009); see also 5B Charles\n\nAlan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1357, at\n\n772–77 (3d ed. 2004) (“[While] the appellate court will accept the facts pleaded\n\nas true and read the complaint in the light most favorable to the pleader[, it] has\n\nno obligation to conjure up unpleaded allegations.” (footnote omitted)). In sum,\n\nbecause we discern no factual allegations by Mr. Kenney that would constitute\n\neven a colorable claim for relief (much less a plausible one), the district court did\n\nnot err in dismissing his complaint without granting leave to amend.\n\n                                  III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s order\n\ndismissing Mr. Kenney’s complaint. We further DENY as moot Mr. Kenney’s\n\nmotion to proceed IFP on appeal because he has already received prior approval\n\nfrom the district court. See Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3); see also United States v.\n\nDeClerck, 252 F. App’x 220, 221 n.2 (10th Cir. 2007) (“DeClerck has filed a\n\n                                          -7-\n\fmotion to proceed [IFP].
