In 1965 and 1968 the district\n\ncourt denied Plaintiffs relief and those denials were affirmed on\n\n      *\n      Honorable John H. Moore II, Senior U.S. District Judge for\nthe Middle District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n\fappeal. Lockett v. Board of Educ. of Muscogee County, 391 F.2d 272\n\n(5th Cir.1968);   Lockett v. Board of Educ. of Muscogee County, 342\n\nF.2d 225 (5th Cir.1965). In 1971, however, following the decisions\n\nin Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct.\n\n1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), and Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\n\n402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), this court\n\nordered   the   school    district   to   present   and   implement   a\n\ndesegregation plan consistent with the principles established in\n\nSwann, Singleton v. Jackson Mun. Sch. Dist., 419 F.2d 1211 (5th\n\nCir.1969), and Carter v. West Feliciana Parish Sch. Bd., 432 F.2d\n\n875 (5th Cir.1970).      See Lockett v. Board of Educ. of Muscogee\n\nCounty, 442 F.2d 1336 (5th Cir.1971).     In response to this court's\n\norder, the school district submitted a plan to the district court\n\nto achieve student and faculty racial compositions proportionate to\n\nthe   racial    compositions   of    their   respective    populations\n\ncounty-wide.    That plan reads in pertinent part:\n\n   AMENDED PLAN TO DESEGREGATE THE SCHOOLS OF MUSCOGEE COUNTY,\nGEORGIA\n\n           The Board of Education of Muscogee County School\n      District, in continuation of its effort to unify its schools\n      to eliminate every vestige of discrimination because of race\n      or color of its students and to maintain a fully desegregated\n      system, hereby adopts this Amended plan of Desegregation so as\n      to fully comply with the law in such cases made and provided.\n      The percentage of white and Negro students attending the\n      school in the County are approximately 70% white and 30%\n      Negro, and it is the purpose and intent of this Board to\n      obtain approximate proportionate representation of each race\n      in each school in the most efficient manner;\n\n                   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:\n\n                          STUDENT ASSIGNMENT\n\n           All white students, equal in number to 70% of the\n      capacity of the school to which they have been assigned,\n      living nearest to said school, and all Negro students, equal\n\f     in number to 30% of the capacity of the school to which they\n     have been assigned, living nearest to said school, shall\n     attend said school for the year beginning in September, 1971.\n\n          All other students assigned to said school shall be\n     assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the school\n     nearest to the residence of said student which does not then\n     have its quota of white or Negro students as above stated.\n\n          All students who have not been assigned to any school for\n     the current Fall term, or who later enter the School System,\n     shall be assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the\n     school nearest the residence of said student which then has\n     space available and has less than its quota of white or Negro\n     students, as the case may be, then assigned to said school.\n\n          There shall be no transfer or assignment of any student\n     during the entire school year, except in case, absent the\n     consideration of race, a change is educationally called for or\n     where compelling hardship or other good reason is shown by the\n     student.\n\n          In school years after the school year beginning in\n     September, 1971, the Board of Education, prior to the end of\n     such school year, shall determine the approximate percentage\n     of white and Negro students attending the school in this\n     District and assignment of students shall be made as above\n     provided so that the approximate number of white and Negro\n     students in each school shall be substantially the same as the\n     percentage of white and Negro students in the entire School\n     System.\n\nThe approved plan included a provision which created a continuing\n\nobligation   to   make   student   assignments   in   proportion   to   the\n\ncounty-wide racial composition consistent with the 1971 order. The\n\nschool district's proposal was approved by court order on July 14,\n\n1971 (\"1971 order\"), and accordingly the parties were subject to\n\nthe court's supervision until such time as the district court\n\ndismissed the order.1\n\n     1\n      In 1972 the order was amended to exempt first grade and\nkindergarten students from the plan. The 1972 amendment also\nstated:\n\n          The quota or percentage of white and Negro students in\n          each school in the next school term shall be\n          substantially the same as the percentage of white and\n\f     Throughout the 1970s the school district implemented student\n\nreassignment and attendance zone adjustments in order to achieve\n\nits goal of proportionate student representation, and submitted\n\nannual reports describing its efforts and their effects on the\n\nracial composition of the schools.               By about 1973, 57 of the 64\n\nschools    had     racial     compositions      within     a   10%    range    of   the\n\ncounty-wide student racial composition, and an additional 5 schools\n\nfell within a 20% range of the county-wide ratio.                          The school\n\ndistrict     maintained        relatively       constant       statistical     racial\n\ncompositions within its schools up through the 1976-77 academic\n\nyear.     Similarly, the racial compositions of faculty and staff\n\nwithin    most    of    the   schools    were    within    a    15%    range   of   the\n\ncounty-wide average from 1972 to 1980. The record does not contain\n\nspecific    data    describing     the    relative       quality      of   facilities,\n\ntransportation, or extracurricular activities throughout the 1970s\n\nand 1980s.\n\n     By the end of the 1970s the school district began reducing the\n\nnumber of student reassignments and attendance zone adjustments.\n\nDuring    the    same   period   that    the    district       was    curtailing    its\n\naffirmative desegregation efforts, the demographics of the county\n\nbegan to shift, which resulted in a decrease in the number of white\n\nstudents, an increase in the number of black students, and racially\n\n\n            Negro students in the entire school system at the end\n            of the current school term.\n\n     We find unpersuasive the school district's argument that\n     under this language, the plan's proportionate representation\n     requirement was not applicable to any school year after\n     1972-73. Indeed, the school district itself continued to\n     submit data on the racial composition within its schools\n     well into the 1980s.\n\fpolarized    residential        areas.      By    the     mid-1980s      the   racial\n\ncompositions        within    many    schools      again    were        statistically\n\ndisproportionate with the county-wide ratios, and indeed, by 1991\n\na number of racially identifiable schools existed.2                     Similarly, by\n\nthe   mid-1980s      the    number   of   schools    with       acceptable     faculty\n\ncompositions was declining.          At no time prior to the commencement\n\nof the current proceedings did the school district attempt to\n\ndismiss or modify the 1971 order.\n\n      In    1991,    Plaintiffs,      citing      the     increase      in   racially\n\nidentifiable schools in the district, filed a motion seeking an\n\ninjunction and an order directing the school district to take\n\nwhatever action necessary to achieve proportionate representation.\n\nThe   district      court    dismissed    the    motion    as    moot    because   the\n\noriginal class of plaintiffs were no longer students;                     however, in\n\nNovember of 1992, this court remanded the motion for consideration\n\non its merits pursuant to Graves v. Walton County Bd. of Educ., 686\n\nF.2d 1135 (5th Cir., Unit B, 1982).              Lockett v. Board of Educ. of\n\nMuscogee County Sch. Dist., 976 F.2d 648 (11th Cir.1992). Prior to\n\nremand, however, the school district implemented a neighborhood\n\nschool plan, whereby cross-district busing would be eliminated and\n\nelementary students would be assigned to schools in their local\n\nneighborhoods, thus potentially aggravating the racial imbalances.\n\nOn May 21, 1992, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to enjoin\n\n      2\n      According to the school district's expert on desegregation,\nby 1993, 23 of the 33 elementary schools, 3 of the 8 middle\nschools, and 2 of the 7 high schools were no longer within a 20%\nrange of the county-wide student racial percentages. Only 15 of\nthe 48 schools were within a 15% range of the county-wide racial\npercentage, whereas, 12 schools had student populations that were\nmore than 90% of one race.\n\fimplementation of the new neighborhood assignment plan during the\n\npendency of the appeal;        however, the district court denied the\n\nmotion finding no irreparable harm, relying in part on the school\n\ndistrict's     proposal   to   institute     a    magnet    program   and    a\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program.           In 1993, Plaintiffs again\n\nmoved to enjoin the district's assignment plan, and again, the\n\ncourt denied their motion.       Finally, on June 7, 1993, the school\n\ndistrict moved for a final dismissal and a declaration of unitary\n\nstatus.\n\n     On November 18, 1994, following an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court granted the school district's motion, finding:               (1)\n\nthe school district effectively had disestablished its dual system\n\nin 1963;   (2) the school district effectively had desegregated its\n\nschools in the 1971-72 school year;          (3) the school district had\n\nmaintained a high degree of racial balance in student assignments\n\nfor a longer period of time than most large counties in the\n\ncountry;     and (4) the racial imbalance exhibited in the 1980s and\n\n1990s, and present today, resulted from demographic changes over\n\nwhich the school district had no control.                  Based upon these\n\nfindings, the court ruled that the Muscogee County School District\n\nhad satisfied its burden of showing that it had successfully\n\neliminated the vestiges of the old dual system to the maximum\n\nextent practicable, and that the school district had exhibited a\n\ngood faith commitment to the discharge of its constitutional\n\nduties.\n\n                                Discussion\n\n      In 1954, the Supreme Court recognized that state-compelled\n\fsegregation in education violates the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.                  Brown v. Board of Ed., 347 U.S. 483,\n\n495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 692, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (\"Brown I \").                              However,\n\nthe     Court        did     not     order       the     immediate         eradication       of\n\nconstitutionally violative dual school systems. Instead, the Court\n\nordered district courts to supervise school systems that had\n\npreviously practiced de jure segregation in their efforts to\n\neffectuate      the        constitutional           mandate    of    Brown     I   \"with    all\n\ndeliberate speed.\"               Brown v. Board of Ed., 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75\n\nS.Ct. 753, 757, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) (\"                        Brown II \").         District\n\ncourts were instructed to assert jurisdiction over school systems\n\nin order to ensure compliance with the courts' remedial orders and\n\nthe Constitution until such time as a district court determined\n\nthat the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable.                    Swann, 402 U.S. at 15, 91 S.Ct. at\n\n1275.     To this end, a school district is obligated to comply in\n\ngood faith with the entire desegregation decree throughout the life\n\nof the order, and must \"take whatever [affirmative] steps might be\n\nnecessary       to    convert        to    a    unitary       system      in   which    racial\n\ndiscrimination would be eliminated root and branch,\" Green, 391\n\nU.S.    at   437-38,        88     S.Ct.   at       1693-94.        The   purpose      of   such\n\nremediation,          however,        is       to     eliminate        the     vestiges      of\n\nstate-compelled dual systems, and not to remedy racial imbalances\n\nunrelated to de jure segregation.                     Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467,\n\n494, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1447, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).\n\n        Forty-one years have passed since Brown I and Brown II, yet a\n\nnumber of school systems, as well as the district courts that\n\fretain jurisdiction over them, continue to struggle with the scope\n\nand duration of their duties under Brown II and its progeny.                    In\n\nthis case the primary issue is whether Muscogee County's school\n\ndistrict fulfilled its obligations under the district court's 1971\n\ndesegregation order, and whether the district court correctly\n\nterminated its jurisdiction over the case.\n\n       The school district argues, and the district court agreed,\n\nthat    unitary   status   had     been    achieved   in    around    1980,   and\n\ntherefore, the school district's obligations under the 1971 order\n\nterminated at that time even though unitary status was not actually\n\ndeclared until 1994.       The school district also contends that the\n\ndistrict court did not err in finding that the racial imbalances\n\nthat currently exist are the result of demographic shifts, and are\n\nnot the vestiges of its prior dual system.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the school district's obligation to make\n\naffirmative efforts to desegregate the school system commenced in\n\n1971 and did not end until the district court declared unitary\n\nstatus in 1994.      During that time, however, the school district\n\nfailed to make good faith efforts to desegregate, as exemplified by\n\nthe district's curtailment of desegregation programs after 1980,\n\nits refusal to implement majority-to-minority transfer programs,\n\nand    its   implementation   of    a     neighborhood     school    plan,   which\n\nincreased racial imbalances.            Thus, according to Plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court ignored the school district's failure to satisfy its\n\nduties under the court order between about 1980 and 1994, the year\n\nthat the court actually declared unitary status.\n\n       Plaintiffs also argue that the school district failed to\n\fproffer sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that schools\n\nthat     are    racially       identifiable      are    vestiges       of   prior\n\nunconstitutional segregation. Plaintiffs argue that in ruling that\n\nthe current imbalances are due primarily to demographic shifts, the\n\ndistrict court failed to consider the adverse actions of the school\n\ndistrict,      including    the    curtailment   of    student   transfers     and\n\nattendance zone adjustments, the siting of schools, and the use of\n\nmobile classrooms.          Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that because the\n\nschool district failed to keep statistics on the effects of these\n\nactions, Plaintiffs could not rebut the demographic data that the\n\nschool district presented.\n\n         Because the Muscogee County School Board did not seek a\n\ndeclaration of unitary status prior to the current litigation, our\n\ninquiry into whether the school district has attained unitary\n\nstatus    depends    upon     an   examination   of    the   school    district's\n\ndesegregation       efforts    and   their   effects    from    1971   until   the\n\npresent.       It is well-established that \"persons subject to an\n\ninjunctive order issued by a court with jurisdiction are expected\n\nto obey that decree until it is modified or reversed, even if they\n\nhave proper grounds to object to the order.\"                   Celotex Corp. v.\n\nEdwards, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 1493, 1498, 131 L.Ed.2d 403\n\n(1995).     The school district was subject to the 1971 court order\n\nuntil such time as the district court vacated that order by\n\ndeclaring that the school district had achieved unitary status and\n\ncomplied with the order in good faith.           Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v.\n\nSpangler, 427 U.S. 424, 439-40, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2706, 49 L.Ed.2d 599\n\n(1976).     Thus, to the extent that the district court ignored the\n\fschool district's actions after 1980, while the district was still\n\nsubject to the 1971 order, the court erred.\n\n        In determining whether a school district has complied with\n\nthe constitutional mandate of Brown I and Brown II, a district\n\ncourt    must   examine    student   assignments,   faculty   and   staff\n\nassignments,     facilities,     extra   curricular   activities,     and\n\ntransportation.    Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1693-94;\n\nBoard of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237,\n\n250, 111 S.Ct. 630, 638, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991).         More recently,\n\ncourts have also considered the relative quality of education\n\noffered to black and white students.      Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1446.    Where a school district has a history of practicing\n\nsegregation, substantially disproportionate racial compositions\n\nwithin the schools is presumed to be constitutionally violative,\n\nand the school district bears the burden of proving that the\n\nimbalances are not the result of present or past discriminatory\n\naction on its part.       Swann, 402 U.S. at 25, 91 S.Ct. at 1281.     In\n\ndetermining whether the school district has satisfied that burden,\n\na district court should consider (1) whether the racial imbalances\n\nare traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional violations,\n\n(2) whether the school district has exhibited a record of full and\n\nsatisfactory compliance with the decree, and (3) \"whether the\n\nschool district has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents\n\nand students of the once disfavored race, its good faith commitment\n\nto the whole of the court's decree and to those provisions of the\n\nlaws and the constitution that were the predicate for judicial\n\nintervention in the first place.\"        Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491, 112\n\fS.Ct. at 1446.\n\n     The district court found, and the school district concedes,\n\nthat student assignments in the Muscogee County schools currently\n\nare racially unbalanced.       The parties also agree that the school\n\ndistrict previously had operated an unconstitutional dual system.\n\nThus, the first issue on appeal is whether the district court\n\nclearly erred in ruling that the school district satisfied its\n\nburden of showing that current racial imbalances are not caused by\n\nprior unconstitutional practices, but instead, are the result of\n\ndemographic shifts within the county and the student population.\n\n     The district court in Freeman was presented with a factually\n\nsimilar inquiry. 3    In that case, the DeKalb County School System,\n\nwhich had previously practiced de jure segregation, voluntarily\n\nproposed a plan to desegregate its school system.                 The district\n\ncourt approved the proposed plan through a 1969 consent order which\n\ncalled for the closing of all former de jure black schools and the\n\nreassignment of students among the remaining schools.              In 1976 the\n\ndistrict   court     ordered   the     school    system     to    expand   its\n\nmajority-to-minority    student      transfer    program,   to    establish   a\n\nbi-racial committee to oversee the transfer program and boundary\n\nline changes, and to reassign faculty to achieve racial balance.\n\nIn 1983, the district court again ordered an adjustment to the\n\nmajority-to-minority     transfer     program.      In    1986,    the   school\n\ndistrict filed a motion for final dismissal of the court order, and\n\na declaration that the district had achieved unitary status.\n\n\n     3\n      For the facts underlying Freeman, and the district court's\nanalysis, see Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474-85, 112 S.Ct. at 1437-43.\n\fAlthough the motion for dismissal was filed at a time when student\n\nracial compositions in the schools were unbalanced, the school\n\nsystem argued that the imbalances were due to demographic changes\n\nindependent of prior unconstitutional practices.\n\n       In analyzing whether the imbalances were attributable to the\n\ndual    system,    or   indeed,      whether   the   prior      de   jure   school\n\nsegregation had contributed to the county's demographics, the\n\ndistrict court focused on the interaction between the school\n\nsystem's policies and the demographic shifts. To determine whether\n\nthe    school      district    had       \"accomplished    maximum      practical\n\ndesegregation,\" the court examined the specific steps that the\n\nschool system had taken to combat the effects of demographic shifts\n\non the racial composition of the schools, particularly noting its\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program, magnet school program, and\n\nother racially integrated scholastic programs.                  Finding that the\n\nschool district's affirmative efforts to desegregate had little or\n\nno    offsetting    effect    on   the    racial   mix,   the    district    court\n\ndetermined that the racial imbalances resulted almost completely\n\nfrom the demographic shifts, and thus the imbalances were not due\n\nto the school board's actions or inaction.                      Thus, the court\n\nrecognized that the impact of demographics on racial composition\n\ncan only be assessed relative to the other factors contributing to\n\nthe racial composition in the schools.             In affirming the district\n\ncourt's findings, the Supreme Court ratified the district court's\n\napproach for analyzing the causes of racial imbalance within\n\nschools.\n\n       In this case, the district court found that at least for the\n\ffirst half of the 1970s the Muscogee County school district had\n\nattained acceptable statistical racial compositions within its\n\nschools.      Having   made   that   finding,    the   district    court   then\n\ndetermined that any later imbalances were caused, not by factors\n\nover which the school district had control, but by the demographic\n\nshifts which took place after 1980.             Consequently, the district\n\ncourt effectively ruled that the school district was under no\n\nobligation to make affirmative desegregation efforts after 1980.\n\nThe district court apparently assumed that once a school system has\n\nachieved acceptable racial compositions within its schools, it has\n\nno ongoing obligation to try to offset later imbalances caused by\n\ncircumstances over which it has no control.               The district court\n\nalso assumed that demographic shifts are necessarily independent of\n\nprior unconstitutional practices.\n\n      The district court, however, made some erroneous assumptions.\n\nFirst, a school district does not escape its obligation to make\n\naffirmative efforts to remedy racial imbalances simply because the\n\nimbalances are caused by circumstances \"over which [the school\n\ndistrict] has no control\";      instead, while under court supervision\n\nthe school district must make efforts to eradicate all imbalances\n\nwhich are traceable to prior de jure segregation.                 Freeman, 503\n\nU.S. at 491, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.          The school district bears the\n\nburden of showing that no such causal link exists, and absent such\n\na showing, the district must continue to make affirmative efforts\n\nto   remedy   racial    imbalances    while     subject    to   court   order.\n\nMoreover, in the case of demographic shifts and their resulting\n\nracial imbalances, the Supreme Court has recognized that school\n\fsegregation      is    a    contributing     cause    of    housing     segregation,\n\nColumbus Bd. of Ed. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 465 n. 13, 99 S.Ct.\n\n2941, 2950 n. 13, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979), and thus, demographic\n\nshifts are not necessarily independent of prior unconstitutional\n\npractices.       Finally, in finding unitary status retroactively, the\n\ndistrict     court     failed     to    examine      the    relative    quality    of\n\nfacilities, transportation, and extracurricular activities that\n\nexisted in the 1970s and 1980s, conditions that must be considered\n\nin conjunction with student assignments in determining unitary\n\nstatus.    Thus, the district court erred to the extent that it held\n\n(1) that the school district's obligations to make affirmative\n\nefforts under the 1971 order ceased upon achieving statistically\n\nacceptable racial compositions in the 1970s;                      (2) that a school\n\nsystem     has    no       obligation   to   remedy        imbalances    caused    by\n\ncircumstances over which the school district has no control;                      (3)\n\nthat demographics shifts are never caused by prior de jure school\n\nsegregation;       and (4) that unitary status can be determined on\n\nstudent and faculty assignments alone.\n\n         The proper analysis requires an examination of the various\n\nfactors that may have contributed to the current racial imbalance,\n\nand   to   determine whether,           in   spite    of    the    school   system's\n\naffirmative efforts to accomplish maximum practical desegregation,\n\nthe impact of demographic shifts still would have resulted in the\n\nimbalance.       Unlike the situation in Freeman, in which the DeKalb\n\nCounty school district had implemented desegregation programs to\n\naffirmatively combat demographic shifts, the school district in\n\nthis case actually reduced the number of student reassignments and\n\fattendance    zone   changes   just    as   demographic     shifts   began   to\n\nadversely affect the racial composition of the schools, and did not\n\nimplement new desegregation initiatives in their place.              Moreover,\n\nbecause of an absence of data, this court has no basis for\n\nassessing the arguably adverse impact that the school board's\n\nneighborhood assignment plan, grade structure changes, portable\n\nclassrooms, and student transfers had on racial composition within\n\nthe schools.     Thus, on the record presented, we have no way of\n\nassessing the impact of shifting demographics on the current racial\n\ncompositions compared with other variables, including the school\n\ndistrict's actions and inaction, which arguably exacerbated, rather\n\nthan alleviated, the racial imbalances during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAt the very least, we do not believe that the school district\n\ncarried its burden of showing that current imbalances, caused by\n\ndemographic    shifts     or   otherwise,    are    not    the   vestiges    of\n\nunconstitutional practices.\n\n      Under the second factor in Freeman, this court must look at\n\nthe degree to which the school district complied with the 1971\n\norder throughout the life of the order.            See Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n491, 112 S.Ct. at 1446;        see also Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249, 111\n\nS.Ct. at 637 (\"[I]n deciding whether to modify or dissolve a\n\ndesegregation decree, a school board's compliance with previous\n\ncourt orders is obviously relevant.\").              The terms of the 1971\n\norder, which the school district itself drafted, obligated the\n\nschool   district    to   annually    determine    the    county-wide   racial\n\ncomposition of the students within the district, and to reassign\n\nstudents so that the racial composition within the schools would be\n\fsubstantially the same as the composition county-wide.                          Moreover,\n\nthe explicit purpose of the order was to eliminate every vestige of\n\ndiscrimination         and   to    maintain      a    fully     desegregated     system.\n\nAlthough a school district is not constitutionally required to\n\nexhibit    a     particular       racial   mix       at   all    times,    or    to   make\n\nyear-by-year adjustments, Swann, 402 U.S. at 24, 32, 91 S.Ct. at\n\n1280, 1284, a school district must make affirmative efforts to\n\ncomply with the desegregation decree until a district court has\n\ndeclared that unitary status has been achieved.\n\n     The record in this case shows that the Muscogee County school\n\ndistrict did make annual student reassignments and attendance zone\n\nadjustments for most of the 1970s.                   The statistical data cited in\n\nthe district court's order indicates that for at least six years\n\nthe district maintained racial compositions within the schools\n\nproportionate to the racial composition of the county's entire\n\nstudent population.          Thus, the record supports a finding that the\n\nschool district complied with the court order with respect to\n\nstudent and faculty assignments throughout the 1970s. However, the\n\nschool district did not request a declaration of unitary status\n\nuntil 1993, and therefore, it had a continuing obligation to abide\n\nby the order until such time as the district court modified or\n\nvacated the order.           The record reflects, and the district court\n\nfound,    that    by    1980      the   school       district    stopped    making    the\n\nadjustments it had made in the 1970s, and that the curtailment of\n\ndesegregation efforts may have contributed to the subsequent racial\n\nimbalances.        In    addition,       the   school      district    implemented      a\n\nneighborhood assignment plan, which required elementary students to\n\fattend local neighborhood schools and eliminated cross-district\n\nbusing.    Not only did the neighborhood plan have the potential to\n\nexacerbate segregation, it directly contravened the clear mandate\n\nof the order.   Thus, the record suggests that although the school\n\ndistrict initially complied with the 1971 order, in about 1980 the\n\ndistrict    unilaterally   decided   that   it   had    satisfied   its\n\nobligations, and based upon that decision, it essentially ignored\n\nthe desegregation decree for the last fourteen years that it was\n\nunder the court's supervision.\n\n     Under the third factor in Freeman, before divesting itself of\n\njurisdiction, a district court must determine whether the school\n\ndistrict has complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\n\nsince it was entered and with the constitutional principles it\n\nembraces.    Freeman, 503 U.S. at 497, 112 S.Ct. at 1449.     The good\n\nfaith requirement assures parents, students, and the public that\n\nthey will be protected against further injuries or stigma, id., by\n\nmaking \"it unlikely that the school district would return to its\n\nformer ways,\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636-37;         see\n\nalso Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d 313, 321 (1st Cir.1987) (\"a finding\n\nof good faith ... reduces the possibility that a school system's\n\ncompliance with court orders is but a temporary constitutional\n\nritual\"). In addition, if the school district has demonstrated its\n\ngood faith, \"[t]he causal link between current conditions and the\n\nprior violation is even more attenuated.\"        Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n496, 497, 112 S.Ct. at 1448, 1449.    When a school district has not\n\ndemonstrated good faith under a plan to remedy violations, the\n\nSupreme Court has approved ongoing supervision.        Id.\n\f         As noted above, after the school district had achieved\n\nproportionate representation for a number of years, it essentially\n\nstopped reassigning students and rezoning—activities that ensure\n\nracial    balance.   Moreover,   the   district   never   implemented   a\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program, a tool basic to \"every\"\n\ndesegregation program, Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281.\n\nIndeed, through its neighborhood assignment plan, the district\n\naffirmatively increased racial imbalances.        Finally, \"[i]t is for\n\nthe court of first instance to determine the question of the\n\nvalidity of the law, and until its decision is reversed for error\n\nby orderly review, either by itself or by a higher court, its\n\norders based on its decision are to be respected, and disobedience\n\nof them is contempt of its lawful authority, to be punished.\"\n\nSpangler, 427 U.S. at 439, 96 S.Ct. at 2706 (quoting           Howat v.\n\nKansas, 258 U.S. 181, 190, 42 S.Ct. 277, 281, 66 L.Ed. 550 (1922)).\n\nAlthough the school district could have sought modification or\n\ntermination of the order at any time, it had no authority to decide\n\nunilaterally that it had achieved unitary status and had complied\n\nwith the 1971 order in good faith.      Because the district did not\n\nseek termination of the order through the proper judicial channels,\n\nprior to 1993 the district court never got the opportunity to\n\ncontemporaneously review all of the other factors which indicate\n\nthe achievement of unitary status. Given the district's failure to\n\nabide by its obligation to make affirmative efforts to desegregate\n\nthrough much of the 1980s and 1990s, and its disregard for the\n\njudicial decree, we believe the school district did not exhibit\n\ngood faith for the last ten to fifteen years that it was subject to\n\fthe 1971 order.\n\n      In summary, the school district failed (1) to meet its burden\n\nof   showing   current   imbalances    are    not    vestiges   of    its    prior\n\nunconstitutional practices, (2) to comply with the 1971 order\n\nthroughout the 1980s and 1990s, and (3) to evince a good faith\n\ncommitment to the court's order and the principles established in\n\nBrown. In light of these deficiencies, it is not clear whether the\n\nschool    board's    actions   after   1980    exacerbated,      rather      than\n\nalleviated, school segregation in Muscogee County at a time when\n\nthe district was still subject to court order.             Therefore, we hold\n\nthat the district court erred in divesting itself of jurisdiction.\n\nAccordingly, the district court must retain jurisdiction in order\n\nto monitor the progress of the school district's desegregation\n\nefforts until such time as a reliable body of data exists to assure\n\nthe district court that the school district has desegregated its\n\nschools to the maximum extent practicable.                In particular, the\n\ndistrict court should assess the school district's efforts in, and\n\ncommitment     to,   combating    imbalances        by   evaluating    its     new\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program, magnet school program, and\n\nany other programs that can be implemented in order to ensure\n\nlong-term desegregation.4        The school district also should begin\n\ncompiling statistics comparing the quality of the education between\n\n\n      4\n      In both its order denying Plaintiffs' 1991 motion to enjoin\nthe neighborhood assignment plan and its order vacating\njurisdiction, the district court relied upon the school board's\npromises to implement an effective majority-to-minority transfer\nprogram and a magnet school program. However, this court does\nnot have any information regarding the scope of those programs,\nand whether they are having any appreciable effect on school\ndesegregation efforts.\n\fthose schools with a majority of white students and those schools\n\nwith a majority of black students so that upon the district court's\n\nreview of the school system's compliance with its desegregation\n\ndecree, quality of education can be assessed along with student\n\nassignments.    See generally Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112 S.Ct. at\n\n1446 (It is an appropriate exercise of discretion to address not\n\nonly the elements of a unitary system discussed in Green, but to\n\n\"inquire whether other elements ought to be identified, and to\n\ndetermine whether minority students were being disadvantage in ways\n\nthat required the formulation of new and further remedies to insure\n\nfull compliance with the court's decree.\").\n\n     Because the parties and the district court agree that unitary\n\nstatus   has   been   achieved   with   respect    to    faculty   and   staff\n\nassignments,    facilities,      transportation,        and   extracurricular\n\nactivities,    the    district   court's   order    divesting      itself   of\n\njurisdiction over these matters is affirmed.\n\n     Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in\n\npart, reversed in part, and remanded for the district court to\n\nretain jurisdiction consistent with the principles discussed above.\n\n     AFFIRMED in part;     REVERSED in part;       and REMANDED.\n\f",

That plan reads in pertinent part:\n\n   AMENDED PLAN TO DESEGREGATE THE SCHOOLS OF MUSCOGEE COUNTY,\nGEORGIA\n\n           The Board of Education of Muscogee County School\n      District, in continuation of its effort to unify its schools\n      to eliminate every vestige of discrimination because of race\n      or color of its students and to maintain a fully desegregated\n      system, hereby adopts this Amended plan of Desegregation so as\n      to fully comply with the law in such cases made and provided.\n      The percentage of white and Negro students attending the\n      school in the County are approximately 70% white and 30%\n      Negro, and it is the purpose and intent of this Board to\n      obtain approximate proportionate representation of each race\n      in each school in the most efficient manner;\n\n                   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:\n\n                          STUDENT ASSIGNMENT\n\n           All white students, equal in number to 70% of the\n      capacity of the school to which they have been assigned,\n      living nearest to said school, and all Negro students, equal\n\f     in number to 30% of the capacity of the school to which they\n     have been assigned, living nearest to said school, shall\n     attend said school for the year beginning in September, 1971.\n\n          All other students assigned to said school shall be\n     assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the school\n     nearest to the residence of said student which does not then\n     have its quota of white or Negro students as above stated.\n\n          All students who have not been assigned to any school for\n     the current Fall term, or who later enter the School System,\n     shall be assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the\n     school nearest the residence of said student which then has\n     space available and has less than its quota of white or Negro\n     students, as the case may be, then assigned to said school.\n\n          There shall be no transfer or assignment of any student\n     during the entire school year, except in case, absent the\n     consideration of race, a change is educationally called for or\n     where compelling hardship or other good reason is shown by the\n     student.\n\n          In school years after the school year beginning in\n     September, 1971, the Board of Education, prior to the end of\n     such school year, shall determine the approximate percentage\n     of white and Negro students attending the school in this\n     District and assignment of students shall be made as above\n     provided so that the approximate number of white and Negro\n     students in each school shall be substantially the same as the\n     percentage of white and Negro students in the entire School\n     System.\n\nThe approved plan included a provision which created a continuing\n\nobligation   to   make   student   assignments   in   proportion   to   the\n\ncounty-wide racial composition consistent with the 1971 order. The\n\nschool district's proposal was approved by court order on July 14,\n\n1971 (\"1971 order\"), and accordingly the parties were subject to\n\nthe court's supervision until such time as the district court\n\ndismissed the order.1\n\n     1\n      In 1972 the order was amended to exempt first grade and\nkindergarten students from the plan. The 1972 amendment also\nstated:\n\n          The quota or percentage of white and Negro students in\n          each school in the next school term shall be\n          substantially the same as the percentage of white and\n\f     Throughout the 1970s the school district implemented student\n\nreassignment and attendance zone adjustments in order to achieve\n\nits goal of proportionate student representation, and submitted\n\nannual reports describing its efforts and their effects on the\n\nracial composition of the schools.               By about 1973, 57 of the 64\n\nschools    had     racial     compositions      within     a   10%    range    of   the\n\ncounty-wide student racial composition, and an additional 5 schools\n\nfell within a 20% range of the county-wide ratio.                          The school\n\ndistrict     maintained        relatively       constant       statistical     racial\n\ncompositions within its schools up through the 1976-77 academic\n\nyear.     Similarly, the racial compositions of faculty and staff\n\nwithin    most    of    the   schools    were    within    a    15%    range   of   the\n\ncounty-wide average from 1972 to 1980. The record does not contain\n\nspecific    data    describing     the    relative       quality      of   facilities,\n\ntransportation, or extracurricular activities throughout the 1970s\n\nand 1980s.\n\n     By the end of the 1970s the school district began reducing the\n\nnumber of student reassignments and attendance zone adjustments.\n\nDuring    the    same   period   that    the    district       was    curtailing    its\n\naffirmative desegregation efforts, the demographics of the county\n\nbegan to shift, which resulted in a decrease in the number of white\n\nstudents, an increase in the number of black students, and racially\n\n\n            Negro students in the entire school system at the end\n            of the current school term.\n\n     We find unpersuasive the school district's argument that\n     under this language, the plan's proportionate representation\n     requirement was not applicable to any school year after\n     1972-73. Indeed, the school district itself continued to\n     submit data on the racial composition within its schools\n     well into the 1980s.\n\fpolarized    residential        areas.      By    the     mid-1980s      the   racial\n\ncompositions        within    many    schools      again    were        statistically\n\ndisproportionate with the county-wide ratios, and indeed, by 1991\n\na number of racially identifiable schools existed.2                     Similarly, by\n\nthe   mid-1980s      the    number   of   schools    with       acceptable     faculty\n\ncompositions was declining.          At no time prior to the commencement\n\nof the current proceedings did the school district attempt to\n\ndismiss or modify the 1971 order.\n\n      In    1991,    Plaintiffs,      citing      the     increase      in   racially\n\nidentifiable schools in the district, filed a motion seeking an\n\ninjunction and an order directing the school district to take\n\nwhatever action necessary to achieve proportionate representation.\n\nThe   district      court    dismissed    the    motion    as    moot    because   the\n\noriginal class of plaintiffs were no longer students;                     however, in\n\nNovember of 1992, this court remanded the motion for consideration\n\non its merits pursuant to Graves v.

Prior to\n\nremand, however, the school district implemented a neighborhood\n\nschool plan, whereby cross-district busing would be eliminated and\n\nelementary students would be assigned to schools in their local\n\nneighborhoods, thus potentially aggravating the racial imbalances.\n\nOn May 21, 1992, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to enjoin\n\n      2\n      According to the school district's expert on desegregation,\nby 1993, 23 of the 33 elementary schools, 3 of the 8 middle\nschools, and 2 of the 7 high schools were no longer within a 20%\nrange of the county-wide student racial percentages. Only 15 of\nthe 48 schools were within a 15% range of the county-wide racial\npercentage, whereas, 12 schools had student populations that were\nmore than 90% of one race.\n\fimplementation of the new neighborhood assignment plan during the\n\npendency of the appeal;        however, the district court denied the\n\nmotion finding no irreparable harm, relying in part on the school\n\ndistrict's     proposal   to   institute     a    magnet    program   and    a\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program.           In 1993, Plaintiffs again\n\nmoved to enjoin the district's assignment plan, and again, the\n\ncourt denied their motion.       Finally, on June 7, 1993, the school\n\ndistrict moved for a final dismissal and a declaration of unitary\n\nstatus.\n\n     On November 18, 1994, following an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court granted the school district's motion, finding:               (1)\n\nthe school district effectively had disestablished its dual system\n\nin 1963;   (2) the school district effectively had desegregated its\n\nschools in the 1971-72 school year;          (3) the school district had\n\nmaintained a high degree of racial balance in student assignments\n\nfor a longer period of time than most large counties in the\n\ncountry;     and (4) the racial imbalance exhibited in the 1980s and\n\n1990s, and present today, resulted from demographic changes over\n\nwhich the school district had no control.                  Based upon these\n\nfindings, the court ruled that the Muscogee County School District\n\nhad satisfied its burden of showing that it had successfully\n\neliminated the vestiges of the old dual system to the maximum\n\nextent practicable, and that the school district had exhibited a\n\ngood faith commitment to the discharge of its constitutional\n\nduties.\n\n                                Discussion\n\n      In 1954, the Supreme Court recognized that state-compelled\n\fsegregation in education violates the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.

In\n\nthis case the primary issue is whether Muscogee County's school\n\ndistrict fulfilled its obligations under the district court's 1971\n\ndesegregation order, and whether the district court correctly\n\nterminated its jurisdiction over the case.\n\n       The school district argues, and the district court agreed,\n\nthat    unitary   status   had     been    achieved   in    around    1980,   and\n\ntherefore, the school district's obligations under the 1971 order\n\nterminated at that time even though unitary status was not actually\n\ndeclared until 1994.       The school district also contends that the\n\ndistrict court did not err in finding that the racial imbalances\n\nthat currently exist are the result of demographic shifts, and are\n\nnot the vestiges of its prior dual system.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the school district's obligation to make\n\naffirmative efforts to desegregate the school system commenced in\n\n1971 and did not end until the district court declared unitary\n\nstatus in 1994.      During that time, however, the school district\n\nfailed to make good faith efforts to desegregate, as exemplified by\n\nthe district's curtailment of desegregation programs after 1980,\n\nits refusal to implement majority-to-minority transfer programs,\n\nand    its   implementation   of    a     neighborhood     school    plan,   which\n\nincreased racial imbalances.            Thus, according to Plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court ignored the school district's failure to satisfy its\n\nduties under the court order between about 1980 and 1994, the year\n\nthat the court actually declared unitary status.\n\n       Plaintiffs also argue that the school district failed to\n\fproffer sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that schools\n\nthat     are    racially       identifiable      are    vestiges       of   prior\n\nunconstitutional segregation. Plaintiffs argue that in ruling that\n\nthe current imbalances are due primarily to demographic shifts, the\n\ndistrict court failed to consider the adverse actions of the school\n\ndistrict,      including    the    curtailment   of    student   transfers     and\n\nattendance zone adjustments, the siting of schools, and the use of\n\nmobile classrooms.          Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that because the\n\nschool district failed to keep statistics on the effects of these\n\nactions, Plaintiffs could not rebut the demographic data that the\n\nschool district presented.\n\n         Because the Muscogee County School Board did not seek a\n\ndeclaration of unitary status prior to the current litigation, our\n\ninquiry into whether the school district has attained unitary\n\nstatus    depends    upon     an   examination   of    the   school    district's\n\ndesegregation       efforts    and   their   effects    from    1971   until   the\n\npresent.

More recently,\n\ncourts have also considered the relative quality of education\n\noffered to black and white students.      Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1446.    Where a school district has a history of practicing\n\nsegregation, substantially disproportionate racial compositions\n\nwithin the schools is presumed to be constitutionally violative,\n\nand the school district bears the burden of proving that the\n\nimbalances are not the result of present or past discriminatory\n\naction on its part.       Swann, 402 U.S. at 25, 91 S.Ct. at 1281.     In\n\ndetermining whether the school district has satisfied that burden,\n\na district court should consider (1) whether the racial imbalances\n\nare traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional violations,\n\n(2) whether the school district has exhibited a record of full and\n\nsatisfactory compliance with the decree, and (3) \"whether the\n\nschool district has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents\n\nand students of the once disfavored race, its good faith commitment\n\nto the whole of the court's decree and to those provisions of the\n\nlaws and the constitution that were the predicate for judicial\n\nintervention in the first place.\"        Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491, 112\n\fS.Ct. at 1446.\n\n     The district court found, and the school district concedes,\n\nthat student assignments in the Muscogee County schools currently\n\nare racially unbalanced.       The parties also agree that the school\n\ndistrict previously had operated an unconstitutional dual system.\n\nThus, the first issue on appeal is whether the district court\n\nclearly erred in ruling that the school district satisfied its\n\nburden of showing that current racial imbalances are not caused by\n\nprior unconstitutional practices, but instead, are the result of\n\ndemographic shifts within the county and the student population.\n\n     The district court in Freeman was presented with a factually\n\nsimilar inquiry. 3    In that case, the DeKalb County School System,\n\nwhich had previously practiced de jure segregation, voluntarily\n\nproposed a plan to desegregate its school system.                 The district\n\ncourt approved the proposed plan through a 1969 consent order which\n\ncalled for the closing of all former de jure black schools and the\n\nreassignment of students among the remaining schools.              In 1976 the\n\ndistrict   court     ordered   the     school    system     to    expand   its\n\nmajority-to-minority    student      transfer    program,   to    establish   a\n\nbi-racial committee to oversee the transfer program and boundary\n\nline changes, and to reassign faculty to achieve racial balance.\n\nIn 1983, the district court again ordered an adjustment to the\n\nmajority-to-minority     transfer     program.      In    1986,    the   school\n\ndistrict filed a motion for final dismissal of the court order, and\n\na declaration that the district had achieved unitary status.\n\n\n     3\n      For the facts underlying Freeman, and the district court's\nanalysis, see Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474-85, 112 S.Ct. at 1437-43.\n\fAlthough the motion for dismissal was filed at a time when student\n\nracial compositions in the schools were unbalanced, the school\n\nsystem argued that the imbalances were due to demographic changes\n\nindependent of prior unconstitutional practices.\n\n       In analyzing whether the imbalances were attributable to the\n\ndual    system,    or   indeed,      whether   the   prior      de   jure   school\n\nsegregation had contributed to the county's demographics, the\n\ndistrict court focused on the interaction between the school\n\nsystem's policies and the demographic shifts. To determine whether\n\nthe    school      district    had       \"accomplished    maximum      practical\n\ndesegregation,\" the court examined the specific steps that the\n\nschool system had taken to combat the effects of demographic shifts\n\non the racial composition of the schools, particularly noting its\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program, magnet school program, and\n\nother racially integrated scholastic programs.                  Finding that the\n\nschool district's affirmative efforts to desegregate had little or\n\nno    offsetting    effect    on   the    racial   mix,   the    district    court\n\ndetermined that the racial imbalances resulted almost completely\n\nfrom the demographic shifts, and thus the imbalances were not due\n\nto the school board's actions or inaction.                      Thus, the court\n\nrecognized that the impact of demographics on racial composition\n\ncan only be assessed relative to the other factors contributing to\n\nthe racial composition in the schools.             In affirming the district\n\ncourt's findings, the Supreme Court ratified the district court's\n\napproach for analyzing the causes of racial imbalance within\n\nschools.\n\n       In this case, the district court found that at least for the\n\ffirst half of the 1970s the Muscogee County school district had\n\nattained acceptable statistical racial compositions within its\n\nschools.      Having   made   that   finding,    the   district    court   then\n\ndetermined that any later imbalances were caused, not by factors\n\nover which the school district had control, but by the demographic\n\nshifts which took place after 1980.             Consequently, the district\n\ncourt effectively ruled that the school district was under no\n\nobligation to make affirmative desegregation efforts after 1980.\n\nThe district court apparently assumed that once a school system has\n\nachieved acceptable racial compositions within its schools, it has\n\nno ongoing obligation to try to offset later imbalances caused by\n\ncircumstances over which it has no control.               The district court\n\nalso assumed that demographic shifts are necessarily independent of\n\nprior unconstitutional practices.\n\n      The district court, however, made some erroneous assumptions.\n\nFirst, a school district does not escape its obligation to make\n\naffirmative efforts to remedy racial imbalances simply because the\n\nimbalances are caused by circumstances \"over which [the school\n\ndistrict] has no control\";      instead, while under court supervision\n\nthe school district must make efforts to eradicate all imbalances\n\nwhich are traceable to prior de jure segregation.                 Freeman, 503\n\nU.S. at 491, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.          The school district bears the\n\nburden of showing that no such causal link exists, and absent such\n\na showing, the district must continue to make affirmative efforts\n\nto   remedy   racial    imbalances    while     subject    to   court   order.\n\nMoreover, in the case of demographic shifts and their resulting\n\nracial imbalances, the Supreme Court has recognized that school\n\fsegregation      is    a    contributing     cause    of    housing     segregation,\n\nColumbus Bd. of Ed. v.

Finally, in finding unitary status retroactively, the\n\ndistrict     court     failed     to    examine      the    relative    quality    of\n\nfacilities, transportation, and extracurricular activities that\n\nexisted in the 1970s and 1980s, conditions that must be considered\n\nin conjunction with student assignments in determining unitary\n\nstatus.    Thus, the district court erred to the extent that it held\n\n(1) that the school district's obligations to make affirmative\n\nefforts under the 1971 order ceased upon achieving statistically\n\nacceptable racial compositions in the 1970s;                      (2) that a school\n\nsystem     has    no       obligation   to   remedy        imbalances    caused    by\n\ncircumstances over which the school district has no control;                      (3)\n\nthat demographics shifts are never caused by prior de jure school\n\nsegregation;       and (4) that unitary status can be determined on\n\nstudent and faculty assignments alone.\n\n         The proper analysis requires an examination of the various\n\nfactors that may have contributed to the current racial imbalance,\n\nand   to   determine whether,           in   spite    of    the    school   system's\n\naffirmative efforts to accomplish maximum practical desegregation,\n\nthe impact of demographic shifts still would have resulted in the\n\nimbalance.       Unlike the situation in Freeman, in which the DeKalb\n\nCounty school district had implemented desegregation programs to\n\naffirmatively combat demographic shifts, the school district in\n\nthis case actually reduced the number of student reassignments and\n\fattendance    zone   changes   just    as   demographic     shifts   began   to\n\nadversely affect the racial composition of the schools, and did not\n\nimplement new desegregation initiatives in their place.              Moreover,\n\nbecause of an absence of data, this court has no basis for\n\nassessing the arguably adverse impact that the school board's\n\nneighborhood assignment plan, grade structure changes, portable\n\nclassrooms, and student transfers had on racial composition within\n\nthe schools.     Thus, on the record presented, we have no way of\n\nassessing the impact of shifting demographics on the current racial\n\ncompositions compared with other variables, including the school\n\ndistrict's actions and inaction, which arguably exacerbated, rather\n\nthan alleviated, the racial imbalances during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAt the very least, we do not believe that the school district\n\ncarried its burden of showing that current imbalances, caused by\n\ndemographic    shifts     or   otherwise,    are    not    the   vestiges    of\n\nunconstitutional practices.\n\n      Under the second factor in Freeman, this court must look at\n\nthe degree to which the school district complied with the 1971\n\norder throughout the life of the order.            See Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n491, 112 S.Ct. at 1446;        see also Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249, 111\n\nS.Ct. at 637 (\"[I]n deciding whether to modify or dissolve a\n\ndesegregation decree, a school board's compliance with previous\n\ncourt orders is obviously relevant.\").              The terms of the 1971\n\norder, which the school district itself drafted, obligated the\n\nschool   district    to   annually    determine    the    county-wide   racial\n\ncomposition of the students within the district, and to reassign\n\nstudents so that the racial composition within the schools would be\n\fsubstantially the same as the composition county-wide.                          Moreover,\n\nthe explicit purpose of the order was to eliminate every vestige of\n\ndiscrimination         and   to    maintain      a    fully     desegregated     system.\n\nAlthough a school district is not constitutionally required to\n\nexhibit    a     particular       racial   mix       at   all    times,    or    to   make\n\nyear-by-year adjustments, Swann, 402 U.S. at 24, 32, 91 S.Ct. at\n\n1280, 1284, a school district must make affirmative efforts to\n\ncomply with the desegregation decree until a district court has\n\ndeclared that unitary status has been achieved.\n\n     The record in this case shows that the Muscogee County school\n\ndistrict did make annual student reassignments and attendance zone\n\nadjustments for most of the 1970s.                   The statistical data cited in\n\nthe district court's order indicates that for at least six years\n\nthe district maintained racial compositions within the schools\n\nproportionate to the racial composition of the county's entire\n\nstudent population.          Thus, the record supports a finding that the\n\nschool district complied with the court order with respect to\n\nstudent and faculty assignments throughout the 1970s. However, the\n\nschool district did not request a declaration of unitary status\n\nuntil 1993, and therefore, it had a continuing obligation to abide\n\nby the order until such time as the district court modified or\n\nvacated the order.           The record reflects, and the district court\n\nfound,    that    by    1980      the   school       district    stopped    making    the\n\nadjustments it had made in the 1970s, and that the curtailment of\n\ndesegregation efforts may have contributed to the subsequent racial\n\nimbalances.        In    addition,       the   school      district    implemented      a\n\nneighborhood assignment plan, which required elementary students to\n\fattend local neighborhood schools and eliminated cross-district\n\nbusing.    Not only did the neighborhood plan have the potential to\n\nexacerbate segregation, it directly contravened the clear mandate\n\nof the order.   Thus, the record suggests that although the school\n\ndistrict initially complied with the 1971 order, in about 1980 the\n\ndistrict    unilaterally   decided   that   it   had    satisfied   its\n\nobligations, and based upon that decision, it essentially ignored\n\nthe desegregation decree for the last fourteen years that it was\n\nunder the court's supervision.\n\n     Under the third factor in Freeman, before divesting itself of\n\njurisdiction, a district court must determine whether the school\n\ndistrict has complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\n\nsince it was entered and with the constitutional principles it\n\nembraces.    Freeman, 503 U.S. at 497, 112 S.Ct. at 1449.     The good\n\nfaith requirement assures parents, students, and the public that\n\nthey will be protected against further injuries or stigma, id., by\n\nmaking \"it unlikely that the school district would return to its\n\nformer ways,\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636-37;         see\n\nalso Morgan v. Nucci, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496180\"><a href=\"/opinion/496180/tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-two/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (1st Cir.1987) (\"a finding\n\nof good faith ... reduces the possibility that a school system's\n\ncompliance with court orders is but a temporary constitutional\n\nritual\"). In addition, if the school district has demonstrated its\n\ngood faith, \"[t]he causal link between current conditions and the\n\nprior violation is even more attenuated.\"        Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n496, 497, 112 S.Ct. at 1448, 1449.    When a school district has not\n\ndemonstrated good faith under a plan to remedy violations, the\n\nSupreme Court has approved ongoing supervision.        Id.\n\f         As noted above, after the school district had achieved\n\nproportionate representation for a number of years, it essentially\n\nstopped reassigning students and rezoning—activities that ensure\n\nracial    balance.   Moreover,   the   district   never   implemented   a\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program, a tool basic to \"every\"\n\ndesegregation program, Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281.\n\nIndeed, through its neighborhood assignment plan, the district\n\naffirmatively increased racial imbalances.        Finally, \"[i]t is for\n\nthe court of first instance to determine the question of the\n\nvalidity of the law, and until its decision is reversed for error\n\nby orderly review, either by itself or by a higher court, its\n\norders based on its decision are to be respected, and disobedience\n\nof them is contempt of its lawful authority, to be punished.\"\n\nSpangler, 427 U.S. at 439, 96 S.Ct. at 2706 (quoting           Howat v.\n\nKansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99939\"><a href=\"/opinion/99939/howat-v-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99939\"><a href=\"/opinion/99939/howat-v-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1922)).\n\nAlthough the school district could have sought modification or\n\ntermination of the order at any time, it had no authority to decide\n\nunilaterally that it had achieved unitary status and had complied\n\nwith the 1971 order in good faith.      Because the district did not\n\nseek termination of the order through the proper judicial channels,\n\nprior to 1993 the district court never got the opportunity to\n\ncontemporaneously review all of the other factors which indicate\n\nthe achievement of unitary status. Given the district's failure to\n\nabide by its obligation to make affirmative efforts to desegregate\n\nthrough much of the 1980s and 1990s, and its disregard for the\n\njudicial decree, we believe the school district did not exhibit\n\ngood faith for the last ten to fifteen years that it was subject to\n\fthe 1971 order.\n\n      In summary, the school district failed (1) to meet its burden\n\nof   showing   current   imbalances    are    not    vestiges   of    its    prior\n\nunconstitutional practices, (2) to comply with the 1971 order\n\nthroughout the 1980s and 1990s, and (3) to evince a good faith\n\ncommitment to the court's order and the principles established in\n\nBrown. In light of these deficiencies, it is not clear whether the\n\nschool    board's    actions   after   1980    exacerbated,      rather      than\n\nalleviated, school segregation in Muscogee County at a time when\n\nthe district was still subject to court order.             Therefore, we hold\n\nthat the district court erred in divesting itself of jurisdiction.\n\nAccordingly, the district court must retain jurisdiction in order\n\nto monitor the progress of the school district's desegregation\n\nefforts until such time as a reliable body of data exists to assure\n\nthe district court that the school district has desegregated its\n\nschools to the maximum extent practicable.                In particular, the\n\ndistrict court should assess the school district's efforts in, and\n\ncommitment     to,   combating    imbalances        by   evaluating    its     new\n\nmajority-to-minority transfer program, magnet school program, and\n\nany other programs that can be implemented in order to ensure\n\nlong-term desegregation.4        The school district also should begin\n\ncompiling statistics comparing the quality of the education between\n\n\n      4\n      In both its order denying Plaintiffs' 1991 motion to enjoin\nthe neighborhood assignment plan and its order vacating\njurisdiction, the district court relied upon the school board's\npromises to implement an effective majority-to-minority transfer\nprogram and a magnet school program. However, this court does\nnot have any information regarding the scope of those programs,\nand whether they are having any appreciable effect on school\ndesegregation efforts.\n\fthose schools with a majority of white students and those schools\n\nwith a majority of black students so that upon the district court's\n\nreview of the school system's compliance with its desegregation\n\ndecree, quality of education can be assessed along with student\n\nassignments.    See generally Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112 S.Ct. at\n\n1446 (It is an appropriate exercise of discretion to address not\n\nonly the elements of a unitary system discussed in Green, but to\n\n\"inquire whether other elements ought to be identified, and to\n\ndetermine whether minority students were being disadvantage in ways\n\nthat required the formulation of new and further remedies to insure\n\nfull compliance with the court's decree.\").\n\n     Because the parties and the district court agree that unitary\n\nstatus   has   been   achieved   with   respect    to    faculty   and   staff\n\nassignments,    facilities,      transportation,        and   extracurricular\n\nactivities,    the    district   court's   order    divesting      itself   of\n\njurisdiction over these matters is affirmed.\n\n     Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in\n\npart, reversed in part, and remanded for the district court to\n\nretain jurisdiction consistent with the principles discussed above.\n\n     AFFIRMED in part;     REVERSED in part;       and REMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
