We agree and affirm.\n                   PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe Regulation\n       The Regulation at issue here involves homeowner insurance, and specifically\nreplacement coverage in the event of a covered event like a fire.2 In general, there are\n\n\n\n\n       1   Undesignated statutory references are to the Insurance Code.\n       2  The Regulation provides: “No licensee shall communicate an estimate of\nreplacement cost to an applicant or insured in connection with an application for or\nrenewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that provides coverage on a replacement cost\nbasis, unless the requirements and standards set forth in subdivisions (a) through (e)\nbelow are met:\n        “(a) The estimate of replacement cost shall include the expenses that would\nreasonably be incurred to rebuild the insured structure(s) in its entirety, including at least\nthe following:\n        “(1) Cost of labor, building materials and supplies;\n        “(2) Overhead and profit;\n        “(3) Cost of demolition and debris removal;\n        “(4) Cost of permits and architect’s plans; and\n        “(5) Consideration of components and features of the insured structure, including\nat least the following:\n        “(A) Type of foundation;\n        “(B) Type of frame;\n        “(C) Roofing materials and type of roof;\n        “(D) Siding materials and type of siding;\n        “(E) Whether the structure is located on a slope;\n        “(F) The square footage of the living space;\n        “(G) Geographic location of property;\n        “(H) Number of stories and any nonstandard wall heights;\n                                               2\n\f        “(I) Materials used in, and generic types of, interior features and finishes, such as,\nwhere applicable, the type of heating and air conditioning system, walls, flooring, ceiling,\nfireplaces, kitchen, and bath(s);\n        “(J) Age of the structure or the year it was built; and\n        “(K) Size and type of attached garage.\n        “(b) The estimate of replacement cost shall be based on an estimate of the cost to\nrebuild or replace the structure taking into account the cost to reconstruct the single\nproperty being evaluated, as compared to the cost to build multiple, or tract, dwellings.\n        “(c) The estimate of replacement cost shall not be based upon the resale value of\nthe land, or upon the amount or outstanding balance of any loan.\n        “(d) The estimate of replacement cost shall not include a deduction for physical\ndepreciation.\n        “(e) The licensee shall no less frequently than annually take reasonable steps to\nverify that the sources and methods used to generate the estimate of replacement cost are\nkept current to reflect changes in the costs of reconstruction and rebuilding, including\nchanges in labor, building materials, and supplies, based upon the geographic location of\nthe insured structure. The estimate of replacement cost shall be created using such\nreasonably current sources and methods.\n        “(f) Except as provided in subdivision (k) of this Section 2695.183, the provisions\nof this article are binding upon licensees, notwithstanding the fact that information, data\nor statistical methods used or relied upon by a licensee to estimate replacement cost may\nbe obtained through a third party source. Any and all information received by the\nDepartment pursuant to this article shall be accorded the degree of confidential treatment\nrequired by section 735.5 of the Insurance Code or Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 3 of\nTitle 2 of the Government Code, commencing at section 11180.\n        “(g)(1) If a licensee communicates an estimate of replacement cost to an applicant\nor insured in connection with an application for or renewal of a homeowners’ insurance\npolicy that provides coverage on a replacement cost basis, the licensee must provide a\ncopy of the estimate of replacement cost to the applicant or insured at the time the\nestimate is communicated. However, in the event the estimate of replacement cost is\ncommunicated by a licensee to an applicant to whom the licensee determines an\ninsurance policy shall not be issued, then the licensee is not required pursuant to the\npreceding sentence to provide a copy of the estimate of replacement cost. In the event\nthe estimate of replacement cost is communicated by telephone to an insured, the copy of\nthe estimate shall be mailed to the insured no later than three business days after the time\nof the telephone conversation. In the event the estimate of replacement cost is\ncommunicated by telephone to an applicant, the copy of the estimate shall be mailed to\nthe applicant no later than three business days after the applicant agrees to purchase the\ncoverage.\n        “(2) An estimate of replacement cost provided in connection with an application\nfor or renewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that provides coverage on a\n                                                3\n\freplacement cost basis must itemize the projected cost for each element specified in\nparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4), and shall identify the assumptions made for each of the\ncomponents and features listed in paragraph (a)(5), of this Section 2695.183.\n        “(h) If an estimate of replacement cost is updated or revised by, or on behalf of,\nthe licensee and the revised estimate of replacement cost is communicated to the\napplicant or insured in connection with an application for or renewal of a homeowners’\ninsurance policy that provides coverage on a replacement cost basis, the licensee shall\nprovide a copy of the revised or updated estimate of replacement cost to the applicant as\nprovided in paragraph (g)(1) of this Section 2695.183, or to the insured simultaneously\nwith the renewal offer, as the case may be. This subdivision (h) shall not apply when the\nupdate or revision to the estimate of replacement cost or the policy limit results solely\nfrom the application of an inflationary provision in a policy or an inflation factor. This\nsubdivision (h) shall not obligate a licensee to recalculate an estimate of replacement cost\non an annual basis.\n        “(i) Licensees shall maintain (1) a record of the information supplied by the\napplicant or insured that is used by the licensee to generate the estimate of replacement\ncost, and (2) a copy of any estimate of replacement cost supplied to the applicant or\ninsured pursuant to paragraph (g)(1), or subdivision (h), of this Section 2695.183. If a\npolicy is issued, these records and copies shall be maintained for the entire term of the\ninsurance policy or the duration of coverage, whichever terminates later in time, and for\nfive years thereafter. However, if the estimate of replacement cost is provided to an\napplicant to whom an insurance policy is never issued, the records and copies referred to\nin the first sentence of this subdivision (i) shall be maintained for the period of time the\nlicensee ordinarily maintains applicant files in the normal course of business, provided\nthat such period of time shall be at least sufficient to ensure that the licensee is able to\ncomply with the provisions of this subdivision in the event the policy is issued to the\napplicant.\n        “(j) To communicate an estimate of replacement value not comporting with\nsubdivisions (a) through (e) of this Section 2695.183 to an applicant or insured in\nconnection with an application for or renewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that\nprovides coverage on a replacement cost basis constitutes making a statement with\nrespect to the business of insurance which is misleading and which by the exercise of\nreasonable care should be known to be misleading, pursuant to Insurance Code section\n790.03.\n        “(k) When an insurer identifies one or more specific sources or tools that a broker-\nagent must use to create an estimate of replacement cost,\n        “(1) the insurer shall prescribe complete written procedures to be followed by\nbroker-agents when they use the sources or tools,\n        “(2) the insurer shall provide the broker-agent with the training and written\ntraining materials necessary to properly utilize the sources or tools according to the\ninsurer’s prescribed procedures, and\n                                                4\n\f        “(3) the insurer, and not the broker-agent, shall be responsible for any\nnoncompliance with this Section 2695.183 that results from the failure of the estimate to\nsatisfy the requirements of subdivisions (a) through (e), unless that noncompliance results\nfrom failure by the broker-agent to follow the insurer’s prescribed written procedures\nwhen using the source or tool.\n        “(l) This Section 2695.183 applies to all communications by a licensee, verbal or\nwritten, with the sole exception of internal communications within an insurer, or\nconfidential communications between an insurer and its contractor, that concern the\ninsurer’s underwriting decisions and that never come to the attention of an applicant or\ninsured.\n        “(m) No provision of this article shall be construed as requiring a licensee to\nestimate replacement cost or to set or recommend a policy limit to an applicant or\ninsured. No provision of this article shall be construed as requiring a licensee to advise\nthe applicant or insured as to the sufficiency of an estimate of replacement cost.\n        “(n) No provision of this article shall limit or preclude a licensee from providing\nand explaining the California Residential Property Insurance Disclosure, as cited in\nInsurance Code section 10102, explaining the various forms of replacement cost coverage\navailable to an applicant or insured, or explaining how replacement cost basis policies\noperate to pay claims.\n        “(o) No provision of this article shall limit or preclude an applicant or insured\nfrom obtaining his or her own estimate of replacement cost from an entity permitted to\nmake such an estimate by Insurance Code section 1749.85.\n        “(p) For purposes of this subdivision (p), ‘minimum amount of insurance’ shall\nmean the lowest amount of insurance that an insurer requires to be purchased in order for\nthe insurer to underwrite the coverage on a particular property, based upon an insurer’s\neligibility guidelines, underwriting practices and/or actuarial analysis. An insurer may\ncommunicate to an applicant or insured that an applicant or insured must purchase a\nminimum amount of insurance that does not comport with subdivisions (a) through (e) of\nthis Section 2695.183; however, if the minimum amount of insurance that is\ncommunicated is based in whole or in part on an estimate of replacement value, the\nestimate of replacement value shall also be provided to the applicant or insured and shall\ncomply with all applicable provisions of this article. Nothing in this article shall limit or\npreclude an insurer from agreeing to provide coverage for a policy limit that is greater\nthan or less than an estimate of replacement cost provided pursuant to this article.\n        “(q) This article shall apply only to estimates of replacement value that are\nprepared, communicated or used by a licensee on or after June 27, 2011.”\n                                             5\n\fthree kinds of replacement cost coverage. Each requires an insurer to pay replacement\ncosts up to a limit defined in the policy or up to a set amount above the policy limit.3 If\nthe cost of repairing or rebuilding a home damaged or destroyed by a covered event\nexceeds that limit, the homeowner has to pay the difference. Section 2051.5, subdivision\n(a) defines replacement cost, in pertinent part, as “the amount that it would cost the\ninsured to repair, rebuild, or replace the thing lost or injured, without a deduction for\nphysical depreciation, or the policy limit, whichever is less.”\n       The Regulation was promulgated in 2010 in response to complaints received from\nhomeowners who lost their residences in the wildfires in Southern California in 2003,\n2007, and 2008. These complaints arose when homeowners learned that they did not\nhave enough insurance to cover the full cost of repairing or rebuilding their homes\nbecause when they bought their homeowner insurance, the estimates of replacement\nvalue were too low.4\n       The introductory sentence of the Regulation prohibits a “licensee” from\n“communicat[ing] an estimate of replacement cost to an applicant or insured in\nconnection with an application for renewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that\n\n\n       3  According to the Commissioner’s “Initial Statement of Reasons,” dated April 2,\n2010, issued when the Commissioner proposed the Regulation, there is “Limited\nReplacement Cost Coverage With an Additional Percentage which pays replacement\ncosts up to a specified amount above the policy limit; [¶] Limited Replacement Cost\nCoverage With No Additional Percentage which pays replacement costs up to” the dollar\nlimit set forth in the policy; and “Actual Cash Value Coverage which pays the fair market\nvalue of the dwelling at the time of the loss, or the cost to repair, rebuild, or replace the\ndamaged or destroyed dwelling with like kind and quality construction up to the policy\nlimit.”\n       4 The administrative record contains complaints about, among other things, the\nestimator’s using an incorrect description of the property or its square footage, failing to\ninspect the property, not considering building code requirements, not including obvious\ncosts like debris removal, and not adjusting for inflation in arriving at a replacement cost\nestimate. It also included a survey conducted after the 2007 wildfires reciting that\n75 percent of those responding to the survey complained that their insurance limits did\nnot cover the cost of rebuilding their structures.\n                                              6\n\fprovides coverage on a replacement cost basis” that does not satisfy the content and\nformat provisions in the Regulation. Subdivision (a) of the Regulation states, among\nother requirements, that an estimate of replacement cost “shall include expenses that\nwould reasonably be incurred to rebuild the insured structure(s) in its entirety” and\nrequires in subdivision (a)(1)–(4) that the estimate include the cost of labor, building\nmaterials and supplies, overhead, profit, demolition, debris removal, permits, and\narchitect’s plans, and in subdivision (a)(5) that the licensee “consider” 11 designated\n“components and features of the insured structure.”\n       The estimate must itemize “the projected cost” of each expense listed in\nsubdivision (a)(1)–(4), and the assumptions as to the components listed in subdivision\n(a)(5). (Reg., subd. (g)(2).) A copy of the estimate and any update of the estimate\n“must” be given to the applicant. (Reg., subds. (g)(1), (h).) Subdivision (e) requires that\n“reasonable steps” be taken to “verify . . . sources and methods used to generate the\nestimate of replacement cost” “no less frequently than annually.” The Regulation also\nimposes recordkeeping obligations on the licensee. (Reg., subd. (i).)\n       Of particular significance to the issue before us is subdivision (j) of the\nRegulation. It provides that “communicat[ing] an estimate of replacement value not\ncomporting with divisions (a) through (e)” to an applicant for homeowner insurance\n“provid[ing] coverage on a replacement cost basis,” or any renewal thereof, “constitutes\nmaking a statement with respect to the business of insurance which is misleading and\nwhich by the exercise of reasonable care should be known to be misleading, pursuant to\nInsurance Code section 790.03.”\n       Representatives from the plaintiffs, the Association of California Insurance\nCompanies and the Personal Insurance Federation of California (Associations), submitted\ncomments and testified in the May 17, 2010 “homeowners insurance hearing,” which\npreceded promulgation of the Regulation. During that hearing, they stated that the\nCommissioner lacked authority to define new unfair business practices. They questioned\nwhether the administrative record supported the Commissioner’s assertion that there was\n\n                                              7\n\fa high volume of homeowner complaints “specifically about the fact that that they were\nnot provided certain information that they needed to make an informed decision about\nwhat insurance coverage limitation they have,” or that the “underinsured problem” was\ncaused by lack of knowledge. Among other comments, they decried the expense of\ncompliance with the Regulation and predicted that the Regulation would discourage\ncarriers from providing insurance.\nThe declaratory relief proceedings\n        On June 8, 2011, the Associations filed a declaratory relief action. There, they\nsought a declaration that the Regulation was invalid because the Commissioner lacked\nauthority to “regulate the underwriting of homeowner insurance”; section 790.03 did not\nauthorize “the imposition of a single, detailed method for estimating the replacement cost\nof houses”; and the Regulation violated insurance companies’ free speech rights under\nthe First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n        After the Associations’ motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied, the\nparties agreed that the case could be tried based on the rulemaking file, written briefs, and\noral argument without oral testimony. Trial and oral argument were held on February 4,\n2013.\n        The Associations’ arguments\n        In their trial brief, the Associations argued that in response to comments at the\nadministrative hearing about the Commissioner’s lack of authority to promulgate the\nRegulation, the Commissioner cited section 790.10 of the UIPA and section 1749.85, but\nthat neither provided any such authority. In essence, they argued that the\nCommissioner’s reliance on section 790.10 ignored the language and structure of the\nUIPA, which at trial they characterized as “unique,” particularly its use of the terms\n“defined” and “determined.” Section 1749.85 merely authorized promulgating standards\nfor calculating replacement cost estimates prepared by appraisers.\n        Section 790.10 provides: “The commissioner shall, from time to time as\nconditions warrant, after notice and public hearing, promulgate reasonable rules and\n\n                                              8\n\fregulations, and amendments and additions thereto, as are necessary to administer this\narticle.” The Associations conceded that section 790.10 gave authority to the\nCommissioner to “administer” the UIPA, but argued that it did not give him authority to\ndefine unfair business practices.\n       More specifically, section 790 of the UIPA provides: “The purpose of this article\nis to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of\nCongress as expressed in the Act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, Seventy-\nninth Congress), by defining, or providing for the determination of, all such practices in\nthis State which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined.” (Italics\nadded.)\n       The Associations argued that the Legislature defined “unfair and deceptive acts or\npractices in the business of insurance” in section 790.03,5 which states that “[t]he\n\n\n\n       5  The full text of section 790.03 is as follows: “The following are hereby defined\nas unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the\nbusiness of insurance.\n        “(a) Making, issuing, circulating, or causing to be made, issued or circulated, any\nestimate, illustration, circular, or statement misrepresenting the terms of any policy issued\nor to be issued or the benefits or advantages promised thereby or the dividends or share of\nthe surplus to be received thereon, or making any false or misleading statement as to the\ndividends or share of surplus previously paid on similar policies, or making any\nmisleading representation or any misrepresentation as to the financial condition of any\ninsurer, or as to the legal reserve system upon which any life insurer operates, or using\nany name or title of any policy or class of policies misrepresenting the true nature thereof,\nor making any misrepresentation to any policyholder insured in any company for the\npurpose of inducing or tending to induce the policyholder to lapse, forfeit, or surrender\nhis or her insurance.\n        “(b) Making or disseminating or causing to be made or disseminated before the\npublic in this state, in any newspaper or other publication, or any advertising device, or\nby public outcry or proclamation, or in any other manner or means whatsoever, any\nstatement containing any assertion, representation, or statement with respect to the\nbusiness of insurance or with respect to any person in the conduct of his or her insurance\nbusiness, which is untrue, deceptive, or misleading, and which is known, or which by the\nexercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue, deceptive, or misleading.\n                                                9\n\f        “(c) Entering into any agreement to commit, or by any concerted action\ncommitting, any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation resulting in or tending to result\nin unreasonable restraint of, or monopoly in, the business of insurance.\n        “(d) Filing with any supervisory or other public official, or making, publishing,\ndisseminating,

The\norder shall specify the reason why the method of competition is alleged to be unfair or the\nact or practice is alleged to be unfair or deceptive.\n        “The hearings provided by this section shall be conducted in accordance with the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of\nDivision 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), except that the hearings may be\nconducted by an administrative law judge in the administrative law bureau when the\nproceedings involve a common question of law or fact with another proceeding arising\nunder other Insurance Code sections that may be conducted by administrative law bureau\nadministrative law judges. The commissioner and the appointed administrative law judge\nshall have all the powers granted under the Administrative Procedure Act. If the alleged\nmethods, acts, or practices or any of them are found to be unfair or deceptive within the\n                                                13\n\f       The Associations argued that the Regulation rendered replacement cost estimates\nnot in compliance with the Regulation’s content and format requirements “unfair and\ndeceptive” notwithstanding that such conduct is not so “defined” in section 790.03 and\nthat the Commissioner was required to, but did not follow the administrative and court\nprocedures set forth in the UIPA in section 790.06 for “determining” whether that\nconduct should be declared “unfair and deceptive.”7\n\n\n\n\nmeaning of this article the commissioner shall issue and service upon that person his or\nher written report so declaring.\n        “(b) If the report charges a violation of this article and if the method of\ncompetition, act or practice has not been discontinued, the commissioner may, through\nthe Attorney General of this state, at any time after 30 days after the service of the report\ncause a petition to be filed in the superior court of this state within the county wherein the\nperson resides or has his or her principal place of business, to enjoin and restrain the\nperson from engaging in the method, act or practice. The court shall have jurisdiction of\nthe proceeding and shall have power to make and enter appropriate orders in connection\ntherewith and to issue any writs as are ancillary to its jurisdiction or are necessary in its\njudgment to prevent injury to the public pendente lite.\n        “(c) A transcript of the proceedings before the commissioner, including all\nevidence taken and the report and findings shall be filed with the petition. If either party\nshall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show, to the\nsatisfaction of the court, that the additional evidence is material and there were\nreasonable grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence in the proceeding before the\ncommissioner, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the\ncommissioner and to be adduced upon the hearing in the manner and upon the terms and\nconditions as to the court may seem proper. The commissioner may modify his or her\nfindings of fact or make new findings by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and\nshall file modified or new findings with the return of the additional evidence.\n        “(d) If the court finds that the method of competition complained of is unfair or\nthat the act or practice complained of is unfair or deceptive, that the proceeding by the\ncommissioner with respect thereto is to the interest of the public and that the findings of\nthe commissioner are supported by the weight of the evidence, it shall issue its order\nenjoining and restraining the continuance of the method of competition, act or practice.”\n       7 It was undisputed in the proceedings below that the Commissioner did not\nfollow the procedures in section 790.06, which in addition to administrative processes,\nrequire a court order to enjoin conduct found to be unfair and deceptive.\n                                             14\n\f       Furthermore, the Regulation renders as unfair and deceptive estimates that are\naccurate, but not in the format dictated by the Regulation. At the same time, the\nRegulation does not sanction an inaccurate estimate that complies with the format and\ncontent requirements of the Regulation. The Associations cited as an admission the\nCommissioner’s statement during an administrative hearing that “‘[t]he regulations do\nnot require of replacement value estimates any particular degree of accuracy.’”\n       The Associations also argued that that the Regulation “Unlawfully Restrict[ed]\nUnderwriting” because despite the exemption for “internal communications within an\ninsurer” in subdivision (l) of the Regulation, in practice, “communications about insurer’s\nunderwriting decisions do come to the attention of applicants and insureds, and\nparticularly so with respect to adverse underwriting decisions.” Because “[t]he amount\nof homeowners’ insurance is an essential part of the underwriting decision,” the\nRegulation “unlawfully restricted homeowner insurers[’] underwriting” and was therefore\ninvalid.\n       Finally, the Associations argued that the Regulation was subject to the higher level\nof scrutiny imposed by Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm’n (1980) 447\nU.S. 557 [100 S.Ct. 2343] (Central Hudson) on government regulation of commercial\nspeech under the First Amendment, and that the Regulation did not pass constitutional\nmuster under the criteria set forth in Central Hudson.\n       The Commissioner’s arguments\n       As discussed post, the Commissioner disavowed reliance on section 1749.85 as a\nsource of authority to promulgate the Regulation except as to that portion of the\nRegulation regarding training of broker-agents. Instead, his authority to promulgate the\nRegulation was grounded in section 790.10, and the UIPA must be construed broadly “to\npromote public welfare.” The Commissioner cited Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian\n(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805 (Calfarm) and Credit Ins. Gen. Agents Assn. v. Payne (1976) 16\nCal.3d 651 (Payne) to support this proposition. Citing Batt v. City and County of San\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fFrancisco (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 163, the Commissioner argued that his powers include\nelaborating on the meaning of key legislative terms.\n       Indeed, that “the promulgation of a regulation that defines a specific type of\nmisleading statement is within the agency’s rulemaking authority under a broad statutory\nprohibition against false and misleading statements” was recognized with respect to\nlicensed automobile dealers in Ford Dealers Assn. v. Department of Motor Vehicles\n(1982) 32 Cal.3d 347 (Ford Dealers). Similarly, the Commissioner has authority to\npromulgate a regulation prohibiting a specific type of misleading statement from being\ncommunicated to purchasers of homeowners insurance. Therefore, it was a non sequitur\nfor the Associations to argue that, just because estimates of replacement costs were not\nspecifically identified in section 790.03, the Commissioner exceeded his authority in\nregulating them.\n       The Commissioner also argued that 790.06 was not a mechanism for adding new\ncategories of unfair and deceptive insurance business practices. Instead, it is an\nenforcement tool to “enjoin a particular practice engaged by an individual insurer through\nprocedures similar to an administrative disciplinary action.”\n       The Commissioner also faulted the Associations for taking the Commissioner’s\nstatement regarding “accuracy” out of context because the statement was followed by a\nstatement at the hearing that “all the regulations do [is] require that any estimate of\nreplace[ment] cost be complete and must not ignore outright any of the basic cost\ncomponents universally acknowledged to figure into replacement cost.” The\nCommissioner further argued that accuracy was not required because “the Commissioner\ndoes not expect insurers to guarantee replacement cost.”\n       The Regulation also does not regulate underwriting because it does not specify or\notherwise dictate what risks insurance companies should underwrite and does not prevent\nan insurer from setting minimum or maximum amounts of coverage or any amount of\ncoverage that is different from the estimate of replacement cost; in fact, subdivision (p) of\nthe Regulation expressly so provides. Furthermore, the Regulation does not dictate how\n\n                                             16\n\fthe estimate is to be calculated; instead it requires that it be complete, based on current\ndata, and communicated to the consumer.\n       In response to the Associations’ free speech challenge to the Regulation, the\nCommissioner argued that restrictions on misleading commercial speech are evaluated\nunder the “reasonably related” test in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel (1985)\n471 U.S. 626 [105 S.Ct. 2265] (Zauderer) and not the intermediate scrutiny criteria set\nforth in Central Hudson, supra, 447 U.S. 557. Under either standard, however, he argued\nthat the Regulation did not violate the Associations’ free speech rights.\n       In their reply, the Associations largely repeated arguments from their opening\nbrief. They also gave illustrations of how the Regulation expanded the definition of\nunfair and deceptive practices in section 790.03, subdivision (b). They hypothesized an\nestimate from a reputable contractor in a single figure to replace a home, including every\ndetail down to the bathroom floor finishing, that was true, but that would be rendered\n“misleading” under the Regulation because it failed to itemize its components. The same\nwould be true for an oral estimate because the Regulation requires the estimate to be in\nwriting. In the Associations’ own words, “Mandatory, specified communication is a far\ncry from prohibiting misleading statements.”\n       The trial court’s statement of decision\n       The trial court agreed with the Associations’ contention that the Commissioner did\nnot have authority to promulgate the Regulation. The court reasoned that estimates of\nreplacement costs, although “inherently inaccurate,” are not misleading. By\ncharacterizing all estimates of replacements costs as misleading except ones that\ncomplied with the content and format requirements in the Regulation, the Commissioner\n“expands the meaning of something ‘known’ or which ‘should be known’ to be\nmisleading beyond the parameters of §790.03(b).” The court concluded that section\n790.03, subdivision (b) did not give the Commissioner authority “to penalize acts not\nknown or cannot be determined through reasonable care to be misleading.”\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       The trial court also dismissed the Commissioner’s legal authorities. Thus, the\ncourt concluded that Calfarm, supra, 48 Cal.3d 805, involved dicta regarding a void\nstatutory scheme that required the “agency to fill in the blanks,” and Payne, supra,\n16 Cal.3d 651, expressly “caution[ed]” against issuing regulations that conflicted with the\nenabling statute. Because the Regulation renders conduct not described in section\n790.03, subdivision (b) as misleading, the Commissioner was required to follow the\nprocedures in section 790.06, which he had failed to do. Because the trial court found\nthat the Regulation was unauthorized, it did not address the Associations’ other\narguments.\n       The judgment declaring the Regulation invalid was entered on May 7, 2013. On\nMay 9, 2013, the Commissioner filed a notice of appeal.\n                                        DISCUSSION\nStandard of review and the parties’ additional arguments on appeal\n       The parties do not contest that neither the trial court nor we are required to give\ndeference to an administrative agency’s interpretation of the scope of its own authority.8\n(Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Board of Equalization (2013) 57 Cal.4th 401, 415\n[“when an implementing regulation is challenged on the ground that it is ‘in conflict with\nthe statute’ [citation] or does not ‘lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the\nLegislature’ [citation], the issue of statutory construction is a question of law on which a\ncourt exercises independent judgment”]; 20th Century Ins. Co. v. Garamendi (1994)\n8 Cal.4th 216, 271 [“That is to say, whether Proposition 103 authorizes the Insurance\nCommissioner to adopt rate regulations to implement the initiative is indeed examined\nindependently.”]; Batt v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at\np. 170 [“Such an inquiry obviously requires examination of the statute and the\nregulation(s), and that examination would be de novo because it entails what we have\ncalled, ‘the quintessential judicial function.’”].)\n\n\n       8 Attrial, the Associations disclaimed any attack on the Regulation on the basis of\nlack of necessity.\n                                               18\n\f       On appeal, the parties generally make the same arguments that they made before\nthe trial court. We will not repeat those here. We summarize only the new matters.\n       Both the Commissioner and the amici curiae9 contend that the trial court\n“conflated” the terms “accurate” and “misleading” because the focus of the Regulation is\ncompleteness and not exactness. The Regulation addresses the problem that arises when\na replacement cost estimate does not include all reasonable components necessary to\nrebuild a home. If a consumer relies on such an estimate in selecting a policy limit, the\nconsumer risks being underinsured. The fact that estimates are not always accurate does\nnot negate the need for an insurer to communicate a complete estimate. Accordingly, the\nCommissioner argues that, just because an estimate is not always accurate, does not mean\nit cannot be misleading. In support of this position, he cites Ford Dealers, supra, 32\nCal.3d 347.\n       The Commissioner faulted the trial judge for making section 790.06 a substitute\nfor rulemaking processes. Instead, section 790.06 is an enforcement tool against an\nindividual insurer and not an across-the-board regulation of the insurance industry. The\ntrial judge also ignored section 790.05.10 Irrespective of the existence of the Regulation,\n\n\n\n\n       9 The\n           United Policyholders, Scripps Ranch Civic Association, and Rancho\nBernardo Community Council filed an amici brief in support of the Commissioner.\n       10 Section 790.05 provides: “Whenever the commissioner shall have reason to\nbelieve that a person has been engaged or is engaging in this state in any unfair method of\ncompetition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice defined in Section 790.03, and that\na proceeding by the commissioner in respect thereto would be to the interest of the\npublic, he or she shall issue and serve upon that person an order to show cause containing\na statement of the charges in that respect, a statement of that person’s potential liability\nunder Section 790.035, and a notice of a hearing thereon to be held at a time and place\nfixed therein, which shall not be less than 30 days after the service thereof, for the\npurpose of determining whether the commissioner should issue an order to that person to,\npay the penalty imposed by Section 790.035, and to cease and desist those methods, acts,\nor practices or any of them.\n       “If the charges or any of them are found to be justified the commissioner shall\nissue and cause to be served upon that person an order requiring that person to pay the\n                                              19\n\fsection 790.05 sets forth the procedures before an administrative law judge for bringing a\nnoncompliance proceeding against a licensee alleged to have engaged in an unfair and\ndeceptive practice prohibited by section 790.03, including “misleading” statements under\nsection 790.03, subdivision (b).\n       The Associations supported the trial court’s reasoning. They reiterated that the\nUIPA is unique, and for that reason Calfarm, Payne, and Ford Dealers are not instructive\nbecause they involved either a different kind of insurance, administrative proceeding, or\nstatute.\n       In addition, the Associations argued the legislative history of section 790.10, when\nit was added in 1971 to the UIPA, indicates that the Legislature did not intend that\nsection 790.10 be a vehicle for the Commissioner to regulate insurance practices under\ncover of disseminating misleading statements under section 790.03, subdivision (b). As\noriginally drafted, section 790.10 would have used the word “implement,” a broader\ngrant of power according to the Associations; instead, the Legislature used the narrower\nterm “administer,” as the statute currently reads. (Stats. 1971, ch. 975, § 1, p. 1887.)11\nThe Associations contend that this was confirmed when the Legislature amended section\n\n\npenalty imposed by Section 790.035 and to cease and desist from engaging in those\nmethods, acts, or practices found to be unfair or deceptive.\n       “The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure\nAct, Chapter 5 (commencing at Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the\nGovernment Code, except that the hearings may be conducted by an administrative law\njudge in the administrative law bureau when the proceedings involve a common question\nof law or fact with another proceeding arising under other Insurance Code sections that\nmay be conducted by administrative law bureau administrative law judges. The\ncommissioner and the appointed administrative law judge shall have all the powers\ngranted under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n       “The person shall be entitled to have the proceedings and the order reviewed by\nmeans of any remedy provided by Section 12940 of this code or by the Administrative\nProcedure Act.”\n       11 A copy of Assembly Bill No. 1353 (1971 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 9, 1971,\nis attached as exhibit B to the Associations’ request for judicial notice filed on April 7,\n2014, which request we granted on February 20, 2015.\n                                             20\n\f790.06 in 2000 to “address[] the authority of the Insurance Commissioner when the\nCommissioner has reason to believe an unfair or deceptive practice has occurred that is\nnot one specifically defined in Insurance Code Section 790.03” by requiring any order to\nshow cause issued under section 790.06 to “contain a statement of the acts or practices\nalleged to be unfair or deceptive.” (Stats. 2000, ch. 280, § 1, p. 2475.)12\nRead as a whole, the UIPA did not give the Commissioner authority to promulgate\nthe Regulation\n       The Commissioner has only the authority conferred on him by the Legislature.\n(Payne, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 656 [“The commissioner, of course, has no power to vary\nor enlarge the terms of an enabling statute [citation], or to issue regulations which\nconflict with this or any other statute.”].) We deduce that authority from the language of\nthe statute itself by applying familiar maxims of statutory construction.\n       In doing so, we give the language its plain meaning. (Day v. City of Fontana\n(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272.) We credit all language in a statute lest we render portions of\nthe statute surplusage. “Moreover, it is equally well settled that fundamental rules of\nstatutory construction require ascertainment of the legislative intent ‘so as to effectuate\nthe purpose of the law [and] “every statute should be construed with reference to the\nwhole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.”\n[Citation.] If possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and\npart of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose. [Citation.]’” (Kaiser Steel Corp. v.\nCounty of Solano (1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 662, 667.) To the extent a statute addresses one\nsubject but not another, we assume that choice was deliberate under the principle of\n“[e]xpressio unius est exclusio alterius. The expression of some things in a statute\nnecessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed.” (Gikas v. Zolin (1993)\n6 Cal.4th 841, 852.)\n\n       12A copy of the Analysis of Senate Bill No. 1500 (1999–2000 Reg. Sess.) by the\nSenate Committee on Insurance, as amended March 28, 2000, is attached as exhibit C to\nthe Associations’ request for judicial notice filed on April 7, 2014, which request we\ngranted on February 20, 2015.\n                                             21\n\fThe Commissioner’s reliance on section 790.10 does not sufficiently credit other\nportions of the UIPA and is not consistent with the structure of the UIPA\n       The Commissioner is correct that the purpose of the UIPA is to regulate insurance\npractices “in the public interest.” That is what section 790 does when it refers to “the Act\nof Congress of March 9, 1945.” That act (15 U.S.C. § 1011) states in pertinent part that\n“the continued regulation . . . by the several States of the business of insurance is in the\npublic interest.” To the extent the Commissioner cites Calfarm, supra, 48 Cal.3d 805, for\nthe proposition that it may promulgate Regulations that serve the public interest, Calfarm\ndoes not illuminate what is already in the UIPA.13\n       The language of the UIPA reveals the Legislature’s intent to set forth in the statute\nwhat unfair or deceptive trade practices are prohibited, and not delegate that function to\nthe Commissioner. Thus, section 790.02 states, “No person shall engage in this State in\nany trade practice which is defined in this article as, or determined pursuant to this\narticle to be, an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in\nthe business of insurance.” (Italics added.)\n       In section 790.03, the Legislature has defined “as unfair methods of competition\nand unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance” numerous acts or\npractices, including, among other acts or practices, making false statements “as to the\ndividends or share of surplus previously paid on similar policies” (subd. (a)); entering\ninto a boycott (subd. (c)); making “any false statement of financial condition of an insurer\nwith intent to deceive” (subd. (d)); “willfully omitting to make a true entry of any\nmaterial fact pertaining to the business of the insurer in any book . . . of the insurer”\n(subd. (e)); unfairly discriminating “between individuals of the same class and equal\nexpectation of life” in life insurance rates (subd. (f)(1)); representing that one is a\nmember of the California Insurance Guarantee Association or insured against insolvency\n\n\n       13 Calfarm is otherwise not on point. There, the Supreme Court invalidated two\nprovisions of Proposition 103 regarding insurance rates (§ 1861.01 et seq.) as\nunconstitutional. (48 Cal.3d at pp. 815–816.)\n                                               22\n\f(subd. (g)); and “[k]nowingly” committing one or more of sixteen “unfair claims\nsettlement practices” set forth in subdivision (h). These are in addition to section 790.03,\nsubdivision (b), at issue here, as to disseminating a “statement . . . which is untrue,\ndeceptive, or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable\ncare should be known, to be untrue, deceptive, or misleading.”\n       In addition, section 790.036, subdivision (a) provides that advertising insurance\nthat the insurer does not sell is also “an unfair and deceptive act or practice.” There is no\nsimilar provision in the UIPA regarding the content and format of replacement costs\nestimates. This demonstrates that the Legislature was deliberate in choosing what\nconduct to brand in sections 790.03 and 790.036 as “unfair and deceptive.” Applying the\nlegislative maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, we can infer that the absence\nof a provision regarding replacement cost estimates was a deliberate choice. Thus, the\nCommissioner did not have authority to add content and format requirements for\nreplacement cost estimates in homeowner insurance to the list of practices set forth in\nsection 790.03 under the guise of deeming nonconforming estimates misleading under\nsection 790.03, subdivision (b).\n       Our conclusion is bolstered by those provisions in the UIPA actually\ndenominating the Commissioner’s powers. These focus on the Commissioner’s power\n(1) to enforce existing prohibitions in the UIPA (§§ 790.035, 790.04, 790.05, 790.07,14\n790.08); (2) to bring enforcement proceedings against a person the Commissioner has\n“reason to believe” is engaging “in any method of competition or in any act or practice\n. . . not defined in Section 790.03 . . . that . . . is unfair or deceptive” (§ 790.06); and\n(3) to “promulgate reasonable rules and regulations” to administer the act (§ 790.10).\nRead together, these provisions demonstrate that the Legislature did not give the\nCommissioner power to define by regulation acts or conduct not otherwise deemed unfair\nor deceptive in the statute.\n\n\n       14 Section790.07 regards violations of a cease and desist order issued pursuant to\nsection 790.05 or a court order issued pursuant to section 790.06.\n                                               23\n\f       Thus, section 790.04 gives the Commissioner “power to examine and investigate\ninto the affairs of every person engaged in the business of insurance . . . in order to\ndetermine whether such person has been or is engaged in any unfair method of\ncompetition or in any unfair or deceptive act or practice prohibited by Section 790.03 or\ndetermined pursuant to this article to be an unfair method of competition or an unfair or\ndeceptive practice in the business of insurance.” (Italics added.)\n       Section 790.05 sets forth an enforcement process when the Commissioner has\n“reason to believe that a person has been engaged . . . in any unfair method of\ncompetition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice defined in Section 790.03, and that\na proceeding by the commissioner in respect thereto would be to the interest of the\npublic.” That process includes an order to show cause hearing after the Commissioner\nhas served that person with a statement of the charges and the person’s potential liability\nunder section 790.035. The hearing is conducted under the auspices of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) (Gov. Code, § 11500 et seq.), and any resulting\norder is reviewable by a court as provided by Insurance Code section 12940 or the APA.\nThe Commissioner’s remedies include civil penalties as provided in section 790.035,\nsubdivision (a),15 and a cease and desist order.\n       The Commissioner’s argument that incomplete replacement cost estimates are\nwithin the ambit of “untrue, deceptive, or misleading” statements in section 790.03,\nsubdivision (b) proves too much. If that were the case, there would be no need for the\nRegulation because, as the Commissioner points out, he would already have had the\nmeans in section 790.05 to assess penalties and issue a cease and desist order against a\n\n\n       15 Section 790.035, subdivision (a) provides: “Any person who engages in any\nunfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice defined in Section\n790.03 is liable to the state for a civil penalty to be fixed by the commissioner, not to\nexceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each act, or, if the act or practice was willful, a\ncivil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each act. The\ncommissioner shall have the discretion to establish what constitutes an act. However,\nwhen the issuance, amendment, or servicing of a policy or endorsement is inadvertent, all\nof those acts shall be a single act for the purpose of this section.”\n                                              24\n\flicensee the Commissioner believed had given a lowball or incomplete estimate in selling\nhomeowner insurance.\n       The Commissioner’s reliance on section 790.10 also appears circular. As set forth\nin the preceding discussion, section 790.03 lists specific insurance industry conduct that\nthe Legislature has deemed unfair and deceptive. Replacement cost estimates are not\nincluded in that list. The Commissioner argues that, because he believes replacement\ncost estimates not following the Regulation’s format and content rules are automatically\n“misleading” under section 790.03, subdivision (b), he has authority to regulate such\nestimates under his powers of administration in section 790.10.\n       This interpretation of the UIPA is not only circular, it also renders section 790.06\nsuperfluous. Put differently, under the Commissioner’s interpretation of its authority\nunder the UIPA, he would never have to resort to the procedures in section 790.06\nregarding practices not “defined” in 790.03 because the Commissioner could always\nargue that conduct not meeting standards in a regulation promulgated under the cover of\nthe Commissioner’s power to administer under section 790.10 would be “misleading.”\nThis is precisely what the Commissioner has done here.\n       Section 790.06 provides for more multifaceted procedural processes than required\nby section 790.05 before any conduct identified by the Commissioner not within 790.03\ncan be sanctioned. Thus, in addition to an order to show cause hearing under the APA, if\nthe conduct is found to be “unfair or deceptive,” the Commissioner is required to issue a\nwritten report “so declaring.” If the conduct has not been discontinued, the\nCommissioner may, through the Attorney General, petition the superior court to enjoin\nthe conduct. Unlike a proceeding under section 790.05, the Commissioner cannot enjoin\nthe purportedly unfair or deceptive conduct without a court order.\n       Under the heading of “Powers vested in commissioner,” section 790.08 provides\nin pertinent part that “[t]he powers vested in the commissioner in this article shall be\nadditional to” the penalties and other remedies “authorized by law with respect to the\nmethods, acts and practices hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive.” (Italics added.)\n\n                                             25\n\fThus, section 790.08 emphasizes that the enforcement role of the Commissioner is\ntethered to acts and practices “hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive,” to wit, defined\nor determined in the UIPA.\n       The Commissioner places great reliance on Ford Dealers, supra, 32 Cal.3d 347, in\narguing that omitting information can be misleading and the Commissioner has\n“discretion” to fill in the “details” as to what is misleading under section 790.03 even if\nthe particular insurance act or practice is not listed in section 790.03. In Ford Dealers,\nthe Supreme Court held that the director of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)\nhad the authority to promulgate a regulation requiring, among other things, licensed\nautomobile dealers to disclose certain added-on delivery and preparation charges where\nthe enabling statute, Vehicle Code section 11713, subdivision (a), made unlawful the\ndissemination of “any statement which is untrue or misleading and which is known, or\nwhich by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or misleading.”\n       Like 790.03, subdivision (b), at issue before us, Vehicle Code section 11713,\nsubdivision (a) is followed by subdivisions identifying other prohibited practices. These\ninclude advertising using fonts and a format other than those specified in the statute\n(subd. (b)); failing to withdraw an advertisement for a vehicle within 48 hours after the\nvehicle has been sold (subd. (c)); not having the required bond (subd. (e)) and\n“established place of business” (subd. (f)); including licensing or transfer of title fees\nwhich are not due to the state (subd. (g)); and employing an unlicensed salesperson (subd.\n(h)). Vehicle Code section 11713, subdivision (a) also makes unlawful the dissemination\nof a misleading statement as “part of a plan . . . with the intent not to sell any vehicle or\nservice so advertised at the price stated therein, or as so advertised.”16\n       In upholding the regulation, the Supreme Court reasoned that an “administrative\nagency is not limited to the exact provisions of a statute in adopting regulations to\n\n\n       16 In addition, division 5, chapter 4, article 1 of the Vehicle Code, of which section\n11713 is a part, contains a myriad of other statutory obligations pertaining to automobile\nsales and dealers. (Veh. Code, §§ 11700–11740.)\n                                              26\n\fenforce its mandate,” and the absence of any specific statutory provision regarding the\nsubject of the regulation did not mean that the agency did not have authority to\npromulgate it. (Ford Dealers, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 362.) Notably absent from the\nstatutory regime at issue in Ford Dealers were provisions distinguishing between\nprocedures to be employed regarding acts or practices defined by the statute to be unfair\nand deceptive, and those acts or practices not so defined in the statute, but nonetheless\nbelieved by the administrative agency to be similarly unfair and deceptive.17 We do not\ndoubt that the Legislature could have delegated to the Commissioner the kind of broad\nauthority conferred on the DMV in Ford Dealers; it did not do so in the UIPA.\n       Payne, supra, 16 Cal.3d 651, offers no more support for the Commissioner’s\nposition. There, the Supreme Court upheld the Commissioner’s authority to limit the\namount of compensation paid to agents in the sale of credit life and credit disability\ninsurance. In Payne, the Supreme Court primarily addressed the necessity of the\nregulation—finding that the administrative record supported the Commissioner. As\nnoted ante, the Associations have not attacked the Regulation on necessity grounds.\n       The Payne court observed that under statutes governing credit insurance, the\nLegislature evidenced its intent to “grant the commissioner broad discretion to determine\nwhat reasonable rules and regulations in the area of credit insurance are necessary to\npromote the public welfare.” (Payne, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 656.) The Commissioner\nhad authority to promulgate the regulation because the credit insurance statutes gave the\nCommissioner power under section 779.21 to adopt regulations “‘as may be necessary to\ncarry out the provisions of [the article relating to credit insurance],’” and under section\n779.9 to disapprove a credit insurance form if it contains provisions that are “‘unjust,\n\n\n       17 The Vehicle Code provisions at issue in Ford Dealers, supra, 32 Cal.3d 347,\nalso contain different enforcement procedures from those in the UIPA. For example,\nVehicle Code section 11726 provides for a civil action for damages, attorney fees, and\ninjunctive relief for any licensee “suffering pecuniary loss because of any willful failure\nby any other licensee to comply with any provision of Article 1 . . . .” There is no\nanalogous provision in the UIPA.\n                                             27\n\funfair, inequitable, misleading, deceptive . . . or are contrary to any provision of the\nInsurance Code or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.’” (Payne, at\np. 656, italics added.)\n       Once again, these statutes governing credit insurance do not contain the same\nlanguage or fit into the same statutory context as section 790.03 does in the UIPA.\nAccordingly, Payne is of limited value to the present analysis—to discern whether in\ngiving the Commissioner power to administer the UIPA in section 790.10, the Legislature\nintended to give the Commissioner power to define content and format rules for\nreplacement cost estimates and render them “misleading” under section 790.03,\nsubdivision (b) just because the estimates did not follow those rules.18\n       The legislative evolution of the UIPA as well as other sections in the\nInsurance Code support the conclusion that the Commissioner was without\nauthority to promulgate the Regulation\n       The UIPA as originally enacted in 1959 (Stats. 1959, ch. 1737, § 1, p. 4187) did\nnot include all the acts and practices currently deemed unfair and deceptive in section\n790.03. It also did not include section 790.10. That section first appeared in the UIPA in\n1971. (Stats. 1971, ch. 975, § 1, p. 1887.) When the Legislature was considering\nAssembly Bill No. 1353, which proposed to add section 790.10, the Assembly\nCommittee on Finance and Insurance’s summary included the following statement:\n“This bill gives the Insurance Commissioner the authority to promulgate rules and\nregulations so that if the need therefor arises, he can, without delay, promulgate necessary\nrules making such practices definite and specific for the benefit of the public without\n\n\n       18 We  note that Justice Mosk dissented in Payne, arguing that there was “no direct\nlegislative authority justifying an enforceable order” other than “two very general\nauthorizations of power.” (Payne, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 659 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)\nIndeed, Justice Mosk asserted that the majority opinion was contrary to the Supreme\nCourt’s “converse conclusion” in Pac. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Public Utilities Com. (1950)\n34 Cal.2d 822 under an even more broadly worded enabling statute applied to a Public\nUtilities Commission regulation regarding payments for services provided by a telephone\ncompany’s parent company that could be passed on to consumers. (Payne, at p. 660.)\n                                             28\n\fhaving to wait for the Legislature to act at a later date.” (Assem. Com. on Finance and\nInsurance, summary of Assem. Bill No. 1353 (1971 Reg. Sess.) p. 1.)19\n       On initial review, this statement of legislative purpose would support the\nCommissioner’s interpretation of his authority to promulgate the Regulation defining\nnoncomplying replacement cost estimates as “misleading” statements under section\n790.03. However, the Legislature’s subsequent additions to section 790.03 are not\nconsistent with this view.\n       We observe that section 790.03, subdivision (h), regarding unfair claims\nsettlement practices, was added to the UIPA in 1972. (Stats. 1972, ch. 725, § 1, p. 1314.)\nSection 790.03, subdivision (h) covers categories of claims settlement practices that\ncould have been regulated under the Commissioner’s interpretation of his authority under\nsections 790.03 and 790.10 without amending the statute. Consider section 790.03,\nsubdivision (h)(1), regarding “[m]isrepresenting to claimants pertinent facts or insurance\npolicy provisions relating to any coverages at issue,” as one such example.\n       Similarly, in 1975, the Legislature added definitions (14) and (15) to\nsubdivision (h) of section 790.03, respectively regarding “advising a claimant not to\nobtain the services of an attorney” and “[m]isleading a claimant as to the applicable\nstatute of limitations.” (Stats. 1975, ch. 790, § 1, p. 1812.) Under the Commissioner’s\nview of his authority, the Commissioner could have defined these practices in a\nregulation and then denominated them as misleading under section 790.03, subdivision\n(b) without waiting for enabling legislation.\n       Indeed, in response to complaints about underinsurance regarding the same\nwildfires that ultimately led to promulgation of the Regulation, the Legislature in 2005\namended section 2051.5 (Stats. 2005, ch. 447, § 3, p. 3608) and added section 1749.85\n\n\n\n\n       19 On our motion, we take judicial notice of this summary and the other legislative\nreports and analyses discussed in this opinion.\n                                                29\n\f(Stats. 2005, ch. 447, § 2, p. 3608).20 As noted earlier, section 2051.5, subdivision (a)\ndefines replacement cost. The 2005 amendments to subdivision (b)(2) of section 2051.5\nexpanded alternative living expense payments in the event of a state of emergency.\nSection 1749.85, subdivision (a) tasked the curriculum committee to make\nrecommendations on training broker-agents on “proper methods of estimating the\nreplacement value of structures, and of explaining the various levels of coverage under a\nhomeowners’ insurance policy.”\n       We observe that section 1749.85, subdivision (c) states that nothing in “[t]his\nsection” shall be construed to prevent “licensed appraisers, contractors and architects\nfrom estimating replacement value of a structure,” but that if they do, subdivision (d)\nauthorizes the Department of Insurance to adopt a regulation “establish[ing] standards for\nthe calculation” of such estimates. Not even the Commissioner argues that section\n1749.85, subdivision (d) authorized the Commissioner to promulgate the Regulation, but\nat trial the Commissioner asserted that the latter statute supported subdivision (k) of the\nRegulation regarding, among other things, training of broker-agents. Although neither\nsection 2051.5 nor 1749.85 is part of the UIPA, the Legislature could have acted at the\ntime of these 2005 amendments to legislate the form and content of replacement cost\nestimates, given consumer complaints about underinsurance, of which the Legislature\nwas well aware, but it did not do so.\n       Similarly, section 10101, which was added to the Insurance Code in 1992, requires\nresidential property insurers to provide written disclosures in the format specified in\nsection 10102. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1089, § 1, p. 5031.) Section 10102, subdivision (a),\nwhich was added to the Insurance Code in 2010—the same year in which the Regulation\nwas promulgated—sets forth the content of the required disclosure, including informing\n\n\n       20 The author of the legislation commented on the many complaints about “the\nunderinsurance problem” and that “[b]etter and continued training of personnel in how to\nestimate the replacement cost of a home is therefore critical.” (Sen. Banking, Finance\nand Insurance Committee, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 2 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended\nMar. 29, 2005, p. 7.)\n                                             30\n\fthe consumer that the coverage “‘should be high enough so you can rebuild your home,’”\nitemizing the kind of rebuilding costs a consumer should anticipate, and warning the\nconsumer to obtain insurance in a sufficient amount to cover those costs. (Stats. 2010,\nch. 589, § 2, No. 9 West’s Cal. Legis. Service, p. 3024.) Section 10103, subdivision\n(a)(2) further provides that no residential property insurance “may be issued or renewed”\nunless it recites “‘[t]he limit of liability for this structure (Coverage A) is based on an\nestimate of the cost to rebuild your home, including an approximate cost for labor and\nmaterials in your area, and specific information that you have provided about your\nhome.’” (Stats. 2006, ch. 137, § 2, p. 1779.)\n       The Legislature could have gone on to define the content and format of\nreplacement cost estimates. It could have added incomplete replacement cost estimates\nto the list of unfair and deceptive practices in the UIPA. We infer that these omissions\nwere deliberate, and that under the guise of “filling in the details,” the Commissioner\ntherefore could not do what the Legislature has chosen not to do.\n       By our opinion today, we are not suggesting that the Legislature could not regulate\nthe form and content of replacement cost estimates if it chooses to do so. We are also not\nsuggesting that the Commissioner could not use the administrative and court processes in\nsection 790.06 to seek a determination that replacement cost estimates not including\ncertain information are unfair and deceptive. Nor are we limiting the Commissioner’s\nauthority under section 790.05 to bring an enforcement action against a licensee who has\nlowballed or otherwise given an incomplete replacement cost estimate. Our ruling today\nis limited to one conclusion—that the UIPA has not as of yet given the Commissioner\nauthority to regulate the content and format of replacement cost estimates. Because we\nconclude that the Commissioner did not have the authority to promulgate the Regulation,\nwe do not reach the Associations’ other arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION.\n\n\n                                                BENDIX, J.*\nWe concur:\n\n\n      CHANEY, Acting P.

We agree and affirm.\n                   PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe Regulation\n       The Regulation at issue here involves homeowner insurance, and specifically\nreplacement coverage in the event of a covered event like a fire.2 In general, there are\n\n\n\n\n       1   Undesignated statutory references are to the Insurance Code.\n       2  The Regulation provides: “No licensee shall communicate an estimate of\nreplacement cost to an applicant or insured in connection with an application for or\nrenewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that provides coverage on a replacement cost\nbasis, unless the requirements and standards set forth in subdivisions (a) through (e)\nbelow are met:\n        “(a) The estimate of replacement cost shall include the expenses that would\nreasonably be incurred to rebuild the insured structure(s) in its entirety, including at least\nthe following:\n        “(1) Cost of labor, building materials and supplies;\n        “(2) Overhead and profit;\n        “(3) Cost of demolition and debris removal;\n        “(4) Cost of permits and architect’s plans; and\n        “(5) Consideration of components and features of the insured structure, including\nat least the following:\n        “(A) Type of foundation;\n        “(B) Type of frame;\n        “(C) Roofing materials and type of roof;\n        “(D) Siding materials and type of siding;\n        “(E) Whether the structure is located on a slope;\n        “(F) The square footage of the living space;\n        “(G) Geographic location of property;\n        “(H) Number of stories and any nonstandard wall heights;\n                                               2\n\f        “(I) Materials used in, and generic types of, interior features and finishes, such as,\nwhere applicable, the type of heating and air conditioning system, walls, flooring, ceiling,\nfireplaces, kitchen, and bath(s);\n        “(J) Age of the structure or the year it was built; and\n        “(K) Size and type of attached garage.\n        “(b) The estimate of replacement cost shall be based on an estimate of the cost to\nrebuild or replace the structure taking into account the cost to reconstruct the single\nproperty being evaluated, as compared to the cost to build multiple, or tract, dwellings.\n        “(c) The estimate of replacement cost shall not be based upon the resale value of\nthe land, or upon the amount or outstanding balance of any loan.\n        “(d) The estimate of replacement cost shall not include a deduction for physical\ndepreciation.\n        “(e) The licensee shall no less frequently than annually take reasonable steps to\nverify that the sources and methods used to generate the estimate of replacement cost are\nkept current to reflect changes in the costs of reconstruction and rebuilding, including\nchanges in labor, building materials, and supplies, based upon the geographic location of\nthe insured structure. The estimate of replacement cost shall be created using such\nreasonably current sources and methods.\n        “(f) Except as provided in subdivision (k) of this Section 2695.183, the provisions\nof this article are binding upon licensees, notwithstanding the fact that information, data\nor statistical methods used or relied upon by a licensee to estimate replacement cost may\nbe obtained through a third party source. Any and all information received by the\nDepartment pursuant to this article shall be accorded the degree of confidential treatment\nrequired by section 735.5 of the Insurance Code or Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 3 of\nTitle 2 of the Government Code, commencing at section 11180.\n        “(g)(1) If a licensee communicates an estimate of replacement cost to an applicant\nor insured in connection with an application for or renewal of a homeowners’ insurance\npolicy that provides coverage on a replacement cost basis, the licensee must provide a\ncopy of the estimate of replacement cost to the applicant or insured at the time the\nestimate is communicated. However, in the event the estimate of replacement cost is\ncommunicated by a licensee to an applicant to whom the licensee determines an\ninsurance policy shall not be issued, then the licensee is not required pursuant to the\npreceding sentence to provide a copy of the estimate of replacement cost. In the event\nthe estimate of replacement cost is communicated by telephone to an insured, the copy of\nthe estimate shall be mailed to the insured no later than three business days after the time\nof the telephone conversation. In the event the estimate of replacement cost is\ncommunicated by telephone to an applicant, the copy of the estimate shall be mailed to\nthe applicant no later than three business days after the applicant agrees to purchase the\ncoverage.\n        “(2) An estimate of replacement cost provided in connection with an application\nfor or renewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that provides coverage on a\n                                                3\n\freplacement cost basis must itemize the projected cost for each element specified in\nparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4), and shall identify the assumptions made for each of the\ncomponents and features listed in paragraph (a)(5), of this Section 2695.183.\n        “(h) If an estimate of replacement cost is updated or revised by, or on behalf of,\nthe licensee and the revised estimate of replacement cost is communicated to the\napplicant or insured in connection with an application for or renewal of a homeowners’\ninsurance policy that provides coverage on a replacement cost basis, the licensee shall\nprovide a copy of the revised or updated estimate of replacement cost to the applicant as\nprovided in paragraph (g)(1) of this Section 2695.183, or to the insured simultaneously\nwith the renewal offer, as the case may be. This subdivision (h) shall not apply when the\nupdate or revision to the estimate of replacement cost or the policy limit results solely\nfrom the application of an inflationary provision in a policy or an inflation factor. This\nsubdivision (h) shall not obligate a licensee to recalculate an estimate of replacement cost\non an annual basis.\n        “(i) Licensees shall maintain (1) a record of the information supplied by the\napplicant or insured that is used by the licensee to generate the estimate of replacement\ncost, and (2) a copy of any estimate of replacement cost supplied to the applicant or\ninsured pursuant to paragraph (g)(1), or subdivision (h), of this Section 2695.183. If a\npolicy is issued, these records and copies shall be maintained for the entire term of the\ninsurance policy or the duration of coverage, whichever terminates later in time, and for\nfive years thereafter. However, if the estimate of replacement cost is provided to an\napplicant to whom an insurance policy is never issued, the records and copies referred to\nin the first sentence of this subdivision (i) shall be maintained for the period of time the\nlicensee ordinarily maintains applicant files in the normal course of business, provided\nthat such period of time shall be at least sufficient to ensure that the licensee is able to\ncomply with the provisions of this subdivision in the event the policy is issued to the\napplicant.\n        “(j) To communicate an estimate of replacement value not comporting with\nsubdivisions (a) through (e) of this Section 2695.183 to an applicant or insured in\nconnection with an application for or renewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that\nprovides coverage on a replacement cost basis constitutes making a statement with\nrespect to the business of insurance which is misleading and which by the exercise of\nreasonable care should be known to be misleading, pursuant to Insurance Code section\n790.03.\n        “(k) When an insurer identifies one or more specific sources or tools that a broker-\nagent must use to create an estimate of replacement cost,\n        “(1) the insurer shall prescribe complete written procedures to be followed by\nbroker-agents when they use the sources or tools,\n        “(2) the insurer shall provide the broker-agent with the training and written\ntraining materials necessary to properly utilize the sources or tools according to the\ninsurer’s prescribed procedures, and\n                                                4\n\f        “(3) the insurer, and not the broker-agent, shall be responsible for any\nnoncompliance with this Section 2695.183 that results from the failure of the estimate to\nsatisfy the requirements of subdivisions (a) through (e), unless that noncompliance results\nfrom failure by the broker-agent to follow the insurer’s prescribed written procedures\nwhen using the source or tool.\n        “(l) This Section 2695.183 applies to all communications by a licensee, verbal or\nwritten, with the sole exception of internal communications within an insurer, or\nconfidential communications between an insurer and its contractor, that concern the\ninsurer’s underwriting decisions and that never come to the attention of an applicant or\ninsured.\n        “(m) No provision of this article shall be construed as requiring a licensee to\nestimate replacement cost or to set or recommend a policy limit to an applicant or\ninsured. No provision of this article shall be construed as requiring a licensee to advise\nthe applicant or insured as to the sufficiency of an estimate of replacement cost.\n        “(n) No provision of this article shall limit or preclude a licensee from providing\nand explaining the California Residential Property Insurance Disclosure, as cited in\nInsurance Code section 10102, explaining the various forms of replacement cost coverage\navailable to an applicant or insured, or explaining how replacement cost basis policies\noperate to pay claims.\n        “(o) No provision of this article shall limit or preclude an applicant or insured\nfrom obtaining his or her own estimate of replacement cost from an entity permitted to\nmake such an estimate by Insurance Code section 1749.85.\n        “(p) For purposes of this subdivision (p), ‘minimum amount of insurance’ shall\nmean the lowest amount of insurance that an insurer requires to be purchased in order for\nthe insurer to underwrite the coverage on a particular property, based upon an insurer’s\neligibility guidelines, underwriting practices and/or actuarial analysis. An insurer may\ncommunicate to an applicant or insured that an applicant or insured must purchase a\nminimum amount of insurance that does not comport with subdivisions (a) through (e) of\nthis Section 2695.183; however, if the minimum amount of insurance that is\ncommunicated is based in whole or in part on an estimate of replacement value, the\nestimate of replacement value shall also be provided to the applicant or insured and shall\ncomply with all applicable provisions of this article. Nothing in this article shall limit or\npreclude an insurer from agreeing to provide coverage for a policy limit that is greater\nthan or less than an estimate of replacement cost provided pursuant to this article.\n        “(q) This article shall apply only to estimates of replacement value that are\nprepared, communicated or used by a licensee on or after June 27, 2011.”\n                                             5\n\fthree kinds of replacement cost coverage. Each requires an insurer to pay replacement\ncosts up to a limit defined in the policy or up to a set amount above the policy limit.3 If\nthe cost of repairing or rebuilding a home damaged or destroyed by a covered event\nexceeds that limit, the homeowner has to pay the difference. Section 2051.5, subdivision\n(a) defines replacement cost, in pertinent part, as “the amount that it would cost the\ninsured to repair, rebuild, or replace the thing lost or injured, without a deduction for\nphysical depreciation, or the policy limit, whichever is less.”\n       The Regulation was promulgated in 2010 in response to complaints received from\nhomeowners who lost their residences in the wildfires in Southern California in 2003,\n2007, and 2008. These complaints arose when homeowners learned that they did not\nhave enough insurance to cover the full cost of repairing or rebuilding their homes\nbecause when they bought their homeowner insurance, the estimates of replacement\nvalue were too low.4\n       The introductory sentence of the Regulation prohibits a “licensee” from\n“communicat[ing] an estimate of replacement cost to an applicant or insured in\nconnection with an application for renewal of a homeowners’ insurance policy that\n\n\n       3  According to the Commissioner’s “Initial Statement of Reasons,” dated April 2,\n2010, issued when the Commissioner proposed the Regulation, there is “Limited\nReplacement Cost Coverage With an Additional Percentage which pays replacement\ncosts up to a specified amount above the policy limit; [¶] Limited Replacement Cost\nCoverage With No Additional Percentage which pays replacement costs up to” the dollar\nlimit set forth in the policy; and “Actual Cash Value Coverage which pays the fair market\nvalue of the dwelling at the time of the loss, or the cost to repair, rebuild, or replace the\ndamaged or destroyed dwelling with like kind and quality construction up to the policy\nlimit.”\n       4 The administrative record contains complaints about, among other things, the\nestimator’s using an incorrect description of the property or its square footage, failing to\ninspect the property, not considering building code requirements, not including obvious\ncosts like debris removal, and not adjusting for inflation in arriving at a replacement cost\nestimate. It also included a survey conducted after the 2007 wildfires reciting that\n75 percent of those responding to the survey complained that their insurance limits did\nnot cover the cost of rebuilding their structures.\n                                              6\n\fprovides coverage on a replacement cost basis” that does not satisfy the content and\nformat provisions in the Regulation. Subdivision (a) of the Regulation states, among\nother requirements, that an estimate of replacement cost “shall include expenses that\nwould reasonably be incurred to rebuild the insured structure(s) in its entirety” and\nrequires in subdivision (a)(1)–(4) that the estimate include the cost of labor, building\nmaterials and supplies, overhead, profit, demolition, debris removal, permits, and\narchitect’s plans, and in subdivision (a)(5) that the licensee “consider” 11 designated\n“components and features of the insured structure.”\n       The estimate must itemize “the projected cost” of each expense listed in\nsubdivision (a)(1)–(4), and the assumptions as to the components listed in subdivision\n(a)(5). (Reg., subd. (g)(2).) A copy of the estimate and any update of the estimate\n“must” be given to the applicant. (Reg., subds. (g)(1), (h).) Subdivision (e) requires that\n“reasonable steps” be taken to “verify . . . sources and methods used to generate the\nestimate of replacement cost” “no less frequently than annually.” The Regulation also\nimposes recordkeeping obligations on the licensee. (Reg., subd. (i).)\n       Of particular significance to the issue before us is subdivision (j) of the\nRegulation. It provides that “communicat[ing] an estimate of replacement value not\ncomporting with divisions (a) through (e)” to an applicant for homeowner insurance\n“provid[ing] coverage on a replacement cost basis,” or any renewal thereof, “constitutes\nmaking a statement with respect to the business of insurance which is misleading and\nwhich by the exercise of reasonable care should be known to be misleading, pursuant to\nInsurance Code section 790.03.”\n       Representatives from the plaintiffs, the Association of California Insurance\nCompanies and the Personal Insurance Federation of California (Associations), submitted\ncomments and testified in the May 17, 2010 “homeowners insurance hearing,” which\npreceded promulgation of the Regulation. During that hearing, they stated that the\nCommissioner lacked authority to define new unfair business practices. They questioned\nwhether the administrative record supported the Commissioner’s assertion that there was\n\n                                              7\n\fa high volume of homeowner complaints “specifically about the fact that that they were\nnot provided certain information that they needed to make an informed decision about\nwhat insurance coverage limitation they have,” or that the “underinsured problem” was\ncaused by lack of knowledge. Among other comments, they decried the expense of\ncompliance with the Regulation and predicted that the Regulation would discourage\ncarriers from providing insurance.\nThe declaratory relief proceedings\n        On June 8, 2011, the Associations filed a declaratory relief action. There, they\nsought a declaration that the Regulation was invalid because the Commissioner lacked\nauthority to “regulate the underwriting of homeowner insurance”; section 790.03 did not\nauthorize “the imposition of a single, detailed method for estimating the replacement cost\nof houses”; and the Regulation violated insurance companies’ free speech rights under\nthe First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n        After the Associations’ motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied, the\nparties agreed that the case could be tried based on the rulemaking file, written briefs, and\noral argument without oral testimony. Trial and oral argument were held on February 4,\n2013.\n        The Associations’ arguments\n        In their trial brief, the Associations argued that in response to comments at the\nadministrative hearing about the Commissioner’s lack of authority to promulgate the\nRegulation, the Commissioner cited section 790.10 of the UIPA and section 1749.85, but\nthat neither provided any such authority. In essence, they argued that the\nCommissioner’s reliance on section 790.10 ignored the language and structure of the\nUIPA, which at trial they characterized as “unique,” particularly its use of the terms\n“defined” and “determined.” Section 1749.85 merely authorized promulgating standards\nfor calculating replacement cost estimates prepared by appraisers.\n        Section 790.10 provides: “The commissioner shall, from time to time as\nconditions warrant, after notice and public hearing, promulgate reasonable rules and\n\n                                              8\n\fregulations, and amendments and additions thereto, as are necessary to administer this\narticle.” The Associations conceded that section 790.10 gave authority to the\nCommissioner to “administer” the UIPA, but argued that it did not give him authority to\ndefine unfair business practices.\n       More specifically, section 790 of the UIPA provides: “The purpose of this article\nis to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of\nCongress as expressed in the Act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, Seventy-\nninth Congress), by defining, or providing for the determination of, all such practices in\nthis State which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined.” (Italics\nadded.)\n       The Associations argued that the Legislature defined “unfair and deceptive acts or\npractices in the business of insurance” in section 790.03,5 which states that “[t]he\n\n\n\n       5  The full text of section 790.03 is as follows: “The following are hereby defined\nas unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the\nbusiness

the\ndividends or share of surplus previously paid on similar policies, or making any\nmisleading representation or any misrepresentation as to the financial condition of any\ninsurer, or as to the legal reserve system upon which any life insurer operates, or using\nany name or title of any policy or class of policies misrepresenting the true nature thereof,\nor making any misrepresentation to any policyholder insured in any company for the\npurpose of inducing or tending to induce the policyholder to lapse, forfeit, or surrender\nhis or her insurance.\n        “(b) Making or disseminating

At the same time, the\nRegulation does not sanction an inaccurate estimate that complies with the format and\ncontent requirements of the Regulation. The Associations cited as an admission the\nCommissioner’s statement during an administrative hearing that “‘[t]he regulations do\nnot require of replacement value estimates any particular degree of accuracy.’”\n       The Associations also argued that that the Regulation “Unlawfully Restrict[ed]\nUnderwriting” because despite the exemption for “internal communications within an\ninsurer” in subdivision (l) of the Regulation, in practice, “communications about insurer’s\nunderwriting decisions do come to the attention of applicants and insureds, and\nparticularly so with respect to adverse underwriting decisions.” Because “[t]he amount\nof homeowners’ insurance is an essential part of the underwriting decision,” the\nRegulation “unlawfully restricted homeowner insurers[’] underwriting” and was therefore\ninvalid.\n       Finally, the Associations argued that the Regulation was subject to the higher level\nof scrutiny imposed by Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v.

Similarly, the Commissioner has authority to\npromulgate a regulation prohibiting a specific type of misleading statement from being\ncommunicated to purchasers of homeowners insurance. Therefore, it was a non sequitur\nfor the Associations to argue that, just because estimates of replacement costs were not\nspecifically identified in section 790.03, the Commissioner exceeded his authority in\nregulating them.\n       The Commissioner also argued that 790.06 was not a mechanism for adding new\ncategories of unfair and deceptive insurance business practices. Instead, it is an\nenforcement tool to “enjoin a particular practice engaged by an individual insurer through\nprocedures similar to an administrative disciplinary action.”\n       The Commissioner also faulted the Associations for taking the Commissioner’s\nstatement regarding “accuracy” out of context because the statement was followed by a\nstatement at the hearing that “all the regulations do [is] require that any estimate of\nreplace[ment] cost be complete and must not ignore outright any of the basic cost\ncomponents universally acknowledged to figure into replacement cost.” The\nCommissioner further argued that accuracy was not required because “the Commissioner\ndoes not expect insurers to guarantee replacement cost.”\n       The Regulation also does not regulate underwriting because it does not specify or\notherwise dictate what risks insurance companies should underwrite and does not prevent\nan insurer from setting minimum or maximum amounts of coverage or any amount of\ncoverage that is different from the estimate of replacement cost; in fact, subdivision (p) of\nthe Regulation expressly so provides.

Under either standard, however, he argued\nthat the Regulation did not violate the Associations’ free speech rights.\n       In their reply, the Associations largely repeated arguments from their opening\nbrief. They also gave illustrations of how the Regulation expanded the definition of\nunfair and deceptive practices in section 790.03, subdivision (b). They hypothesized an\nestimate from a reputable contractor in a single figure to replace a home, including every\ndetail down to the bathroom floor finishing, that was true, but that would be rendered\n“misleading” under the Regulation because it failed to itemize its components. The same\nwould be true for an oral estimate because the Regulation requires the estimate to be in\nwriting. In the Associations’ own words, “Mandatory, specified communication is a far\ncry from prohibiting misleading statements.”\n       The trial court’s statement of decision\n       The trial court agreed with the Associations’ contention that the Commissioner did\nnot have authority to promulgate the Regulation. The court reasoned that estimates of\nreplacement costs, although “inherently inaccurate,” are not misleading. By\ncharacterizing all estimates of replacements costs as misleading except ones that\ncomplied with the content and format requirements in the Regulation, the Commissioner\n“expands the meaning of something ‘known’ or which ‘should be known’ to be\nmisleading beyond the parameters of §790.03(b).” The court concluded that section\n790.03, subdivision (b) did not give the Commissioner authority “to penalize acts not\nknown or cannot be determined through reasonable care to be misleading.”\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       The trial court also dismissed the Commissioner’s legal authorities. Thus, the\ncourt concluded that Calfarm, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1355775\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355775/calfarm-ins-co-v-deukmejian/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, involved dicta regarding a void\nstatutory scheme that required the “agency to fill in the blanks,” and Payne, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219742/credit-ins-gen-agents-assn-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, expressly “caution[ed]” against issuing regulations that conflicted with the\nenabling statute.

The Regulation addresses the problem that arises when\na replacement cost estimate does not include all reasonable components necessary to\nrebuild a home. If a consumer relies on such an estimate in selecting a policy limit, the\nconsumer risks being underinsured. The fact that estimates are not always accurate does\nnot negate the need for an insurer to communicate a complete estimate. Accordingly, the\nCommissioner argues that, just because an estimate is not always accurate, does not mean\nit cannot be misleading. In support of this position, he cites Ford Dealers, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1357706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1357706/ford-dealers-assn-v-department-of-motor-vehicles/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       The Commissioner faulted the trial judge for making section 790.06 a substitute\nfor rulemaking processes. Instead, section 790.06 is an enforcement tool against an\nindividual insurer and not an across-the-board regulation of the insurance industry. The\ntrial judge also ignored section 790.05.10 Irrespective of the existence of the Regulation,\n\n\n\n\n       9 The\n           United Policyholders, Scripps Ranch Civic Association, and Rancho\nBernardo Community Council filed an amici brief in support of the Commissioner.\n       10 Section 790.05 provides: “Whenever the commissioner shall have reason to\nbelieve that a person has been engaged or is engaging in this state in any unfair method of\ncompetition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice defined in Section 790.03, and that\na proceeding by the commissioner in respect thereto would be to the interest of the\npublic, he or she shall issue and serve upon that person an order to show cause containing\na statement of the charges in that respect, a statement of that person’s potential liability\nunder Section 790.035, and a notice of a hearing thereon to be held at a time and place\nfixed therein, which shall not be less than 30 days after the service thereof, for the\npurpose of determining whether the commissioner should issue an order to that person to,\npay the penalty imposed by Section 790.035, and to cease and desist those methods, acts,\nor practices or any of them.\n       “If the charges or any of them are found to be justified the commissioner shall\nissue and cause to be served upon that person an order requiring that person to pay the\n                                              19\n\fsection 790.05 sets forth the procedures before an administrative law judge for bringing a\nnoncompliance proceeding against a licensee alleged to have engaged in an unfair and\ndeceptive practice prohibited by section 790.03, including “misleading” statements under\nsection 790.03, subdivision (b).\n       The Associations supported the trial court’s reasoning. They reiterated that the\nUIPA is unique, and for that reason Calfarm, Payne, and Ford Dealers are not instructive\nbecause they involved either a different kind of insurance, administrative proceeding, or\nstatute.\n       In addition, the Associations argued the legislative history of section 790.10, when\nit was added in 1971 to the UIPA, indicates that the Legislature did not intend that\nsection 790.10 be a vehicle for the Commissioner to regulate insurance practices under\ncover of disseminating misleading statements under section 790.03, subdivision (b). As\noriginally drafted, section 790.10 would have used the word “implement,” a broader\ngrant of power according to the Associations; instead, the Legislature used the narrower\nterm “administer,” as the statute currently reads. (Stats. 1971, ch. 975, § 1, p. 1887.)11\nThe Associations contend that this was confirmed when the Legislature amended section\n\n\npenalty imposed by Section 790.035 and to cease and desist from engaging in those\nmethods, acts, or practices found to be unfair or deceptive.\n       “The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure\nAct, Chapter 5 (commencing at Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the\nGovernment Code, except that the hearings may be conducted by an administrative law\njudge in the administrative law bureau when the proceedings involve a common question\nof law or fact with another proceeding arising under other Insurance Code sections that\nmay be conducted by administrative law bureau administrative law judges.

Thus, section 790.02 states, “No person shall engage in this State in\nany trade practice which is defined in this article as, or determined pursuant to this\narticle to be, an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in\nthe business of insurance.” (Italics added.)\n       In section 790.03, the Legislature has defined “as unfair methods of competition\nand unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance” numerous acts or\npractices, including, among other acts or practices, making false statements “as to the\ndividends or share of surplus previously paid on similar policies” (subd. (a)); entering\ninto a boycott (subd. (c)); making “any false statement of financial condition of an insurer\nwith intent to deceive” (subd. (d)); “willfully omitting to make a true entry of any\nmaterial fact pertaining to the business of the insurer in any book . . . of the insurer”\n(subd. (e)); unfairly discriminating “between individuals of the same class and equal\nexpectation of life” in life insurance rates (subd. (f)(1)); representing that one is a\nmember of the California Insurance Guarantee Association or insured against insolvency\n\n\n       13 Calfarm is otherwise not on point. There, the Supreme Court invalidated two\nprovisions of Proposition 103 regarding insurance rates (§ 1861.01 et seq.) as\nunconstitutional. (48 Cal.3d at pp. 815–816.)\n                                               22\n\f(subd. (g)); and “[k]nowingly” committing one or more of sixteen “unfair claims\nsettlement practices” set forth in subdivision (h). These are in addition to section 790.03,\nsubdivision (b), at issue here, as to disseminating a “statement . . . which is untrue,\ndeceptive, or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable\ncare should be known, to be untrue, deceptive, or misleading.”\n       In addition, section 790.036, subdivision (a) provides that advertising insurance\nthat the insurer does not sell is also “an unfair and deceptive act or practice.” There is no\nsimilar provision in the UIPA regarding the content and format of replacement costs\nestimates. This demonstrates that the Legislature was deliberate in choosing what\nconduct to brand in sections 790.03 and 790.036 as “unfair and deceptive.” Applying the\nlegislative maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, we can infer that the absence\nof a provision regarding replacement cost estimates was a deliberate choice. Thus, the\nCommissioner did not have authority to add content and format requirements for\nreplacement cost estimates in homeowner insurance to the list of practices set forth in\nsection 790.03 under the guise of deeming nonconforming estimates misleading under\nsection 790.03, subdivision (b).\n       Our conclusion is bolstered by those provisions in the UIPA actually\ndenominating the Commissioner’s powers. These focus on the Commissioner’s power\n(1) to enforce existing prohibitions in the UIPA (§§ 790.035, 790.04, 790.05, 790.07,14\n790.08); (2) to bring enforcement proceedings against a person the Commissioner has\n“reason to believe” is engaging “in any method of competition or in any act or practice\n. . . not defined in Section 790.03 . . . that . . . is unfair or deceptive” (§ 790.06); and\n(3) to “promulgate reasonable rules and regulations” to administer the act (§ 790.10).\nRead together, these provisions demonstrate that the Legislature did not give the\nCommissioner power to define by regulation acts or conduct not otherwise deemed unfair\nor deceptive in the statute.\n\n\n       14 Section790.07 regards violations of a cease and desist order issued pursuant to\nsection 790.05 or a court order issued pursuant to section 790.06.\n                                               23\n\f       Thus, section 790.04 gives the Commissioner “power to examine and investigate\ninto the affairs of every person engaged in the business of insurance . . . in order to\ndetermine whether such person has been or is engaged in any unfair method of\ncompetition or in any unfair or deceptive act or practice prohibited by Section 790.03 or\ndetermined pursuant to this article to be an unfair method of competition or an unfair or\ndeceptive practice in the business of insurance.” (Italics added.)\n       Section 790.05 sets forth an enforcement process when the Commissioner has\n“reason to believe that a person has been engaged . . . in any unfair method of\ncompetition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice defined in Section 790.03, and that\na proceeding by the commissioner in respect thereto would be to the interest of the\npublic.” That process includes an order to show cause hearing after the Commissioner\nhas served that person with a statement of the charges and the person’s potential liability\nunder section 790.035. The hearing is conducted under the auspices of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) (Gov. Code, § 11500 et seq.), and any resulting\norder is reviewable by a court as provided by Insurance Code section 12940 or the APA.\nThe Commissioner’s remedies include civil penalties as provided in section 790.035,\nsubdivision (a),15 and a cease and desist order.\n       The Commissioner’s argument that incomplete replacement cost estimates are\nwithin the ambit of “untrue, deceptive, or misleading” statements in section 790.03,\nsubdivision (b) proves too much. If that were the case, there would be no need for the\nRegulation because, as the Commissioner points out, he would already have had the\nmeans in section 790.05 to assess penalties and issue a cease and desist order against a\n\n\n       15 Section 790.035, subdivision (a) provides: “Any person who engages in any\nunfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice defined in Section\n790.03 is liable to the state for a civil penalty to be fixed by the commissioner, not to\nexceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each act, or, if the act or practice was willful, a\ncivil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each act. The\ncommissioner shall have the discretion to establish what constitutes an act. However,\nwhen the issuance, amendment, or servicing of a policy or endorsement is inadvertent, all\nof those acts shall be a single act for the purpose of this section.”\n                                              24\n\flicensee the Commissioner believed had given a lowball or incomplete estimate in selling\nhomeowner insurance.\n       The Commissioner’s reliance on section 790.10 also appears circular. As set forth\nin the preceding discussion, section 790.03 lists specific insurance industry conduct that\nthe Legislature has deemed unfair and deceptive. Replacement cost estimates are not\nincluded in that list. The Commissioner argues that, because he believes replacement\ncost estimates not following the Regulation’s format and content rules are automatically\n“misleading” under section 790.03, subdivision (b), he has authority to regulate such\nestimates under his powers of administration in section 790.10.\n       This interpretation of the UIPA is not only circular, it also renders section 790.06\nsuperfluous. Put differently, under the Commissioner’s interpretation of its authority\nunder the UIPA, he would never have to resort to the procedures in section 790.06\nregarding practices not “defined” in 790.03 because the Commissioner could always\nargue that conduct not meeting standards in a regulation promulgated under the cover of\nthe Commissioner’s power to administer under section 790.10 would be “misleading.”\nThis is precisely what the Commissioner has done here.\n       Section 790.06 provides for more multifaceted procedural processes than required\nby section 790.05 before any conduct identified by the Commissioner not within 790.03\ncan be sanctioned. Thus, in addition to an order to show cause hearing under the APA, if\nthe conduct is found to be “unfair or deceptive,” the Commissioner is required to issue a\nwritten report “so declaring.” If the conduct has not been discontinued, the\nCommissioner may, through the Attorney General, petition the superior court to enjoin\nthe conduct. Unlike a proceeding under section 790.05, the Commissioner cannot enjoin\nthe purportedly unfair or deceptive conduct without a court order.\n       Under the heading of “Powers vested in commissioner,” section 790.08 provides\nin pertinent part that “[t]he powers vested in the commissioner in this article shall be\nadditional to” the penalties and other remedies “authorized by law with respect to the\nmethods, acts and practices hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive.” (Italics added.)\n\n                                             25\n\fThus, section 790.08 emphasizes that the enforcement role of the Commissioner is\ntethered to acts and practices “hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive,” to wit, defined\nor determined in the UIPA.\n       The Commissioner places great reliance on Ford Dealers, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1357706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1357706/ford-dealers-assn-v-department-of-motor-vehicles/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in\narguing that omitting information can be misleading and the Commissioner has\n“discretion” to fill in the “details” as to what is misleading under section 790.03 even if\nthe particular insurance act or practice is not listed in section 790.03. In Ford Dealers,\nthe Supreme Court held that the director of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)\nhad the authority to promulgate a regulation requiring, among other things, licensed\nautomobile dealers to disclose certain added-on delivery and preparation charges where\nthe enabling statute, Vehicle Code section 11713, subdivision (a), made unlawful the\ndissemination of “any statement which is untrue or misleading and which is known, or\nwhich by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or misleading.”\n       Like 790.03, subdivision (b), at issue before us, Vehicle Code section 11713,\nsubdivision (a) is followed by subdivisions identifying other prohibited practices. These\ninclude advertising using fonts and a format other than those specified in the statute\n(subd. (b)); failing to withdraw an advertisement for a vehicle within 48 hours after the\nvehicle has been sold (subd. (c)); not having the required bond (subd. (e)) and\n“established place of business” (subd. (f)); including licensing or transfer of title fees\nwhich are not due to the state (subd. (g)); and employing an unlicensed salesperson (subd.\n(h)). Vehicle Code section 11713, subdivision (a) also makes unlawful the dissemination\nof a misleading statement as “part of a plan . . . with the intent not to sell any vehicle or\nservice so advertised at the price stated therein, or as so advertised.”16\n       In upholding the regulation, the Supreme Court reasoned that an “administrative\nagency is not limited to the exact provisions of a statute in adopting regulations to\n\n\n       16 In addition, division 5, chapter 4, article 1 of the Vehicle Code, of which section\n11713 is a part, contains a myriad of other statutory obligations pertaining to automobile\nsales and dealers.

Code, §§ 11700–11740.)\n                                              26\n\fenforce its mandate,” and the absence of any specific statutory provision regarding the\nsubject of the regulation did not mean that the agency did not have authority to\npromulgate it. (Ford Dealers, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 362.) Notably absent from the\nstatutory regime at issue in Ford Dealers were provisions distinguishing between\nprocedures to be employed regarding acts or practices defined by the statute to be unfair\nand deceptive, and those acts or practices not so defined in the statute, but nonetheless\nbelieved by the administrative agency to be similarly unfair and deceptive.17 We do not\ndoubt that the Legislature could have delegated to the Commissioner the kind of broad\nauthority conferred on the DMV in Ford Dealers; it did not do so in the UIPA.\n       Payne, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219742/credit-ins-gen-agents-assn-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, offers no more support for the Commissioner’s\nposition. There, the Supreme Court upheld the Commissioner’s authority to limit the\namount of compensation paid to agents in the sale of credit life and credit disability\ninsurance. In Payne, the Supreme Court primarily addressed the necessity of the\nregulation—finding that the administrative record supported the Commissioner. As\nnoted ante, the Associations have not attacked the Regulation on necessity grounds.\n       The Payne court observed that under statutes governing credit insurance, the\nLegislature evidenced its intent to “grant the commissioner broad discretion to determine\nwhat reasonable rules and regulations in the area of credit insurance are necessary to\npromote the public welfare.” (Payne, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 656.) The Commissioner\nhad authority to promulgate the regulation because the credit insurance statutes gave the\nCommissioner power under section 779.21 to adopt regulations “‘as may be necessary to\ncarry out the provisions of [the article relating to credit insurance],’” and under section\n779.9 to disapprove a credit insurance form if it contains provisions that are “‘unjust,\n\n\n       17 The Vehicle Code provisions at issue in Ford Dealers, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1357706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1357706/ford-dealers-assn-v-department-of-motor-vehicles/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nalso contain different enforcement procedures from those in the UIPA. For example,\nVehicle Code section 11726 provides for a civil action for damages, attorney fees, and\ninjunctive relief for any licensee “suffering pecuniary loss because of any willful failure\nby any other licensee to comply with any provision of Article 1 . . . .” There is no\nanalogous provision in the UIPA.\n                                             27\n\funfair, inequitable, misleading, deceptive . . . or are contrary to any provision of the\nInsurance Code or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.’” (Payne, at\np. 656, italics added.)\n       Once again, these statutes governing credit insurance do not contain the same\nlanguage or fit into the same statutory context as section 790.03 does in the UIPA.\nAccordingly, Payne is of limited value to the present analysis—to discern whether in\ngiving the Commissioner power to administer the UIPA in section 790.10, the Legislature\nintended to give the Commissioner power to define content and format rules for\nreplacement cost estimates and render them “misleading” under section 790.03,\nsubdivision (b) just because the estimates did not follow those rules.18\n       The legislative evolution of the UIPA as well as other sections in the\nInsurance Code support the conclusion that the Commissioner was without\nauthority to promulgate the Regulation\n       The UIPA as originally enacted in 1959 (Stats. 1959, ch. 1737, § 1, p. 4187) did\nnot include all the acts and practices currently deemed unfair and deceptive in section\n790.03. It also did not include section 790.10. That section first appeared in the UIPA in\n1971. (Stats. 1971, ch. 975, § 1, p. 1887.) When the Legislature was considering\nAssembly Bill No. 1353, which proposed to add section 790.10, the Assembly\nCommittee on Finance and Insurance’s summary included the following statement:\n“This bill gives the Insurance Commissioner the authority to promulgate rules and\nregulations so that if the need therefor arises, he can, without delay, promulgate necessary\nrules making such practices definite and specific for the benefit of the public without\n\n\n       18 We  note that Justice Mosk dissented in Payne, arguing that there was “no direct\nlegislative authority justifying an enforceable order” other than “two very general\nauthorizations of power.” (Payne, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 659 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)\nIndeed, Justice Mosk asserted that the majority opinion was contrary to the Supreme\nCourt’s “converse conclusion” in Pac.

Bill No. 1353 (1971 Reg. Sess.) p. 1.)19\n       On initial review, this statement of legislative purpose would support the\nCommissioner’s interpretation of his authority to promulgate the Regulation defining\nnoncomplying replacement cost estimates as “misleading” statements under section\n790.03. However, the Legislature’s subsequent additions to section 790.03 are not\nconsistent with this view.\n       We observe that section 790.03, subdivision (h), regarding unfair claims\nsettlement practices, was added to the UIPA in 1972. (Stats. 1972, ch. 725, § 1, p. 1314.)\nSection 790.03, subdivision (h) covers categories of claims settlement practices that\ncould have been regulated under the Commissioner’s interpretation of his authority under\nsections 790.03 and 790.10 without amending the statute. Consider section 790.03,\nsubdivision (h)(1), regarding “[m]isrepresenting to claimants pertinent facts or insurance\npolicy provisions relating to any coverages at issue,” as one such example.\n       Similarly, in 1975, the Legislature added definitions (14) and (15) to\nsubdivision (h) of section 790.03, respectively regarding “advising a claimant not to\nobtain the services of an attorney” and “[m]isleading a claimant as to the applicable\nstatute of limitations.” (Stats. 1975, ch. 790, § 1, p. 1812.) Under the Commissioner’s\nview of his authority, the Commissioner could have defined these practices in a\nregulation and then denominated them as misleading under section 790.03, subdivision\n(b) without waiting for enabling legislation.\n       Indeed, in response to complaints about underinsurance regarding the same\nwildfires that ultimately led to promulgation of the Regulation, the Legislature in 2005\namended section 2051.5 (Stats. 2005, ch. 447, § 3, p. 3608) and added section 1749.85\n\n\n\n\n       19 On our motion, we take judicial notice of this summary and the other legislative\nreports and analyses discussed in this opinion.\n                                                29\n\f(Stats. 2005, ch. 447, § 2, p. 3608).20 As noted earlier, section 2051.5, subdivision (a)\ndefines replacement cost. The 2005 amendments to subdivision (b)(2) of section 2051.5\nexpanded alternative living expense payments in the event of a state of emergency.\nSection 1749.85, subdivision (a) tasked the curriculum committee to make\nrecommendations on training broker-agents on “proper methods of estimating the\nreplacement value of structures, and of explaining the various levels of coverage under a\nhomeowners’ insurance policy.”\n       We observe that section 1749.85, subdivision (c) states that nothing in “[t]his\nsection” shall be construed to prevent “licensed appraisers, contractors and architects\nfrom estimating replacement value of a structure,” but that if they do, subdivision (d)\nauthorizes the Department of Insurance to adopt a regulation “establish[ing] standards for\nthe calculation” of such estimates. Not even the Commissioner argues that section\n1749.85, subdivision (d) authorized the Commissioner to promulgate the Regulation, but\nat trial the Commissioner asserted that the latter statute supported subdivision (k) of the\nRegulation regarding, among other things, training of broker-agents. Although neither\nsection 2051.5 nor 1749.85 is part of the UIPA, the Legislature could have acted at the\ntime of these 2005 amendments to legislate the form and content of replacement cost\nestimates, given consumer complaints about underinsurance, of which the Legislature\nwas well aware, but it did not do so.\n       Similarly, section 10101, which was added to the Insurance Code in 1992, requires\nresidential property insurers to provide written disclosures in the format specified in\nsection 10102. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1089, § 1, p. 5031.) Section 10102, subdivision (a),\nwhich was added to the Insurance Code in 2010—the same year in which the Regulation\nwas promulgated—sets forth the content of the required disclosure, including informing\n\n\n       20 The author of the legislation commented on the many complaints about “the\nunderinsurance problem” and that “[b]etter and continued training of personnel in how to\nestimate the replacement cost of a home is therefore critical.” (Sen. Banking, Finance\nand Insurance Committee, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 2 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended\nMar. 29, 2005, p. 7.)\n                                             30\n\fthe consumer that the coverage “‘should be high enough so you can rebuild your home,’”\nitemizing the kind of rebuilding costs a consumer should anticipate, and warning the\nconsumer to obtain insurance in a sufficient amount to cover those costs.

Section 10103, subdivision\n(a)(2) further provides that no residential property insurance “may be issued or renewed”\nunless it recites “‘[t]he limit of liability for this structure (Coverage A) is based on an\nestimate of the cost to rebuild your home, including an approximate cost for labor and\nmaterials in your area, and specific information that you have provided about your\nhome.’” (Stats. 2006, ch. 137, § 2, p. 1779.)\n       The Legislature could have gone on to define the content and format of\nreplacement cost estimates. It could have added incomplete replacement cost estimates\nto the list of unfair and deceptive practices in the UIPA. We infer that these omissions\nwere deliberate, and that under the guise of “filling in the details,” the Commissioner\ntherefore could not do what the Legislature has chosen not to do.\n       By our opinion today, we are not suggesting that the Legislature could not regulate\nthe form and content of replacement cost estimates if it chooses to do so. We are also not\nsuggesting that the Commissioner could not use the administrative and court processes in\nsection 790.06 to seek a determination that replacement cost estimates not including\ncertain information are unfair and deceptive. Nor are we limiting the Commissioner’s\nauthority under section 790.05 to bring an enforcement action against a licensee who has\nlowballed or otherwise given an incomplete replacement cost estimate. Our ruling today\nis limited to one conclusion—that the UIPA has not as of yet given the Commissioner\nauthority to regulate the content and format of replacement cost estimates. Because we\nconclude that the Commissioner did not have the authority to promulgate the Regulation,\nwe do not reach the Associations’ other arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION.\n\n\n                                                BENDIX, J.*\nWe concur:\n\n\n      CHANEY, Acting P.
