Because segregated educational facilities were never mandated by law, it is conceded that a finding of unconstitutionality is dependent on a finding that the segregation was brought about or maintained by intentional state action.  We conclude that sufficient evidence was presented to establish that segregation in the Omaha School District<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was intentionally created and maintained by the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Accordingly, we require that the Omaha School District be integrated, establish guidelines for achieving that goal, and remand to the District Court to supervise the process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>I.

The District Court so found, and the defendants do not contest that finding.  Nevertheless, we briefly describe the segregated nature of the schools.  In 1973-74, the School District of Omaha had a student population of 60,502, of whom 20% Were black.  It operated eight high schools, twelve junior highs, one middle school (grades 5-7), and seventy-eight elementary schools.  Over 50% Of the black students in the District attended schools which had an 80% To 100% Black enrollment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> while 73% Of the white students attended schools with black enrollments of less than 5%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the high school level, Tech was 96% Black, and shared a common attendance zone with Central, which was 32% Black.  North was 36% Black, Benson was 14% Black, and South was 3% Black.  The remaining three high schools enrolled less than fifteen black students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the junior high level, Horace Mann was 97% Black, Monroe was 39% Black, McMillan was 36% Black, Indian Hill was 19% Black, Hale was 10% Black, and Lewis and Clark was 5% Black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The six remaining junior high schools had enrollments of less than 3% Black.  One middle school, Martin Luther King, opened in September, 1973, with an 82% Black enrollment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the elementary level, three schools (Kennedy, Lothrop, and Conestoga) were over 90% Black.  An additional seven were between 75% And 90% Black, two were between 50% And 75% Black, two were between 35% And 50% Black, ten were between 10% And 35% Black, three were between 5% And 10% Black, and eighteen were between 1% And 5% Black.  Thirty-three elementary schools were either all white or had less than 1% Black enrollment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The faculties were also segregated.  In 1972-73, the latest year for which figures were provided in the record, the District employed 193 black teachers.  Of that number, 121 or 62% Were assigned to majority black schools,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and 159 or 82% Were assigned to the twenty-three schools which had a black enrollment exceeding 25%.  Thus, only 18% Of the black teachers were assigned to the seventy-five schools with enrollments less than 25% Black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the high school level, 23 of the 49 black teachers were assigned to Tech (95% Black), and 44 black teachers (90% Of the total) were assigned to the three high schools with more than 30% Black enrollment: Tech, Central and North.  Only five black high school teachers were assigned to the five remaining high schools, and two of those were assigned to Benson, which was 10% Black.  One high school, Northwest, had no black teachers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the junior high level, 18 or the 38 black teachers were assigned to Mann (98% Black), and 28 black teachers (74% Of the total) were assigned to the three junior high schools with more than 30% Black enrollment: Mann, McMillan and Monroe.  The ten remaining black teachers were assigned to five junior high schools.  Four junior high schools had no black teachers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the elementary level, 79 of the 106 black teachers (or 75%) were assigned to ten schools with black enrollments of over 75%, and 86 black teachers (81% Of the total) were assigned to the sixteen elementary schools with black enrollments exceeding 25%.  The remaining 20 black elementary teachers were sprinkled over the sixty-two schools with less than 25% Black enrollment.  Lothrop elementary (96% Black) had more black elementary teachers than those sixty-two schools combined.  At least forty-six elementary schools with predominantly white enrollments did not have a single black faculty member.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No discussion of the segregated nature of the Omaha public schools would be complete without mention of the segregated housing patterns in the city and some of the reasons therefor.  The area in which most of the black community resides is commonly referred to as the \"Near North Side.\"  The area encompassed by that term has changed as blacks have spread out from the core area, particularly toward the northwest.  Newly developing residential areas on the periphery of the city, as well as older residential areas beyond the Near North Side's \"encroachment pattern,\" remain almost exclusively white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence established that segregated housing patterns in the city were the result of discriminatory state and private actions.  Between 1938 and 1953, the Omaha Housing Authority opened five large family-occupied public housing projects.  Four were constructed in, or adjacent to, the Near North Side, and each was over 95% Black in 1973.  One was located in South Omaha, and became a \"white project.\"  The Housing Authority encouraged racially discriminatory housing assignment by allowing white applicants for public housing to turn down openings in \"black\" projects while remaining at the top of the priority list.  Compare Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 296 F.Supp. 907 (N.D.Ill.1969).  By 1955, the school board was aware of the segregated nature of the housing projects and was struggling to cope with large increases in black enrollment causing overcrowding at Druid Hill, Kennedy, Kellom, Lake, and Lothrop elementary schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Private racial discrimination in the housing market was also prevalent.  It was common for racial covenants to be included in deeds even after Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948).  In 1953, the Code of Ethics discouraged realtors from selling property to blacks in a white neighborhood.  In the late 1960's sellers were given an option by the realtors to cross out a sentence barring discrimination in listing agreements.  And, at least from 1965 through 1968, it was common practice to put the word \"CONDITIONS\" on any multiple listing where the seller had indicated that he did not wish to sell the property to minorities.  Approximately one-third to one-half of multiple listing cards during that period had this notation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>II. THE LEGAL STANDARD GOVERNING PROOF OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL SCHOOL SEGREGATION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), dealt only with a school system in which segregation was mandated by law, it has since been made clear in a series of \"northern and western\" cases<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that no intentionally segregated school system can be tolerated under the Constitution.  It is equally clear that the \"intent\" which triggers a finding of unconstitutionality is not an intent to harm black students, but simply an intent to bring about or maintain segregated schools.  Thus, even if a school board believes that \"separate but equal\" is superior for black children, that belief will not save the intentional segregation from a finding of unconstitutionality. \"Benevolence of motives does not excuse segregative acts.\"  Oliver v. Michigan State Board of Education, 508 F.2d 178, 182-183 (6th Cir. 1974), Cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, 95 S.Ct. 1950, 44 L.Ed.2d 449 (1975).  See also Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 725, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961); Hart v. Community School Bd. of Ed., N. Y. Sch. Dist. # 21, 512 F.2d 37, 50 (2nd Cir. 1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since segregation in the Omaha public schools was obvious at the time of trial, the only question presented to the District Court was whether or not the defendants intended to bring about or maintain that condition.  The District Court properly recognized that segregative intent usually must be inferred.  It held, however, that the burden of proving such intent rested at all times on the appellants, and concluded that the appellants had failed to meet that burden, despite its findings that various acts and omissions of the defendants had the natural, probable, foreseeable and actual consequence of creating and maintaining segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a presumption of segregative intent arises once it is established that school authorities have engaged in acts or omissions, the natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of which is to bring about or maintain segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  When that presumption arises, the burden shifts to the defendants to establish that \"segregative intent was not among the factors that motivated their actions.\"  Keyes v.

Hart v. Community School Bd. of Ed., N. Y. Sch. Dist. # 21, supra 512 F.2d at 50-51; Oliver v. Michigan State Board of Education, supra 508 F.2d at 182.

When we consider the motivation of people constituting a school board, the task would be even harder, for we are dealing with a collective will.  It is difficult enough to find the collective mind of a group of legislators.  See Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224-25 (91 S.Ct. 1940, 29 L.Ed.2d 438) * * * (1971); and see Keyes v.

It is even harder to find the motivation of local citizens, many of whom would be as reluctant to admit that they have racial prejudice as to admit that they have no sense of humor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Speaking in De jure terms does not require us, then, to limit the state activity which effectively spells segregation only to acts which are provably motivated by a desire to discriminate.  See Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, supra 407 U.S.  (451) at 461-62 (92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51) * * *.  Aside from the difficulties of ferreting out a collective motive and conversely the injustice of ascribing collective will to articulate remarks of particular bigots, the nature of the \"state action\" takes its quality from its foreseeable effect.

The five areas include faculty assignment, student transfers, optional attendance zones, school construction, and the deterioration of Tech High.  The proof in each area was sufficient in and of itself to trigger the presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We also conclude that the defendants failed to carry their burden of establishing that segregative intent was not among the factors which motivated their actions.

FACULTY ASSIGNMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The history of faculty assignment in the Omaha public schools demonstrates that the faculty segregation detailed in Part I of this opinion resulted from intentional racial discrimination.  The Omaha school district hired its first two black teachers in 1940-41, assigning them to majority black elementary schools.  During the next twenty-three years, every black teacher hired by the District was assigned to a majority black school.  As of 1961-62, the 57 black teachers employed by the District were assigned to seven majority black schools, and eighty majority white schools did not have a single black teacher.  No black teachers were assigned to the secondary level until 1959-60, when seven were assigned to Mann Junior High, which opened as the first majority black secondary school, with a 71% Black enrollment.  No black teachers were assigned to the high school level until 1963-64, the first year in which a majority black high school existed.  Two black teachers were then assigned to Tech High (51% Black), and one was assigned to North (9% Black).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing evidence, the District Court properly found that, from 1940 to \"the early 1960's,\" the school district had</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>* * * a policy of placing black teachers in majority black schools only, and also had a policy of confining qualified black secondary teachers to the elementary grades.  * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

Of 81 new black teachers hired between 1963 and 1969, 67 were assigned to majority black schools.  In 1972-73, 82% Of all black teachers continued to be assigned to schools having a black enrollment exceeding 25%, even though such schools comprised only one-fourth of the total number of schools in the District.  In that year, fifty-one, or more than half, of the District's approximately ninety-eight schools still did not have a single black faculty member.  Compare Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 19-20, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); United States v.

That policy, which continued in effect through the trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> allowed any student to transfer if: (1) the student's achievement level was at least equal to the average achievement level of the receiving school; (2) the receiving school was not overcrowded; (3) the student's parents provided the transportation; and (4) the request was a formal one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that the evidence concerning the transfer policy was not sufficient to establish an intent to segregate students, and premised that ultimate conclusion on its specific findings that: (1) there was \"no evidence\" that the achievement level and transportation limitations discriminated against black students;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  (2) the transfer policy was used equally by black and white students and the board did not discriminate in granting requests;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  (3) the segregative effect of the transfer policy on the school district as a whole was slight, since only about 2.5% Of all students in the District obtained \"segregative transfers\" in the years 1970-72;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  and (4) the effect of the transfer policy on the predominantly black schools was not sufficient to establish segregative intent. As noted in the footnotes, the first three findings are tenuous.  We need not directly confront them, however, since we conclude that the fourth finding is clearly erroneous.  The evidence presented on transfers granted in 1970-71 and 1971-72 shows that the effect of the transfer policy on the majority and predominantly black schools was profound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of a transfer request to a white student was virtually automatic.  No more than 2% Of the white segregative transfer requests were denied in the two school years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970-71, almost 30% Of all white students (318 of 1086) assigned to the twelve predominantly black elementary schools transferred from those schools to predominantly white elementary schools.  In 1971-72, this figure was 32% (338 of 1039).  The magnitude of the white student flight is further demonstrated by the much smaller figures for black students leaving the same schools: only about 1.5% Of the black students transferred out of the twelve predominantly black elementary schools in the same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impact at the junior high level was even greater.  In 1970-71, 61% (92 of 150) of the white students zoned to attend the two majority black junior high schools transferred out.  In 1971-72, the figure was 71% (154 of 218).  During those same years, no more than 7.5% Of black students transferred out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence concerning the one predominantly black high school, Tech, shows a similar pattern.  Although only 16% Of all white high school students were zoned to attend Tech (90% Black) or Central (25% Black), over 50% Of all transfers granted to white high school students during the two-year period were transfers from this joint attendance zone.  Virtually all white South High alone received 250 white students from the Tech/Central zone in 1970-71, and 315 such students in 1971-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foreseeable and actual result of the transfer policy was to increase the segregated nature of almost all of the majority black schools in the District.  Accordingly, as was true with the evidence of faculty discrimination, a presumption of segregative intent arose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  That presumption was not rebutted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. OPTIONAL ATTENDANCE ZONES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1950, the District began a gradual process of converting its elementary schools from Kindergarten through eighth grade (K-8) to Kindergarten through sixth grade (K-6), for the purpose of establishing a junior high system.  The seventh and eighth graders released from the elementary schools fed the junior high schools.  Although the story is a complicated one, the conversion was achieved in a manner which minimized the necessity of assigning white seventh and eighth graders to the two identifiably black junior high schools: Mann and Tech.  Two basic techniques brought about this result:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  (1) delaying the conversion of predominantly white K-8 schools which would be logical feeders for Mann or Tech; and (2) granting options to the seventh and eighth graders in those schools to attend more distant identifiably white junior high schools, when the conversion did take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tech (54% Black in 1963-64) was the closest junior high to five predominantly white K-8 schools: Saunders (0% Black), Walnut Hill (2% Black), Mason (4% Black), Jackson, (0% Black), and Yates (0.3% Black).  Mann (88% Black in 1963-64) was the closest junior high to two other predominantly white K-8 schools: Pershing (0% Black) and Sherman (0.2% Black).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saunders, Walnut Hill and Mason were converted to K-6 in the period from 1964-65 to 1967-68.  No part of their zones was assigned exclusively to Tech Junior High.  Instead, the District created \"optional attendance zones,\" allowing seventh and eighth graders from those schools to choose between attending Tech Junior High more than 60% Black when the options were created and more distant, identifiably white junior high schools.  When the options were created, Tech Junior High had at least 128 vacant seats and, because it was located in the large Tech High School building, which had declining enrollment, additional space could have been made available.  The foreseeable and actual impact of the optional zoning policy was irrefutably segregative.  In 1971-72, the one year for which data is available on the operation of the options, 111 students chose to attend Lewis and Clark (1.7% Black), 53 chose to attend Norris (0.7% Black), and 5 chose Tech Junior High (91% Black).  Had these students, virtually all of whom were white, been assigned directly to Tech, the enrollment of that school would have been 73% Black, rather than 91% Black in 1971-72.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversion of the other two predominantly white K-8 schools near Tech Junior High was further delayed.  Jackson elementary continued K-8 throughout the trial, when it was 0.5% Black.  Yates elementary school, located only five blocks from Tech Junior High, continued K-8 until 1970-71.  Even then, the conversion of Yates had been delayed for one year because of parental opposition which Dr. Hlavac, the assistant superintendent, openly attributed to racial prejudice.  The conversion of Yates was a pyrrhic victory for integration for two reasons.  First, in the summer of 1970, just before the Yates seventh and eighth graders were assigned to Tech Junior High, Dr. Hlavac's office approved transfer requests for 30 of the approximately 35 white students in that group, allowing them to attend identifiably white junior high schools.  Second, Tech Junior High was closed after the 1971-72 school year.  The Yates attendance district was bisected in 1973-74, so that a portion of its seventh and eighth graders was assigned to overwhelmingly black Mann Junior High, and the other portion was assigned to predominantly white Lewis and Clark.  No more than 20 new white students were enrolled at Mann as a result of the closing of Tech Junior High.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two virtually all white K-8 schools located closest to Mann Junior High, Pershing and Sherman, continued as K-8 throughout the trial, despite the conversion policy, available space at Mann, and the fact that neither school had the enrollment or the facilities which the system considered appropriate for a junior high program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the foregoing actions by the school board, given the foreseeable segregative impact, raised a presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  The District Court reasoned that any inference of segregative intent presumptive or otherwise was rebutted because of two findings: (1) that an optional zone created for a portion of the Druid Hill elementary area had an \"integrative effect,\" thus showing that the defendants acted without reference to racial factors; and (2) that the optional zones were \"necessary and reasonable\" for Walnut Hill, Mason, and Saunders.  For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the presumption was not rebutted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Druid Hill option, allowing students in a predominantly black portion of that elementary zone to attend either Mann or McMillan Junior High schools was created in 1967-68.  Prior to that time, students in the area had been zoned to attend predominantly white McMillan; the option gave them the opportunity to choose to attend 98% Black Mann.  Giving students in a predominantly black area a new choice of attending a predominantly black junior high rather than continuing their attendance in a white school does not have an \"integrative effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Walnut Hill option gave seventh and eight graders the option to attend Norris (3.3 miles distant), Lewis and Clark (2.5 miles) or Tech (1.3 miles).  The defendants urge that this was \"reasonable and necessary\" because the junior high to which the Walnut Hill students would ordinarily have been assigned, Monroe, was overcrowded.  This is a non sequitur.  The school board consistently defended its actions throughout trial on the basis of geographical zoning.  If the children from Walnut Hill could not be assigned to the most logical school, Monroe, the next most logical school was surely not Norris or Lewis and Clark, but the considerably closer and underutilized Tech.  At the very least, the overcrowded nature of Monroe does not provide a reason for the defendants' decision to assign no part of the Walnut Hill attendance area exclusively to Tech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Saunders option gave seventh and eighth graders the option to attend Tech (1 mile), Norris (2.2 miles) or Lewis and Clark (2.5 miles) in 1964-65.  The District Court found this \"reasonable and necessary\" because \" enrollments at Technical Junior High were up and enrollments at Lewis and Clark were down.\"  Omaha II, supra 389 F.Supp. at 307.  The record is to the contrary.  It shows that, in 1964-65, Lewis and Clark was operating with 88 students less than stated capacity and Tech was down 142 students from stated capacity.  The 25 to 30 seventh and eighth graders from Saunders could easily have been absorbed at the much nearer Tech Junior High.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that the reasons advanced by the school district to justify the adoption of optional attendance zones for seventh and eighth graders in the predominantly white elementary zones on the border of the black community are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that, from 1951-73, thirty-nine new schools or additions were constructed, of which thirty-seven opened either predominantly black or white, and that all twenty-one buildings or additions constructed from 1964 through 1973 opened either predominantly white or black.  More specifically, between 1951 and 1973, nineteen schools opened 100% White, fourteen more opened 98% White, and two more opened 93% Or more white.  At the same time, two new structures opened 94% Or more black, one opened 82% Black, and one opened 71% Black.  Only one school in the twenty-two year span opened as truly integrated; that was Indian Hill elementary school, with 28% Black enrollment, and that school is located in an area of the city which is entirely separate from the major black community in the \"Near North Side.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A specific example of the racial impact of the building policies was the construction of Martin Luther King Middle School.  Clifton Hill seventh graders (predominantly black) had traditionally attended majority white Monroe Junior High.  After King was constructed, they were reassigned to that school, which opened 82% Black.  Leaders in the black community protested against this segregative impact and appellants sought a preliminary injunction in this action to restrain the building of King.  In its order denying the preliminary injunction, the District Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>* * * The evidence supports the view that apparently some white students live closer to King than do blacks, yet those whites are allowed to go to a predominantly white school while requiring blacks who live farther from King, to attend that institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Omaha I, supra 367 F.Supp. at 185.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the foregoing record, the evidence was sufficient to establish a presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Nothing in the record served to rebut that presumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>E. THE DETERIORATION OF TECH HIGH SCHOOL</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1973-74, Tech High had an enrollment which was 96% Black.  Because it shared a common attendance zone with Central the only joint attendance zone in the District no student had to attend Tech High.  Only 710 students chose to enroll in that year, despite its capacity of 2,475.  It was the black high school in Omaha.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tech High is located in a white neighborhood, close to the southern boundary of the black community.  It opened in 1923 as a vocational and college prep school.  From 1936-45, it had the largest student body in the District, with a peak of 3,771, and it was predominantly white.  Starting in 1950, the black enrollment at the school increased markedly, from 17% In 1950 to 51% In 1963 to 96% In 1973.  Simultaneously, it experienced a steady decline in total enrollment.  The District Court found that, during this period, Tech developed a large unused capacity at the same time as South and Benson were seriously overcrowded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  The school board's solution to overcrowding in adjacent predominantly white high schools was to construct additions at Benson, North and South in the late 1950's and early 1960's, and to build Bryan, Burke and Northwest High schools.  Boundary adjustments were necessary when the three new schools opened, just as they would have been if space at Tech had been used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the initial reasons for the adoption of the joint Central/Tech attendance zone, there was evidence that Tech's continued status as a school which no one had to attend was at least in part due to perceived white community opposition to a compulsory attendance zone which would force them to send their children to a black Tech High.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  The result of the joint attendance zone was that, in 1973-74, only twenty-two white students attended Tech, despite the fact that all of the white high school students in the District could have chosen to attend Tech under the \"open school\" policy, and despite the fact that the Tech/Central zone encompassed all or part of twelve identifiably white elementary attendance areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the enrollment at Tech declined, and the proportion of black students increased, certain course offerings were dropped, and extracurricular activities were curtailed.  In particular, electronics was dropped from the curriculum, and its instructor was transferred to predominantly white Benson, which was located in an adjacent attendance area and was overcrowded.  At the same time, courses which the school board felt would be more adequately suited to the needs of Tech's increasingly black enrollment, including culinary arts and auto body shop, were added to the curriculum.  Simultaneously, Tech began to serve growing numbers of \"special education\" students.  The criteria used by the defendants to place such students in Tech was an IQ below 85, \"emotional problems,\" and difficulty in learning.  Many of these students were disruptive and presented disciplinary problems.  At a minimum, of 1,170 students enrolled at Tech in 1970-71, 244 students (21%) were special education students.  Only two other high schools had such students in that year: North with 4% And South with 2%.  By 1973, the Committee for the Future of Technical High School reported in one of its memoranda: \"The consensus was that we now are (a school for special education) except in name.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1971-72, Tech High was in a state of disrepair, was ungovernable, and was 91% Black.  After protests of various kinds, the District repaired and renovated it, changed faculty assignments, and altered the curriculum to offer more individualized instruction.  Despite the attempt to shore it up, the preferred recommendation of the Committee for the Future of Technical High School in 1973 was: \"Close the school disperse the students.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that the steady decline in enrollment, the constant and severe overcrowding at neighboring schools, and the increasingly black makeup of Tech were known to the administration of the Omaha public schools.

This has not been the law since Brown v. Board of Education and \"(t)he law can never afford to bend in this direction again.\"  Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier County, Ark., supra 410 F.2d at 926.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By focusing on the quality of education at Tech High, the District Court gave insufficient weight to the fact that the defendants' actions in setting up a joint Tech/Central zone, in making Tech a special education school \"except in name,\" in deleting attractive vocational courses such as electronics from the curriculum and substituting courses aimed at meeting black stereotypes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> in permitting Tech's enrollment to dip far below capacity, and in assigning most of the black high school teachers to Tech, all combined to result in a high school which was identified as \"a 'colored school' just as certainly as if the words were printed across its entrance in six-inch letters.\"  Kelley v. Altheimer, Arkansas Public School Dist. No. 22, 378 F.2d 483, 491 (8th Cir. 1967), Quoting Brown v. County School Board of Frederick County, Va., 245 F.Supp. 549, 560 (W.D.Va.1965).  The result of the defendants' actions in these instances, given the assignment of students to Tech by choice, was not just natural, probable and foreseeable, it was inevitable: a virtually all black and relatively empty school.  That result is even more significant when it is recalled that Tech is located in a white neighborhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presumption of segregative intent which arose following proof of the above course of conduct was not rebutted by anything in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>IV.

We, therefore, remand to the District Court with instructions to it to take those steps necessary to bring about a thoroughly integrated school system in accordance with the guidelines and the timetable set forth below.  We recognize that integration will be difficult.  The pain of transition is an unfortunate, but inevitable result of deliberate policies which have isolated black Americans from the schools and residential communities<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> of white Americans.  Fortunately, the present board of education has indicated a disposition to move toward an integrated school system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  We are confident that, when it understands fully the additional steps that need to be taken to achieve integration, it will take those steps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

The burdens of integration shall be borne as equally as possible by blacks and whites in all geographic areas of the District.  Because substantial changes in student assignments will be required, and because some schools were damaged by a recent tornado, the planning and implementation of student integration may be done in phases, so long as the ultimate deadline is achieved.  Plans for the first phase shall be submitted to the District Court for approval within forty-five days of the issuance of this Court's mandate.  The first phase shall be put into operation for the beginning of the 1975-76 school year.

This policy recognizes the desirability of integrated schools in integrated neighborhoods.  See Swann v. Charlotte- Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra at 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267.  It makes little sense to reassign students now attending integrated schools in their neighborhood to schools in other sections of the city.

This explanation is not sufficient to rebut the presumption for three reasons.  First, such a belief is unacceptable as a justification for racially discriminatory practices, since it is contrary to the factual underpinnings of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954).  See Cato v. Parham, supra 403 F.2d at 15 &amp; nn.6 &amp; 7; Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton Sch. Dist.

The defendants are thus hoist by their own petard.</p>\n        <p>Third, the school district's explanation is belied by a 1966 report by the Superintendent.  That report declared that the ACLU's request for non-white teachers in all Omaha public schools \"is currently unrealistic\" but that \"(t)he climate of our community has been increasingly receptive.\"  This report suggests that the defendants were \"effectuating the discriminatory designs of private individuals.\"  United States v.

Com'rs of Indianapolis, Ind., supra 474 F.2d at 89.

In 1971-72, 80% Of the whites in the District could not possibly have obtained a \"segregative transfer,\" since they already attended schools less than 10% Black.  Since 2.5% Of the total white pool did obtain such transfers, one out of every eight white students who Could seek a \"segregative transfer\" obtained one.  Moreover, the figures for the predominantly black schools show that a much higher proportion of the whites assigned to those schools were fleeing by means of the transfer policy.

First, as the District Court found, the school board granted some transfer requests which were explicitly based on racial factors.  For example, the following requests for transfers were granted:</p>\n        <p>My daughter, Alice, is now going to Clifton Hill School.  I would like to request a transfer for her to Fontenelle School for the next school term.  She said the reason she wants to transfer is because there are too many Negroe (sic) children in her class.  * * *</p>\n        <p>* * * (Request permission to attend Sherman instead of Mann) Because its (sic) a good school and I don't think it right for a girl to go to a considerable Negro school without some of her friends * * *.</p>\n        <p>Compare Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, supra at 520.</p>\n        <p>Second, in 1969, two years before the white student flight shown in the evidence, concern over the obviously segregative effect of the transfer policy had caused Legislative Bill 1042 to be introduced into the Nebraska Legislature.  That bill, which died in committee, would have prohibited racially segregative transfers in the Omaha School District.  The assistant superintendent in charge of administering the transfer policy, Dr. Hlavac, appeared before a committee of the legislature to testify in opposition to the bill.</p>\n        <p>Third, despite the capacity limitation in the transfer policy, large numbers of white students were allowed to transfer to South High from the Tech/Central zone at a time when Tech had unused capacity of close to 1,000 and South was seriously overcrowded.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In 1963-64, only fourteen of the original forty-six K-8 schools had not been converted to K-6.

The District Court so found, and the defendants do not contest that finding.  Nevertheless, we briefly describe the segregated nature of the schools.  In 1973-74, the School District of Omaha had a student population of 60,502, of whom 20% Were black.  It operated eight high schools, twelve junior highs, one middle school (grades 5-7), and seventy-eight elementary schools.  Over 50% Of the black students in the District attended schools which had an 80% To 100% Black enrollment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> while 73% Of the white students attended schools with black enrollments of less than 5%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the high school level, Tech was 96% Black, and shared a common attendance zone with Central, which was 32% Black.  North was 36% Black, Benson was 14% Black, and South was 3% Black.  The remaining three high schools enrolled less than fifteen black students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the junior high level, Horace Mann was 97% Black, Monroe was 39% Black, McMillan was 36% Black, Indian Hill was 19% Black, Hale was 10% Black, and Lewis and Clark was 5% Black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The six remaining junior high schools had enrollments of less than 3% Black.

In 1972-73, the latest year for which figures were provided in the record, the District employed 193 black teachers.  Of that number, 121 or 62% Were assigned to majority black schools,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and 159 or 82% Were assigned to the twenty-three schools which had a black enrollment exceeding 25%.

Only five black high school teachers were assigned to the five remaining high schools, and two of those were assigned to Benson, which was 10% Black.

The area in which most of the black community resides is commonly referred to as the \"Near North Side.\"  The area encompassed by that term has changed as blacks have spread out from the core area, particularly toward the northwest.  Newly developing residential areas on the periphery of the city, as well as older residential areas beyond the Near North Side's \"encroachment pattern,\" remain almost exclusively white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence established that segregated housing patterns in the city were the result of discriminatory state and private actions.  Between 1938 and 1953, the Omaha Housing Authority opened five large family-occupied public housing projects.  Four were constructed in, or adjacent to, the Near North Side, and each was over 95% Black in 1973.  One was located in South Omaha, and became a \"white project.\"  The Housing Authority encouraged racially discriminatory housing assignment by allowing white applicants for public housing to turn down openings in \"black\" projects while remaining at the top of the priority list.

In the late 1960's sellers were given an option by the realtors to cross out a sentence barring discrimination in listing agreements.  And, at least from 1965 through 1968, it was common practice to put the word \"CONDITIONS\" on any multiple listing where the seller had indicated that he did not wish to sell the property to minorities.

It held, however, that the burden of proving such intent rested at all times on the appellants, and concluded that the appellants had failed to meet that burden, despite its findings that various acts and omissions of the defendants had the natural, probable, foreseeable and actual consequence of creating and maintaining segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a presumption of segregative intent arises once it is established that school authorities have engaged in acts or omissions, the natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of which is to bring about or maintain segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  When that presumption arises, the burden shifts to the defendants to establish that \"segregative intent was not among the factors that motivated their actions.\"  Keyes v.

The Omaha school district hired its first two black teachers in 1940-41, assigning them to majority black elementary schools.  During the next twenty-three years, every black teacher hired by the District was assigned to a majority black school.  As of 1961-62, the 57 black teachers employed by the District were assigned to seven majority black schools, and eighty majority white schools did not have a single black teacher.  No black teachers were assigned to the secondary level until 1959-60, when seven were assigned to Mann Junior High, which opened as the first majority black secondary school, with a 71% Black enrollment.  No black teachers were assigned to the high school level until 1963-64, the first year in which a majority black high school existed.

In 1972-73, 82% Of all black teachers continued to be assigned to schools having a black enrollment exceeding 25%, even though such schools comprised only one-fourth of the total number of schools in the District.

In March of 1964, the school board initiated a new transfer policy.  That policy, which continued in effect through the trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> allowed any student to transfer if: (1) the student's achievement level was at least equal to the average achievement level of the receiving school; (2) the receiving school was not overcrowded; (3) the student's parents provided the transportation; and (4) the request was a formal one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that the evidence concerning the transfer policy was not sufficient to establish an intent to segregate students, and premised that ultimate conclusion on its specific findings that: (1) there was \"no evidence\" that the achievement level and transportation limitations discriminated against black students;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  (2) the transfer policy was used equally by black and white students and the board did not discriminate in granting requests;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  (3) the segregative effect of the transfer policy on the school district as a whole was slight, since only about 2.5% Of all students in the District obtained \"segregative transfers\" in the years 1970-72;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  and (4) the effect of the transfer policy on the predominantly black schools was not sufficient to establish segregative intent. As noted in the footnotes, the first three findings are tenuous.  We need not directly confront them, however, since we conclude that the fourth finding is clearly erroneous.  The evidence presented on transfers granted in 1970-71 and 1971-72 shows that the effect of the transfer policy on the majority and predominantly black schools was profound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of a transfer request to a white student was virtually automatic.  No more than 2% Of the white segregative transfer requests were denied in the two school years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970-71, almost 30% Of all white students (318 of 1086) assigned to the twelve predominantly black elementary schools transferred from those schools to predominantly white elementary schools.  In 1971-72, this figure was 32% (338 of 1039).  The magnitude of the white student flight is further demonstrated by the much smaller figures for black students leaving the same schools: only about 1.5% Of the black students transferred out of the twelve predominantly black elementary schools in the same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impact at the junior high level was even greater.  In 1970-71, 61% (92 of 150) of the white students zoned to attend the two majority black junior high schools transferred out.  In 1971-72, the figure was 71% (154 of 218).  During those same years, no more than 7.5% Of black students transferred out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence concerning the one predominantly black high school, Tech, shows a similar pattern.  Although only 16% Of all white high school students were zoned to attend Tech (90% Black) or Central (25% Black), over 50% Of all transfers granted to white high school students during the two-year period were transfers from this joint attendance zone.  Virtually all white South High alone received 250 white students from the Tech/Central zone in 1970-71, and 315 such students in 1971-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foreseeable and actual result of the transfer policy was to increase the segregated nature of almost all of the majority black schools in the District.  Accordingly, as was true with the evidence of faculty discrimination, a presumption of segregative intent arose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  That presumption was not rebutted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. OPTIONAL ATTENDANCE ZONES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1950, the District began a gradual process of converting its elementary schools from Kindergarten through eighth grade (K-8) to Kindergarten through sixth grade (K-6), for the purpose of establishing a junior high system.  The seventh and eighth graders released from the elementary schools fed the junior high schools.  Although the story is a complicated one, the conversion was achieved in a manner which minimized the necessity of assigning white seventh and eighth graders to the two identifiably black junior high schools: Mann and Tech.  Two basic techniques brought about this result:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  (1) delaying the conversion of predominantly white K-8 schools which would be logical feeders for Mann or Tech; and (2) granting options to the seventh and eighth graders in those schools to attend more distant identifiably white junior high schools, when the conversion did take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tech (54% Black in 1963-64) was the closest junior high to five predominantly white K-8 schools: Saunders (0% Black), Walnut Hill (2% Black), Mason (4% Black), Jackson, (0% Black), and Yates (0.3% Black).  Mann (88% Black in 1963-64) was the closest junior high to two other predominantly white K-8 schools: Pershing (0% Black) and Sherman (0.2% Black).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saunders, Walnut Hill and Mason were converted to K-6 in the period from 1964-65 to 1967-68.  No part of their zones was assigned exclusively to Tech Junior High.  Instead, the District created \"optional attendance zones,\" allowing seventh and eighth graders from those schools to choose between attending Tech Junior High more than 60% Black when the options were created and more distant, identifiably white junior high schools.  When the options were created, Tech Junior High had at least 128 vacant seats and, because it was located in the large Tech High School building, which had declining enrollment, additional space could have been made available.  The foreseeable and actual impact of the optional zoning policy was irrefutably segregative.  In 1971-72, the one year for which data is available on the operation of the options, 111 students chose to attend Lewis and Clark (1.7% Black), 53 chose to attend Norris (0.7% Black), and 5 chose Tech Junior High (91% Black).  Had these students, virtually all of whom were white, been assigned directly to Tech, the enrollment of that school would have been 73% Black, rather than 91% Black in 1971-72.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversion of the other two predominantly white K-8 schools near Tech Junior High was further delayed.  Jackson elementary continued K-8 throughout the trial, when it was 0.5% Black.  Yates elementary school, located only five blocks from Tech Junior High, continued K-8 until 1970-71.  Even then, the conversion of Yates had been delayed for one year because of parental opposition which Dr. Hlavac, the assistant superintendent, openly attributed to racial prejudice.  The conversion of Yates was a pyrrhic victory for integration for two reasons.  First, in the summer of 1970, just before the Yates seventh and eighth graders were assigned to Tech Junior High, Dr. Hlavac's office approved transfer requests for 30 of the approximately 35 white students in that group, allowing them to attend identifiably white junior high schools.  Second, Tech Junior High was closed after the 1971-72 school year.  The Yates attendance district was bisected in 1973-74, so that a portion of its seventh and eighth graders was assigned to overwhelmingly black Mann Junior High, and the other portion was assigned to predominantly white Lewis and Clark.  No more than 20 new white students were enrolled at Mann as a result of the closing of Tech Junior High.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two virtually all white K-8 schools located closest to Mann Junior High, Pershing and Sherman, continued as K-8 throughout the trial, despite the conversion policy, available space at Mann, and the fact that neither school had the enrollment or the facilities which the system considered appropriate for a junior high program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the foregoing actions by the school board, given the foreseeable segregative impact, raised a presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  The District Court reasoned that any inference of segregative intent presumptive or otherwise was rebutted because of two findings: (1) that an optional zone created for a portion of the Druid Hill elementary area had an \"integrative effect,\" thus showing that the defendants acted without reference to racial factors; and (2) that the optional zones were \"necessary and reasonable\" for Walnut Hill, Mason, and Saunders.  For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the presumption was not rebutted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Druid Hill option, allowing students in a predominantly black portion of that elementary zone to attend either Mann or McMillan Junior High schools was created in 1967-68.  Prior to that time, students in the area had been zoned to attend predominantly white McMillan; the option gave them the opportunity to choose to attend 98% Black Mann.  Giving students in a predominantly black area a new choice of attending a predominantly black junior high rather than continuing their attendance in a white school does not have an \"integrative effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Walnut Hill option gave seventh and eight graders the option to attend Norris (3.3 miles distant), Lewis and Clark (2.5 miles) or Tech (1.3 miles).  The defendants urge that this was \"reasonable and necessary\" because the junior high to which the Walnut Hill students would ordinarily have been assigned, Monroe, was overcrowded.  This is a non sequitur.  The school board consistently defended its actions throughout trial on the basis of geographical zoning.  If the children from Walnut Hill could not be assigned to the most logical school, Monroe, the next most logical school was surely not Norris or Lewis and Clark, but the considerably closer and underutilized Tech.  At the very least, the overcrowded nature of Monroe does not provide a reason for the defendants' decision to assign no part of the Walnut Hill attendance area exclusively to Tech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Saunders option gave seventh and eighth graders the option to attend Tech (1 mile), Norris (2.2 miles) or Lewis and Clark (2.5 miles) in 1964-65.  The District Court found this \"reasonable and necessary\" because \" enrollments at Technical Junior High were up and enrollments at Lewis and Clark were down.\"  Omaha II, supra 389 F.Supp. at 307.  The record is to the contrary.  It shows that, in 1964-65, Lewis and Clark was operating with 88 students less than stated capacity and Tech was down 142 students from stated capacity.  The 25 to 30 seventh and eighth graders from Saunders could easily have been absorbed at the much nearer Tech Junior High.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that the reasons advanced by the school district to justify the adoption of optional attendance zones for seventh and eighth graders in the predominantly white elementary zones on the border of the black community are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that, from 1951-73, thirty-nine new schools or additions were constructed, of which thirty-seven opened either predominantly black or white, and that all twenty-one buildings or additions constructed from 1964 through 1973 opened either predominantly white or black.  More specifically, between 1951 and 1973, nineteen schools opened 100% White, fourteen more opened 98% White, and two more opened 93% Or more white.  At the same time, two new structures opened 94% Or more black, one opened 82% Black, and one opened 71% Black.  Only one school in the twenty-two year span opened as truly integrated; that was Indian Hill elementary school, with 28% Black enrollment, and that school is located in an area of the city which is entirely separate from the major black community in the \"Near North Side.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A specific example of the racial impact of the building policies was the construction of Martin Luther King Middle School.  Clifton Hill seventh graders (predominantly black) had traditionally attended majority white Monroe Junior High.  After King was constructed, they were reassigned to that school, which opened 82% Black.  Leaders in the black community protested against this segregative impact and appellants sought a preliminary injunction in this action to restrain the building of King.  In its order denying the preliminary injunction, the District Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>* * * The evidence supports the view that apparently some white students live closer to King than do blacks, yet those whites are allowed to go to a predominantly white school while requiring blacks who live farther from King, to attend that institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Omaha I, supra 367 F.Supp. at 185.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the foregoing record, the evidence was sufficient to establish a presumption of segregative intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Nothing in the record served to rebut that presumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>E. THE DETERIORATION OF TECH HIGH SCHOOL</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1973-74, Tech High had an enrollment which was 96% Black.  Because it shared a common attendance zone with Central the only joint attendance zone in the District no student had to attend Tech High.  Only 710 students chose to enroll in that year, despite its capacity of 2,475.  It was the black high school in Omaha.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tech High is located in a white neighborhood, close to the southern boundary of the black community.  It opened in 1923 as a vocational and college prep school.  From 1936-45, it had the largest student body in the District, with a peak of 3,771, and it was predominantly white.  Starting in 1950, the black enrollment at the school increased markedly, from 17% In 1950 to 51% In 1963 to 96% In 1973.  Simultaneously, it experienced a steady decline in total enrollment.  The District Court found that, during this period, Tech developed a large unused capacity at the same time as South and Benson were seriously overcrowded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  The school board's solution to overcrowding in adjacent predominantly white high schools was to construct additions at Benson, North and South in the late 1950's and early 1960's, and to build Bryan, Burke and Northwest High schools.  Boundary adjustments were necessary when the three new schools opened, just as they would have been if space at Tech had been used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the initial reasons for the adoption of the joint Central/Tech attendance zone, there was evidence that Tech's continued status as a school which no one had to attend was at least in part due to perceived white community opposition to a compulsory attendance zone which would force them to send their children to a black Tech High.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  The result of the joint attendance zone was that, in 1973-74, only twenty-two white students attended Tech, despite the fact that all of the white high school students in the District could have chosen to attend Tech under the \"open school\" policy, and despite the fact that the Tech/Central zone encompassed all or part of twelve identifiably white elementary attendance areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the enrollment at Tech declined, and the proportion of black students increased, certain course offerings were dropped, and extracurricular activities were curtailed.  In particular, electronics was dropped from the curriculum, and its instructor was transferred to predominantly white Benson, which was located in an adjacent attendance area and was overcrowded.  At the same time, courses which the school board felt would be more adequately suited to the needs of Tech's increasingly black enrollment, including culinary arts and auto body shop, were added to the curriculum.  Simultaneously, Tech began to serve growing numbers of \"special education\" students.  The criteria used by the defendants to place such students in Tech was an IQ below 85, \"emotional problems,\" and difficulty in learning.  Many of these students were disruptive and presented disciplinary problems.  At a minimum, of 1,170 students enrolled at Tech in 1970-71, 244 students (21%) were special education students.  Only two other high schools had such students in that year: North with 4% And South with 2%.  By 1973, the Committee for the Future of Technical High School reported in one of its memoranda: \"The consensus was that we now are (a school for special education) except in name.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1971-72, Tech High was in a state of disrepair, was ungovernable, and was 91% Black.  After protests of various kinds, the District repaired and renovated it, changed faculty assignments, and altered the curriculum to offer more individualized instruction.  Despite the attempt to shore it up, the preferred recommendation of the Committee for the Future of Technical High School in 1973 was: \"Close the school disperse the students.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that the steady decline in enrollment, the constant and severe overcrowding at neighboring schools, and the increasingly black makeup of Tech were known to the administration of the Omaha public schools.  The court further found that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>* * * Mr. Carl Palmquist, the principal at Technical during the 1950's and 1960's, repeatedly notified the Superintendent of Schools and his staff orally and in writing that Technical was in danger of becoming an all-black school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Omaha II, supra 389 F.Supp. at 308.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the court found that the increasingly segregated nature of Tech High school was not evidence of segregative intent because the defendants showed \"a determination * * * to upgrade both the physical plant and the quality of education at this school.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming the validity of the court's factual finding that the District sought throughout the 1960's and 1970's to provide an excellent education at Technical,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> the court's conclusion that no segregative intent was shown by the board's actions with respect to Tech High school was premised, at least in part, on the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" educational facilities.  This has not been the law since Brown v. Board of Education and \"(t)he law can never afford to bend in this direction again.\"  Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier County, Ark., supra 410 F.2d at 926.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By focusing on the quality of education at Tech High, the District Court gave insufficient weight to the fact that the defendants' actions in setting up a joint Tech/Central zone, in making Tech a special education school \"except in name,\" in deleting attractive vocational courses such as electronics from the curriculum and substituting courses aimed at meeting black stereotypes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> in permitting Tech's enrollment to dip far below capacity, and in assigning most of the black high school teachers to Tech, all combined to result in a high school which was identified as \"a 'colored school' just as certainly as if the words were printed across its entrance in six-inch letters.\"  Kelley v. Altheimer, Arkansas Public School Dist. No. 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"276176\"><a href=\"/opinion/276176/moses-kelley-on-behalf-of-himself-and-his-minor-children-moses-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 491 (8th Cir. 1967), Quoting Brown v.

The result of the defendants' actions in these instances, given the assignment of students to Tech by choice, was not just natural, probable and foreseeable, it was inevitable: a virtually all black and relatively empty school.

We, therefore, remand to the District Court with instructions to it to take those steps necessary to bring about a thoroughly integrated school system in accordance with the guidelines and the timetable set forth below.  We recognize that integration will be difficult.  The pain of transition is an unfortunate, but inevitable result of deliberate policies which have isolated black Americans from the schools and residential communities<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> of white Americans.  Fortunately, the present board of education has indicated a disposition to move toward an integrated school system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  We are confident that, when it understands fully the additional steps that need to be taken to achieve integration, it will take those steps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

The burdens of integration shall be borne as equally as possible by blacks and whites in all geographic areas of the District.  Because substantial changes in student assignments will be required, and because some schools were damaged by a recent tornado, the planning and implementation of student integration may be done in phases, so long as the ultimate deadline is achieved.  Plans for the first phase shall be submitted to the District Court for approval within forty-five days of the issuance of this Court's mandate.

In 1971-72, 80% Of the whites in the District could not possibly have obtained a \"segregative transfer,\" since they already attended schools less than 10% Black.  Since 2.5% Of the total white pool did obtain such transfers, one out of every eight white students who Could seek a \"segregative transfer\" obtained one.  Moreover, the figures for the predominantly black schools show that a much higher proportion of the whites assigned to those schools were fleeing by means of the transfer policy.

First, as the District Court found, the school board granted some transfer requests which were explicitly based on racial factors.  For example, the following requests for transfers were granted:</p>\n        <p>My daughter, Alice, is now going to Clifton Hill School.  I would like to request a transfer for her to Fontenelle School for the next school term.  She said the reason she wants to transfer is because there are too many Negroe (sic) children in her class.  * * *</p>\n        <p>* * * (Request permission to attend Sherman instead of Mann) Because its (sic) a good school and I don't think it right for a girl to go to a considerable Negro school without some of her friends * * *.</p>\n        <p>Compare Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, supra at 520.</p>\n        <p>Second, in 1969, two years before the white student flight shown in the evidence, concern over the obviously segregative effect of the transfer policy had caused Legislative Bill 1042 to be introduced into the Nebraska Legislature.  That bill, which died in committee, would have prohibited racially segregative transfers in the Omaha School District.  The assistant superintendent in charge of administering the transfer policy, Dr. Hlavac, appeared before a committee of the legislature to testify in opposition to the bill.</p>\n        <p>Third, despite the capacity limitation in the transfer policy, large numbers of white students were allowed to transfer to South High from the Tech/Central zone at a time when Tech had unused capacity of close to 1,000 and South was seriously overcrowded.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In 1963-64, only fourteen of the original forty-six K-8 schools had not been converted to K-6.

All or part of their zones were assigned exclusively to one or more nearby junior high schools (not Mann or Tech), and no optional attendance zones were created.  The remaining seven K-8 schools were the ones discussed in the text located so that the nearest junior high was Mann or Tech.

Thus, the difference between a 63% Black Tech Junior High and a 91% Black Tech was directly attributable to the combination of the two policies of special transfers and optional zoning.

But all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation.  * * *</p>\n        <p>* * * \"Racially neutral\" assignment plans proposed by school authorities to a district court may be inadequate * * * (w)hen school authorities present a district court with a \"loaded game board\" * * *.</p>\n        <p>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282.  Hence as a practical matter, in Omaha as well as in other large metropolitan areas, \"(d)esegregation plans cannot be limited to the walk-in school.\"  Id. at 30, 91 S.Ct. at 1283.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
