Litscher, Secretary of the Wisconsin\nDepartment of Corrections, in his official capacity,\nand DONALD G. BANEY, JOANNE BARTON, THOMAS\nBORGEN, KEVIN CANNON, JASON MacPHETRIDGE,\nCLYDE MAXWELL, ERIN RICHARDS and JESS ROONEY\nin their personal capacities,\n\nDefendants-Appellees.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Wisconsin.\nNo. 00 C-0401 C--Barbara B. Crabb, Chief Judge.\n\nArgued January 11, 2001--Decided August 15, 2001\n\n\n  Before Flaum, Chief Judge, and Cudahy and\nPosner, Circuit Judges.\n\n  Cudahy, Circuit Judge. Cedric R. Johnson\nappeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 1983 complaint against members of\nthe Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n(DOC). The district court concluded that\nJohnson had not exhausted his\nadministrative remedies pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. sec. 1997e(a) and dismissed the\ncomplaint without prejudice. We affirm.\n\n  Johnson, an inmate in the Wisconsin\nprison system, won a lawsuit against the\nDOC’s director of health services for\nunreasonably refusing to authorize a\nliver transplant for Johnson. After his\nsuccess, Johnson was harassed repeatedly\nby DOC officials./1 Correctional\nofficers were hostile toward Johnson and\ndramatically increased the number of\nconduct reports issued against him. The\nlarge number of reports ultimately\nresulted in Johnson’s transfer to a\nmaximum security prison. Johnson filed a\ncomplaint charging the defendants with\nretaliating against him for exercising\nhis First Amendment right to bring a suit\nrelated to his confinement. Johnson\nsought compensatory damages and a\n\fpreliminary injunction prohibiting DOC\nfrom transferring him to the maximum\nsecurity prison. The district court\ndenied Johnson’s motion for an injunction\nand--concluding that Johnson had not\nexhausted his administrative remedies--\ndismissed Johnson’s action without\nprejudice.\n\nI.\n\n  In the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996) (PLRA),\nCongress imposed an exhaustion\nrequirement on suits by prison inmates.\nThus, 42 U.S.C. sec. 1997e(a) provides:\n\"No action shall be brought with respect\nto prison conditions under section 1983\nof this title, or any other Federal law,\nby a prisoner confined in any jail,\nprison, or other correctional facility\nuntil such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted.\" Johnson argues\nthat his action is not subject to the\nexhaustion requirement of sec. 1997e(a)\nbecause it is not an action \"with respect\nto prison conditions.\" Prior to our\ndecision in Smith v. Zachary, 2001 WL\n723010 (7th Cir. June 28, 2001), there\nwas room for this argument. But there is\nno longer.\n\n  Courts have divided sharply on the issue\nwhether the term \"prison conditions\"\nincorporates discrete tortious acts like\nharassment, beatings and other kinds of\nexcessive force. The Third and Sixth\nCircuits have concluded that excessive\nforce and assault claims are subject to\nsec. 1997e(a)’s exhaustion requirement.\nSee Booth v. Churner, 206 F.3d 289, 293-\n98 (3d Cir. 2000),/2 aff’d on other\ngrounds, 121 S.Ct. 1819 (2001); Freeman\nv. Francis, 196 F.3d 641, 643-44 (6th\nCir. 1999). The Second Circuit has held\nto the contrary. See Nussle v. Willette,\n224 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2000), cert.\ngranted sub nom. Porter v. Nussle, 121\nS.Ct. 2213 (2001). Our court recently\ncame down on the inclusive side of the\ndebate, ruling that \"prison conditions\"\ndoes indeed include beatings by prison\nguards. In Smith, a prison inmate had\nfiled a suit for allegedly being beaten\nby prison guards in retaliation for\nparticipating in a prison riot. He failed\nto exhaust the administrative review\nprocess prescribed for the complained-of\naction, but argued that the sec. 1997e(a)\nexhaustion requirement does not apply to\n\fbeatings by prison guards because, inter\nalia, beatings are not \"prison\nconditions.\" This court found his\nargument unpersuasive, and ultimately\nconcluded that \"[i]n the context of\nprisons, harassment from correctional\nofficers or government officials is not\nequivalent to an unsolicited attack on\nthe street; rather, the harassment is\nmade possible by the correctional\nenvironment. Thus, a remedy lies in\naddressing prison conditions that\nfacilities [sic] or tolerates aberrant\nbehavior by guards.\" Smith, 2001 WL\n723010 at *2. Therefore, we reasoned,\nisolated incidents of harassment or of\nassault by prison officials are \"prison\nconditions\" within the meaning of the\nPLRA exhaustion requirement. This is, of\ncourse, binding precedent.\n\n  Although Johnson’s claims are slightly\ndifferent from a claim of assault or\nexcessive force (because he alleges\nretaliation of a different sort for the\nexercise of his First Amendment rights)\nthe reasoning of Smith still applies.\nActs of individual prison officials\noutside the scope of official prison\npolicy, whether governed by the Eighth\nAmendment or the First, are within the\nrealm of \"harassment made possible by the\ncorrectional environment,\" and thus\nsubject to the exhaustion requirement.\nSee id. The Supreme Court in its\nforthcoming review of the Second\nCircuit’s Nussle decision may resolve the\ndebate among the circuits on what has\nbeen a hotly contested issue, but for\nnow, in this circuit, Smith is\ndefinitive. Thus, Johnson’s complaints\nmust be deemed allegations about \"prison\nconditions\" within the meaning of the\nPLRA.\n\nII.\n\n  Johnson makes the further argument that\nthe exhaustion requirement does not apply\nto him because no administrative remedy\nis available. For the exhaustion\nrequirement to apply, there must be some\nadministrative remedy to exhaust. See\nPerez v. Wisconsin Dep’t of Corr., 182\nF.3d 532, 537 (7th Cir. 1999). Johnson\nargues that no remedy is open to him\nbecause the DOC’s administrative remedy\nprogram--the Inmate Complaint Review\nSystem (ICRS)--does not address claims of\nthe nature of this one.\n\f  Wisconsin Administrative Code sec.\n310.08, which defines the scope of the\nICRS, provides that inmates may bring\ncomplaints \"to raise significant issues\nregarding rules, living conditions, and\nstaff actions affecting institution envi\nronment . . . .\" sec. 310.08(2) (emphasis\nadded). Section 310.08 outlines various\nexceptions for which the ICRS is not\navailable, including challenges to a\n\"program review committee’s decision\" and\n\"[t]he subject matter of a conduct report\n. . . .\" sec. 310.08(2)(a) & (b)./3\nJohnson first argues that he could not\nbring his complaint under sec. 310.08\nbecause the portion of the explanatory\nappendix relevant to this subsection\nlimits this remedy to challenges of\n\"institutional polic[ies] or\npractice[s].\" sec. 310 App., at n.310.08.\nThe defendants counter that sec. 310.08\nis not intended to be exhaustive; it\nsimply provides guidance as to the types\nof challenges that are covered by the\nICRS.\n\n  The note to sec. 310.08 in the appendix\nin some respects tends to support\nJohnson’s argument, since neither he nor\nthe defendants argue that it is the DOC’s\ninstitutional policy or practice to\nretaliate against prison inmates for the\nexercise of their First Amendment rights.\nHowever, the language of the appendix\nnote does not indicate that the ICRS\nsystem is limited to addressing\ninstitutional policies and practices; in\nfact, the note states that \"[t]he scope\nof the grievance system is wide.\" Id.\nFurther, it is apparent that claims\nchallenging conditions other than\ninstitutional policies are eligible for\nthe grievance system. See Davis v.\nWoehrer, 32 F.Supp.2d 1078 (E.D. Wis.\n1999), appeal dismissed, 227 F.3d 759\n(7th Cir. 2000). In Davis, a prisoner\nfiled a civil rights complaint charging\nthat the defendants had violated his\nEighth Amendment right to be free from\ncruel and unusual punishment by ordering\nhim to operate a meat slicer without\nappropriate training. Id. at 1078. The\ndistrict court ruled in favor of the\ninmate, but on the grounds that the ICRS\ncould not provide monetary relief to\nprisoners and that was the only relief\nthe prisoner was seeking./4 But the\ncourt did not question whether there was\nany sec. 310.08 administrative remedy\n\favailable to the inmate under the ICRS;\nthat appeared to be a given. And the\ncomplaint in that case arguably cannot be\ncalled a challenge to an \"institutional\npolicy or practice,\"/5 the limitation\nJohnson alleges exists in the ICRS\nsystem.\n\n  And in Moore v. Stahowiak, 212 Wis.2d\n744, 569 N.W.2d 711 (Ct. App. 1997), the\ncourt dismissed an inmate’s petition for\na writ of mandamus against a prison\nrecord custo-dian demanding a copy of a\nprison policy on the grounds that he\nfailed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies. The court concluded that sec.\n310.08 provided an administrative remedy.\nThus, it necessarily concluded that sec.\n310.08 was available for grievances that\ndo not address \"institutional policies\nand practices,\" because a writ of\nmandamus challenges the failure to comply\nwith a policy--not the policy itself.\nJohnson has failed to adequately counter\nthe assumptions that arise from the plain\nlanguage of the statute, as well as the\nconclusions reached in Davis and Moore.\n\n  Johnson also argues that his appeal of\nthe transfer to the maximum security\nprison has no available administra-tive\nremedy. He argues that 1) Wis. Adm. Code\nsec. DOC 302.19(9), which provides for\nappeals of decisions respecting \"program\nassignments,\" does not apply to prison\ntransfers, and 2) Wis. Adm. Code sec. DOC\n302.20, which governs inter-prison\ntransfers, contains no appeal provision.\nIt is probably true that Johnson cannot\nuse these avenues to appeal the prison\ntransfer decision, but we need not\nexplore the point. He does not tell us\nwhy prison transfers cannot be within the\nscope of sec. 310.08. We see no reason\nwhy they cannot. Further, if for some\nreason they are not within the scope of\nsec. 310.08, the Supreme Court’s recent\ndecision in Booth v. Churner indicates\nthat a prison grievance system’s\ninability to prevent a prison transfer\ndoes not obviate the need for exhaustion.\nSee 121 S.Ct. 1819, 1821, 1825 (2001)\n(holding that prisoners must exhaust\nadministrative remedies, even when the\nparticular remedy sought cannot be\nobtained through the prison grievance\nsystem). Because Johnson’s challenge to\nthe prison transfer is part of his claim\nof retaliatory conduct and because that\nclaim has an available administrative\n\fvehicle for redress, we cannot excuse him\nfrom the exhaustion requirement.\n\n  If the ICRS system should fail to\naddress Johnson’s claim, that will\nconstitute exhaustion, and he may then\nbring his claim to federal court.\n\nIII.\n\n  The defendants argue that Johnson is\nlimited to habeas corpus relief on this\nclaim. In Heck v. Humphrey, the Supreme\nCourt ruled that a prisoner is barred\nfrom pursuing a sec. 1983 claim when \"a\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff would\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of his\nconviction or sentence.\" 512 U.S. 477,\n487 (1994). This includes challenges to\nthe fact or duration of confinement. See\nid. at 481-82. In Edwards v. Balisok, the\nCourt extended this holding to prison\ndisciplinary proceedings, holding that a\nprisoner was barred from bringing a sec.\n1983 suit that would nec-essarily imply\nthe invalidity of a loss of good time\ncredits. 520 U.S. 641, 646 (1997).\nJohnson adequately distinguishes those\ncases, along with our decision in Evans\nv. McBride, 94 F.3d 1062 (7th Cir. 1996),\non the grounds that they all involved\ndirect challenges to convictions or\ndisciplinary findings, while his claim\ninvolves a challenge to a course of\nretaliatory conduct, only part of which\ninvolved disciplinary action.\nParticularly supportive of Johnson’s\nclaim is our decision in DeWalt v.\nCarter, 224 F.3d 607 (7th Cir. 2000), in\nwhich we said that Heck and Edwards do\nnot bar prisoners’ sec. 1983 claims\nunless they are, in effect, challenges to\nthe fact or duration of the prisoner’s\nconfinement.\n\n  The defendants contend that Johnson in\nthis claim is necessarily challenging the\nvalidity of at least some of his conduct\nreports. The defendants distinguish\nDeWalt on two bases: 1) that here,\nJohnson is in fact challenging the\nduration of his confinement and 2) that\nhere, unlike in DeWalt, Johnson would be\nable to challenge the retaliatory actions\nthrough a petition for habeas corpus. But\nthe only challenge to the duration of\nJohnson’s confinement that the defendants\ncan actually identify here is one item\nfrom Johnson’s original complaint in the\ndistrict court: \"In addition, the\n\fpenalties tied to the increase in conduct\nreports has caused plaintiff to lose\n’good time’ and has therefore extended\nthe date for his mandatory release.\" But\nthis is not the crux of Johnson’s\ncomplaint; rather, the complaint states\nthat \"he has received penalties greatly\nin excess of those imposed on similarly\nsituated inmates\" and as a result has\nbeen ordered to serve more than 260 days\nin segregation, and to be scheduled to be\ntransferred to a maximum-security prison.\nFinding for Johnson would not\n\"necessarily imply the invalidity of his\nconviction or sentence,\" see Heck, 512\nU.S. at 487; nor would it necessarily\nimply the invalidity of the conduct\nreports, see Edwards, 520 U.S. at 646-47.\nIt also would not necessarily result in a\nrevocation of his conduct reports or a\nrestoration of the lost good time.\nJohnson’s claims challenge much more than\nthe fact that the conduct reports were\nundeserved; he is also arguing that they\nare excessive in number. It is the act of\ndiscipline that constitutes the\nretaliatory conduct--a separate issue\nfrom whether Johnson was, in fact, guilty\nof the conduct alleged in the reports.\nJohnson seeks monetary damages and an\ninjunction preventing his transfer to a\nmaximum security prison, not a reduction\nin his sentence.\n\n  Further, it appears that habeas relief\nwould not be available to Johnson in a\nchallenge to the prison transfer. Pischke\nv. Litscher holds that habeas corpus\ncould not be used to challenge a transfer\nbetween prisons \"unless the custody in\nwhich the transferred prisoner will find\nhimself when transferred is so much more\nrestrictive than his former custody that\nthe transfer can fairly be said to have\nbrought about what in Graham we called ’a\nquantum change in the level of custody.’\"\n178 F.3d 497, 499 (7th Cir. 1999)\n(quoting Graham v. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379,\n381 (7th Cir. 1991) (defining \"quantum\nchange\" as \"outright freedom, or freedom\nsubject to the limited reporting and\nfinancial constraints of bond or parole\nor probation, or the run of the prison in\ncontrast to the approximation to solitary\nconfinement that is disciplinary\nsegregation\")). We have seen nothing to\nindicate that the transfer to maximum\nsecurity in this case represents such a\nquantum change. But perhaps it is a close\nenough question that, were it really\n\fbefore us, we would have to remand for\nfurther development of the record. That\nwe need not do, however, because we\nconclude that Heck and Edwards do not\napply to Johnson’s claim.\n\nIV.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment\nof the district court is Affirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n/1 We are viewing the facts in the light most\nfavorable to Johnson. See Hentosh v. Herman M.\nFinch Univ. of Health Sciences/The Chicago Med.\nSch., 167 F.3d 1170, 1173 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n/2 In dissenting from the Third Circuit panel,\nSenior Circuit Judge John Noonan of the Ninth\nCircuit, sitting by designation, protested that,\n\"A punch in the jaw in prison is not ’prison\nconditions.’ A punch in the jaw is an act . . .\n. That Churner’s alleged blow took place in a\nprison does not make it ’prison conditions.’\" 206\nF.3d at 301 (Noonan, J. dissenting).\n\n/3 The ICRS also permits prisoners to file civil\nrights complaints in the ICRS. But, as the gov-\nernment concedes, this avenue is unavailable to\nJohnson. See Wis. Adm. Code sec. 310.08(7).\n\"[C]ivil rights complaints\" is defined as com-\nplaints in which an inmate \"alleges discrimina-\ntion on the basis of race, creed, ethnicity,\nnational origin, sex, handicap, age, religion,\ncolor, ancestry, sexual orientation or marital\nstatus.\" Wis. Adm. Code sec. 310.03(7). Johnson\ndoes not bring a discrimination claim.\n\n/4 The Supreme Court has recently rejected this\napproach, holding that prisoners seeking only\nmonetary relief still must exhaust administrative\nremedies that do not provide such relief. Booth\nv. Churner, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 1821, 1825 (2001).\n\n/5 Whether it was an official prison policy to order\ninmates to operate meat slicers without appropri-\nate training is unclear from the opinion in that\ncase. However, we think it likely that this was\nnot an official policy, and that this challenge\nwould likely not be classified as a challenge to\nan \"institutional policy or practice.\"\n\f",

Wisconsin Dep’t of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765028\"><a href=\"/opinion/765028/eduardo-m-perez-v-wisconsin-department-of-corrections-and-michael-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (7th Cir. 1999). Johnson\nargues that no remedy is open to him\nbecause the DOC’s administrative remedy\nprogram--the Inmate Complaint Review\nSystem (ICRS)--does not address claims of\nthe nature of this one.\n\f  Wisconsin Administrative Code sec.\n310.08, which defines the scope of the\nICRS, provides that inmates may bring\ncomplaints \"to raise significant issues\nregarding rules, living conditions, and\nstaff actions affecting institution envi\nronment . . . .\" sec. 310.08(2) (emphasis\nadded). Section 310.08 outlines various\nexceptions for which the ICRS is not\navailable, including challenges to a\n\"program review committee’s decision\" and\n\"[t]he subject matter of a conduct report\n. . . .\" sec. 310.08(2)(a) & (b)./3\nJohnson first argues that he could not\nbring his complaint under sec. 310.08\nbecause the portion of the explanatory\nappendix relevant to this subsection\nlimits this remedy to challenges of\n\"institutional polic[ies] or\npractice[s].\" sec. 310 App., at n.310.08.\nThe defendants counter that sec. 310.08\nis not intended to be exhaustive; it\nsimply provides guidance as to the types\nof challenges that are covered by the\nICRS.\n\n  The note to sec. 310.08 in the appendix\nin some respects tends to support\nJohnson’s argument, since neither he nor\nthe defendants argue that it is the DOC’s\ninstitutional policy or practice to\nretaliate against prison inmates for the\nexercise of their First Amendment rights.\nHowever, the language of the appendix\nnote does not indicate that the ICRS\nsystem is limited to addressing\ninstitutional policies and practices; in\nfact, the note states that \"[t]he scope\nof the grievance system is wide.\" Id.\nFurther, it is apparent that claims\nchallenging conditions other than\ninstitutional policies are eligible for\nthe grievance system. See Davis v.\nWoehrer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2338151\"><a href=\"/opinion/2338151/davis-v-woehrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In Davis, a prisoner\nfiled a civil rights complaint charging\nthat the defendants had violated his\nEighth Amendment right to be free from\ncruel and unusual punishment by ordering\nhim to operate a meat slicer without\nappropriate training. Id. at 1078. The\ndistrict court ruled in favor of the\ninmate, but on the grounds that the ICRS\ncould not provide monetary relief to\nprisoners and that was the only relief\nthe prisoner was seeking./4 But the\ncourt did not question whether there was\nany sec. 310.08 administrative remedy\n\favailable to the inmate under the ICRS;\nthat appeared to be a given. And the\ncomplaint in that case arguably cannot be\ncalled a challenge to an \"institutional\npolicy or practice,\"/5 the limitation\nJohnson alleges exists in the ICRS\nsystem.\n\n  And in Moore v. Stahowiak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1833995\"><a href=\"/opinion/1833995/moore-v-stahowiak/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1833995\"><a href=\"/opinion/1833995/moore-v-stahowiak/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ct. App. 1997), the\ncourt dismissed an inmate’s petition for\na writ of mandamus against a prison\nrecord custo-dian demanding a copy of a\nprison policy on the grounds that he\nfailed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies. The court concluded that sec.\n310.08 provided an administrative remedy.\nThus, it necessarily concluded that sec.\n310.08 was available for grievances that\ndo not address \"institutional policies\nand practices,\" because a writ of\nmandamus challenges the failure to comply\nwith a policy--not the policy itself.\nJohnson has failed to adequately counter\nthe assumptions that arise from the plain\nlanguage of the statute, as well as the\nconclusions reached in Davis and Moore.\n\n  Johnson also argues that his appeal of\nthe transfer to the maximum security\nprison has no available administra-tive\nremedy. He argues that 1) Wis. Adm. Code\nsec. DOC 302.19(9), which provides for\nappeals of decisions respecting \"program\nassignments,\" does not apply to prison\ntransfers, and 2) Wis. Adm. Code sec. DOC\n302.20, which governs inter-prison\ntransfers, contains no appeal provision.\nIt is probably true that Johnson cannot\nuse these avenues to appeal the prison\ntransfer decision, but we need not\nexplore the point. He does not tell us\nwhy prison transfers cannot be within the\nscope of sec. 310.08. We see no reason\nwhy they cannot. Further, if for some\nreason they are not within the scope of\nsec. 310.08, the Supreme Court’s recent\ndecision in Booth v. Churner indicates\nthat a prison grievance system’s\ninability to prevent a prison transfer\ndoes not obviate the need for exhaustion.\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118434\"><a href=\"/opinion/118434/booth-v-churner/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because Johnson’s challenge to\nthe prison transfer is part of his claim\nof retaliatory conduct and because that\nclaim has an available administrative\n\fvehicle for redress, we cannot excuse him\nfrom the exhaustion requirement.\n\n  If the ICRS system should fail to\naddress Johnson’s claim, that will\nconstitute exhaustion, and he may then\nbring his claim to federal court.\n\nIII.\n\n  The defendants argue that Johnson is\nlimited to habeas corpus relief on this\nclaim. In Heck v. Humphrey, the Supreme\nCourt ruled that a prisoner is barred\nfrom pursuing a sec. 1983 claim when \"a\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff would\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of his\nconviction or sentence.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n487 (1994). This includes challenges to\nthe fact or duration of confinement. See\nid. at 481-82. In Edwards v. Balisok, the\nCourt extended this holding to prison\ndisciplinary proceedings, holding that a\nprisoner was barred from bringing a sec.\n1983 suit that would nec-essarily imply\nthe invalidity of a loss of good time\ncredits. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118112\"><a href=\"/opinion/118112/edwards-v-balisok/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646 (1997).\nJohnson adequately distinguishes those\ncases, along with our decision in Evans\nv. McBride, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725527\"><a href=\"/opinion/725527/ronald-w-evans-plaintiffpetitioner-appellant-v-daniel-r-mcbride/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1062</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1996),\non the grounds that they all involved\ndirect challenges to convictions or\ndisciplinary findings, while his claim\ninvolves a challenge to a course of\nretaliatory conduct, only part of which\ninvolved disciplinary action.\nParticularly supportive of Johnson’s\nclaim is our decision in DeWalt v.\nCarter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770154\"><a href=\"/opinion/770154/anthony-dewalt-v-lamark-carter-correctional-officer-young-carol-biester/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2000), in\nwhich we said that Heck and Edwards do\nnot bar prisoners’ sec. 1983 claims\nunless they are, in effect, challenges to\nthe fact or duration of the prisoner’s\nconfinement.\n\n  The defendants contend that Johnson in\nthis claim is necessarily challenging the\nvalidity of at least some of his conduct\nreports. The defendants distinguish\nDeWalt on two bases: 1) that here,\nJohnson is in fact challenging the\nduration of his confinement and 2) that\nhere, unlike in DeWalt, Johnson would be\nable to challenge the retaliatory actions\nthrough a petition for habeas corpus. But\nthe only challenge to the duration of\nJohnson’s confinement that the defendants\ncan actually identify here is one item\nfrom Johnson’s original complaint in the\ndistrict court: \"In addition, the\n\fpenalties tied to the increase in conduct\nreports has caused plaintiff to lose\n’good time’ and has therefore extended\nthe date for his mandatory release.\" But\nthis is not the crux of Johnson’s\ncomplaint; rather, the complaint states\nthat \"he has received penalties greatly\nin excess of those imposed on similarly\nsituated inmates\" and as a result has\nbeen ordered to serve more than 260 days\nin segregation, and to be scheduled to be\ntransferred to a maximum-security prison.\nFinding for Johnson would not\n\"necessarily imply the invalidity of his\nconviction or sentence,\" see Heck, 512\nU.S. at 487; nor would it necessarily\nimply the invalidity of the conduct\nreports, see Edwards, 520 U.S. at 646-47.\nIt also would not necessarily result in a\nrevocation of his conduct reports or a\nrestoration of the lost good time.\nJohnson’s claims challenge much more than\nthe fact that the conduct reports were\nundeserved; he is also arguing that they\nare excessive in number. It is the act of\ndiscipline that constitutes the\nretaliatory conduct--a separate issue\nfrom whether Johnson was, in fact, guilty\nof the conduct alleged in the reports.\nJohnson seeks monetary damages and an\ninjunction preventing his transfer to a\nmaximum security prison, not a reduction\nin his sentence.\n\n  Further, it appears that habeas relief\nwould not be available to Johnson in a\nchallenge to the prison transfer. Pischke\nv. Litscher holds that habeas corpus\ncould not be used to challenge a transfer\nbetween prisons \"unless the custody in\nwhich the transferred prisoner will find\nhimself when transferred is so much more\nrestrictive than his former custody that\nthe transfer can fairly be said to have\nbrought about what in Graham we called ’a\nquantum change in the level of custody.’\"\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764407\"><a href=\"/opinion/764407/keith-e-pischke-v-jon-e-litscher-secretary-of-the-wisconsin-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (7th Cir. 1999)\n(quoting Graham v.

We have seen nothing to\nindicate that the transfer to maximum\nsecurity in this case represents such a\nquantum change. But perhaps it is a close\nenough question that, were it really\n\fbefore us, we would have to remand for\nfurther development of the record. That\nwe need not do, however, because we\nconclude that Heck and Edwards do not\napply to Johnson’s claim.\n\nIV.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment\nof the district court is Affirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n/1 We are viewing the facts in the light most\nfavorable to Johnson. See Hentosh v. Herman M.\nFinch Univ. of Health Sciences/The Chicago Med.\nSch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761745\"><a href=\"/opinion/761745/patricia-hentosh-phd-v-herman-m-finch-university-of-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n/2 In dissenting from the Third Circuit panel,\nSenior Circuit Judge John Noonan of the Ninth\nCircuit, sitting by designation, protested that,\n\"A punch in the jaw in prison is not ’prison\nconditions.’ A punch in the jaw is an act . . .\n. That Churner’s alleged blow took place in a\nprison does not make it ’prison conditions.’\" 206\nF.3d at 301 (Noonan, J. dissenting).\n\n/3 The ICRS also permits prisoners to file civil\nrights complaints in the ICRS. But, as the gov-\nernment concedes, this avenue is unavailable to\nJohnson. See Wis. Adm. Code sec. 310.08(7).\n\"[C]ivil rights complaints\" is defined as com-\nplaints in which an inmate \"alleges discrimina-\ntion on the basis of race, creed, ethnicity,\nnational origin, sex, handicap, age, religion,\ncolor, ancestry, sexual orientation or marital\nstatus.\" Wis. Adm. Code sec. 310.03(7). Johnson\ndoes not bring a discrimination claim.\n\n/4 The Supreme Court has recently rejected this\napproach, holding that prisoners seeking only\nmonetary relief still must exhaust administrative\nremedies that do not provide such relief.
