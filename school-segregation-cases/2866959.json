INTRODUCTION\n\n          This appeal involves a controversy over City of Farrell\n\nmunicipal income taxes that Sharon Steel Corporation withheld\n\nfrom its employees' wages.   After withholding the amounts in\n\ndispute, Sharon Steel filed for protection under Chapter 11 of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code and thus did not remit the funds to the city.\n\nThe City of Farrell subsequently initiated this action in the\n\nbankruptcy court to collect the unpaid taxes withheld.   The\n\nbankruptcy court and the district court denied the City's request\n\nfor an order requiring Sharon Steel to remit the withheld funds.\n\nWe will reverse the district court's order, and we will remand\n\fthe case to the district court for the proceedings we outline in\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n         II.     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          Sharon Steel has its main plant and principal place of\n\nbusiness in the City of Farrell, Mercer County, Pennsylvania.     In\n\n1967 the city, pursuant to section 13 of the Pennsylvania Local\n\nTax Enabling Act, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, § 6913\n\n(1972), enacted a tax (Ordinance No. 0-17-66) on the earned\n\nincome and net profits of all residents and non-residents\n\nemployed or conducting business within the city.    Under the\n\nordinance and Pennsylvania law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, § 6913\n\nIV, employers located in the City of Farrell must withhold taxes\n\non locally earned income from the wages of any employee subject\n\nto the city income tax and must remit those taxes in quarterly\n\npayments to the city.\n\n          For the fourth quarter of 1992, Sharon Steel withheld\n\n$56,831.99 in City of Farrell income tax.    On November 30, 1992,\n\nSharon Steel filed its petition under Chapter 11 of the\n\nBankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nWestern District of Pennsylvania.    After filing its petition,\n\nSharon Steel remitted $7,944.97 in withholding taxes to the City\n\nof Farrell, which was the post-petition portion of the fourth-\n\nquarter wages it withheld for payment to the City of Farrell.\n\nBut Sharon Steel retained the remainder of the withheld fourth-\n\nquarter taxes.\n\f          To obtain the remaining funds, the City of Farrell\n\nfiled a motion in the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay\n\nand to compel the turnover of the funds.    The bankruptcy court\n\ndenied the motion in a written opinion dated April 9, 1993,\n\nrejecting the city's reliance on Begier v. IRS, 496 U.S. 53, 110\n\nS.Ct. 2258 (1990).    In re Sharon Steel Corp., 152 B.R. 450\n\n(Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1993).    The city contends that Begier held that\n\na trust is created for the benefit of the taxing authority\n\nwhenever an employer withholds a portion of an employee's wages\n\nas income taxes.     Thus, in the city's view, taxes withheld from\n\nan employee but not paid to the city do not become \"property of\n\nthe estate\" when the employer files for bankruptcy even if the\n\nemployer had not segregated the \"trust\" funds from its other\n\nassets.   But the bankruptcy court distinguished Begier, primarily\n\nbecause Begier requires that the taxing authority show \"some\n\nnexus between the trust and the assets sought to be applied to\n\nthe debtor's trust fund tax obligations\" and, in the court's\n\nview, the city could not \"establish the required nexus with\n\nregard to the commingled funds in [Sharon Steel's] possession.\"\n\nId. at 451-52.   In other words, unlike in Begier, where the\n\ndebtor had paid the taxes withheld to the Internal Revenue\n\nService prior to filing its bankruptcy petition, thereby creating\n\na segregated fund, Sharon Steel commingled the funds with its\n\nother assets and the funds remained commingled when Sharon Steel\n\nfiled its Chapter 11 petition.\n\n          The city appealed but the district court affirmed the\n\nbankruptcy court's decision in a written opinion, agreeing with\n\fthe bankruptcy court that \"the facts of this case are\n\ndistinguishable from [those in] Begier\" and that the City \"has\n\nfailed to demonstrate the required nexus between the taxes and\n\nthe commingled funds in the possession of the estate of Sharon\n\nSteel.\"   In re Sharon Steel Corp., Civ. No. 93-0736, at 3-4 (W.D.\n\nPa. Feb. 11, 1994).   The district court also distinguished Begier\n\non the basis that the statutory \"language establishing a 'trust\n\nfund' in the withheld taxes in Begier is absent in the pertinent\n\nstatute and ordinance governing withholding taxes for Farrell.\"\n\nId.   The district court entered its order on February 14, 1994,\n\naffirming the bankruptcy court's order.      The city has appealed to\n\nus from that order.\n\n           The bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 157(b) and 11 U.S.C. § 362(d) as the City of\n\nFarrell filed a motion to lift the automatic stay and compel\n\nturnover of the trust fund taxes.   The district court had\n\nappellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a) over the\n\nbankruptcy court's denial of the City's motion, as the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's order denying the city relief was final.     We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d) over the district court's\n\nfinal order affirming the bankruptcy court's order.\n\n\n\n                         III.   DISCUSSION\n\na.    Introduction\n           The crux of this appeal is whether the remaining\n\nportion of the funds Sharon Steel withheld from its employees'\n\nwages for the fourth quarter of 1992 constitutes property of its\n\fbankruptcy estate or whether it is excluded from the estate by 11\n\nU.S.C. § 541(d), which excludes equitable interests of third\n\nparties from a bankrupt's estate.1   If the funds are property of\n\nthe estate, then the bankruptcy court and district court\n\ncorrectly rejected the city's claim; but if the funds are not\n\nproperty of the estate, they should be paid to the city unless,\n\nas we discuss below, Sharon Steel's pre-petition lenders have a\n\nprior claim to the funds.   The City of Farrell primarily contends\n\nthat because Sharon Steel retained the funds withheld in trust\n\nfor the city, the funds are not property of the estate, and that\n\ntherefore we should reverse the district court's order.    In\n\nconsidering this appeal we are exercising plenary review because\n\nboth the bankruptcy court and the district court decided the case\n\nas a matter of law on facts which so far as considered by those\n\ncourts were not disputed.   In re Brown, 851 F.2d 81, 84 (3d Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n\n\n\n1\n . 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1) provides that the property of the\nestate includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor\nin property as of the commencement of the case.\" Section 541(d)\nprovides the following exception:\n\n          Property in which the debtor holds, as of the\n          commencement of the case, only legal title and not\n          an equitable interest . . . becomes property of\n          the estate under subsection (a)(1) of this section\n          only to the extent of the debtor's legal title to\n          such property, but not to the extent of any\n          equitable interest in such property that the\n          debtor does not hold.\n\f          We start from the well-settled principle that debtors\n\ndo \"not own an equitable interest in property . . . [they] hold[\n\n] in trust for another,\" and that therefore funds held in trust\n\nare not \"property of the estate.\"2   Begier, 496 U.S. at 59, 110\n\nS.Ct. at 2263; see also 11 U.S.C. § 541(d); Universal Bonding\n\nIns. Co. v. Gittens & Sprinkle Enters., 960 F.2d 366, 371 (3d\n\nCir. 1992).   In general, \"to establish rights as a trust\n\nrecipient, a claimant must make two showings: (1) demonstrate\n\nthat the trust relationship and its legal source exist, and (2)\n\nidentify and trace the trust funds if they are commingled.\"\n\nGoldberg v. New Jersey Lawyers' Fund, 932 F.2d 273, 280 (3d Cir.\n\n1991); In re Columbia Gas Sys. Inc., 997 F.2d 1039, 1063 (3d Cir.\n\n1993) (\"beneficiaries of trust funds bear the burden of\n\nidentifying and tracing their trust property\"), cert. denied, 114\n\nS.Ct. 1050 (1994).   Goldberg teaches that we look to state law to\n\ndetermine whether the claimant has shown a trust relationship,3\n\nbut that we look to federal law to determine whether the claimant\n\n\n\n\n2\n . The \"classic definition of a trust . . . [is that] the\nbeneficiary has an equitable interest in the trust property while\nlegal title is vested in the trustee.\" In re Columbia Gas Sys.\nInc., 997 F.2d 1039, 1059 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct.\n1050 (1994).\n3\n . See Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 54, 99 S.Ct. 914,\n918 (1979) (\"Congress has generally left the determination of\nproperty rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to state\nlaw.\"); see also In re Nejberger, 934 F.2d 1300, 1302 (3d Cir.\n1991) (\"Although section 541 defines property of the estate, we\nmust look to state law to determine if a property right exists\nand to stake out its dimensions.\").\n\fhas traced and identified the trust funds.4   Goldberg, 932 F.2d\n\nat 280; see also Universal Bonding, 960 F.2d at 369; In re Markos\n\nGurnee Partnership, 163 B.R. 124, 129 & n.4 (Bankr. N.D. Ill.\n\n1993); In re Visiting Nurse Ass'n v. Bowen, 143 B.R. 633, 641\n\n(W.D. Pa. 1992) (\"Once a bankruptcy court makes a determination\n\nconcerning whether a debtor has any legal or equitable interest\n\nin property based upon applicable state law, whether the property\n\nwill come into the estate is a federal question.\") (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted)), aff'd, 986 F.2d 1410 (3d Cir.\n\n1993) (table).\n\n           In considering this case we naturally focus first on\n\nBegier.   In Begier, the trustee filed an adversary proceeding\n\nagainst the United States, claiming that the debtor's pre-\n\npetition payment of withheld federal income tax to the Internal\n\nRevenue Service was a voidable preference under 11 U.S.C. §\n\n547(b).   The Supreme Court rejected the trustee's position,\n\nholding that the payment of the taxes to the IRS was not a\n\nvoidable preference because the funds transferred were not\n\nproperty of the debtor, but rather were held in trust for the\n\ngovernment.   Begier, 496 U.S. at 66-67, 110 S.Ct. at 2267.    In\n\nfinding that a trust existed, the Court relied on a section of\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code, which provided that persons\n\n\n4\n . Begier is not inconsistent with Goldberg's approach. In\nBegier, the Court solely confronted federal issues, so it\nnaturally looked to federal law to determine whether the claimant\nproved a trust relationship. Additionally, the Court looked to\nfederal law to determine whether the claimant identified and\ntraced the trust funds.\n\fwithholding taxes hold the withheld funds in trust for the IRS.5\n\nThe Court also found that the debtor's pre-petition payments of\n\nwithholding amounts to the IRS constituted a sufficient enough\n\nnexus to take the funds out of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n          The city contends that Begier mandates that we reverse\n\nthe district and bankruptcy courts' orders denying the city's\n\nmotion to lift the automatic stay and compel turnover of the\n\nremaining funds withheld.   The district court found two\n\nindependent reasons for denying the city's motion: (1) the city\n\nfailed to show that a statutory trust had been created; and (2)\n\nthe city failed to show the appropriate \"nexus\" between the\n\ndebtor's assets and the withholding funds.   Sharon Steel and\n\nCitibank, as agent for certain of Sharon Steel's creditors,\n\ncontend that the district court correctly held that Begier is\n\ndistinguishable and that therefore we should affirm its order\n\naffirming the bankruptcy court.   Accordingly, we will discuss the\n\ndistrict court's two reasons for denying the City's motion.\nb. Was a trust created in the taxes withheld?\n\n\n          The district court concluded that while there is no\n\n\"statutory authority . . . [for] Farrell's contention that these\n\ntaxes are held in trust,\" the statute involved in Begier, 26\nU.S.C. § 7501, \"expressly designates that taxes withheld by an\n\n\n5\n . The Court quoted: \"'Whenever any person is required to\ncollect or withhold any internal revenue tax from any other\nperson and to pay over such tax to the United States, the amount\nof tax so collected or withheld shall be held to be a special\nfund in trust for the United States.'\" 496 U.S. at 60, 110 S.Ct.\nat 2263 (quoting 26 U.S.C. § 7501).\n\femployer are held in trust for the United States.\"   In re Sharon\n\nSteel Corp., Civ. No. 93-0736, at 3-4.   In response, the city\n\nargues that Pennsylvania law demonstrates that Sharon Steel did\n\nhold the taxes in trust for the city.    See City of Philadelphia\n\nv. Penn Plastering Corp., 253 A.2d 247 (Pa. 1969), and City of\n\nPhiladelphia v. B. Axe Co., 397 A.2d 51 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1979).\n\nWe are satisfied that in determining whether a trust has been\n\ncreated we look to the entire body of germane state law,\n\nincluding the relevant case law, and that we should not be\n\nconfined solely by the applicable authorizing statute.     See,\n\ne.g., Goldberg, 932 F.2d at 280; In re Markos Gurnee, 163 B.R. at\n\n129; In re Visiting Nurse Ass'n, 143 B.R. at 641-42; In re King,\n\n117 B.R. 339, 341 (Bankr. W.D. Tenn. 1990).\n\n          We find that under Pennsylvania case law, when Sharon\n\nSteel withheld the city income taxes a trust was created so that\n\nSharon Steel held the funds in trust for the city.   Penn Plaster\n\nis instructive in this regard.   That case involved a suit by the\n\nCity of Philadelphia against a corporation doing business in\n\nPhiladelphia and its president to collect wage taxes withheld by\n\nthe corporation.   As the corporation's president filed\n\n\"preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer,\" the court\n\naccepted Philadelphia's averments as true, finding that \"the\n\ntaxes were collected by the corporation as agent for\n\n[Philadelphia] and that [the president as] the active and\n\ncontrolling officer . . . failed to pay the taxes so collected\n\nover to the City.\"   Penn Plaster, 253 A.2d at 248-49.\nPhiladelphia argued that when the corporation withheld the city\n\fincome tax, the corporation and its president as its controlling\n\nofficer and director became \"trustees of those wage taxes\" and\n\nhad \"a duty to pay those funds over to [Philadelphia].\"    Id. at\n\n248.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed, holding that \"[o]ne\n\nwho collects taxes as agent for a city and fails to pay the same\n\nover to the city has long been held to be a trustee ex\n\nmaleficio.\"   Id. at 249 (citing City of Philadelphia v. Heinel\n\nMotors, Inc., 16 A.2d 761 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1940)); see also City\n\nof Philadelphia v. B. Axe Co., 397 A.2d 51.\n\n           Penn Plaster's reference to the principle that the\n\nparty who \"collects taxes as agent for a city and fails to pay\n\nthe same over to the city [is] . . .   a trustee ex maleficio[,]\"\n\ndoes not somehow undermine our conclusion that when Sharon Steel\n\nwithheld the City of Farrell income tax, a trust was created.\n\nRather, the reference supports our result.    After all, the\n\nprinciple that Penn Plaster's reasoning recognized was premised\n\non the concept that a trust was created when the corporation\n\nwithheld the income taxes.   The court stated that it is\n\nundisputed \"that corporations must act through individuals and\n\nwhere the individuals are the active and controlling officers and\n\nagents of the corporation and they fail to administer the trust\nresponsibilities of the corporation, those responsibilities are\n\nimposed upon the individuals who are responsible for the\n\nperformance of the trust duty.\"   Penn Plaster, 253 A.2d at 125\n\n(emphasis added).   Therefore, Penn Plaster clearly contemplated\n\nthat when a corporation withholds municipal income taxes,\n\nPennsylvania law imposes a \"trust responsibility\" and thus the\n\fcorporation retains the funds withheld as trustee for the\n\nmunicipality.\n\n            Heinel Motors, cited in Penn Plaster, supports our\n\nconclusion that, under Pennsylvania law, a trust is created when\n\nan employer withholds city income taxes.   Heinel Motors involved\n\nthe question of whether a trust is created when a vendor collects\n\nsales tax from a purchaser of goods subject to the tax.    In\n\nmaking its analysis, the Heinel court extensively considered\n\nprecedent regarding the creation of trusts and concluded that the\n\n\"receipt of the tax money by the vendor operates to create a\n\nconstructive trust.\"   Heinel Motors, 16 A.2d at 765.   The court\n\nreasoned, in part, that as the sales tax was imposed on the\n\npurchaser and not on the vendor, the vendor collected the tax as\n\ntrustee for the state.    Indeed, the court recognized the broad\n\nprinciple that \"[e]very person who receives money to be paid to\n\nanother or to be applied to a particular purpose is a trustee[.]\"\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omitted).   Clearly,\n\ntherefore, the tax in Heinel Motors is similar to the withholding\n\ntax at issue here, as in both instances the entity holding the\n\ntax funds is not responsible for the burden of the tax but only\n\nis responsible for collecting it.    See also In re King, 117 B.R.\nat 341.\n\n            We acknowledge that sales taxes are paid to the vendor\n\nby a third party but when income tax is involved the employer had\n\npossession of the funds it withholds prior to paying wages to the\n\nemployee.    However, this distinction does not affect our result.\n\nIn substance, when the employer pays wages and withholds taxes it\n\fis paying the employees' taxes to itself since the employee has\n\nearned his or her entire gross wages.   Indeed, the only reason\n\nthat the employer need not pay the funds withheld to the employee\n\nis that the applicable law requires the employer to withhold the\n\nwages for application on the employee's tax obligations.    Thus,\n\nit would be artificial to characterize the withholding tax\n\nsituation as simply creating a debtor-creditor relationship\n\nbetween the employer and the city.   The real debt is the\n\nemployees' tax liability to the city and the employer is merely\n\nthe conduit for its employees' tax payments.   Consequently, we\n\nhold that under Pennsylvania law Sharon Steel held the\n\nwithholding taxes in trust for the City of Farrell.6\n 6\n  . In re Markos Gurnee, 163 B.R. 124, does not conflict with\nour conclusion. There, the Illinois Department of Revenue\nclaimed that it had a trust-fund interest in the debtor's general\nassets to the extent of unpaid hotel occupation and use taxes.\nMarkos Gurnee, 163 B.R. at 127. The court held against the\nstate, reasoning that the statutes creating the hotel occupation\nand use taxes did not \"create a trust in favor of the state.\"\nId. at 130.\n\n          But as the Markos Gurnee court recognized, the hotel\noccupation and use taxes differed from the type of trust-fund\ntaxes involved in Begier. The Markos Gurnee court stated that\nthe \"theory of 'trust fund taxes' (like income tax withholding)\nis that the tax is imposed on one party (for example, an\nemployee), but is collected and held by another party (for\nexample, the employer).\" Id. The court held that this theory\nwas inapplicable to the occupation tax \"since the tax is imposed\ndirectly on hotel operators, not their customers.\" Id. As to\nthe use tax, the court held that the statute's plain language\nshows that state is a creditor and \"not in the position of a\"\nbeneficiary. Id. at 131-32. Thus, Markos Gurnee is\ndistinguishable from this case, because the occupation tax is a\ndirect tax on the hotel while the City of Farrell income tax is a\ndirect tax on the employees and not on Sharon Steel, and because\nthe Illinois use tax statute's plain language merely creates a\ndebtor-creditor relationship between the taxing authority and the\nparty responsible for remitting the taxes.\n\fc. Does the source of the trust distinguish this case from\n\nBegier?\n\n          We must now decide whether the trust created under\n\nPennsylvania law warrants the same treatment as the trust created\n\nunder the statute in Begier, 26 U.S.C. § 7501.    Section 7501\n\nprovides that \"[w]henever any person is required to collect or\n\nwithhold any internal revenue tax from any other person and to\n\npay over such tax to the United States, the amount of tax so\n\ncollected or withheld shall be held to be a special fund in trust\n\nfor the United States.\"    According to the Begier Court, this\n\nstatutory trust extends \"only to 'the amount of tax so collected\n\nor withheld,'\" and that the trust is created \"at the moment\" the\n\nemployer paid its employees' wages.    Begier, 496 U.S. at 60-61,\n\n110 S.Ct. at 2263-64.     Moreover, Begier rejected the argument\n\nthat segregation of the withheld funds was a prerequisite to the\n\ncreation of a trust.    Id. at 60-61, 110 S.Ct. at 2264.\n\n(..continued)\n\n          We also recognize the following additional point. It\nis conceivable that an employer paying wages might not have the\nfunds to pay the gross wages in full, though it could pay the\nemployees their net wages after withholding. In that event it\nreasonably could be argued that no trust has been created in the\n\"withheld\" taxes as there were no funds to withhold. Clearly,\nthe larger the amount of taxes to be deducted the more plausible\nwould be the argument that a trust had not been created.\nHowever, while we recognize the plausibility of this argument, we\ndo not address it because neither Sharon Steel nor Citibank\nraises it. Furthermore, we doubt that there would be a factual\npredicate for the argument because the City of Farrell income tax\nrate was 1% when it was enacted, and we believe it was 1.5% by\n1992.\n\f          We find no significant distinction between the trust\n\ncreated under section 7501 with respect to federal withholding\n\nand the trust created under Pennsylvania law with respect\n\nwithholding of local income taxes.    First, both statutory schemes\n\nrequire that the employer withhold the appropriate portion of\n\nincome when it pays wages to its employees.7   Thus, as\n\nPennsylvania case law establishes that a trust is created when\n\nthe tax is withheld and as section 7501 creates an express trust\n\nin funds withheld, it is clear that under both statutory regimes\n\nthe trust is created when the employer pays the wages.\n\n          Second, the Begier Court's primary reason for rejecting\n\nthe argument that segregation of the withheld funds is a\n\nprerequisite to the creation of a trust applies with equal force\n\nin this case.    Begier stated that requiring segregation as a\n\nprerequisite to the creation of the trust would \"mean that an\n\nemployer could avoid the creation of a trust simply by refusing\n\nto segregate.\"    496 U.S. at 61, 110 S.Ct. at 2264.      Thus, if\n\nwe were to hold that a trust was not created under Pennsylvania\n\nlaw because Sharon Steel did not segregate the withholding funds,\n\nwe would be eviscerating the concept expressed in Penn Plaster\nthat \"[o]ne who collects taxes as agent for a city and fails to\n\n\n7\n . See Begier, 496 U.S. at 60, 110 S.Ct. at 2264 (\"Section\n3402(a)(1) requires that 'every employer making payments of wages\nshall deduct and withhold upon such wages [the employee's federal\nincome tax].'\") (emphasis added); and see City of Farrell\nOrdinance No. 0-17-66, § 5(b) (\"Every employer having . . . [a]\nplace of business within the City of Farrell . . . shall deduct\nat the time of payment thereof, the tax imposed by this Ordinance\non the earned income due to his employe or employes.\").\n\fpay the same over to the city has long been held to be a trustee\n\nex maleficio.\"   253 A.2d at 249.   This would occur because, then,\n\nan employer could avoid creating a trust simply by commingling\n\nthe withholding funds with its other assets.\n\n           Moreover, we must recognize the city's equitable\n\ninterest in the funds withheld even though Pennsylvania law and\n\nthe city ordinance do not create an express trust in the withheld\n\nfunds.   Whatever may be true in other contexts, the distinction\n\nbetween a direct trust (i.e. one expressly created by the\n\nparties) and a constructive trust (i.e. one imposed by law) has\n\nno relevance to the issues on this appeal.      As we recently\n\nstated, \"Congress clearly intended the exclusion [of trust funds\n\nfrom the debtor's estate] created by section 541(d) to include\n\nnot only funds held in express trust, but also funds held in\n\nconstructive trust.\"   In re Columbia Gas, 997 F.2d at 1059\n\n(citing H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 368 (1977),\n\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6324).\n\n           We are not alone in this approach.    The Court of\n\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, in In re Unicom Computer Corp., 13\n\nF.3d 321, 324 (9th Cir. 1994), even more recently indicated,\n\n\"[a]lthough we have never expressly held that the same rule\n\n(viz., funds held in trust are property neither of the debtor nor\n\nof the bankruptcy estate) should apply as well to situations\n\ninvolving funds held by a debtor in constructive trust, the rule\n\nwould seem to apply with equal force to both situations.\"\n\nTherefore, since we have recognized that the crux of this appeal\n\nis whether the withholding funds fall within section 541(d)'s\n\fexception to \"property of the estate,\" the fact that the trust at\n\nissue is constructive rather than express has no bearing on our\n\ndecision.    Accordingly, we find no reason not to analyze the\n\ntrust in this case in the same manner as Begier analyzed the\n\ntrust created by 26 U.S.C. § 7501.    We hold that because a trust\n\nwas created under Pennsylvania law when Sharon Steel withheld the\n\nincome tax, the district court erred when it held that the City\n\nof Farrell did not show a trust relationship.\n\nd.   Has the city satisfied Begier's \"nexus\" requirement?\n\n            In Begier, after the Court concluded that a trust was\n\ncreated \"at the moment\" of wage payment, it analyzed whether \"the\n\nparticular dollars that     . . . [the debtor] paid to the IRS were\n\n'property of the debtor.'\"    Begier, 496 U.S. at 61, 110 S.Ct. at\n\n2264 (emphasis added).    In other words, the Court wrestled with\n\nhow to determine whether the \"assets transferred to the IRS            .\n\n. . were trust property.\"    Id. at 62, 110 S.Ct. at 2265.    This\n\ninquiry mirrors the second part of our Goldberg test, i.e.\n\nwhether the claimant identified and traced the trust funds.      See\n\n932 F.2d at 280.\n\n            Because the statute creating the trust considered in\n\nBegier, section 7501, provided no guidance on this issue, the\nCourt stated that it \"might naturally begin with the common-law\n\nrules that have been created to answer such questions about other\n\nvarieties of trusts.\"    496 U.S. at 61, 110 S.Ct. at 2265.   The\n\nCourt, however, concluded that \"[c]ommon-law tracing rules . . .\n\nare unhelpful in this special context,\" reasoning that \"[u]nlike\n\na common-law trust, in which the settlor sets aside particular\n\fproperty as the trust res, § 7501 creates a trust in an abstract\n\n'amount'-- a dollar figure not tied to any particular assets --\n\nrather than in the actual dollars withheld.\"   Id. at 62-63, 110\n\nS.Ct. at 2265 (emphasis added).   As we have concluded that we\n\nshould analyze the trust in this case as Begier analyzed a\n\nsection 7501 trust, we find that the common-law tracing rules\n\nshould not apply to our decision on whether the city has\n\nsatisfied Begier's nexus requirement.\n\n          Were it not for Begier, our task would be more\n\ndifficult because of the Supreme Court's opinion in United States\n\nv. Randall, 401 U.S. 513, 91 S.Ct. 991 (1971).    In Randall, the\n\nCourt confronted a situation very similar to this appeal.    There,\n\nthe United States sought, in the bankruptcy proceeding, to\n\nsatisfy the debtor's pre-petition tax obligations from the\n\ndebtor's post-petition general assets.   The United States argued\n\nthat the debtor held an amount representing the tax obligation in\n\ntrust for the government and that this amount could be traced to\n\nthe debtor's funds when the petition was filed.   In response, the\n\ntrustee argued that no trust had been created because the debtor\n\ndid not segregate any funds for the tax obligation.   The Court\n\ndid not accept either argument.   Instead, it held that the IRS\n\ncould not recover the taxes ahead of administrative expenses,\n\nreasoning that \"the statutory policy of subordinating taxes to\n\ncosts and expenses of administration would not be served by\n\ncreating or enforcing trusts which eat up an estate, leaving\n\nlittle or nothing for creditors and court officers whose goods\n\nand services created the assets.\"   Id. at 517, 91 S.Ct. at 994.\n\f           Were we to apply Randall on this appeal, we probably\n\nwould affirm the district court's order on the basis that a\n\ntaxing authority's trust interest in a debtor's pre-petition tax\n\nobligation does not justify granting the authority priority over\n\nclaims for administrative expenses.   Begier, however, held that\n\nthe \"strict rule of Randall . . . did not survive the adoption of\n\nthe new Bankruptcy Code\" section 541.   Begier, 496 U.S. at 65,\n\n110 S.Ct. at 2266.   The Court's reasons for holding that section\n\n541 displaced the holding in Randall are helpful in shedding\n\nlight on the nexus requirement.\n\n           In reaching its decision, the Begier Court first\n\ncompared the Senate and House bills that led to the enactment of\n\nsection 541.   Begier stated that the \"Senate bill attacked\n\nRandall directly, providing in § 541 that trust-fund taxes\n\nwithheld or collected prior to the filing of the bankruptcy\n\npetition were not 'property of the estate.'\"   Begier, 496 U.S. at\n\n63-64, 110 S.Ct. at 2265 (citing S. Rep. No. 95-1106, at 33\n\n(1978)).   As to the House bill, Begier stated that while the\n\n\"bill did not deal explicitly with the problem of trust fund\n\ntaxes, . . . the House Report stated that 'property of the\n\nestate' would not include property held in trust for another.\"\n\nBegier, 496 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2265-66 (citing H.R. Rep.\nNo. 95-595, at 368 (1977)).   Congress's final compromise in\n\nenacting the portion of section 541 that deals with post-petition\n\ntransfers, according to Begier, \"explicitly provided that 'in the\n\ncase of property held in trust, the property of the estate\n\nincludes the legal title, but not the beneficial interest of the\n\fproperty.'\"     Begier, 496 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2266 (citing\n\n124 Cong. Rec. at 32,417 (remarks of Representative Edwards)).\n\n            Next, Begier took the unusual step of treating the\n\nfloor statements of a representative \"as persuasive evidence of\n\ncongressional intent.\"     Begier, 496 U.S. at 64 n.5, 110 S.Ct. at\n\n2266 n.5.     The Court quoted Representative Edwards for the\n\nproposition that \"the Senate language specifying that withheld or\n\ncollected trust-fund taxes are not part of the bankruptcy estate\n\nwas deleted as 'unnecessary since property of the estate does not\n\ninclude the beneficial interest in property held by the debtor as\n\ntrustee.'\"    Id. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2266 (citing 124 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 32,417).\n\n             Additionally, Begier placed great weight on\n\nRepresentative Edwards' subsequent discussion of \"the effects of\n\nthe House language on the rule established by Randall\":\n          [A] serious problem exists where 'trust fund\n          taxes' withheld from others are held to be\n          property of the estate where the withheld amounts\n          are commingled with other assets of the debtor.\n          The courts should permit the use of reasonable\n          assumptions under which the Internal Revenue\n          Service, and other tax authorities, can\n          demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are\n          still in the possession of the debtor at the\n          commencement of the case.\n\n\nBegier, 496 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2266 (citing 124 Cong. Rec.\nat 32,417).    From this statement, the Court concluded that \"by\n\nrequiring the IRS to 'demonstrate that amounts withheld are still\n\nin possession of the debtor at the commencement of the case'\n\n[i.e. at the filing of the petition] . . . , Congress expected\n\nthat the IRS would have to show some connection between the §\n\f7501 trust and the assets sought to be applied to a debtor's\n\ntrust-fund tax obligations.\"   Begier, 496 U.S. at 65-66, 110\n\nS.Ct. at 2266 (emphasis added).   The Court continued by asking\n\njust \"how extensive the required nexus must be.\"    Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).   Answering that question, the Court held that in Begier\n\nthe pre-petition payment to the IRS satisfied the nexus\n\nrequirement.8   Id. at 67, 110 S.Ct. at 2267.   Thus, as Begier\n\ninvolved a pre-petition payment, while here we have no such\n\n8\n . In explaining this \"nexus\" requirement, Begier stated that\nthe \"Bankruptcy Code provides no explicit answer, and\nRepresentative Edwards' admonition that courts should 'permit\nreasonable assumptions' does not add much.\" Begier, 496 U.S. at\n66, 110 S.Ct. at 2266. Accordingly, the Court looked to the\nfollowing statement from the House Report for guidance:\n\n           'A payment of withholding taxes constitutes a\n           payment of money held in trust under Internal\n           Revenue Code § 7501(a), and thus will not be a\n           preference because the beneficiary of the trust,\n           the taxing authority, is in a separate class with\n           respect to those taxes, if they have been properly\n           held for payment, as they will have been if the\n           debtor is able to make the payments.'\n\nId. at 66, 110 S.Ct. at 2267 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at\n368 (1977), 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6324). \"In the absence of any\nsuggestion in the Bankruptcy Code about what tracing rules to\napply,\" the Court adopted a literal reading of the above quote.\nUnder this literal reading, the Court held that \"any voluntary\nprepetition payment of trust-fund taxes out of the debtor's\nassets [satisfies the nexus requirement and therefore] is not a\ntransfer of the debtor's property.\" Begier, 496 U.S. at 67, 110\nS.Ct. at 2267.\n\n          This holding does not control the situation before us,\nbecause Begier involved a pre-petition payment to the taxing\nauthority, while here we confront the taxing authority's attempt\nto collect the taxes from the debtor's post-petition general\nassets. Of course, the holding that an actual pre-petition\npayment will satisfy the nexus requirement does not mean that the\nrequirement cannot be satisfied in some other way.\n\fpayment, we cannot draw a conclusion from Begier as to whether\n\nthe City of Farrell has met the nexus requirement.\n\n          Nevertheless Sharon Steel argues that as \"it is\n\nundisputed that the [t]axes were not held in a segregated account\n\n. . . [or] paid prepetition, . . . the required nexus cannot be\n\nestablished.\"   Brief at 13 (emphasis added).   But its argument\n\nmisconstrues Begier's nexus requirement, because it contemplates\n\nthat the nexus requirement is met only if the employer had\n\nsegregated the trust fund taxes or transferred them to the taxing\n\nauthority before the petition.   Yet Begier's reliance on\n\nRepresentative Edwards' remarks shows that the taxing authorities\n\nshould be able to show that the nexus requirement is satisfied in\n\nother ways.9\n9\n . The bankruptcy court cited In re Kulzer Roofing, Inc., 139\nB.R. 132 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1992), aff'd 150 B.R. 134 (E.D. Pa.\n1992), and In re Russman's, Inc., 125 B.R. 520 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn.\n1991), for the proposition that the \"City of Farrell cannot\nestablish the required nexus with regard to the commingled funds\nin [Sharon Steel's] possession.\" In re Sharon Steel Corp., 152\nB.R. at 451-52. Kulzer is readily distinguishable as it did not\ninvolve a taxing authority, but involved private parties'\nattempts to collect funds that were commingled in the debtor's\ngeneral assets. The bankruptcy court rejected the attempt\nbecause the claimants had not established that the funds were\nheld in either an express or a constructive trust. 139 B.R. at\n141. Of course, even if Kulzer were not distinguishable we would\nnot be bound to follow it.\n\n          Russman, however, though concerning sales taxes, raises\ntrust-fund issues similar to those in this case. Russman held\nthat a state taxing authority had satisfied Begier's nexus\nrequirement with respect to segregated funds but had not\nsatisfied the nexus requirement \"with regard to the commingled\nfunds remaining on deposit in the trustee's general operating\naccount.\" Russman, 125 B.R. at 524. But the court reached its\nconclusion with respect to the commingled funds without analysis\nand in these circumstances we do not find the opinion persuasive.\n\f          Because the Begier Court relied heavily on\n\nRepresentative Edwards' remarks when deciding whether the pre-\n\npetition transfer satisfied the nexus requirement, we will give\n\nhis remarks similar weight in considering whether the City of\n\nFarrell has satisfied the nexus requirement.   Specifically, as\n\npartially quoted earlier, Representative Edwards stated that:\n               Where it is not possible for the Internal\n          Revenue Service to demonstrate that the amounts of\n          taxes withheld are still in the possession of the\n          debtor at the commencement of the case, present\n          law generally includes amounts of withheld taxes\n          as property of the estate. . . . Nonetheless, a\n          serious problem exists where 'trust fund taxes'\n          withheld from others are held to be property of\n          the estate where the withheld amounts are\n          commingled with other assets of the debtor. The\n          Courts should permit the use of reasonable\n          assumptions under which the Internal Revenue\n          Service, and other taxing authorities, can\n          demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are\n          still in the possession of the debtor at the\n          commencement of the case. For example, where the\n          debtor had commingled that amount of withheld\n          taxes in his general checking account, it might be\n          reasonable to assume that any remaining amounts in\n          that account on the commencement of the case are\n          withheld taxes.\n\n\n124 Cong. Rec. at 11,047.   Thus, Representative Edwards spoke\n\nabout a situation in which an employer commingles the trust-fund\n\ntaxes in its general checking account and subsequently files for\n\nbankruptcy without having paid the taxes to the appropriate\n\ntaxing authority.\n\n          We, however, face an insurmountable hurdle barring us\n\nfrom deciding whether the City of Farrell has satisfied the nexus\n\nrequirement, because neither the bankruptcy court nor the\n\ndistrict court made findings of fact on which we could predicate\n\fsuch a determination.   This omission is understandable, since the\n\nbankruptcy court and district court believed that the city could\n\nnot satisfy the nexus requirement as Sharon Steel's funds were\n\ncommingled and Sharon Steel did not pay the taxes before it filed\n\nits Chapter 11 petition.   Nevertheless Representative Edwards'\n\nexample of what \"might\" constitute a reasonable assumption could\n\nbe applicable here.10\n\n          As we have indicated, Representative Edwards stated\n\nthat \"where the debtor had commingled [the] amount of withheld\n\ntaxes in his general checking account, it might be reasonable to\n\nassume that any remaining amounts in that account on the\n\ncommencement of the case are withheld taxes.\"   Sharon Steel\n\nconcedes that before it filed for bankruptcy, Citibank\n\n\"controlled all monies coming into Sharon Steel through a lock\n\nbox account . . . [and] Citibank would authorize disbursement of\n\nfunds from the [l]ock [b]ox [a]ccount to Sharon Steel's operating\n\n\n10\n . We recognize that allowing courts to consider commingling in\ndeciding whether a sufficient nexus exists runs counter to our\nholding above that a party should not be able to defeat a trust\n\"simply by commingling the withholding funds with its other\nassets.\" See typescript at 15. Nonetheless, as the Supreme\nCourt held in Begier, the question of whether a trust exists is\nanalytically distinct from whether or not the trust funds are\ntraceable and identifiable. The first question involves an\ninquiry into state law; the second does not. Therefore,\nconsiderations relevant to the first question are not always\ncoextensive with considerations relevant to the second. To some\nextent, however, Representative Edwards' comments were intended\nto make equitable considerations part of the \"nexus\" inquiry as\nwell. Thus, when applying the guidelines we set forth to\ndetermine whether a nexus exists, the bankruptcy court certainly\nshould keep in mind the broader policy against allowing a party\nunilaterally to make a trust unenforceable by commingling assets.\n\faccounts.\"    Brief at 3.   Thus, as Sharon Steel's funds were\n\nplaced in the lock box account, it would be reasonable to\n\nconclude that the withheld funds were held in trust for the City\n\nof Farrell in that account.     Moreover, when Sharon Steel filed\n\nits Chapter 11 petition the lock box account may have contained\n\nan amount of funds exceeding the remaining withholding held in\n\ntrust for the City.    If so, we have the exact set of facts that\n\nRepresentative Edwards contemplated:     i.e. pre-petition trust-\n\nfund taxes commingled in the debtor's general checking account.11\n\n             Because it is manifest that we do not know sufficient\n\nfacts to determine whether the City of Farrell has met the nexus\n\nrequirement, we will remand the case to the district court which\n\nin turn will remand it to the bankruptcy court for appropriate\n\nfact finding.    The district court and the bankruptcy court should\n\nbe cognizant of the factual findings necessary to apply the\n\n\"lowest intermediate balance test\" (\"LIBT\").     The LIBT is a\n\njudicial construct that some federal courts have applied to ease\n\na beneficiary's tracing burden when \"a trustee commingles trust\nfunds with other monies in a single account.\"     In re Columbia\n\nGas, 997 F.2d at 1063.      The LIBT \"allows trust beneficiaries to\n\nassume that trust funds are withdrawn last from a commingled\n\n\n11\n . We reject any argument that because the City of Farrell is\nnot the IRS, it should not receive the benefits of Representative\nEdwards' remarks. He specifically stated that \"[t]he Courts\nshould permit the use of reasonable assumptions under which the\nInternal Revenue Service, and other taxing authorities, can\ndemonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are still in the\npossession of the debtor at the commencement of the case.\" Thus,\nwe cannot limit the application of his statement to the IRS.\n\faccount.   Once trust money is removed, however, it is not\n\nreplenished by subsequent deposits.   Therefore, the lowest\n\nintermediate balance in a commingled account represents trust\n\nfunds that have never been dissipated and which are reasonably\n\nidentifiable.\"   Id.\n\n           At this time we do not decide definitively that the\n\ndistrict court and the bankruptcy court must apply the LIBT as\n\nthe parties have not briefed the issue and neither the bankruptcy\n\ncourt nor the district court addressed the applicability of the\n\nLIBT.   But, as we recognize that the LIBT may constitute a\n\n\"reasonable assumption[] under which the Internal Revenue\n\nService, and other taxing authorities, can demonstrate that\n\namounts of withheld taxes are still in the possession of the\n\ndebtor at the commencement of the case[,]\" we will instruct that\n\non remand, the bankruptcy court make factual findings sufficient\n\nto support a conclusion as to whether the city may recover if, as\n\na matter of law, the LIBT is applied.\n\n           Sharon Steel also contends that the city did not\n\nrequest discovery and relied exclusively on Begier in the\n\nbankruptcy court.   Thus, in Sharon Steel's view, the city has\n\nwaived its rights to discovery and we therefore should not remand\n\nfor additional fact-finding.   Brief at 8-9.   The city responds\n\nthat the procedural posture of the case in the bankruptcy court\n\nprecluded it from obtaining discovery.   We need not linger on\n\nthis point as Sharon Steel's argument necessarily is predicated\n\non its contention that we must apply a clearly erroneous standard\n\nof review to the bankruptcy court's finding that \"[t]he City of\n\fFarrell cannot establish the required nexus with regard to the\n\ncommingled funds in [Sharon Steel's] possession.\"     Brief at 10.\n\nThe bankruptcy court made this finding on the basis of its\n\ncorrect observation that \"there is no allegation that there\n\nexists a segregated trust fund and the amount in question has not\n\nbeen paid.\"    In re Sharon Steel Corp., 152 B.R. at 451.   In view\n\nof those legal conclusions drawn from undisputed facts it would\n\nhave been pointless for the city to request discovery as the\n\ndiscovery would not have been directed to the issues which the\n\nbankruptcy court thought were outcome determinative as a matter\n\nof law.   Rather, discovery could be germane only to determine the\n\nstatus of funds that Sharon Steel had neither segregated nor paid\n\nbefore filing its Chapter 11 petition.      Accordingly, in light of\n\nour legal conclusion that the bankruptcy court misstated the law,\n\nit is only fair that the parties have an opportunity to develop\n\nthe facts relating to the broader method of satisfying the nexus\n\nrequirement which we recognize.    Consequently, we reject Sharon\n\nSteel's argument that we should not remand for additional factual\n\nfindings.\n\n            We deal with one final point.   Citibank, as agent for\n\ncertain lenders, asserts that \"the only source of funds available\n\nto pay the taxes is the Cash Collateral Account which secures\n\n[Sharon Steel's] obligations to the Lenders under\" a prepetition\n\ncredit agreement on which the lenders have a prior lien.\n\nTherefore in its view the taxes cannot be paid without the\n\nlenders' consent.    It concludes the taxes cannot be paid at all\n\nas the lenders do not consent.    Brief at 10-11.    Neither the\n\fdistrict court nor the bankruptcy court considered this issue and\n\nthe parties have not briefed it on this appeal, though Citibank\n\nhas mentioned the point in a conclusory fashion.   Furthermore,\n\nthe record is not clear as to exactly how Citibank and Sharon\n\nSteel treated Sharon Steel's funds.   In these circumstances we\n\nare satisfied that we should not address Citibank's argument but\n\nwe reach our result without prejudice to Citibank's position on\n\nthis point which it may advance on the remand.\n\n          In sum, therefore, we will reverse the district court's\n\norder of February 14, 1994, and will remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nSpecifically, on further remand, the bankruptcy court should make\n\nfactual findings about Sharon Steel's payment of wages and the\n\nwithholding, i.e. the accounts in which the withholding was\n\nplaced, the deposit and withdrawal history of those accounts, and\n\nthe amounts remaining in those accounts at the time Sharon Steel\n\nfiled its bankruptcy petition.   Furthermore, Citibank may assert\n\nthat the lenders which it represents have a lien on the funds\n\nfrom which the city seeks payment.\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n          This appeal involves a controversy over City of Farrell\n\nmunicipal income taxes that Sharon Steel Corporation withheld\n\nfrom its employees' wages.   After withholding the amounts in\n\ndispute, Sharon Steel filed for protection under Chapter 11 of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code and thus did not remit the funds to the city.\n\nThe City of Farrell subsequently initiated this action in the\n\nbankruptcy court to collect the unpaid taxes withheld.   The\n\nbankruptcy court and the district court denied the City's request\n\nfor an order requiring Sharon Steel to remit the withheld funds.\n\nWe will reverse the district court's order, and we will remand\n\fthe case to the district court for the proceedings we outline in\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n         II.     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          Sharon Steel has its main plant and principal place of\n\nbusiness in the City of Farrell, Mercer County, Pennsylvania.     In\n\n1967 the city, pursuant to section 13 of the Pennsylvania Local\n\nTax Enabling Act, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, § 6913\n\n(1972), enacted a tax (Ordinance No. 0-17-66) on the earned\n\nincome and net profits of all residents and non-residents\n\nemployed or conducting business within the city.    Under the\n\nordinance and Pennsylvania law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, § 6913\n\nIV, employers located in the City of Farrell must withhold taxes\n\non locally earned income from the wages of any employee subject\n\nto the city income tax and must remit those taxes in quarterly\n\npayments to the city.\n\n          For the fourth quarter of 1992, Sharon Steel withheld\n\n$56,831.99 in City of Farrell income tax.    On November 30, 1992,\n\nSharon Steel filed its petition under Chapter 11 of the\n\nBankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nWestern District of Pennsylvania.    After filing its petition,\n\nSharon Steel remitted $7,944.97 in withholding taxes to the City\n\nof Farrell, which was the post-petition portion of the fourth-\n\nquarter wages it withheld for payment to the City of Farrell.\n\nBut Sharon Steel retained the remainder of the withheld fourth-\n\nquarter taxes.\n\f          To obtain the remaining funds, the City of Farrell\n\nfiled a motion in the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay\n\nand to compel the turnover of the funds.    The bankruptcy court\n\ndenied the motion in a written opinion dated April 9, 1993,\n\nrejecting the city's reliance on Begier v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112445\"><a href=\"/opinion/112445/begier-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112445\"><a href=\"/opinion/112445/begier-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990).    In re Sharon Steel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1884116\"><a href=\"/opinion/1884116/in-re-sharon-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1993).    The city contends that Begier held that\n\na trust is created for the benefit of the taxing authority\n\nwhenever an employer withholds a portion of an employee's wages\n\nas income taxes.     Thus, in the city's view, taxes withheld from\n\nan employee but not paid to the city do not become \"property of\n\nthe estate\" when the employer files for bankruptcy even if the\n\nemployer had not segregated the \"trust\" funds from its other\n\nassets.   But the bankruptcy court distinguished Begier, primarily\n\nbecause Begier requires that the taxing authority show \"some\n\nnexus between the trust and the assets sought to be applied to\n\nthe debtor's trust fund tax obligations\" and, in the court's\n\nview, the city could not \"establish the required nexus with\n\nregard to the commingled funds in [Sharon Steel's] possession.\"\n\nId. at 451-52.   In other words, unlike in Begier, where the\n\ndebtor had paid the taxes withheld to the Internal Revenue\n\nService prior to filing its bankruptcy petition, thereby creating\n\na segregated fund, Sharon Steel commingled the funds with its\n\nother assets and the funds remained commingled when Sharon Steel\n\nfiled its Chapter 11 petition.\n\n          The city appealed but the district court affirmed the\n\nbankruptcy court's decision in a written opinion, agreeing with\n\fthe bankruptcy court that \"the facts of this case are\n\ndistinguishable from [those in] Begier\" and that the City \"has\n\nfailed to demonstrate the required nexus between the taxes and\n\nthe commingled funds in the possession of the estate of Sharon\n\nSteel.\"   In re Sharon Steel Corp., Civ. No. 93-0736, at 3-4 (W.D.\n\nPa. Feb. 11, 1994).   The district court also distinguished Begier\n\non the basis that the statutory \"language establishing a 'trust\n\nfund' in the withheld taxes in Begier is absent in the pertinent\n\nstatute and ordinance governing withholding taxes for Farrell.\"\n\nId.   The district court entered its order on February 14, 1994,\n\naffirming the bankruptcy court's order.      The city has appealed to\n\nus from that order.\n\n           The bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 157(b) and 11 U.S.C. § 362(d) as the City of\n\nFarrell filed a motion to lift the automatic stay and compel\n\nturnover of the trust fund taxes.   The district court had\n\nappellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a) over the\n\nbankruptcy court's denial of the City's motion, as the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's order denying the city relief was final.     We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d) over the district court's\n\nfinal order affirming the bankruptcy court's order.\n\n\n\n                         III.   DISCUSSION\n\na.    Introduction\n           The crux of this appeal is whether the remaining\n\nportion of the funds Sharon Steel withheld from its employees'\n\nwages for the fourth quarter of 1992 constitutes property of its\n\fbankruptcy estate or whether it is excluded from the estate by 11\n\nU.S.C. § 541(d), which excludes equitable interests of third\n\nparties from a bankrupt's estate.1   If the funds are property of\n\nthe estate, then the bankruptcy court and district court\n\ncorrectly rejected the city's claim; but if the funds are not\n\nproperty of the estate, they should be paid to the city unless,\n\nas we discuss below, Sharon Steel's pre-petition lenders have a\n\nprior claim to the funds.   The City of Farrell primarily contends\n\nthat because Sharon Steel retained the funds withheld in trust\n\nfor the city, the funds are not property of the estate, and that\n\ntherefore we should reverse the district court's order.    In\n\nconsidering this appeal we are exercising plenary review because\n\nboth the bankruptcy court and the district court decided the case\n\nas a matter of law on facts which so far as considered by those\n\ncourts were not disputed.   In re Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508523\"><a href=\"/opinion/508523/in-re-delores-c-brown-debtor-v-pennsylvania-state-employees-credit-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (3d Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n\n\n\n1\n . 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1) provides that the property of the\nestate includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor\nin property as of the commencement of the case.\" Section 541(d)\nprovides the following exception:\n\n          Property in which the debtor holds, as of the\n          commencement of the case, only legal title and not\n          an equitable interest . . . becomes property of\n          the estate under subsection (a)(1) of this section\n          only to the extent of the debtor's legal title to\n          such property, but not to the extent of any\n          equitable interest in such property that the\n          debtor does not hold.\n\f          We start from the well-settled principle that debtors\n\ndo \"not own an equitable interest in property . . .

In Begier, the trustee filed an adversary proceeding\n\nagainst the United States, claiming that the debtor's pre-\n\npetition payment of withheld federal income tax to the Internal\n\nRevenue Service was a voidable preference under 11 U.S.C. §\n\n547(b).   The Supreme Court rejected the trustee's position,\n\nholding that the payment of the taxes to the IRS was not a\n\nvoidable preference because the funds transferred were not\n\nproperty of the debtor, but rather were held in trust for the\n\ngovernment.   Begier, 496 U.S. at 66-67, 110 S.Ct. at 2267.    In\n\nfinding that a trust existed, the Court relied on a section of\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code, which provided that persons\n\n\n4\n . Begier is not inconsistent with Goldberg's approach. In\nBegier, the Court solely confronted federal issues, so it\nnaturally looked to federal law to determine whether the claimant\nproved a trust relationship. Additionally, the Court looked to\nfederal law to determine whether the claimant identified and\ntraced the trust funds.\n\fwithholding taxes hold the withheld funds in trust for the IRS.5\n\nThe Court also found that the debtor's pre-petition payments of\n\nwithholding amounts to the IRS constituted a sufficient enough\n\nnexus to take the funds out of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n          The city contends that Begier mandates that we reverse\n\nthe district and bankruptcy courts' orders denying the city's\n\nmotion to lift the automatic stay and compel turnover of the\n\nremaining funds withheld.   The district court found two\n\nindependent reasons for denying the city's motion: (1) the city\n\nfailed to show that a statutory trust had been created; and (2)\n\nthe city failed to show the appropriate \"nexus\" between the\n\ndebtor's assets and the withholding funds.   Sharon Steel and\n\nCitibank, as agent for certain of Sharon Steel's creditors,\n\ncontend that the district court correctly held that Begier is\n\ndistinguishable and that therefore we should affirm its order\n\naffirming the bankruptcy court.   Accordingly, we will discuss the\n\ndistrict court's two reasons for denying the City's motion.\nb. Was a trust created in the taxes withheld?\n\n\n          The district court concluded that while there is no\n\n\"statutory authority . . . [for] Farrell's contention that these\n\ntaxes are held in trust,\" the statute involved in Begier, 26\nU.S.C. § 7501, \"expressly designates that taxes withheld by an\n\n\n5\n . The Court quoted: \"'Whenever any person is required to\ncollect or withhold any internal revenue tax from any other\nperson and to pay over such tax to the United States, the amount\nof tax so collected or withheld shall be held to be a special\nfund in trust for the United States.'\" 496 U.S. at 60, 110 S.Ct.\nat 2263 (quoting 26 U.S.C. § 7501).\n\femployer are held in trust for the United States.\"   In re Sharon\n\nSteel Corp., Civ.

W.D. Tenn. 1990).\n\n          We find that under Pennsylvania case law, when Sharon\n\nSteel withheld the city income taxes a trust was created so that\n\nSharon Steel held the funds in trust for the city.   Penn Plaster\n\nis instructive in this regard.   That case involved a suit by the\n\nCity of Philadelphia against a corporation doing business in\n\nPhiladelphia and its president to collect wage taxes withheld by\n\nthe corporation.   As the corporation's president filed\n\n\"preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer,\" the court\n\naccepted Philadelphia's averments as true, finding that \"the\n\ntaxes were collected by the corporation as agent for\n\n[Philadelphia] and that [the president as] the active and\n\ncontrolling officer . . . failed to pay the taxes so collected\n\nover to the City.\"   Penn Plaster, 253 A.2d at 248-49.\nPhiladelphia argued that when the corporation withheld the city\n\fincome tax, the corporation and its president as its controlling\n\nofficer and director became \"trustees of those wage taxes\" and\n\nhad \"a duty to pay those funds over to [Philadelphia].\"    Id. at\n\n248.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed, holding that \"[o]ne\n\nwho collects taxes as agent for a city and fails to pay the same\n\nover to the city has long been held to be a trustee ex\n\nmaleficio.\"   Id. at 249 (citing City of Philadelphia v. Heinel\n\nMotors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3855168\"><a href=\"/opinion/4095666/phila-v-heinel-motors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.

After all, the\n\nprinciple that Penn Plaster's reasoning recognized was premised\n\non the concept that a trust was created when the corporation\n\nwithheld the income taxes.   The court stated that it is\n\nundisputed \"that corporations must act through individuals and\n\nwhere the individuals are the active and controlling officers and\n\nagents of the corporation and they fail to administer the trust\nresponsibilities of the corporation, those responsibilities are\n\nimposed upon the individuals who are responsible for the\n\nperformance of the trust duty.\"   Penn Plaster, 253 A.2d at 125\n\n(emphasis added).   Therefore, Penn Plaster clearly contemplated\n\nthat when a corporation withholds municipal income taxes,\n\nPennsylvania law imposes a \"trust responsibility\" and thus the\n\fcorporation retains the funds withheld as trustee for the\n\nmunicipality.\n\n            Heinel Motors, cited in Penn Plaster, supports our\n\nconclusion that, under Pennsylvania law, a trust is created when\n\nan employer withholds city income taxes.   Heinel Motors involved\n\nthe question of whether a trust is created when a vendor collects\n\nsales tax from a purchaser of goods subject to the tax.    In\n\nmaking its analysis, the Heinel court extensively considered\n\nprecedent regarding the creation of trusts and concluded that the\n\n\"receipt of the tax money by the vendor operates to create a\n\nconstructive trust.\"   Heinel Motors, 16 A.2d at 765.   The court\n\nreasoned, in part, that as the sales tax was imposed on the\n\npurchaser and not on the vendor, the vendor collected the tax as\n\ntrustee for the state.    Indeed, the court recognized the broad\n\nprinciple that \"[e]very person who receives money to be paid to\n\nanother or to be applied to a particular purpose is a trustee[.]\"\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omitted).   Clearly,\n\ntherefore, the tax in Heinel Motors is similar to the withholding\n\ntax at issue here, as in both instances the entity holding the\n\ntax funds is not responsible for the burden of the tax but only\n\nis responsible for collecting it.    See also In re King, 117 B.R.\nat 341.\n\n            We acknowledge that sales taxes are paid to the vendor\n\nby a third party but when income tax is involved the employer had\n\npossession of the funds it withholds prior to paying wages to the\n\nemployee.    However, this distinction does not affect our result.\n\nIn substance, when the employer pays wages and withholds taxes it\n\fis paying the employees' taxes to itself since the employee has\n\nearned his or her entire gross wages.   Indeed, the only reason\n\nthat the employer need not pay the funds withheld to the employee\n\nis that the applicable law requires the employer to withhold the\n\nwages for application on the employee's tax obligations.    Thus,\n\nit would be artificial to characterize the withholding tax\n\nsituation as simply creating a debtor-creditor relationship\n\nbetween the employer and the city.   The real debt is the\n\nemployees' tax liability to the city and the employer is merely\n\nthe conduit for its employees' tax payments.   Consequently, we\n\nhold that under Pennsylvania law Sharon Steel held the\n\nwithholding taxes in trust for the City of Farrell.6\n 6\n  . In re Markos Gurnee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1940851\"><a href=\"/opinion/1940851/in-re-markos-gurnee-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, does not conflict with\nour conclusion. There, the Illinois Department of Revenue\nclaimed that it had a trust-fund interest in the debtor's general\nassets to the extent of unpaid hotel occupation and use taxes.\nMarkos Gurnee, 163 B.R. at 127. The court held against the\nstate, reasoning that the statutes creating the hotel occupation\nand use taxes did not \"create a trust in favor of the state.\"\nId. at 130.\n\n          But as the Markos Gurnee court recognized, the hotel\noccupation and use taxes differed from the type of trust-fund\ntaxes involved in Begier. The Markos Gurnee court stated that\nthe \"theory of 'trust fund taxes' (like income tax withholding)\nis that the tax is imposed on one party (for example, an\nemployee), but is collected and held by another party (for\nexample, the employer).\" Id. The court held that this theory\nwas inapplicable to the occupation tax \"since the tax is imposed\ndirectly on hotel operators, not their customers.\" Id. As to\nthe use tax, the court held that the statute's plain language\nshows that state is a creditor and \"not in the position of a\"\nbeneficiary. Id. at 131-32. Thus, Markos Gurnee is\ndistinguishable from this case, because the occupation tax is a\ndirect tax on the hotel while the City of Farrell income tax is a\ndirect tax on the employees and not on Sharon Steel, and because\nthe Illinois use tax statute's plain language merely creates a\ndebtor-creditor relationship between the taxing authority and the\nparty responsible for remitting the taxes.\n\fc. Does the source of the trust distinguish this case from\n\nBegier?\n\n          We must now decide whether the trust created under\n\nPennsylvania law warrants the same treatment as the trust created\n\nunder the statute in Begier, 26 U.S.C. § 7501.    Section 7501\n\nprovides that \"[w]henever any person is required to collect or\n\nwithhold any internal revenue tax from any other person and to\n\npay over such tax to the United States, the amount of tax so\n\ncollected or withheld shall be held to be a special fund in trust\n\nfor the United States.\"    According to the Begier Court, this\n\nstatutory trust extends \"only to 'the amount of tax so collected\n\nor withheld,'\" and that the trust is created \"at the moment\" the\n\nemployer paid its employees' wages.    Begier, 496 U.S. at 60-61,\n\n110 S.Ct. at 2263-64.     Moreover, Begier rejected the argument\n\nthat segregation of the withheld funds was a prerequisite to the\n\ncreation of a trust.    Id. at 60-61, 110 S.Ct. at 2264.\n\n(..continued)\n\n          We also recognize the following additional point. It\nis conceivable that an employer paying wages might not have the\nfunds to pay the gross wages in full, though it could pay the\nemployees their net wages after withholding. In that event it\nreasonably could be argued that no trust has been created in the\n\"withheld\" taxes as there were no funds to withhold. Clearly,\nthe larger the amount of taxes to be deducted the more plausible\nwould be the argument that a trust had not been created.\nHowever, while we recognize the plausibility of this argument, we\ndo not address it because neither Sharon Steel nor Citibank\nraises it. Furthermore, we doubt that there would be a factual\npredicate for the argument because the City of Farrell income tax\nrate was 1% when it was enacted, and we believe it was 1.5% by\n1992.\n\f          We find no significant distinction between the trust\n\ncreated under section 7501 with respect to federal withholding\n\nand the trust created under Pennsylvania law with respect\n\nwithholding of local income taxes.    First, both statutory schemes\n\nrequire that the employer withhold the appropriate portion of\n\nincome when it pays wages to its employees.7   Thus, as\n\nPennsylvania case law establishes that a trust is created when\n\nthe tax is withheld and as section 7501 creates an express trust\n\nin funds withheld, it is clear that under both statutory regimes\n\nthe trust is created when the employer pays the wages.\n\n          Second, the Begier Court's primary reason for rejecting\n\nthe argument that segregation of the withheld funds is a\n\nprerequisite to the creation of a trust applies with equal force\n\nin this case.    Begier stated that requiring segregation as a\n\nprerequisite to the creation of the trust would \"mean that an\n\nemployer could avoid the creation of a trust simply by refusing\n\nto segregate.\"    496 U.S. at 61, 110 S.Ct. at 2264.      Thus, if\n\nwe were to hold that a trust was not created under Pennsylvania\n\nlaw because Sharon Steel did not segregate the withholding funds,\n\nwe would be eviscerating the concept expressed in Penn Plaster\nthat \"[o]ne who collects taxes as agent for a city and fails to\n\n\n7\n . See Begier, 496 U.S. at 60, 110 S.Ct. at 2264 (\"Section\n3402(a)(1) requires that 'every employer making payments of wages\nshall deduct and withhold upon such wages [the employee's federal\nincome tax].'\") (emphasis added); and see City of Farrell\nOrdinance No. 0-17-66, § 5(b) (\"Every employer having . . . [a]\nplace of business within the City of Farrell . . . shall deduct\nat the time of payment thereof, the tax imposed by this Ordinance\non the earned income due to his employe or employes.\").\n\fpay the same over to the city has long been held to be a trustee\n\nex maleficio.\"   253 A.2d at 249.   This would occur because, then,\n\nan employer could avoid creating a trust simply by commingling\n\nthe withholding funds with its other assets.\n\n           Moreover, we must recognize the city's equitable\n\ninterest in the funds withheld even though Pennsylvania law and\n\nthe city ordinance do not create an express trust in the withheld\n\nfunds.   Whatever may be true in other contexts, the distinction\n\nbetween a direct trust (i.e. one expressly created by the\n\nparties) and a constructive trust (i.e. one imposed by law) has\n\nno relevance to the issues on this appeal.      As we recently\n\nstated, \"Congress clearly intended the exclusion [of trust funds\n\nfrom the debtor's estate] created by section 541(d) to include\n\nnot only funds held in express trust, but also funds held in\n\nconstructive trust.\"   In re Columbia Gas, 997 F.2d at 1059\n\n(citing H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 368 (1977),\n\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6324).\n\n           We are not alone in this approach.    The Court of\n\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, in In re Unicom Computer Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659949\"><a href=\"/opinion/659949/in-re-unicom-computer-corporation-aka-unicom-communications-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (9th Cir. 1994), even more recently indicated,\n\n\"[a]lthough we have never expressly held that the same rule\n\n(viz., funds held in trust are property neither of the debtor nor\n\nof the bankruptcy estate) should apply as well to situations\n\ninvolving funds held by a debtor in constructive trust, the rule\n\nwould seem to apply with equal force to both situations.\"\n\nTherefore, since we have recognized that the crux of this appeal\n\nis whether the withholding funds fall within section 541(d)'s\n\fexception to \"property of the estate,\" the fact that the trust at\n\nissue is constructive rather than express has no bearing on our\n\ndecision.    Accordingly, we find no reason not to analyze the\n\ntrust in this case in the same manner as Begier analyzed the\n\ntrust created by 26 U.S.C. § 7501.    We hold that because a trust\n\nwas created under Pennsylvania law when Sharon Steel withheld the\n\nincome tax, the district court erred when it held that the City\n\nof Farrell did not show a trust relationship.\n\nd.   Has the city satisfied Begier's \"nexus\" requirement?\n\n            In Begier, after the Court concluded that a trust was\n\ncreated \"at the moment\" of wage payment, it analyzed whether \"the\n\nparticular dollars that     . . . [the debtor] paid to the IRS were\n\n'property of the debtor.'\"    Begier, 496 U.S. at 61, 110 S.Ct. at\n\n2264 (emphasis added).    In other words, the Court wrestled with\n\nhow to determine whether the \"assets transferred to the IRS            .\n\n. . were trust property.\"    Id. at 62, 110 S.Ct. at 2265.    This\n\ninquiry mirrors the second part of our Goldberg test, i.e.\n\nwhether the claimant identified and traced the trust funds.      See\n\n932 F.2d at 280.\n\n            Because the statute creating the trust considered in\n\nBegier, section 7501, provided no guidance on this issue, the\nCourt stated that it \"might naturally begin with the common-law\n\nrules that have been created to answer such questions about other\n\nvarieties of trusts.\"    496 U.S. at 61, 110 S.Ct. at 2265.   The\n\nCourt, however, concluded that \"[c]ommon-law tracing rules . . .\n\nare unhelpful in this special context,\" reasoning that \"[u]nlike\n\na common-law trust, in which the settlor sets aside particular\n\fproperty as the trust res, § 7501 creates a trust in an abstract\n\n'amount'-- a dollar figure not tied to any particular assets --\n\nrather than in the actual dollars withheld.\"   Id. at 62-63, 110\n\nS.Ct. at 2265 (emphasis added).   As we have concluded that we\n\nshould analyze the trust in this case as Begier analyzed a\n\nsection 7501 trust, we find that the common-law tracing rules\n\nshould not apply to our decision on whether the city has\n\nsatisfied Begier's nexus requirement.\n\n          Were it not for Begier, our task would be more\n\ndifficult because of the Supreme Court's opinion in United States\n\nv. Randall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108292\"><a href=\"/opinion/108292/united-states-v-randall/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108292\"><a href=\"/opinion/108292/united-states-v-randall/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).    In Randall, the\n\nCourt confronted a situation very similar to this appeal.    There,\n\nthe United States sought, in the bankruptcy proceeding, to\n\nsatisfy the debtor's pre-petition tax obligations from the\n\ndebtor's post-petition general assets.   The United States argued\n\nthat the debtor held an amount representing the tax obligation in\n\ntrust for the government and that this amount could be traced to\n\nthe debtor's funds when the petition was filed.   In response, the\n\ntrustee argued that no trust had been created because the debtor\n\ndid not segregate any funds for the tax obligation.   The Court\n\ndid not accept either argument.   Instead, it held that the IRS\n\ncould not recover the taxes ahead of administrative expenses,\n\nreasoning that \"the statutory policy of subordinating taxes to\n\ncosts and expenses of administration would not be served by\n\ncreating or enforcing trusts which eat up an estate, leaving\n\nlittle or nothing for creditors and court officers whose goods\n\nand services created the assets.\"   Id. at 517, 91 S.Ct. at 994.\n\f           Were we to apply Randall on this appeal, we probably\n\nwould affirm the district court's order on the basis that a\n\ntaxing authority's trust interest in a debtor's pre-petition tax\n\nobligation does not justify granting the authority priority over\n\nclaims for administrative expenses.   Begier, however, held that\n\nthe \"strict rule of Randall . . . did not survive the adoption of\n\nthe new Bankruptcy Code\" section 541.   Begier, 496 U.S. at 65,\n\n110 S.Ct. at 2266.   The Court's reasons for holding that section\n\n541 displaced the holding in Randall are helpful in shedding\n\nlight on the nexus requirement.\n\n           In reaching its decision, the Begier Court first\n\ncompared the Senate and House bills that led to the enactment of\n\nsection 541.   Begier stated that the \"Senate bill attacked\n\nRandall directly, providing in § 541 that trust-fund taxes\n\nwithheld or collected prior to the filing of the bankruptcy\n\npetition were not 'property of the estate.'\"   Begier, 496 U.S. at\n\n63-64, 110 S.Ct. at 2265 (citing S. Rep. No. 95-1106, at 33\n\n(1978)).   As to the House bill, Begier stated that while the\n\n\"bill did not deal explicitly with the problem of trust fund\n\ntaxes, . . . the House Report stated that 'property of the\n\nestate' would not include property held in trust for another.\"\n\nBegier, 496 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2265-66 (citing H.R. Rep.\nNo. 95-595, at 368 (1977)).   Congress's final compromise in\n\nenacting the portion of section 541 that deals with post-petition\n\ntransfers, according to Begier, \"explicitly provided that 'in the\n\ncase of property held in trust, the property of the estate\n\nincludes the legal title, but not the beneficial interest of the\n\fproperty.'\"     Begier, 496 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2266 (citing\n\n124 Cong. Rec. at 32,417 (remarks of Representative Edwards)).\n\n            Next, Begier took the unusual step of treating the\n\nfloor statements of a representative \"as persuasive evidence of\n\ncongressional intent.\"     Begier, 496 U.S. at 64 n.5, 110 S.Ct. at\n\n2266 n.5.     The Court quoted Representative Edwards for the\n\nproposition that \"the Senate language specifying that withheld or\n\ncollected trust-fund taxes are not part of the bankruptcy estate\n\nwas deleted as 'unnecessary since property of the estate does not\n\ninclude the beneficial interest in property held by the debtor as\n\ntrustee.'\"    Id. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2266 (citing 124 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 32,417).\n\n             Additionally, Begier placed great weight on\n\nRepresentative Edwards' subsequent discussion of \"the effects of\n\nthe House language on the rule established by Randall\":\n          [A] serious problem exists where 'trust fund\n          taxes' withheld from others are held to be\n          property of the estate where the withheld amounts\n          are commingled with other assets of the debtor.\n          The courts should permit the use of reasonable\n          assumptions under which the Internal Revenue\n          Service, and other tax authorities, can\n          demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are\n          still in the possession of the debtor at the\n          commencement of the case.\n\n\nBegier, 496 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2266 (citing 124 Cong. Rec.\nat 32,417).    From this statement, the Court concluded that \"by\n\nrequiring the IRS to 'demonstrate that amounts withheld are still\n\nin possession of the debtor at the commencement of the case'\n\n[i.e. at the filing of the petition] . . . , Congress expected\n\nthat the IRS would have to show some connection between the §\n\f7501 trust and the assets sought to be applied to a debtor's\n\ntrust-fund tax obligations.\"   Begier, 496 U.S. at 65-66, 110\n\nS.Ct. at 2266 (emphasis added).   The Court continued by asking\n\njust \"how extensive the required nexus must be.\"    Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).   Answering that question, the Court held that in Begier\n\nthe pre-petition payment to the IRS satisfied the nexus\n\nrequirement.8   Id. at 67, 110 S.Ct. at 2267.   Thus, as Begier\n\ninvolved a pre-petition payment, while here we have no such\n\n8\n . In explaining this \"nexus\" requirement, Begier stated that\nthe \"Bankruptcy Code provides no explicit answer, and\nRepresentative Edwards' admonition that courts should 'permit\nreasonable assumptions' does not add much.\" Begier, 496 U.S. at\n66, 110 S.Ct. at 2266. Accordingly, the Court looked to the\nfollowing statement from the House Report for guidance:\n\n           'A payment of withholding taxes constitutes a\n           payment of money held in trust under Internal\n           Revenue Code § 7501(a), and thus will not be a\n           preference because the beneficiary of the trust,\n           the taxing authority, is in a separate class with\n           respect to those taxes, if they have been properly\n           held for payment, as they will have been if the\n           debtor is able to make the payments.'\n\nId. at 66, 110 S.Ct. at 2267 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at\n368 (1977), 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6324). \"In the absence of any\nsuggestion in the Bankruptcy Code about what tracing rules to\napply,\" the Court adopted a literal reading of the above quote.\nUnder this literal reading, the Court held that \"any voluntary\nprepetition payment of trust-fund taxes out of the debtor's\nassets [satisfies the nexus requirement and therefore] is not a\ntransfer of the debtor's property.\" Begier, 496 U.S. at 67, 110\nS.Ct. at 2267.\n\n          This holding does not control the situation before us,\nbecause Begier involved a pre-petition payment to the taxing\nauthority, while here we confront the taxing authority's attempt\nto collect the taxes from the debtor's post-petition general\nassets. Of course, the holding that an actual pre-petition\npayment will satisfy the nexus requirement does not mean that the\nrequirement cannot be satisfied in some other way.\n\fpayment, we cannot draw a conclusion from Begier as to whether\n\nthe City of Farrell has met the nexus requirement.\n\n          Nevertheless Sharon Steel argues that as \"it is\n\nundisputed that the [t]axes were not held in a segregated account\n\n. . . [or] paid prepetition, . . . the required nexus cannot be\n\nestablished.\"   Brief at 13 (emphasis added).   But its argument\n\nmisconstrues Begier's nexus requirement, because it contemplates\n\nthat the nexus requirement is met only if the employer had\n\nsegregated the trust fund taxes or transferred them to the taxing\n\nauthority before the petition.   Yet Begier's reliance on\n\nRepresentative Edwards' remarks shows that the taxing authorities\n\nshould be able to show that the nexus requirement is satisfied in\n\nother ways.9\n9\n .

E.D. Tenn.\n1991), for the proposition that the \"City of Farrell cannot\nestablish the required nexus with regard to the commingled funds\nin [Sharon Steel's] possession.\" In re Sharon Steel Corp., 152\nB.R. at 451-52. Kulzer is readily distinguishable as it did not\ninvolve a taxing authority, but involved private parties'\nattempts to collect funds that were commingled in the debtor's\ngeneral assets. The bankruptcy court rejected the attempt\nbecause the claimants had not established that the funds were\nheld in either an express or a constructive trust. 139 B.R. at\n141. Of course, even if Kulzer were not distinguishable we would\nnot be bound to follow it.\n\n          Russman, however, though concerning sales taxes, raises\ntrust-fund issues similar to those in this case. Russman held\nthat a state taxing authority had satisfied Begier's nexus\nrequirement with respect to segregated funds but had not\nsatisfied the nexus requirement \"with regard to the commingled\nfunds remaining on deposit in the trustee's general operating\naccount.\" Russman, 125 B.R. at 524. But the court reached its\nconclusion with respect to the commingled funds without analysis\nand in these circumstances we do not find the opinion persuasive.\n\f          Because the Begier Court relied heavily on\n\nRepresentative Edwards' remarks when deciding whether the pre-\n\npetition transfer satisfied the nexus requirement, we will give\n\nhis remarks similar weight in considering whether the City of\n\nFarrell has satisfied the nexus requirement.   Specifically, as\n\npartially quoted earlier, Representative Edwards stated that:\n               Where it is not possible for the Internal\n          Revenue Service to demonstrate that the amounts of\n          taxes withheld are still in the possession of the\n          debtor at the commencement of the case, present\n          law generally includes amounts of withheld taxes\n          as property of the estate. . . . Nonetheless, a\n          serious problem exists where 'trust fund taxes'\n          withheld from others are held to be property of\n          the estate where the withheld amounts are\n          commingled with other assets of the debtor. The\n          Courts should permit the use of reasonable\n          assumptions under which the Internal Revenue\n          Service, and other taxing authorities, can\n          demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are\n          still in the possession of the debtor at the\n          commencement of the case. For example, where the\n          debtor had commingled that amount of withheld\n          taxes in his general checking account, it might be\n          reasonable to assume that any remaining amounts in\n          that account on the commencement of the case are\n          withheld taxes.\n\n\n124 Cong. Rec. at 11,047.   Thus, Representative Edwards spoke\n\nabout a situation in which an employer commingles the trust-fund\n\ntaxes in its general checking account and subsequently files for\n\nbankruptcy without having paid the taxes to the appropriate\n\ntaxing authority.\n\n          We, however, face an insurmountable hurdle barring us\n\nfrom deciding whether the City of Farrell has satisfied the nexus\n\nrequirement, because neither the bankruptcy court nor the\n\ndistrict court made findings of fact on which we could predicate\n\fsuch a determination.   This omission is understandable, since the\n\nbankruptcy court and district court believed that the city could\n\nnot satisfy the nexus requirement as Sharon Steel's funds were\n\ncommingled and Sharon Steel did not pay the taxes before it filed\n\nits Chapter 11 petition.   Nevertheless Representative Edwards'\n\nexample of what \"might\" constitute a reasonable assumption could\n\nbe applicable here.10\n\n          As we have indicated, Representative Edwards stated\n\nthat \"where the debtor had commingled [the] amount of withheld\n\ntaxes in his general checking account, it might be reasonable to\n\nassume that any remaining amounts in that account on the\n\ncommencement of the case are withheld taxes.\"   Sharon Steel\n\nconcedes that before it filed for bankruptcy, Citibank\n\n\"controlled all monies coming into Sharon Steel through a lock\n\nbox account . . . [and] Citibank would authorize disbursement of\n\nfunds from the [l]ock [b]ox [a]ccount to Sharon Steel's operating\n\n\n10\n . We recognize that allowing courts to consider commingling in\ndeciding whether a sufficient nexus exists runs counter to our\nholding above that a party should not be able to defeat a trust\n\"simply by commingling the withholding funds with its other\nassets.\" See typescript at 15. Nonetheless, as the Supreme\nCourt held in Begier, the question of whether a trust exists is\nanalytically distinct from whether or not the trust funds are\ntraceable and identifiable. The first question involves an\ninquiry into state law; the second does not. Therefore,\nconsiderations relevant to the first question are not always\ncoextensive with considerations relevant to the second. To some\nextent, however, Representative Edwards' comments were intended\nto make equitable considerations part of the \"nexus\" inquiry as\nwell. Thus, when applying the guidelines we set forth to\ndetermine whether a nexus exists, the bankruptcy court certainly\nshould keep in mind the broader policy against allowing a party\nunilaterally to make a trust unenforceable by commingling assets.\n\faccounts.\"    Brief at 3.   Thus, as Sharon Steel's funds were\n\nplaced in the lock box account, it would be reasonable to\n\nconclude that the withheld funds were held in trust for the City\n\nof Farrell in that account.     Moreover, when Sharon Steel filed\n\nits Chapter 11 petition the lock box account may have contained\n\nan amount of funds exceeding the remaining withholding held in\n\ntrust for the City.    If so, we have the exact set of facts that\n\nRepresentative Edwards contemplated:     i.e. pre-petition trust-\n\nfund taxes commingled in the debtor's general checking account.11\n\n             Because it is manifest that we do not know sufficient\n\nfacts to determine whether the City of Farrell has met the nexus\n\nrequirement, we will remand the case to the district court which\n\nin turn will remand it to the bankruptcy court for appropriate\n\nfact finding.    The district court and the bankruptcy court should\n\nbe cognizant of the factual findings necessary to apply the\n\n\"lowest intermediate balance test\" (\"LIBT\").     The LIBT is a\n\njudicial construct that some federal courts have applied to ease\n\na beneficiary's tracing burden when \"a trustee commingles trust\nfunds with other monies in a single account.\"     In re Columbia\n\nGas, 997 F.2d at 1063.      The LIBT \"allows trust beneficiaries to\n\nassume that trust funds are withdrawn last from a commingled\n\n\n11\n . We reject any argument that because the City of Farrell is\nnot the IRS, it should not receive the benefits of Representative\nEdwards' remarks. He specifically stated that \"[t]he Courts\nshould permit the use of reasonable assumptions under which the\nInternal Revenue Service, and other taxing authorities, can\ndemonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are still in the\npossession of the debtor at the commencement of the case.\" Thus,\nwe cannot limit the application of his statement to the IRS.\n\faccount.   Once trust money is removed, however, it is not\n\nreplenished by subsequent deposits.   Therefore, the lowest\n\nintermediate balance in a commingled account represents trust\n\nfunds that have never been dissipated and which are reasonably\n\nidentifiable.\"   Id.\n\n           At this time we do not decide definitively that the\n\ndistrict court and the bankruptcy court must apply the LIBT as\n\nthe parties have not briefed the issue and neither the bankruptcy\n\ncourt nor the district court addressed the applicability of the\n\nLIBT.   But, as we recognize that the LIBT may constitute a\n\n\"reasonable assumption[] under which the Internal Revenue\n\nService, and other taxing authorities, can demonstrate that\n\namounts of withheld taxes are still in the possession of the\n\ndebtor at the commencement of the case[,]\" we will instruct that\n\non remand, the bankruptcy court make factual findings sufficient\n\nto support a conclusion as to whether the city may recover if, as\n\na matter of law, the LIBT is applied.\n\n           Sharon Steel also contends that the city did not\n\nrequest discovery and relied exclusively on Begier in the\n\nbankruptcy court.   Thus, in Sharon Steel's view, the city has\n\nwaived its rights to discovery and we therefore should not remand\n\nfor additional fact-finding.   Brief at 8-9.   The city responds\n\nthat the procedural posture of the case in the bankruptcy court\n\nprecluded it from obtaining discovery.   We need not linger on\n\nthis point as Sharon Steel's argument necessarily is predicated\n\non its contention that we must apply a clearly erroneous standard\n\nof review to the bankruptcy court's finding that \"[t]he City of\n\fFarrell cannot establish the required nexus with regard to the\n\ncommingled funds in [Sharon Steel's] possession.\"     Brief at 10.\n\nThe bankruptcy court made this finding on the basis of its\n\ncorrect observation that \"there is no allegation that there\n\nexists a segregated trust fund and the amount in question has not\n\nbeen paid.\"    In re Sharon Steel Corp., 152 B.R. at 451.   In view\n\nof those legal conclusions drawn from undisputed facts it would\n\nhave been pointless for the city to request discovery as the\n\ndiscovery would not have been directed to the issues which the\n\nbankruptcy court thought were outcome determinative as a matter\n\nof law.   Rather, discovery could be germane only to determine the\n\nstatus of funds that Sharon Steel had neither segregated nor paid\n\nbefore filing its Chapter 11 petition.      Accordingly, in light of\n\nour legal conclusion that the bankruptcy court misstated the law,\n\nit is only fair that the parties have an opportunity to develop\n\nthe facts relating to the broader method of satisfying the nexus\n\nrequirement which we recognize.    Consequently, we reject Sharon\n\nSteel's argument that we should not remand for additional factual\n\nfindings.\n\n            We deal with one final point.   Citibank, as agent for\n\ncertain lenders, asserts that \"the only source of funds available\n\nto pay the taxes is the Cash Collateral Account which secures\n\n[Sharon Steel's] obligations to the Lenders under\" a prepetition\n\ncredit agreement on which the lenders have a prior lien.\n\nTherefore in its view the taxes cannot be paid without the\n\nlenders' consent.    It concludes the taxes cannot be paid at all\n\nas the lenders do not consent.    Brief at 10-11.    Neither the\n\fdistrict court nor the bankruptcy court considered this issue and\n\nthe parties have not briefed it on this appeal, though Citibank\n\nhas mentioned the point in a conclusory fashion.   Furthermore,\n\nthe record is not clear as to exactly how Citibank and Sharon\n\nSteel treated Sharon Steel's funds.   In these circumstances we\n\nare satisfied that we should not address Citibank's argument but\n\nwe reach our result without prejudice to Citibank's position on\n\nthis point which it may advance on the remand.\n\n          In sum, therefore, we will reverse the district court's\n\norder of February 14, 1994, and will remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nSpecifically, on further remand, the bankruptcy court should make\n\nfactual findings about Sharon Steel's payment of wages and the\n\nwithholding, i.e. the accounts in which the withholding was\n\nplaced, the deposit and withdrawal history of those accounts, and\n\nthe amounts remaining in those accounts at the time Sharon Steel\n\nfiled its bankruptcy petition.   Furthermore, Citibank may assert\n\nthat the lenders which it represents have a lien on the funds\n\nfrom which the city seeks payment.\n\f</pre>",
