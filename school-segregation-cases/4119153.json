Public and private pension plans alike often include cost-of-\nliving adjustments to base benefits so that plan participants can receive the real value of those\nbenefits. One way to calculate such adjustments is to make them dependent on yearly changes in\nthe consumer price index.     For more than four decades, the Tennessee Valley Authority\nRetirement System (TVARS) did just that. Employees of the Tennessee Valley Authority\n(TVA), who participate in TVARS-managed retirement plans, thus received cost-of-living\nadjustments on top of their investment returns, pension benefits, and supplemental benefits. That\nchanged in 2009. In that year, with the retirement system’s financial health in jeopardy, the\nTVARS board amended the rules that govern the system to cap or eliminate cost-of-living\nadjustments for the years 2010–2013, increase the eligibility age for cost-of-living adjustments,\nand lower the interest rate on a savings fund. The complaint in this case soon followed, with the\nplaintiffs arguing—among other things—that cost-of-living adjustments are vested benefits and\nthat the TVARS board violated one of its own rules by reducing such a benefit. The plaintiffs\nalso raised a Takings Clause claim.\n\n       None of the claims survived summary judgment. According to the district court, the\nplaintiffs did not have a private right of action to enforce the board’s compliance with the\nTVARS rules, and the Takings claim failed on the merits.           Despite having adopted the\n2009 amendments, the TVARS now professes that it did so in error, agreeing with the plaintiffs\nthat courts may review the board’s 2009 actions and that cost-of-living adjustments are vested.\nThe TVA disagrees on the vesting issue.\n\n       Summary judgment in favor of the TVA and the TVARS was proper on the Takings\nClause claim. Because cost-of-living adjustments are not vested, the agencies were also entitled\n\fNo. 15-6019                       Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                        Page 3\n\n\nto summary judgment on the merits of the claim that the board violated TVARS rules by\nreducing vested benefits. As for the remaining claims alleging violations of the TVARS rules,\nthose claims are judicially reviewable in the context of this case. Remand is therefore required\nfor the district court to address those claims in the first instance.\n\n        In 1933, Congress created the TVA, a federal agency that is organized and operated as a\ncorporation. See Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, 16 U.S.C. §§ 831 et seq. Several\nyears later, the TVA established the TVARS for the purpose of managing the retirement plans of\nTVA employees, who become members of the retirement system upon accepting employment.\nThe TVA created the TVARS by promulgating Rules and Regulations (the Rules), which\nestablished how the retirement system would be administered and what benefits would be\npayable to plan participants. As the system is a governmental pension plan, it is not governed by\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).                    See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1002(32),\n1003(b)(1). The TVA’s statutory authority to create the retirement system has long been beyond\nquestion. See Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Kinzer, 142 F.2d 833, 836–37 (6th Cir. 1944).\n\n        According to the Rules, the TVARS is governed by a seven-member board. Rule 3.1,\nRules     and     Regulations      of     the    TVA       Retirement      System,     available   at\nhttp://www.tvars.com/pdf/tvars_rules_regs.pdf (last visited June 22, 2016). Three of the board’s\nmembers are elected by TVA employees, three others are appointed by the TVA, and the last\nboard member is selected by a majority vote of the other six. Id. The relationship between the\nTVARS and the TVA is unique. Although the TVARS was created by the TVA, it is operated\nfor the benefit of TVA employees. The TVARS board was accordingly given broad authority to\nmanage the retirement system, including decision-making responsibility on investment\nportfolios, the “interest rate or rates to be used in all actuarial and other calculations,” and what\nbenefits are payable and to whom. Rule 3.7, 4.1, 4.5. The board was also entrusted with the\npower to amend the Rules, from “time to time [and] as may be necessary to carry out the\nprovisions of the Retirement System.” Rule 3.6. Notwithstanding this extensive power, the\nindependence of the TVARS from the TVA remains cabined in significant ways. Almost all of\nthe retirement system’s funding comes from the TVA, and the board must submit to the TVA\nannual reports on the system’s financial condition.          Rule 3.5, 9.B.1, 9.B.5.     The board’s\n\fNo. 15-6019                          Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                              Page 4\n\n\namendment prerogative is circumscribed by the Rules, too. For one thing, the TVA wields a\nveto power: amendments proposed by the board become effective only if the TVA does not\nexercise its veto within thirty days. Rule 13. In addition, Rule 13 contains a so-called anti-\ncutback provision, prohibiting amendments that “reduce the then accrued benefits of the existing\nmembers or beneficiaries which are nonforfeitable or [are] covered by accumulated reserves held\ntherefor.” This appeal hinges on the anti-cutback provision, as the plaintiffs’ chief argument is\nthat the TVARS violated Rule 13 by reducing cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for the years\n2010–2013.\n\n        The plaintiffs in this case are among the 36,000 current and former TVA employees who\nparticipate in the retirement system. Two-thirds of the participants are retired. Under the Rules,\nthe retirement income of those participants comes from four sources. First, eligible beneficiaries\nreceive a monthly pension benefit in an amount linked to their average compensation and years\nof service.1 Rule 6.A.2, 7.C. Second, beneficiaries receive a monthly supplemental benefit that\nis related to the costs of medical insurance. Rule 18.A–B. Third, beneficiaries have the option\nof contributing to a fixed-rate fund or variable-rate fund, both of which are managed by the\nTVARS. Rule 9.A, 19.A. The interest rate for the fixed fund was lowered by the 2009 rule\namendments that are at issue in this case. Fourth, beneficiaries may receive COLAs, payments\nthat increase pension and supplemental benefits based on yearly changes in the consumer price\nindex (CPI). Excepting the years at issue in this case, COLAs are triggered as follows:\n\n        The board shall increase (subject, however, to the provisions of section 11) that\n        portion of the monthly benefit payable to each retiree, or beneficiary of a\n        deceased member or retiree, which is derived from TVA’s contributions to the\n        System . . . whenever the 12-month average of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n        for any year after 1966 exceeds by as much as one percent (1%) the CPI average\n        for the preceding year.\n\nRule 6.I, 7.L; see also Rule 18.C.3. By tying COLAs to the CPI, the Rules preserve the\npurchasing power of pension and supplemental benefits.\n\n\n\n        1\n          Two types of benefit plans are now in place. One of those plans—the “original benefit structure”—was\nclosed to new entrants in December 1995, and is covered by Rule 6. Provisions concerning the more recent plan, the\n“cash balance benefit structure,” are in Rule 7. The differences in these plans are not relevant to this appeal.\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                        Page 5\n\n\n       COLAs have not always been a part of the retirement system.                That feature was\nimplemented in 1967, when the board amended the Rules to apply COLAs to benefits based on\nTVA contributions. Later amendments contained language explicitly committing the TVA to\nfunding COLAs: “[a] further ‘cost-of-living contribution’” to the TVARS, in addition to two\nother types of contributions, “shall be made [by the TVA] to provide the funds to pay for\nincreases in monthly benefits.” Rule 9.B.1. The Rules make clear that COLAs are an important\nfeature of the retirement system. According to one provision, “[t]he total amount payable each\nyear by TVA to the Retirement System shall be not less than the sum of the normal contribution\nrate and the accrued liability contribution rate . . . plus cost-of-living contributions.” Rule 9.B.5.\nAs for the amount of a COLA, one provision gives the board some discretion to depart from the\nCPI formula: “the board may, in its discretion and with the approval of TVA, apply for any year\na maximum different from [a 5% cap].” Rule 6.I, 7.L.\n\n       Another round of amendments followed soon after, in 1974. Prior to that date, none of\nthe benefits provided to beneficiaries was vested, a term that the parties agree is synonymous\nwith nonforfeitable. That meant that the Rules did not prevent the board from reducing a\nparticipant’s future benefits. After the enactment of ERISA, however, the board decided to\nguarantee certain categories of benefits instead of offering the plan-termination insurance that\nERISA required for private pensions. Although ERISA does not apply to the retirement system,\nthe board took this action in recognition of the congressional intention that employers should\nfollow through with their financial commitments to employees. Rule 13 was therefore amended\nto include the anti-cutback provision, which protects accrued benefits that are vested. Rule\n11.B.1, the only rule defining what benefits are vested, indicates that “[r]ights to benefits based\non a member’s own contributions shall be nonforfeitable.” Also vested, according to Rule\n11.B.1, are certain “accrued benefits from creditable service based on TVA’s contributions,” and\ncash balance benefits distributed after five years of cash balance service.\n\n       This case, like many others, has its genesis in the recession of the late 2000s. During that\ntime, the liabilities of the TVARS grew to exceed its assets by $3 billion. In June 2009, the\nTVARS made its annual contribution request to the TVA for the following year, asking for $300\nmillion to keep the system afloat. The TVA countered with a proposal to give the TVARS $1\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 6\n\n\nbillion, a lump sum that would be conditioned on a TVARS promise not to request additional\nfunds until 2014. In the TVA’s counterproposal, the agency also suggested that the TVARS\nreduce its liabilities by lowering COLAs for the years 2010–2013, increasing the COLA-\neligibility age for TVA employees, and reducing the annual interest rate on the fixed-rate fund.\nOn August 16, 2009, a special TVARS board meeting was called for the following day. In this\nlitigation, one board member has asserted that she was not made aware of the purpose of the\nmeeting until several hours beforehand. Other evidence suggests, however, that the question of\nwhether COLAs are vested had been the subject of some discussion before that meeting, as board\nchairman Frank Alford had asked in July 2009 for an actuary’s opinion on that question. By a 4-\n3 vote, the board approved amendments to the Rules that were consistent with the TVA’s\ncounterproposal. The thirty-day period passed without a TVA veto.\n\n       The changes to the Rules increased the COLA-eligibility age from 55 to 60 for\nparticipants retiring in 2010 or after, and decreased the interest rate on the fixed fund from 7.25%\nto 6%. Rule 6.I, 7.L, 18.C; Appendix Rule 17. The amendments also eliminated COLAs for\n2010 and 2012, and capped them at 3% and 2.5% for 2011 and 2013. Rule 6.I, 7.L, 18.C. The\namendments had their intended effect. Deposition testimony indicates that the changes reduced\nthe retirement system’s potential liabilities by over $200 million.\n\n       The named plaintiffs in this case—which is styled as a class action—took issue with the\namendments, filing suit against the board’s directors in federal court. An amended complaint\nnamed only the TVA and the TVARS as defendants. In that complaint, the plaintiffs asserted\nthat the board’s actions violated several provisions of the Rules. Among other things, the\nplaintiffs alleged that: Rule 13 prohibited the TVARS from capping COLAs, from increasing the\nCOLA-eligibility age, and from decreasing the interest rate on the fixed fund; the TVA was\nrequired to make annual contributions to the TVARS; the board did not give plan participants\nproper notice for the amendments; and the board violated provisions related to an account called\nthe “Excess COLA Account.” Although the complaint was not entirely clear on the proper\nvehicle for asserting the Rules-violation arguments, it asserted those arguments primarily under\nfiduciary-duty and declaratory-judgment counts.       In addition to those claims, the plaintiffs\ncharged the board with violating the procedural and substantive protections of the Administrative\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 7\n\n\nProcedure Act (APA). Finally, the plaintiffs asserted a Takings Clause claim based on the 2009\namendments, maintaining that the board’s actions deprived plan participants of protected\nproperty interests.\n\n       After discovery, the TVA moved for summary judgment, arguing that the board’s actions\nwere valid under the Rules. The TVA conceded that “[t]he arbitrary and capricious standard of\nreview applies here regardless of whether TVARS is an agency within the meaning of the APA,”\nand did not argue that the plaintiffs’ Rules-violation arguments were not reviewable. The\nplaintiffs also filed a partial motion for summary judgment on the question of liability for each\nclaim. The TVARS filed a single “response” to both motions. Although the TVARS agreed\nwith the TVA that the APA does not apply to the TVARS and that there was no merit to the\nplaintiffs’ arguments concerning notice, the interest rate, and the Excess COLA Account, the\nTVARS asked the district court to grant the plaintiffs summary judgment on the issue of whether\nCOLAs are vested. According to the minutes of a 2015 board meeting, the directors at that\ntime—in another 4-3 decision—voted to approve the TVARS summary-judgment response,\nwhich confessed that the 2009 amendments were in error. At summary judgment, then, neither\nagency had contested the reviewability of the plaintiffs’ arguments that the board had violated\nRule 13 and other provisions.\n\n       The district court nonetheless held that those claims—labeled by the plaintiffs as\n“nonstatutory claims”—were not judicially reviewable. In reaching that result, the court first\nconcluded that neither the Rules nor the Tennessee Valley Authority Act created a “private right\nof action” to enforce the Rules. The district court so held notwithstanding our indication in an\nunpublished opinion that plaintiffs may challenge the board’s decisions using causes of action\nthat predate the APA. See Beaman v. Ret. Sys. of Tenn. Valley Auth., 928 F.2d 1132, at *2 (6th\nCir. 1991) (table opinion). According to the district court, the Rules-violation arguments could\nnot be asserted under the APA either, because the TVARS did not fall within the APA’s\ndefinition of “agency.” That conclusion meant that the court could not review any arguments\nthat the board had violated the Rules. As for the Takings Clause claim, the district court held\nthat the claim was without merit because the Rules did not create a property right in a particular\namount of COLAs. The district court also rejected an estoppel claim, a claim that the plaintiffs\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 8\n\n\ndo not press on appeal. The district court reasoned in conclusion that the purported non-\nreviewability of the board’s actions was attributable to the unique, quasi-governmental nature of\nthe retirement system.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that their Rules-violation arguments are reviewable, that\nthe board violated Rule 13 by reducing vested COLAs, and that they were deprived of COLAs in\nviolation of the Takings Clause. The TVARS agrees as to the reviewability of its own actions.\nAs for the TVA, the agency argues primarily that the 2009 amendments did not violate the\nTakings Clause. This conclusion, the TVA maintains, moots every other issue.\n\n       Because none of the parties disputed the judicial reviewability of the Rules-violation\narguments in the district court, and the issue is not a matter of court jurisdiction, we can safely\nassume that those claims are reviewable under one rubric or another, without resolving the\nesoteric issue of what precise cause of action obtains. Even without the parties’ concessions, the\nclaims are reviewable, given the strong presumption of reviewability and the fact that the APA\ndid not displace common-law review. Even though the Rules-violation claims are reviewable,\naffirmance is nonetheless required on the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim that future COLAs are\nvested benefits. That claim, which was briefed on appeal, is foreclosed by the plain language of\nthe Rules. Nor does it help the plaintiffs that the TVARS now agrees with the plaintiffs\nconcerning vesting, as there are strong reasons for not applying the deference described in Auer\nv. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), to that agency’s litigation position.        Lastly, our holding\nregarding vesting requires the conclusion that the agencies were entitled to summary judgment\non the Takings Clause claim, as well. In short, a forfeitable benefit cannot be a constitutionally\nprotected property right for Takings Clause purposes.\n\n                                                I.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, the APA does not provide a basis for judicial reviewability in\nthis case. Chapter 7 of the APA governs judicial review of agency action, empowering courts to\nset aside final agency action. 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 705. Yet that statute’s procedural and substantive\n\fNo. 15-6019                       Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.

The TVARS does not meet that criterion.\n\n        Section 701 excludes “agencies composed of representatives of the parties or of\nrepresentatives of organizations of the parties to the disputes determined by them.”            Id.\n§ 701(b)(1)(E). The TVARS board fits squarely within the first part of this exception, because it\nis composed of representatives of the parties to this case. Although the APA does not define the\nword “representative,” that word naturally includes members of a governmental body who are\nappointed or elected by management and employee groups, as are six of the directors on the\nboard. Three board members are elected by TVARS participants, see Rule 3.2, and so those\nmembers are most fairly characterized as representatives of the participants. So too with the\nthree directors appointed by the TVA: those members are best understood as representatives of\nTVA management. Allowing plan participants and the TVA to place three members on the\nboard allows the interests of the financier and the payee to be represented in the board’s\ndecision-making processes. As a practical matter, that is what happened here. When voting on\nthe summary-judgment brief in this litigation, the board split 4-3, with the three TVA-appointed\ndirectors siding with the agency and the three participant-elected directors voting that COLAs\nare   vested.        See     TVARS,      TVA     Retirement     System    Board   of     Directors,\nhttp://www.tvars.com/aboutus.htm (last visited June 24, 2016).           Board members are thus\nrepresentatives of the groups to whom they owe their position.\n\n        Moreover, the phrase at the end of § 701(b)(1)(E), “to the disputes determined by them,”\napplies on its face to the TVARS board. First, the board necessarily resolves disputes between\nitself and plan participants in light of its “exclusive responsibility” under Rule 3.7 “for\ndetermining . . . what benefits are payable by the Retirement System and to whom they shall be\npaid.” Rule 3.7. Second, when the board makes decisions on what benefits are payable by the\nretirement system, it also impliedly resolves disputes between plan participants and the funder of\nthe retirement system, the TVA. In this case, for instance, by interpreting the Rules as vesting\nCOLAs, the TVARS has attempted to exercise just that kind of dispute-resolution power.\n\n        Because the TVARS is not an “agency” for APA purposes, the APA does not provide for\njudicial reviewability of its action.\n\fNo. 15-6019                          Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                               Page 10\n\n\n                                                        B.\n\n        But even though the APA does not apply, the decisions of the TVARS are judicially\nreviewable. Both the TVARS and the TVA have conceded that the plaintiffs’ Rules-violation\narguments are reviewable. In any event, agency action was presumptively judicially reviewable\nbefore the APA was enacted.\n\n        The TVA’s decision not to argue reviewability in the district court is significant.\n“[W]hile subject-matter jurisdiction can never be waived or forfeited, we usually require timely\nand reasoned presentation of non-jurisdictional issues to avoid forfeiture.”                         Winnett v.\nCaterpillar, Inc., 553 F.3d 1000, 1006 (6th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). Reviewability is such\na non-jurisdictional issue.         Because this case involves the interpretation of regulations\npromulgated by a federal agency, see Kinzer, 142 F.2d at 837–38, the district court had\njurisdiction to hear this case under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In contrast to subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthe question of reviewability relates to whether a cause of action exists and whether review has\nbeen foreclosed by a statute or other type of law. The parties are free to concede reviewability if\nthey so choose, and both agencies have done so here. Although the TVA did not make an\nexplicit concession in the district court that the case was reviewable, the TVA also did not make\nany argument in the other direction. The TVA argued below that “Plaintiffs’ argument [for a\nRules violation] necessarily fails because . . . the TVARS Board’s judgment that the\nAmendments did not reduce benefits in violation of [Rule 13’s] anti-cutback provision was not\narbitrary and capricious.” That is an argument concerning the merits, not about whether judicial\nreview exists. Nor has the TVA made a serious effort to contest reviewability on appeal.2\n\n        Even if the TVA or the TVARS had taken a different litigation position regarding\nreviewability in the district court, an independent analysis of the issue yields the same result. In\n\n\n        2\n          The TVA’s brief focuses almost entirely on issues other than reviewability. At the end of the brief, the\nTVA appears to advert to two arguments that could be construed as arguments against reviewability. Neither one\nhas any force. First, the TVA argues that the plaintiffs waived any claims for “nonstatutory” review by failing to\nlabel the claims as nonstatutory claims in the district court. The nomenclature of the claims, however, is not\ndispositive of the waiver issue, particularly where, as here, a claim can be defined in various ways. Second, the\nTVA argues that the plaintiffs should have used an administrative appeals procedure that was added to the Rules in\n2012. But the complaint in this case was filed in 2010, and the TVA cannot defeat judicial review by pointing to an\namendment that was adopted after litigation in this case had already begun.\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 11\n\n\nthis case, we need not decide whether reviewability of agency action outside of the APA should\nbe described as § 1331 review, nonstatutory review, or federal common-law review.              We\nlikewise need not determine whether the relevant cause of action lies in certiorari or mandamus,\nor by means of equitable relief. Whatever the appropriate label for describing the basis for\nreviewability, the plaintiffs’ claims are reviewable, and the scope of review and extent of our\npower are the same, at least in the context of this case.\n\n       Reviewability is the norm. Courts strongly presume the reviewability of agency action,\nand nothing rebuts that principle here.       “[J]udicial review of a final agency action by an\naggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the\npurpose of Congress.” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967). This presumption is\na strong one, see Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2015), and an “agency\nbears a ‘heavy burden’” in proving that Congress intended to preclude all judicial review. Id.\n(citation omitted). In 5 U.S.C. § 701(a), the APA codified the two primary ways by which\nagency conduct may be made unreviewable. See also Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140; 33 Charles\nA. Wright & Charles H. Koch, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 8390 (1st ed. 2006). These\nlimits pre-existed the APA. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140; U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney\nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 94 (1947). Neither one applies here.\nFirst, no statute precludes judicial review of the actions of the TVARS board. The Tennessee\nValley Authority Act does not mention the TVARS. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 831–831ee. Nor does the\nstatute preclude review of the actions of the TVA or an agency created by the TVA, and a\nstatute’s silence does not indicate that Congress intended to make agency action unreviewable,\nsee Peoples Gas, Light & Coke Co. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 658 F.2d 1182, 1190 n.4 (7th Cir. 1981).\nSecond, no argument has been made that the decisions of the TVARS are committed to agency\ndiscretion by law. Agency action has been held to be committed to agency discretion generally\nwhen there is “no law to apply,” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402,\n410 (1971) (citation omitted), and specifically in areas not traditionally amenable to judicial\nreview, such as prosecutorial discretion or the allocation of government resources, see Heckler v.\nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 834 (1985). This case is nothing like cases in which agency action has\nbeen found to be committed to agency discretion.\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 12\n\n\n       Reviewability in this case is supported by our reasoning in Beaman, another case\ninvolving claims against the TVARS. In Beaman, the plaintiff challenged a decision by the\nboard to award the equity in a savings plan to the decedent’s estate. 928 F.2d 1132, at *1–2.\nAlthough the parties disputed the applicability of the APA, we declined to rule on that issue,\nreasoning that “the district court applied the correct standard of review”—the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard—“inasmuch as the standard of review would be the same under the Act or\nfederal common law.” Id. at *2. We thus recognized that regardless of whether the APA\napplied, the plaintiff’s claim was reviewable. Nothing in the opinion hinted that review of the\nboard’s decisions might be foreclosed by statute or any other reason.\n\n       As Beaman suggested, the fact that the APA’s remedies do not apply with respect to the\nTVARS does not change the picture. Far from displacing judicial review that occurs outside of\nthe APA regime—including review of agency action under the general federal-question statute—\nthe APA expressly acknowledges that this review survives. Section 703 provides that “[t]he\nform of proceeding for judicial review . . . in the absence or inadequacy” of special statutory\nreview is “any applicable form of legal action, including actions for declaratory judgments or\nwrits of prohibitory or mandatory injunction or habeas corpus, in a court of competent\njurisdiction.” 5 U.S.C. § 703. The actions mentioned in that section are representative of the\nactions that courts entertained before the APA’s enactment in 1946. See Louis L. Jaffe, Judicial\nControl of Administrative Action 164–96 (1965). Section 703 thus acknowledges that where a\nstatute does not establish a right of action, a case is nonetheless reviewable under any applicable\nlegal vehicle that predates the APA.\n\n       In an analogous case, the Seventh Circuit has explained the interaction between the\ncommon law and the APA:\n\n               The United States contends that a congressional intent to preclude review\n       can be inferred from the fact that Congress exempted the Postal Service from all\n       federal law dealing with public or federal contracts, as well as the Administrative\n       Procedure Act. The Administrative Procedure Act has been widely interpreted as\n       being merely declaratory of the common law of reviewability and standing\n       existing at the time of the statute’s enactment in 1948. See, e.g., Arnold Tours,\n       Inc. v. Camp, 408 F.2d 1147, 1161 (1st Cir. 1969), vacated, 397 U.S. 315 (1970);\n       Kansas City Power & Light Co. v. McKay, 225 F.2d 924, 931–32 (D.C. Cir.),\n       cert. denied, 350 U.S. 884 (1955). Contra, e.g., Scanwell Labs, Inc. v. Schaeffer,\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                        Page 13\n\n\n       424 F.2d 859, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1970). See generally, 6 Jaffe, Judicial Control of\n       Administrative Action, at 372, 528–30 (1965) (hereinafter cited as “Jaffe, at ......”).\n       As such, the Administrative Procedure Act embodies the basic common law\n       presumption of judicial review. Abbott Labs, Inc., 387 U.S. at 140, citing Shields\n       v. Utah Idaho Central RR, 305 U.S. 177 (1938); Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288,\n       (1944); American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 108\n       (1902); Jaffe, at 372; H. Saferstein, supra n.4, at 374. It can be reasonably\n       assumed, therefore, that an agency’s exemption from the provisions of the\n       Administrative Procedure Act does not negate the applicability of common law\n       review principles that preexisted and operate apart from the subsequent\n       codification.\n\nPeoples Gas, 658 F.2d at 1191. In that case, judicial review thus existed as to the plaintiffs’\nclaim that the Postal Service had not complied with its own regulations, even though the Service\nis exempt from the APA. Id. at 1191–92. Other courts have followed a similar approach with\nrespect to other APA-exempted entities. See, e.g., Tex. Rural Legal Aid, Inc. v. Legal Servs.\nCorp., 940 F.2d 685, 697 (9th Cir. 1991). The House Report accompanying the APA supports\nthis reasoning. Section 703, according to the report, “is an express statutory recognition and\nadoption of the so-called common-law actions as being appropriate and authorized means of\njudicial review, operative whenever special statutory forms of judicial review are either lacking\nor insufficient.” H.R. Rep. No. 79-1980, at 42 (1946).\n\n       Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), does not require a different conclusion on\nreviewability. That decision did not overturn all pre-APA bases for challenging agency conduct,\nbut instead concerned a plaintiff’s ability to enforce a federal regulation against a state actor who\nwas subject to the regulation. In that case, Martha Sandoval sued the director of the Alabama\nDepartment of Public Safety to enjoin a practice of administering state driver’s license\nexaminations only in English. Id. at 278–79. Sandoval argued that this policy violated a\nDepartment of Justice regulation forbidding funding recipients from “utiliz[ing] criteria or\nmethods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\nbecause of their race, color, or national origin.” Id. at 278 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2)).\nThe issue before the Court was “whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the\nregulation.” Id. at 279. In answering that question in the negative, the Court reasoned that\n“private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress” and that courts\nmust accordingly analyze the text and structure of a statute to determine whether Congress\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                       Page 14\n\n\nintended to create a private remedy. Id. at 286–88. In the statute at issue there, Congress had not\ndone so. Id. at 293.\n\n       There is a major difference between a plaintiff attempting to obtain a remedy against a\nperson subject to federal regulations, and a plaintiff attempting to hold an agency accountable for\nalleged violations of its own rules. Sandoval spoke to the former situation—alleged misconduct\nby a regulated person. But this case involves the latter situation—review of agency action. As\nthe Court’s 2015 decision in Mach Mining made clear, Sandoval did not overturn the\npresumption of reviewability that applies in the context of judicial review of agency action. See\nMach Mining, 135 S. Ct. at 1651.\n\n       Nor does our 1944 decision in Kinzer say otherwise concerning the reviewability of the\nboard’s actions. In that case, we held that the Rules were authorized by the Tennessee Valley\nAuthority Act and that they have the force of law. Kinzer, 142 F.2d at 836–38. In reaching that\nconclusion, we reasoned that the TVA “is free from a state’s regulation or control and subject to\nsuit only as permitted by the federal statute creating it.” Id. at 837. That sentence has no bearing\non this case. The sentence indicates only that Congress must waive sovereign immunity for the\nTVA to be subject to suit, not that the presumption of reviewability does not apply to the actions\nof that agency or the TVARS.\n\n       In sum, because extant causes of action survived the enactment of the APA and because\ncourts strongly presume judicial review of agency action, summary judgment was not\nappropriate on the basis of reviewability.      We need not resolve, however, the essentially\nacademic question of what particular cause of action is appropriate for the residual category of\nnon-APA agencies.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       On the merits of the Rules-violation arguments, the plaintiffs in their opening brief\naddressed the issue of whether COLAs are vested. As noted, Rule 13 provides that “[n]o\namendment to these Rules and Regulations shall be adopted which will reduce the then accrued\nbenefits of the existing members or beneficiaries which are nonforfeitable or covered by\n\fNo. 15-6019                          Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                             Page 15\n\n\naccumulated reserves held therefor.”3 Because COLAs are not vested benefits, the board did not\nviolate that provision by reducing or eliminating COLAs for the years 2010–2013. The agencies\nwere therefore entitled to summary judgment with respect to the claim that COLAs are vested\nbenefits.\n\n        The plain language of the Rules controls the analysis. See Mitchell v. Comm’r, 775 F.3d\n1243, 1249 (10th Cir. 2015). Most significantly, one provision that is located in two separate\nCOLA paragraphs indicates that the amount of a COLA is completely within the board’s\ndiscretion.    According to that provision, when the board calculates COLAs, “[t]he rate of\nincrease shall be the percent increase in the CPI over the preceding [year]; provided, however,\nthat the increase for any year shall not exceed five percent (5%) except that the board may, in its\ndiscretion and with the approval of TVA, apply for any year a maximum different from that\nspecified above.” Rule 6.I, 7.L. This provision authorizes the board to vary from the CPI and\nreduce a COLA as long as the board does so with the TVA’s approval. Although it is true that\nthe quoted language says that “the increase for any year shall not exceed five percent”—language\nthat in isolation might suggest that the provision grants only the authority to exceed a 5% cap—\nthe discretion-granting clause uses the words “different from.” Those words indicate that the\nboard has discretion not just to go above the 5% cap with TVA approval, but also to reduce the\nCOLA rate.\n\n        Other sections confirm this interpretation of Rules 6.I and 7.L, proving that the discretion\nthat those provisions mention includes the discretion to reduce future COLAs. For one thing, the\nRules do not explicitly state that COLAs are vested benefits. Vested benefits are defined only in\nRule 11.B, which is entitled “Vested (Nonforfeitable) Benefits and Segregation of Funds.” (The\nCOLA-funding provisions in Rules 6.I and 7.L expressly incorporate Rule 11, stating that the\nboard shall provide COLAs “subject, however, to the provisions of section 11.”) The first\n\n\n        3\n           One might ask how a legal document can coherently limit a provision for its own amendment when the\nlimit itself might be amendable. Yet legal provisions often do so. For instance, Article V of the Constitution\nprohibits an amendment that would deprive a state of its equal voting power in the Senate. U.S. Const. art. V. We\nneed not resolve the conundrum of whether the provision here is coherent, as the parties have not argued the\nlawfulness of Rule 13. We accordingly assume that Rule 13 validly prohibits amendments that reduce vested\nbenefits, even though conceivably Rule 13 could itself be amended to permit such a vested-benefit-reducing\namendment.\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 16\n\n\nparagraph of Rule 11.B.1 indicates that member contributions, pension benefits, and\nsupplemental benefits are vested. The rule provides in relevant part:\n\n       Rights to benefits based on a member’s own contributions shall be nonforfeitable\n       at all times. A nonforfeitable right to accrued benefits from creditable service\n       based on TVA’s contributions shall arise [upon the occurrence of one of the listed\n       events]. A nonforfeitable right to cash balance account benefits based on TVA’s\n       contributions shall arise upon completion of 5 years of cash balance service.\n\nIn contrast to benefits based on a member’s creditable service—a category that includes pension\nand supplemental benefits—and benefits based on member contributions, COLAs are not\nmentioned in Rule 11.B.1, but rather in Rule 11.B.2, which explains what happens if the TVA\ndiscontinues or reduces its contributions to the retirement system. This is significant. COLAs\nare not included in the same paragraph as the three types of benefits that indisputably are vested,\nand COLAs likely would have been included in that paragraph if they were vested, as the\n“Notice of Amendments” that accompanied the 1974 amendments to the Rules indicated that\n“[v]ested benefits are defined in section 11B1.” Nor are COLAs calculated in the same way as\nthe nonforfeitable benefits based on TVA contributions that Rule 11.B.1 describes. Unlike those\nbenefits, COLAs are related not just to a member’s years of service, but also to the CPI. What is\nmore, Rule 11.B.2 distinguishes between COLAs and nonforfeitable benefits by stating that both\ntypes of payments have priority over other benefits in the event that the TVA reduces its\ncontributions to the retirement system.         These distinctions suggest that COLAs and\nnonforfeitable benefits are not one and the same.\n\n       Rule 11’s other sections, too, treat COLAs differently from benefits that clearly are\nvested. Rule 11.B.4.a, for instance, provides that “[f]unds of the System sufficient to provide\nnonforfeitable benefits shall be segregated in the System’s accounts and shall thereafter be used\nin the following order of priority.” The rule then indicates that member contributions take top\npriority, that pension benefits follow, and that supplemental benefits come last. COLAs are not\nmentioned in subsection (a). Rather, they are addressed in subsection (e), which provides that\n“[t]o the fullest extent TVA finds feasible, it will also make additional contributions as required\nfrom time to time to provide cost-of-living increases pursuant to sections 6I, 7L or 18C3 for\nthose with nonforfeitable benefits based on service prior to such discontinuance or reduction [of\n\fNo. 15-6019                            Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                                  Page 17\n\n\nTVA contributions].” Two points about this subsection deserve mention. First, the subsection\nqualifies the TVA’s duty to fund COLAs with the language “[t]o the fullest extent TVA finds\nfeasible.” That language strongly suggests that although the board should prioritize the payment\nof COLAs, it has the discretion to reduce them. Second, the subsection uses the phrase “cost-of-\nliving increases” in the same sentence as “for those with nonforfeitable benefits,” which suggests\nthat the two phrases refer to different benefits. That distinction is another sign that COLAs are\nnot vested.\n\n          The Rules treat COLAs in a similar way in the section that addresses the termination of\nthe retirement system.          Rule 11.C.1 states that “[p]romptly upon the termination of the\nRetirement System, the board shall make such arrangements as it deems necessary or appropriate\nto assure payment of (1) benefits based on members’ contributions; and (2) nonforfeitable\nbenefits based on TVA contributions and, so far as it finds feasible, cost-of-living increases\nrelated thereto.”         Like Rule 11.B, this provision distinguishes between COLAs and\nnonforfeitable benefits, and also qualifies the TVA’s responsibility with regard to COLAs.4\n\n          In short, there is a difference between funding certain types of high-priority payments\nwhenever possible, and writing in stone that those payments can never be reduced. COLAs\nundoubtedly have played and continue to play an important role in the retirement packages of\nplan participants. Many participants may have expected that COLAs would always be provided.\nBut whether COLAs are vested is a different question, to which the Rules provide an answer. It\nis not our business to ensure a lifetime entitlement to COLAs by rewriting the Rules.\n\n          The plaintiffs offer several rejoinders to this conclusion, but none requires a different\nresult.\n\n\n\n\n          4\n            The plaintiffs cite two cases in support of the argument that Rule 11 is not relevant to the question of\nvesting, see Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 377–78 (1980); A-T-O, Inc. v.\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 634 F.2d 1013, 1018–19 (6th Cir. 1980), but neither one requires that conclusion.\nAs an initial matter, both cases arose under ERISA—a statute that defines nonforfeitable and accrued benefits—and\nso have little bearing on governmental plans like the one here. Still more, the cases addressed a type of plan\nprovision that is not at issue here—one that attempted to allow employers, upon plan termination, to disclaim\nliability for vested benefits to the extent that a fund’s assets were not sufficient to cover the benefits. See Nachman,\n446 U.S. at 362; A-T-O, 634 F.2d at 1019. This appeal involves no such provision.\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 18\n\n\n          First is the plaintiffs’ chief objection, which concerns the issue of deference to the\nTVARS. This is not a case, however, where Auer deference is due. The plaintiffs argue that the\nTVARS—in its summary judgment brief—interpreted the Rules as vesting COLAs, and that the\nagency’s position is therefore entitled to substantial deference. The TVARS’ position was based\non, among other things, language in the Rules stating that the board “shall increase” benefits by\nproviding COLAs, the board’s longstanding practice of awarding COLAs, and the way that the\nboard’s actuary classified COLAs in the annual report to the TVA. Although under Auer,\n519 U.S. at 461–62, courts ordinarily defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations,\nAuer does not apply in the context of this case.\n\n          In the first place, the plain text of the Rules precludes deference to the TVARS. “Auer\ndeference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous. . . . To defer to\n[an] agency’s position [where the text is clear] would be to permit the agency, under the guise of\ninterpreting a regulation, to create de facto a new regulation.” Christensen v. Harris Cty.,\n529 U.S. 576, 588 (2000). As noted, the discretion-granting provisions in Rules 6.I and 7.L,\nwhen read in conjunction with Rule 11, allow the board to reduce COLAs. That should end the\nmatter.\n\n          Even if the text were less clear, Auer would still not apply. The TVARS was designed in\na way that makes it functionally subordinate to the TVA. The nature of that junior agency/senior\nagency relationship suggests that the views of the TVARS on the vesting of COLAs—payments\nthat in any given year might involve high-dollar amounts—should not trump the view of the\nTVA. Although the TVARS has an obligation to look out for the interests of plan participants\nand is legally distinct from the TVA, the TVA exercises substantial control over the retirement\nsystem. For example, the TVA exercises total control over the pursestrings, as it provides all\nfunding for the retirement system except for member contributions. Because the TVARS does\nnot provide the funding, some of the directors on its board may be inclined to take a position that\nis more favorable to plan participants and less so to the TVA. The TVA also has the final say-so\non every amendment by virtue of its veto power. Moreover, the entire retirement system was\ncreated by, and could be dissolved by, the TVA. These aspects of the relationship between the\nagencies suggest that the TVARS should not be granted greater deference than the TVA in the\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 19\n\n\nmatter of COLAs, a matter that has significant ramifications for the TVA’s funding\nresponsibility.\n\n       Rule 3.7 does not foreclose that conclusion. It is true that the rule endows the TVARS\nwith some degree of interpretive authority regarding the Rules:\n\n       The board shall have sole and exclusive responsibility for determining under these\n       Rules and Regulations what benefits are payable by the retirement System and to\n       whom they shall be paid; and the board’s interpretation and application of the\n       Rules and Regulations in these and all other matters pertaining to the System’s\n       operations . . . shall be final and conclusive as to all parties.\n\nThis rule, however, does not allow the TVARS to rewrite the Rules. In this case, crediting the\nTVARS litigation position over the TVA’s would potentially allow the TVARS to require the\nTVA to fund benefits that neither agency originally agreed to provide. The TVARS claims a\nright to obtain $200 million from the TVA, and supposes that it should obtain deference in\ndeciding the vesting question. That result cannot be squared with the purpose of the Auer\ndoctrine.\n\n       Another reason also counsels against applying Auer.        The TVARS has changed its\nposition on COLAs several times in the past seven years, a fact that decreases the level of\ndeference that a court should give to its litigation position, see Thomas Jefferson University v.\nShalala, 512 U.S. 504, 515 (1994). Before 2009, at least some of the board members believed\nthat COLAs were vested. At odds with that position, however, is the board’s 2009 vote, which a\nmajority of the board has since characterized as a mistake. No matter how rushed, uninformed,\nor ill-advised the 2009 decision, the fact remains that a majority of the board approved the\nreduction in COLAs. That action is not consistent with the view that COLAs are protected from\nreduction. In addition, some consideration was in fact given to the vesting issue before the vote,\nas the board’s chairman consulted an actuary in July 2009 concerning whether COLAs are\nvested. Moreover, even though the board now maintains that the 2009 amendments were illegal,\nit took the board almost six years to formally disavow that decision by approving the TVARS\nsummary-judgment brief. If one of the directors who voted to approve the brief is replaced in the\nnear future, the agency’s position could change yet again. This is not the type of case where an\nagency’s most recent interpretation of a regulation should be given deference.\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 20\n\n\n       Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co. is not to the contrary. 564 U.S. 50\n(2011). In that case, the Court held that an agency’s position may be entitled to deference even if\nthe position is contained in an amicus brief. Id. at 59 (citing Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,\n562 U.S. 195, 208–10 (2011)). The distinction between this case and Talk America is that the\nagency in that case had not recently taken action that was inconsistent with the position in the\namicus brief. Also there, unlike here, the Court could say that there is no “reason to suspect that\nthe interpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judgment.” Id. (citation\nomitted). That distinction makes all the difference for Auer purposes.\n\n       Apart from Auer deference, the plaintiffs’ arguments related to the language of the\nCOLA-funding provisions do not compel the conclusion that COLAs are vested. First, the\nplaintiffs argue that COLAs are part and parcel of the adjusted benefits, such that COLAs\nnecessarily vest along with the underlying base benefits. That argument cannot be squared with\nRule 11, however, which expressly distinguishes between COLAs and nonforfeitable benefits.\nMoreover, the Rules’ description of COLAs as increases or adjustments to the base benefits\nsuggests that COLAs are not inextricably linked to those benefits. Rule 6.I, 7.L; see also Frazier\nv. City of Chattanooga, No. 1:14-CV-128, 2015 WL 9309123, at *5 (E.D. Tenn. Nov. 23, 2015).\nSecond, the plaintiffs argue that the Rules use “mandatory, durational language” to refer to\nCOLAs, noting that the Rules provide that “[t]he board shall increase . . . that portion of the\nmonthly benefit payable” with COLAs. Rule 6.I, 7.L (emphasis added). The use of the word\n“shall” is not determinative. That word is best read to require the board to fund COLAs every\nyear unless and until the board exercises its discretion to amend the Rules to change the COLA\nrate. In other words, decreasing COLAs requires a formal amendment, not merely a decision by\nthe board that COLAs should be reduced.\n\n       In sum, the Rules do not vest COLAs. Although the district court did not rule on this\nmerits question, the court’s judgment may be affirmed in part on this alternative basis. On\nremand, the district court must address any remaining arguments for a Rules violation that are\nnot abandoned.\n\fNo. 15-6019                       Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                   Page 21\n\n\n                                                    III.\n\n         Our conclusion on the vesting issue necessarily requires dismissal of the Takings Clause\nclaim.    Although the plaintiffs’ claim is framed as a Takings claim, the analysis borrows\nprinciples from the Contract Clause context. The first step in the analysis is whether the\nclaimant has demonstrated a cognizable property interest, see Coalition for Government\nProcurement v. Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 365 F.3d 435, 481 (6th Cir. 2004) (citation\nomitted), which may include an enforceable contract right, see Parella v. Retirement Board of\nthe Rhode Island Employees’ Retirement System, 173 F.3d 46, 59 (3d Cir. 1999). Where a public\ncontract is alleged to have been created by statute, however, a plaintiff may prove a contractual\nrelationship only by showing that the legislature has unmistakably intended to create a binding\ncontract right. See id. at 60 (citation omitted).\n\n         That showing is absent here. Because COLAs are not vested, the TVARS did not\nunmistakably intend to prevent itself from reducing COLAs below the CPI rate. The 2009\namendments, then, did not deprive the plaintiffs of a protected property right.\n\n                                                    IV.\n\n         The judgment of the district court is affirmed with respect to the claim that COLAs are\nvested benefits. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Public and private pension plans alike often include cost-of-\nliving adjustments to base benefits so that plan participants can receive the real value of those\nbenefits. One way to calculate such adjustments is to make them dependent on yearly changes in\nthe consumer price index.     For more than four decades, the Tennessee Valley Authority\nRetirement System (TVARS) did just that. Employees of the Tennessee Valley Authority\n(TVA), who participate in TVARS-managed retirement plans, thus received cost-of-living\nadjustments on top of their investment returns, pension benefits, and supplemental benefits. That\nchanged in 2009. In that year, with the retirement system’s financial health in jeopardy, the\nTVARS board amended the rules that govern the system to cap or eliminate cost-of-living\nadjustments for the years 2010–2013, increase the eligibility age for cost-of-living adjustments,\nand lower the interest rate on a savings fund. The complaint in this case soon followed, with the\nplaintiffs arguing—among other things—that cost-of-living adjustments are vested benefits and\nthat the TVARS board violated one of its own rules by reducing such a benefit. The plaintiffs\nalso raised a Takings Clause claim.\n\n       None of the claims survived summary judgment. According to the district court, the\nplaintiffs did not have a private right of action to enforce the board’s compliance with the\nTVARS rules, and the Takings claim failed on the merits.           Despite having adopted the\n2009 amendments, the TVARS now professes that it did so in error, agreeing with the plaintiffs\nthat courts may review the board’s 2009 actions and that cost-of-living adjustments are vested.\nThe TVA disagrees on the vesting issue.\n\n       Summary judgment in favor of the TVA and the TVARS was proper on the Takings\nClause claim. Because cost-of-living adjustments are not vested, the agencies were also entitled\n\fNo. 15-6019                       Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                        Page 3\n\n\nto summary judgment on the merits of the claim that the board violated TVARS rules by\nreducing vested benefits. As for the remaining claims alleging violations of the TVARS rules,\nthose claims are judicially reviewable in the context of this case. Remand is therefore required\nfor the district court to address those claims in the first instance.\n\n        In 1933, Congress created the TVA, a federal agency that is organized and operated as a\ncorporation. See Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, 16 U.S.C. §§ 831 et seq. Several\nyears later, the TVA established the TVARS for the purpose of managing the retirement plans of\nTVA employees, who become members of the retirement system upon accepting employment.\nThe TVA created the TVARS by promulgating Rules and Regulations (the Rules), which\nestablished how the retirement system would be administered and what benefits would be\npayable to plan participants. As the system is a governmental pension plan, it is not governed by\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).                    See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1002(32),\n1003(b)(1). The TVA’s statutory authority to create the retirement system has long been beyond\nquestion. See Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Kinzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1551239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1551239/tennessee-valley-authority-v-kinzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836–37 (6th Cir. 1944).\n\n        According to the Rules, the TVARS is governed by a seven-member board. Rule 3.1,\nRules     and     Regulations      of     the    TVA       Retirement      System,     available   at\nhttp://www.tvars.com/pdf/tvars_rules_regs.pdf (last visited June 22, 2016). Three of the board’s\nmembers are elected by TVA employees, three others are appointed by the TVA, and the last\nboard member is selected by a majority vote of the other six. Id. The relationship between the\nTVARS and the TVA is unique. Although the TVARS was created by the TVA, it is operated\nfor the benefit of TVA employees. The TVARS board was accordingly given broad authority to\nmanage the retirement system, including decision-making responsibility on investment\nportfolios, the “interest rate or rates to be used in all actuarial and other calculations,” and what\nbenefits are payable and to whom. Rule 3.7, 4.1, 4.5. The board was also entrusted with the\npower to amend the Rules, from “time to time [and] as may be necessary to carry out the\nprovisions of the Retirement System.” Rule 3.6. Notwithstanding this extensive power, the\nindependence of the TVARS from the TVA remains cabined in significant ways. Almost all of\nthe retirement system’s funding comes from the TVA, and the board must submit to the TVA\nannual reports on the system’s financial condition.          Rule 3.5, 9.B.1, 9.B.5.     The board’s\n\fNo. 15-6019                          Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                              Page 4\n\n\namendment prerogative is circumscribed by the Rules, too. For one thing, the TVA wields a\nveto power: amendments proposed by the board become effective only if the TVA does not\nexercise its veto within thirty days. Rule 13. In addition, Rule 13 contains a so-called anti-\ncutback provision, prohibiting amendments that “reduce the then accrued benefits of the existing\nmembers or beneficiaries which are nonforfeitable or [are] covered by accumulated reserves held\ntherefor.” This appeal hinges on the anti-cutback provision, as the plaintiffs’ chief argument is\nthat the TVARS violated Rule 13 by reducing cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for the years\n2010–2013.\n\n        The plaintiffs in this case are among the 36,000 current and former TVA employees who\nparticipate in the retirement system. Two-thirds of the participants are retired. Under the Rules,\nthe retirement income of those participants comes from four sources. First, eligible beneficiaries\nreceive a monthly pension benefit in an amount linked to their average compensation and years\nof service.1 Rule 6.A.2, 7.C. Second, beneficiaries receive a monthly supplemental benefit that\nis related to the costs of medical insurance. Rule 18.A–B. Third, beneficiaries have the option\nof contributing to a fixed-rate fund or variable-rate fund, both of which are managed by the\nTVARS. Rule 9.A, 19.A. The interest rate for the fixed fund was lowered by the 2009 rule\namendments that are at issue in this case. Fourth, beneficiaries may receive COLAs, payments\nthat increase pension and supplemental benefits based on yearly changes in the consumer price\nindex (CPI). Excepting the years at issue in this case, COLAs are triggered as follows:\n\n        The board shall increase (subject, however, to the provisions of section 11) that\n        portion of the monthly benefit payable to each retiree, or beneficiary of a\n        deceased member or retiree, which is derived from TVA’s contributions to the\n        System . . . whenever the 12-month average of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n        for any year after 1966 exceeds by as much as one percent (1%) the CPI average\n        for the preceding year.\n\nRule 6.I, 7.L; see also Rule 18.C.3. By tying COLAs to the CPI, the Rules preserve the\npurchasing power of pension and supplemental benefits.\n\n\n\n        1\n          Two types of benefit plans are now in place. One of those plans—the “original benefit structure”—was\nclosed to new entrants in December 1995, and is covered by Rule 6. Provisions concerning the more recent plan, the\n“cash balance benefit structure,” are in Rule 7. The differences in these plans are not relevant to this appeal.\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                        Page 5\n\n\n       COLAs have not always been a part of the retirement system.                That feature was\nimplemented in 1967, when the board amended the Rules to apply COLAs to benefits based on\nTVA contributions. Later amendments contained language explicitly committing the TVA to\nfunding COLAs: “[a] further ‘cost-of-living contribution’” to the TVARS, in addition to two\nother types of contributions, “shall be made [by the TVA] to provide the funds to pay for\nincreases in monthly benefits.” Rule 9.B.1. The Rules make clear that COLAs are an important\nfeature of the retirement system. According to one provision, “[t]he total amount payable each\nyear by TVA to the Retirement System shall be not less than the sum of the normal contribution\nrate and the accrued liability contribution rate . . . plus cost-of-living contributions.” Rule 9.B.5.\nAs for the amount of a COLA, one provision gives the board some discretion to depart from the\nCPI formula: “the board may, in its discretion and with the approval of TVA, apply for any year\na maximum different from [a 5% cap].” Rule 6.I, 7.L.\n\n       Another round of amendments followed soon after, in 1974. Prior to that date, none of\nthe benefits provided to beneficiaries was vested, a term that the parties agree is synonymous\nwith nonforfeitable. That meant that the Rules did not prevent the board from reducing a\nparticipant’s future benefits. After the enactment of ERISA, however, the board decided to\nguarantee certain categories of benefits instead of offering the plan-termination insurance that\nERISA required for private pensions. Although ERISA does not apply to the retirement system,\nthe board took this action in recognition of the congressional intention that employers should\nfollow through with their financial commitments to employees. Rule 13 was therefore amended\nto include the anti-cutback provision, which protects accrued benefits that are vested. Rule\n11.B.1, the only rule defining what benefits are vested, indicates that “[r]ights to benefits based\non a member’s own contributions shall be nonforfeitable.” Also vested, according to Rule\n11.B.1, are certain “accrued benefits from creditable service based on TVA’s contributions,” and\ncash balance benefits distributed after five years of cash balance service.\n\n       This case, like many others, has its genesis in the recession of the late 2000s. During that\ntime, the liabilities of the TVARS grew to exceed its assets by $3 billion. In June 2009, the\nTVARS made its annual contribution request to the TVA for the following year, asking for $300\nmillion to keep the system afloat. The TVA countered with a proposal to give the TVARS $1\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 6\n\n\nbillion, a lump sum that would be conditioned on a TVARS promise not to request additional\nfunds until 2014. In the TVA’s counterproposal, the agency also suggested that the TVARS\nreduce its liabilities by lowering COLAs for the years 2010–2013, increasing the COLA-\neligibility age for TVA employees, and reducing the annual interest rate on the fixed-rate fund.\nOn August 16, 2009, a special TVARS board meeting was called for the following day. In this\nlitigation, one board member has asserted that she was not made aware of the purpose of the\nmeeting until several hours beforehand. Other evidence suggests, however, that the question of\nwhether COLAs are vested had been the subject of some discussion before that meeting, as board\nchairman Frank Alford had asked in July 2009 for an actuary’s opinion on that question. By a 4-\n3 vote, the board approved amendments to the Rules that were consistent with the TVA’s\ncounterproposal. The thirty-day period passed without a TVA veto.\n\n       The changes to the Rules increased the COLA-eligibility age from 55 to 60 for\nparticipants retiring in 2010 or after, and decreased the interest rate on the fixed fund from 7.25%\nto 6%. Rule 6.I, 7.L, 18.C; Appendix Rule 17. The amendments also eliminated COLAs for\n2010 and 2012, and capped them at 3% and 2.5% for 2011 and 2013. Rule 6.I, 7.L, 18.C. The\namendments had their intended effect. Deposition testimony indicates that the changes reduced\nthe retirement system’s potential liabilities by over $200 million.\n\n       The named plaintiffs in this case—which is styled as a class action—took issue with the\namendments, filing suit against the board’s directors in federal court. An amended complaint\nnamed only the TVA and the TVARS as defendants. In that complaint, the plaintiffs asserted\nthat the board’s actions violated several provisions of the Rules. Among other things, the\nplaintiffs alleged that: Rule 13 prohibited the TVARS from capping COLAs, from increasing the\nCOLA-eligibility age, and from decreasing the interest rate on the fixed fund; the TVA was\nrequired to make annual contributions to the TVARS; the board did not give plan participants\nproper notice for the amendments; and the board violated provisions related to an account called\nthe “Excess COLA Account.” Although the complaint was not entirely clear on the proper\nvehicle for asserting the Rules-violation arguments, it asserted those arguments primarily under\nfiduciary-duty and declaratory-judgment counts.       In addition to those claims, the plaintiffs\ncharged the board with violating the procedural and substantive protections of the Administrative\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 7\n\n\nProcedure Act (APA). Finally, the plaintiffs asserted a Takings Clause claim based on the 2009\namendments, maintaining that the board’s actions deprived plan participants of protected\nproperty interests.\n\n       After discovery, the TVA moved for summary judgment, arguing that the board’s actions\nwere valid under the Rules. The TVA conceded that “[t]he arbitrary and capricious standard of\nreview applies here regardless of whether TVARS is an agency within the meaning of the APA,”\nand did not argue that the plaintiffs’ Rules-violation arguments were not reviewable. The\nplaintiffs also filed a partial motion for summary judgment on the question of liability for each\nclaim. The TVARS filed a single “response” to both motions. Although the TVARS agreed\nwith the TVA that the APA does not apply to the TVARS and that there was no merit to the\nplaintiffs’ arguments concerning notice, the interest rate, and the Excess COLA Account, the\nTVARS asked the district court to grant the plaintiffs summary judgment on the issue of whether\nCOLAs are vested. According to the minutes of a 2015 board meeting, the directors at that\ntime—in another 4-3 decision—voted to approve the TVARS summary-judgment response,\nwhich confessed that the 2009 amendments were in error. At summary judgment, then, neither\nagency had contested the reviewability of the plaintiffs’ arguments that the board had violated\nRule 13 and other provisions.\n\n       The district court nonetheless held that those claims—labeled by the plaintiffs as\n“nonstatutory claims”—were not judicially reviewable. In reaching that result, the court first\nconcluded that neither the Rules nor the Tennessee Valley Authority Act created a “private right\nof action” to enforce the Rules. The district court so held notwithstanding our indication in an\nunpublished opinion that plaintiffs may challenge the board’s decisions using causes of action\nthat predate the APA. See Beaman v. Ret. Sys. of Tenn. Valley Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (6th\nCir. 1991) (table opinion). According to the district court, the Rules-violation arguments could\nnot be asserted under the APA either, because the TVARS did not fall within the APA’s\ndefinition of “agency.” That conclusion meant that the court could not review any arguments\nthat the board had violated the Rules. As for the Takings Clause claim, the district court held\nthat the claim was without merit because the Rules did not create a property right in a particular\namount of COLAs. The district court also rejected an estoppel claim, a claim that the plaintiffs\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 8\n\n\ndo not press on appeal. The district court reasoned in conclusion that the purported non-\nreviewability of the board’s actions was attributable to the unique, quasi-governmental nature of\nthe retirement system.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that their Rules-violation arguments are reviewable, that\nthe board violated Rule 13 by reducing vested COLAs, and that they were deprived of COLAs in\nviolation of the Takings Clause. The TVARS agrees as to the reviewability of its own actions.\nAs for the TVA, the agency argues primarily that the 2009 amendments did not violate the\nTakings Clause. This conclusion, the TVA maintains, moots every other issue.\n\n       Because none of the parties disputed the judicial reviewability of the Rules-violation\narguments in the district court, and the issue is not a matter of court jurisdiction, we can safely\nassume that those claims are reviewable under one rubric or another, without resolving the\nesoteric issue of what precise cause of action obtains. Even without the parties’ concessions, the\nclaims are reviewable, given the strong presumption of reviewability and the fact that the APA\ndid not displace common-law review. Even though the Rules-violation claims are reviewable,\naffirmance is nonetheless required on the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim that future COLAs are\nvested benefits. That claim, which was briefed on appeal, is foreclosed by the plain language of\nthe Rules. Nor does it help the plaintiffs that the TVARS now agrees with the plaintiffs\nconcerning vesting, as there are strong reasons for not applying the deference described in Auer\nv. Robbins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118089\"><a href=\"/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), to that agency’s litigation position.        Lastly, our holding\nregarding vesting requires the conclusion that the agencies were entitled to summary judgment\non the Takings Clause claim, as well. In short, a forfeitable benefit cannot be a constitutionally\nprotected property right for Takings Clause purposes.\n\n                                                I.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, the APA does not provide a basis for judicial reviewability in\nthis case. Chapter 7 of the APA governs judicial review of agency action, empowering courts to\nset aside final agency action. 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 705. Yet that statute’s procedural and substantive\n\fNo. 15-6019                       Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 9\n\n\nprovisions regarding agency action extend only to statutorily-defined agencies.            See id.\n§ 701(b)(1). The TVARS does not meet that criterion.\n\n        Section 701 excludes “agencies composed of representatives of the parties or of\nrepresentatives of organizations of the parties to the disputes determined by them.”            Id.\n§ 701(b)(1)(E). The TVARS board fits squarely within the first part of this exception, because it\nis composed of representatives of the parties to this case. Although the APA does not define the\nword “representative,” that word naturally includes members of a governmental body who are\nappointed or elected by management and employee groups, as are six of the directors on the\nboard. Three board members are elected by TVARS participants, see Rule 3.2, and so those\nmembers are most fairly characterized as representatives of the participants. So too with the\nthree directors appointed by the TVA: those members are best understood as representatives of\nTVA management. Allowing plan participants and the TVA to place three members on the\nboard allows the interests of the financier and the payee to be represented in the board’s\ndecision-making processes. As a practical matter, that is what happened here. When voting on\nthe summary-judgment brief in this litigation, the board split 4-3, with the three TVA-appointed\ndirectors siding with the agency and the three participant-elected directors voting that COLAs\nare   vested.        See     TVARS,      TVA     Retirement     System    Board   of     Directors,\nhttp://www.tvars.com/aboutus.htm (last visited June 24, 2016).           Board members are thus\nrepresentatives of the groups to whom they owe their position.\n\n        Moreover, the phrase at the end of § 701(b)(1)(E), “to the disputes determined by them,”\napplies on its face to the TVARS board. First, the board necessarily resolves disputes between\nitself and plan participants in light of its “exclusive responsibility” under Rule 3.7 “for\ndetermining . . . what benefits are payable by the Retirement System and to whom they shall be\npaid.” Rule 3.7. Second, when the board makes decisions on what benefits are payable by the\nretirement system, it also impliedly resolves disputes between plan participants and the funder of\nthe retirement system, the TVA. In this case, for instance, by interpreting the Rules as vesting\nCOLAs, the TVARS has attempted to exercise just that kind of dispute-resolution power.\n\n        Because the TVARS is not an “agency” for APA purposes, the APA does not provide for\njudicial reviewability of its action.\n\fNo. 15-6019                          Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                               Page 10\n\n\n                                                        B.\n\n        But even though the APA does not apply, the decisions of the TVARS are judicially\nreviewable. Both the TVARS and the TVA have conceded that the plaintiffs’ Rules-violation\narguments are reviewable. In any event, agency action was presumptively judicially reviewable\nbefore the APA was enacted.\n\n        The TVA’s decision not to argue reviewability in the district court is significant.\n“[W]hile subject-matter jurisdiction can never be waived or forfeited, we usually require timely\nand reasoned presentation of non-jurisdictional issues to avoid forfeiture.”                         Winnett v.\nCaterpillar, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1253884\"><a href=\"/opinion/1253884/winnett-v-caterpillar-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1006 (6th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). Reviewability is such\na non-jurisdictional issue.         Because this case involves the interpretation of regulations\npromulgated by a federal agency, see Kinzer, 142 F.2d at 837–38, the district court had\njurisdiction to hear this case under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In contrast to subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthe question of reviewability relates to whether a cause of action exists and whether review has\nbeen foreclosed by a statute or other type of law. The parties are free to concede reviewability if\nthey so choose, and both agencies have done so here. Although the TVA did not make an\nexplicit concession in the district court that the case was reviewable, the TVA also did not make\nany argument in the other direction. The TVA argued below that “Plaintiffs’ argument [for a\nRules violation] necessarily fails because . . . the TVARS Board’s judgment that the\nAmendments did not reduce benefits in violation of [Rule 13’s] anti-cutback provision was not\narbitrary and capricious.” That is an argument concerning the merits, not about whether judicial\nreview exists. Nor has the TVA made a serious effort to contest reviewability on appeal.2\n\n        Even if the TVA or the TVARS had taken a different litigation position regarding\nreviewability in the district court, an independent analysis of the issue yields the same result. In\n\n\n        2\n          The TVA’s brief focuses almost entirely on issues other than reviewability. At the end of the brief, the\nTVA appears to advert to two arguments that could be construed as arguments against reviewability. Neither one\nhas any force. First, the TVA argues that the plaintiffs waived any claims for “nonstatutory” review by failing to\nlabel the claims as nonstatutory claims in the district court. The nomenclature of the claims, however, is not\ndispositive of the waiver issue, particularly where, as here, a claim can be defined in various ways. Second, the\nTVA argues that the plaintiffs should have used an administrative appeals procedure that was added to the Rules in\n2012. But the complaint in this case was filed in 2010, and the TVA cannot defeat judicial review by pointing to an\namendment that was adopted after litigation in this case had already begun.\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 11\n\n\nthis case, we need not decide whether reviewability of agency action outside of the APA should\nbe described as § 1331 review, nonstatutory review, or federal common-law review.              We\nlikewise need not determine whether the relevant cause of action lies in certiorari or mandamus,\nor by means of equitable relief. Whatever the appropriate label for describing the basis for\nreviewability, the plaintiffs’ claims are reviewable, and the scope of review and extent of our\npower are the same, at least in the context of this case.\n\n       Reviewability is the norm. Courts strongly presume the reviewability of agency action,\nand nothing rebuts that principle here.       “[J]udicial review of a final agency action by an\naggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the\npurpose of Congress.” Abbott Labs. v.

Id.\n(citation omitted). In 5 U.S.C. § 701(a), the APA codified the two primary ways by which\nagency conduct may be made unreviewable. See also Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140; 33 Charles\nA. Wright & Charles H. Koch, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 8390 (1st ed. 2006). These\nlimits pre-existed the APA. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140; U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney\nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 94 (1947). Neither one applies here.\nFirst, no statute precludes judicial review of the actions of the TVARS board. The Tennessee\nValley Authority Act does not mention the TVARS. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 831–831ee. Nor does the\nstatute preclude review of the actions of the TVA or an agency created by the TVA, and a\nstatute’s silence does not indicate that Congress intended to make agency action unreviewable,\nsee Peoples Gas, Light & Coke Co. v. U.S. Postal Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393971\"><a href=\"/opinion/393971/peoples-gas-light-and-coke-company-v-united-states-postal-service-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190 n.4 (7th Cir. 1981).\nSecond, no argument has been made that the decisions of the TVARS are committed to agency\ndiscretion by law.

Page 12\n\n\n       Reviewability in this case is supported by our reasoning in Beaman, another case\ninvolving claims against the TVARS. In Beaman, the plaintiff challenged a decision by the\nboard to award the equity in a savings plan to the decedent’s estate. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1–2.\nAlthough the parties disputed the applicability of the APA, we declined to rule on that issue,\nreasoning that “the district court applied the correct standard of review”—the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard—“inasmuch as the standard of review would be the same under the Act or\nfederal common law.” Id. at *2. We thus recognized that regardless of whether the APA\napplied, the plaintiff’s claim was reviewable. Nothing in the opinion hinted that review of the\nboard’s decisions might be foreclosed by statute or any other reason.\n\n       As Beaman suggested, the fact that the APA’s remedies do not apply with respect to the\nTVARS does not change the picture. Far from displacing judicial review that occurs outside of\nthe APA regime—including review of agency action under the general federal-question statute—\nthe APA expressly acknowledges that this review survives. Section 703 provides that “[t]he\nform of proceeding for judicial review . . . in the absence or inadequacy” of special statutory\nreview is “any applicable form of legal action, including actions for declaratory judgments or\nwrits of prohibitory or mandatory injunction or habeas corpus, in a court of competent\njurisdiction.” 5 U.S.C. § 703. The actions mentioned in that section are representative of the\nactions that courts entertained before the APA’s enactment in 1946. See Louis L. Jaffe, Judicial\nControl of Administrative Action 164–96 (1965). Section 703 thus acknowledges that where a\nstatute does not establish a right of action, a case is nonetheless reviewable under any applicable\nlegal vehicle that predates the APA.\n\n       In an analogous case, the Seventh Circuit has explained the interaction between the\ncommon law and the APA:\n\n               The United States contends that a congressional intent to preclude review\n       can be inferred from the fact that Congress exempted the Postal Service from all\n       federal law dealing with public or federal contracts, as well as the Administrative\n       Procedure Act. The Administrative Procedure Act has been widely interpreted as\n       being merely declaratory of the common law of reviewability and standing\n       existing at the time of the statute’s enactment in 1948.

The House Report accompanying the APA supports\nthis reasoning.

That decision did not overturn all pre-APA bases for challenging agency conduct,\nbut instead concerned a plaintiff’s ability to enforce a federal regulation against a state actor who\nwas subject to the regulation. In that case, Martha Sandoval sued the director of the Alabama\nDepartment of Public Safety to enjoin a practice of administering state driver’s license\nexaminations only in English. Id. at 278–79. Sandoval argued that this policy violated a\nDepartment of Justice regulation forbidding funding recipients from “utiliz[ing] criteria or\nmethods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\nbecause of their race, color, or national origin.” Id. at 278 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2)).\nThe issue before the Court was “whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the\nregulation.” Id. at 279. In answering that question in the negative, the Court reasoned that\n“private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress” and that courts\nmust accordingly analyze the text and structure of a statute to determine whether Congress\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                       Page 14\n\n\nintended to create a private remedy. Id. at 286–88. In the statute at issue there, Congress had not\ndone so. Id. at 293.\n\n       There is a major difference between a plaintiff attempting to obtain a remedy against a\nperson subject to federal regulations, and a plaintiff attempting to hold an agency accountable for\nalleged violations of its own rules. Sandoval spoke to the former situation—alleged misconduct\nby a regulated person. But this case involves the latter situation—review of agency action. As\nthe Court’s 2015 decision in Mach Mining made clear, Sandoval did not overturn the\npresumption of reviewability that applies in the context of judicial review of agency action. See\nMach Mining, 135 S. Ct. at 1651.\n\n       Nor does our 1944 decision in Kinzer say otherwise concerning the reviewability of the\nboard’s actions. In that case, we held that the Rules were authorized by the Tennessee Valley\nAuthority Act and that they have the force of law. Kinzer, 142 F.2d at 836–38. In reaching that\nconclusion, we reasoned that the TVA “is free from a state’s regulation or control and subject to\nsuit only as permitted by the federal statute creating it.” Id. at 837. That sentence has no bearing\non this case. The sentence indicates only that Congress must waive sovereign immunity for the\nTVA to be subject to suit, not that the presumption of reviewability does not apply to the actions\nof that agency or the TVARS.\n\n       In sum, because extant causes of action survived the enactment of the APA and because\ncourts strongly presume judicial review of agency action, summary judgment was not\nappropriate on the basis of reviewability.      We need not resolve, however, the essentially\nacademic question of what particular cause of action is appropriate for the residual category of\nnon-APA agencies.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       On the merits of the Rules-violation arguments, the plaintiffs in their opening brief\naddressed the issue of whether COLAs are vested. As noted, Rule 13 provides that “[n]o\namendment to these Rules and Regulations shall be adopted which will reduce the then accrued\nbenefits of the existing members or beneficiaries which are nonforfeitable or covered by\n\fNo. 15-6019                          Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                             Page 15\n\n\naccumulated reserves held therefor.”3 Because COLAs are not vested benefits, the board did not\nviolate that provision by reducing or eliminating COLAs for the years 2010–2013. The agencies\nwere therefore entitled to summary judgment with respect to the claim that COLAs are vested\nbenefits.\n\n        The plain language of the Rules controls the analysis. See Mitchell v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1243</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1249 (10th Cir. 2015). Most significantly, one provision that is located in two separate\nCOLA paragraphs indicates that the amount of a COLA is completely within the board’s\ndiscretion.    According to that provision, when the board calculates COLAs, “[t]he rate of\nincrease shall be the percent increase in the CPI over the preceding [year]; provided, however,\nthat the increase for any year shall not exceed five percent (5%) except that the board may, in its\ndiscretion and with the approval of TVA, apply for any year a maximum different from that\nspecified above.” Rule 6.I, 7.L. This provision authorizes the board to vary from the CPI and\nreduce a COLA as long as the board does so with the TVA’s approval. Although it is true that\nthe quoted language says that “the increase for any year shall not exceed five percent”—language\nthat in isolation might suggest that the provision grants only the authority to exceed a 5% cap—\nthe discretion-granting clause uses the words “different from.” Those words indicate that the\nboard has discretion not just to go above the 5% cap with TVA approval, but also to reduce the\nCOLA rate.\n\n        Other sections confirm this interpretation of Rules 6.I and 7.L, proving that the discretion\nthat those provisions mention includes the discretion to reduce future COLAs. For one thing, the\nRules do not explicitly state that COLAs are vested benefits. Vested benefits are defined only in\nRule 11.B, which is entitled “Vested (Nonforfeitable) Benefits and Segregation of Funds.” (The\nCOLA-funding provisions in Rules 6.I and 7.L expressly incorporate Rule 11, stating that the\nboard shall provide COLAs “subject, however, to the provisions of section 11.”) The first\n\n\n        3\n           One might ask how a legal document can coherently limit a provision for its own amendment when the\nlimit itself might be amendable. Yet legal provisions often do so. For instance, Article V of the Constitution\nprohibits an amendment that would deprive a state of its equal voting power in the Senate. U.S. Const. art. V. We\nneed not resolve the conundrum of whether the provision here is coherent, as the parties have not argued the\nlawfulness of Rule 13. We accordingly assume that Rule 13 validly prohibits amendments that reduce vested\nbenefits, even though conceivably Rule 13 could itself be amended to permit such a vested-benefit-reducing\namendment.\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 16\n\n\nparagraph of Rule 11.B.1 indicates that member contributions, pension benefits, and\nsupplemental benefits are vested. The rule provides in relevant part:\n\n       Rights to benefits based on a member’s own contributions shall be nonforfeitable\n       at all times. A nonforfeitable right to accrued benefits from creditable service\n       based on TVA’s contributions shall arise [upon the occurrence of one of the listed\n       events]. A nonforfeitable right to cash balance account benefits based on TVA’s\n       contributions shall arise upon completion of 5 years of cash balance service.\n\nIn contrast to benefits based on a member’s creditable service—a category that includes pension\nand supplemental benefits—and benefits based on member contributions, COLAs are not\nmentioned in Rule 11.B.1, but rather in Rule 11.B.2, which explains what happens if the TVA\ndiscontinues or reduces its contributions to the retirement system. This is significant. COLAs\nare not included in the same paragraph as the three types of benefits that indisputably are vested,\nand COLAs likely would have been included in that paragraph if they were vested, as the\n“Notice of Amendments” that accompanied the 1974 amendments to the Rules indicated that\n“[v]ested benefits are defined in section 11B1.” Nor are COLAs calculated in the same way as\nthe nonforfeitable benefits based on TVA contributions that Rule 11.B.1 describes. Unlike those\nbenefits, COLAs are related not just to a member’s years of service, but also to the CPI. What is\nmore, Rule 11.B.2 distinguishes between COLAs and nonforfeitable benefits by stating that both\ntypes of payments have priority over other benefits in the event that the TVA reduces its\ncontributions to the retirement system.         These distinctions suggest that COLAs and\nnonforfeitable benefits are not one and the same.\n\n       Rule 11’s other sections, too, treat COLAs differently from benefits that clearly are\nvested. Rule 11.B.4.a, for instance, provides that “[f]unds of the System sufficient to provide\nnonforfeitable benefits shall be segregated in the System’s accounts and shall thereafter be used\nin the following order of priority.” The rule then indicates that member contributions take top\npriority, that pension benefits follow, and that supplemental benefits come last. COLAs are not\nmentioned in subsection (a). Rather, they are addressed in subsection (e), which provides that\n“[t]o the fullest extent TVA finds feasible, it will also make additional contributions as required\nfrom time to time to provide cost-of-living increases pursuant to sections 6I, 7L or 18C3 for\nthose with nonforfeitable benefits based on service prior to such discontinuance or reduction [of\n\fNo. 15-6019                            Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                                  Page 17\n\n\nTVA contributions].” Two points about this subsection deserve mention. First, the subsection\nqualifies the TVA’s duty to fund COLAs with the language “[t]o the fullest extent TVA finds\nfeasible.” That language strongly suggests that although the board should prioritize the payment\nof COLAs, it has the discretion to reduce them. Second, the subsection uses the phrase “cost-of-\nliving increases” in the same sentence as “for those with nonforfeitable benefits,” which suggests\nthat the two phrases refer to different benefits. That distinction is another sign that COLAs are\nnot vested.\n\n          The Rules treat COLAs in a similar way in the section that addresses the termination of\nthe retirement system.          Rule 11.C.1 states that “[p]romptly upon the termination of the\nRetirement System, the board shall make such arrangements as it deems necessary or appropriate\nto assure payment of (1) benefits based on members’ contributions; and (2) nonforfeitable\nbenefits based on TVA contributions and, so far as it finds feasible, cost-of-living increases\nrelated thereto.”         Like Rule 11.B, this provision distinguishes between COLAs and\nnonforfeitable benefits, and also qualifies the TVA’s responsibility with regard to COLAs.4\n\n          In short, there is a difference between funding certain types of high-priority payments\nwhenever possible, and writing in stone that those payments can never be reduced. COLAs\nundoubtedly have played and continue to play an important role in the retirement packages of\nplan participants. Many participants may have expected that COLAs would always be provided.\nBut whether COLAs are vested is a different question, to which the Rules provide an answer. It\nis not our business to ensure a lifetime entitlement to COLAs by rewriting the Rules.\n\n          The plaintiffs offer several rejoinders to this conclusion, but none requires a different\nresult.\n\n\n\n\n          4\n            The plaintiffs cite two cases in support of the argument that Rule 11 is not relevant to the question of\nvesting, see Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110257\"><a href=\"/opinion/110257/nachman-corp-v-pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377–78 (1980); A-T-O, Inc. v.\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384411\"><a href=\"/opinion/384411/a-t-o-inc-v-pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1018–19 (6th Cir. 1980), but neither one requires that conclusion.\nAs an initial matter, both cases arose under ERISA—a statute that defines nonforfeitable and accrued benefits—and\nso have little bearing on governmental plans like the one here. Still more, the cases addressed a type of plan\nprovision that is not at issue here—one that attempted to allow employers, upon plan termination, to disclaim\nliability for vested benefits to the extent that a fund’s assets were not sufficient to cover the benefits. See Nachman,\n446 U.S. at 362; A-T-O, 634 F.2d at 1019. This appeal involves no such provision.\n\fNo. 15-6019                      Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 18\n\n\n          First is the plaintiffs’ chief objection, which concerns the issue of deference to the\nTVARS. This is not a case, however, where Auer deference is due. The plaintiffs argue that the\nTVARS—in its summary judgment brief—interpreted the Rules as vesting COLAs, and that the\nagency’s position is therefore entitled to substantial deference. The TVARS’ position was based\non, among other things, language in the Rules stating that the board “shall increase” benefits by\nproviding COLAs, the board’s longstanding practice of awarding COLAs, and the way that the\nboard’s actuary classified COLAs in the annual report to the TVA. Although under Auer,\n519 U.S. at 461–62, courts ordinarily defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations,\nAuer does not apply in the context of this case.\n\n          In the first place, the plain text of the Rules precludes deference to the TVARS. “Auer\ndeference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous. . . . To defer to\n[an] agency’s position [where the text is clear] would be to permit the agency, under the guise of\ninterpreting a regulation, to create de facto a new regulation.” Christensen v. Harris Cty.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118362\"><a href=\"/opinion/118362/christensen-v-harris-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (2000). As noted, the discretion-granting provisions in Rules 6.I and 7.L,\nwhen read in conjunction with Rule 11, allow the board to reduce COLAs. That should end the\nmatter.\n\n          Even if the text were less clear, Auer would still not apply. The TVARS was designed in\na way that makes it functionally subordinate to the TVA. The nature of that junior agency/senior\nagency relationship suggests that the views of the TVARS on the vesting of COLAs—payments\nthat in any given year might involve high-dollar amounts—should not trump the view of the\nTVA. Although the TVARS has an obligation to look out for the interests of plan participants\nand is legally distinct from the TVA, the TVA exercises substantial control over the retirement\nsystem. For example, the TVA exercises total control over the pursestrings, as it provides all\nfunding for the retirement system except for member contributions. Because the TVARS does\nnot provide the funding, some of the directors on its board may be inclined to take a position that\nis more favorable to plan participants and less so to the TVA. The TVA also has the final say-so\non every amendment by virtue of its veto power. Moreover, the entire retirement system was\ncreated by, and could be dissolved by, the TVA. These aspects of the relationship between the\nagencies suggest that the TVARS should not be granted greater deference than the TVA in the\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                     Page 19\n\n\nmatter of COLAs, a matter that has significant ramifications for the TVA’s funding\nresponsibility.\n\n       Rule 3.7 does not foreclose that conclusion. It is true that the rule endows the TVARS\nwith some degree of interpretive authority regarding the Rules:\n\n       The board shall have sole and exclusive responsibility for determining under these\n       Rules and Regulations what benefits are payable by the retirement System and to\n       whom they shall be paid; and the board’s interpretation and application of the\n       Rules and Regulations in these and all other matters pertaining to the System’s\n       operations . . . shall be final and conclusive as to all parties.\n\nThis rule, however, does not allow the TVARS to rewrite the Rules. In this case, crediting the\nTVARS litigation position over the TVA’s would potentially allow the TVARS to require the\nTVA to fund benefits that neither agency originally agreed to provide. The TVARS claims a\nright to obtain $200 million from the TVA, and supposes that it should obtain deference in\ndeciding the vesting question. That result cannot be squared with the purpose of the Auer\ndoctrine.\n\n       Another reason also counsels against applying Auer.        The TVARS has changed its\nposition on COLAs several times in the past seven years, a fact that decreases the level of\ndeference that a court should give to its litigation position, see Thomas Jefferson University v.\nShalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 (1994). Before 2009, at least some of the board members believed\nthat COLAs were vested. At odds with that position, however, is the board’s 2009 vote, which a\nmajority of the board has since characterized as a mistake. No matter how rushed, uninformed,\nor ill-advised the 2009 decision, the fact remains that a majority of the board approved the\nreduction in COLAs. That action is not consistent with the view that COLAs are protected from\nreduction. In addition, some consideration was in fact given to the vesting issue before the vote,\nas the board’s chairman consulted an actuary in July 2009 concerning whether COLAs are\nvested. Moreover, even though the board now maintains that the 2009 amendments were illegal,\nit took the board almost six years to formally disavow that decision by approving the TVARS\nsummary-judgment brief. If one of the directors who voted to approve the brief is replaced in the\nnear future, the agency’s position could change yet again. This is not the type of case where an\nagency’s most recent interpretation of a regulation should be given deference.\n\fNo. 15-6019                     Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                      Page 20\n\n\n       Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co. is not to the contrary. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2011). In that case, the Court held that an agency’s position may be entitled to deference even if\nthe position is contained in an amicus brief. Id. at 59 (citing Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208–10 (2011)). The distinction between this case and Talk America is that the\nagency in that case had not recently taken action that was inconsistent with the position in the\namicus brief. Also there, unlike here, the Court could say that there is no “reason to suspect that\nthe interpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judgment.” Id. (citation\nomitted). That distinction makes all the difference for Auer purposes.\n\n       Apart from Auer deference, the plaintiffs’ arguments related to the language of the\nCOLA-funding provisions do not compel the conclusion that COLAs are vested. First, the\nplaintiffs argue that COLAs are part and parcel of the adjusted benefits, such that COLAs\nnecessarily vest along with the underlying base benefits. That argument cannot be squared with\nRule 11, however, which expressly distinguishes between COLAs and nonforfeitable benefits.\nMoreover, the Rules’ description of COLAs as increases or adjustments to the base benefits\nsuggests that COLAs are not inextricably linked to those benefits. Rule 6.I, 7.L; see also Frazier\nv. City of Chattanooga, No. 1:14-CV-128, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9309123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (E.D. Tenn. Nov. 23, 2015).\nSecond, the plaintiffs argue that the Rules use “mandatory, durational language” to refer to\nCOLAs, noting that the Rules provide that “[t]he board shall increase . . . that portion of the\nmonthly benefit payable” with COLAs. Rule 6.I, 7.L (emphasis added). The use of the word\n“shall” is not determinative. That word is best read to require the board to fund COLAs every\nyear unless and until the board exercises its discretion to amend the Rules to change the COLA\nrate. In other words, decreasing COLAs requires a formal amendment, not merely a decision by\nthe board that COLAs should be reduced.\n\n       In sum, the Rules do not vest COLAs. Although the district court did not rule on this\nmerits question, the court’s judgment may be affirmed in part on this alternative basis. On\nremand, the district court must address any remaining arguments for a Rules violation that are\nnot abandoned.\n\fNo. 15-6019                       Duncan, et al. v. Muzyn, et al.                   Page 21\n\n\n                                                    III.\n\n         Our conclusion on the vesting issue necessarily requires dismissal of the Takings Clause\nclaim.    Although the plaintiffs’ claim is framed as a Takings claim, the analysis borrows\nprinciples from the Contract Clause context. The first step in the analysis is whether the\nclaimant has demonstrated a cognizable property interest, see Coalition for Government\nProcurement v. Federal Prison Industries, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785874\"><a href=\"/opinion/785874/coalition-for-government-procurement-v-federal-prison-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (6th Cir. 2004) (citation\nomitted), which may include an enforceable contract right, see Parella v. Retirement Board of\nthe Rhode Island Employees’ Retirement System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198432\"><a href=\"/opinion/198432/parella-v-retirement/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (3d Cir. 1999). Where a public\ncontract is alleged to have been created by statute, however, a plaintiff may prove a contractual\nrelationship only by showing that the legislature has unmistakably intended to create a binding\ncontract right. See id. at 60 (citation omitted).\n\n         That showing is absent here. Because COLAs are not vested, the TVARS did not\nunmistakably intend to prevent itself from reducing COLAs below the CPI rate. The 2009\namendments, then, did not deprive the plaintiffs of a protected property right.\n\n                                                    IV.\n\n         The judgment of the district court is affirmed with respect to the claim that COLAs are\nvested benefits. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
