Koppe,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Las Vegas, Nevada, for\nrespondent United States of America.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nWALLACE, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Curtin appeals from his conviction and sentence for travel-\ning across state lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with\na minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), and of use of an\ninterstate facility to attempt to persuade a minor to engage in\nsex, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). We have jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm in part, reverse in\npart, and remand for a new trial.\n\n                               I.\n\n   On the afternoon of February 11, 2004, Las Vegas Metro-\npolitan Police Department Detective Michael Castaneda was\nacting undercover on the Internet as a 14-year-old girl using\nthe screen name “christine13.” Castaneda entered a chat chan-\nnel labeled “ltgirlsexchat” and received an instant message\nfrom Curtin, who used the screen name “M-42SOCAL.”\n\n   The detective, as “Christy,” and Curtin “chatted” through\ninstant messaging for approximately four hours. They\nexchanged photos early in the conversation. Castaneda sent\nCurtin a picture of a female police officer, taken when she\nwas fourteen years old. Curtin said his name was “Kenny”\nand that he was forty-two years old, divorced, and living in\nAnaheim, California. He told Christy that he was planning to\ntravel to Las Vegas on Friday, February 13 and invited her to\ngo to a “Penn and Teller” show on Sunday, February 15.\nChristy agreed.\n\f3674               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   Curtin extensively discussed sex with Christy during this\nconversation, saying that he would love for her to “spend the\nnight” after the show and hoped to “get a room.” Curtin told\nChristy “I want to make you happy . . . . If you were mastur-\nbating and fantasizing about sex, I’d love to have sex with\nyou.” He added that they “could just make out or I could just\ngive you oral sex or we could just fool around.” Finally, Cur-\ntin made plans to meet Christy in the bowling alley of a Las\nVegas casino at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 15. At the end\nof the conversation, Curtin asked Christy to try sleeping\nnaked that night, and to “imagine my face moving between\nyour legs and licking you. Imagine my tongue penetrating\nyou.”\n\n   The next day, Curtin sent Christy an email message saying\n“I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to Sunday.\nWe’re going to have a great time.” The detective and Curtin\nlater that day had another “chat” during which Curtin contin-\nued to make explicit references to having sex with Christy.\nCurtin concluded the “chat” by confirming their meeting and\ntelling Christy he would introduce her to Penn and Teller as\nhis niece, adding, “Let’s not get caught, ever.”\n\n   On that Sunday, the police officer whose picture was sent\nto Curtin waited in the bowling alley as a decoy, dressed in\nthe clothes that Christy indicated she would be wearing. Eight\nto ten other law enforcement officers were also present. Cur-\ntin entered the bowling alley at 1:45 p.m. and walked towards\nthe area where the decoy officer was sitting. He walked past\nher and then turned and walked past her again, looking at her\neach time. Curtin then left the area where the decoy was sit-\nting and went to the back of the bowling alley, where he used\nhis personal digital assistant. At the request of law enforce-\nment officers, a casino security guard approached Curtin and\nasked for identification. Curtin showed the guard a United\nStates passport and subsequently left the bowling alley area of\nthe casino.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                 3675\n   Curtin reentered the bowling alley approximately 2:05 p.m.\nHe looked around and again walked to the area where the\ndecoy officer was sitting. After less than a minute, he moved\neven closer to her, looking in her direction the entire time. He\nstopped behind the officer and she turned and said “hi” to\nhim. Whether he said “hi” in return is disputed.\n\n   He then left the bowling alley and started getting into a van,\nat which point law enforcement officers stopped and asked\nhim for identification. He was detained by police and advised\nof his rights under Miranda. After Curtin waived these rights,\nhe agreed to speak with the law enforcement officers. In a\nvoluntary statement, he stated that he had traveled by car to\nLas Vegas for meetings. He explained that he was at the\nbowling alley to meet a female friend he had met on the inter-\nnet. He admitted to using the screen name and email address\nused to contact Christy. Curtin explained that he often enters\nchat rooms and “role play[s]” as if he is engaged in “daddy/\ndaughter” type conversations, and that he expected Christy to\nbe a thirty- to forty-year-old woman pretending to be a girl.\n\n   Curtin was then arrested by the Las Vegas police. Upon\nsearching his van and hotel room, police seized his digital\nassistant and laptop computer. The digital assistant contained\nover 140 stories about adults having sex with children. The\nlaptop contained a list of chat channels that Curtin had\naccessed in the past, as well as pictures of girls whose names\nmatched some of those in his “chat” list.\n\n   Curtin was indicted on one count of travel with intent to\nengage in a sexual act with a juvenile, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 2423(b), and one count of coercion and enticement,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). Curtin filed two motions\nin limine asking the district court to exclude the stories found\non his digital assistant from evidence. The district court\ndenied these motions in limine. On the second day of trial, the\ngovernment offered two of the stories, “My Little Sister” and\n“Love for the World,” to show modus operandi, intent, prepa-\n\f3676                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nration, and knowledge. They were admitted over Curtin’s\nobjection. The engineer who extracted the stories from the\ndigital assistant testified that both stories were about a father\nhaving sex with his young daughter and the daughter’s enjoy-\nment of the experience. However, when the government\nsought to introduce a third story, “Melanie’s Busy Day,” the\ndistrict court stopped the questioning. The court allowed the\ngovernment to ask general questions without admitting the\nstories, such as whether they all related to sex between a\nminor and an adult. However, recognizing the highly prejudi-\ncial nature of the stories, the court held that the story could\nbe entered into evidence only if it tied into Curtin’s intent,\nknowledge, preparation, or modus operandi.\n\n   The government then asked the court to make a preliminary\nlegal determination about the admissibility of the remaining\nstories. The government argued that “Melanie’s Busy Day”\nwas admissible to show general intent, modus operandi, prep-\naration, and knowledge because it had language similar to that\nused by Curtin in his email to Christy, namely, language con-\ncerning oral sex and a child masturbating. The government\nargued that “Missing Big Brother,” which discussed how the\nadult did not want to hurt the child during sex, was also\nadmissible for intent, modus operandi, preparation, and\nknowledge. The government made similar arguments with\nregard to seventeen other stories, with titles such as “I’m\nBeing Molested,” “The Good Girl,” “A Relative Interest,”\n“Restrictions,” “Teaching the Kids,” and “Mommy Juice.”\n\n   The following morning, Curtin renewed his objection to the\nadmission of the stories, arguing that they were highly preju-\ndicial and were being admitted to show propensity. The dis-\ntrict court held that if the government could cite a part of the\nstory that related to one of the permissible purposes under\nFederal Rule of Evidence Rule 404(b), then the court would\nadmit the entire story to show general intent.\n\n   The district court admitted to being unable to read the sto-\nries because they were so disturbing. “I thought about this\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3677\nproblem overnight because I want to address the relative over-\nwhelming prejudice versus the purpose. I read the first story\nand a little bit of the second. That’s as far as I could get,\nwhich is confirming [defense counsel’s] statement. It has a\ntendency to overwhelm you and overwhelm the jury.” How-\never, after more argument, the district court agreed to give a\nlimiting instruction and to admit five of the stories: “My Little\nSister” (which involved incest and the impregnation of a nine-\nyear-old girl), “Love for the World” (which involved incest),\n“Restrictions” (same), “Daddy’s Lessons” (same), and “Mela-\nnie’s Busy Day” (which involved an eleven-year-old girl initi-\nating sex with, among others, her father and her teacher).\n\n  The limiting instruction given was as follows:\n\n       A person cannot be charged nor convicted of liter-\n    ature that they read or that they possess. That’s why\n    I’m giving you the instruction.\n\n       But the Government has the obligation to prove,\n    beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had\n    the wrongful intent. They may offer possession of\n    such literature to show that. . . .\n\n       You may take this kind of evidence on the ques-\n    tion of whether the defendant actually possessed the\n    intent.\n\n       You may also take it on the additional questions\n    which go to the question of intent, whether he prac-\n    ticed in this alleged conduct methodology consistent\n    with literature that he had or tending to show that he\n    prepared to commit the acts or that he had knowl-\n    edge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act\n    was illegal. . . .\n\n       So, for those four reasons, only, the Government\n    is offering to show that the defendant possessed this\n\f3678                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    literature; intent, method, preparation, and knowl-\n    edge. And you may only take it for that purpose.\n\n       Again, you have a constitutional right. You have\n    that right. You would want to protect the defendant’s\n    right to possess any kind of literature and to read it\n    or not read it.\n\n      You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias\n    you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate\n    question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that.\n\n                               II.\n\n   Curtin contends that the five stories were inadmissible\ncharacter evidence, introduced to show propensity in violation\nof Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The govern-\nment responds that the stories fall outside the parameters of\nRule 404(b) because they are inextricably intertwined with the\ncharged crimes. Alternatively, the government argues that the\nstories were properly admitted under Rule 404(b) to prove\nCurtin’s intent.\n\n                               A.\n\n   The government argues that the admitted stories were “in-\nextricably intertwined” with the facts giving rise to the indict-\nment against Curtin and therefore not “other acts” evidence\nwithin the scope of Rule 404(b). We review de novo the ques-\ntion of whether the evidence was within the scope of Rule\n404(b). See United States v. DeGeorge, 380 F.3d 1203, 1219\n(9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   [1] Two categories of evidence may be considered “inextri-\ncably intertwined” with a charged offense and therefore\nadmitted without regard to Rule 404(b). First, evidence of\nprior acts may be admitted if the evidence “constitutes a part\nof the transaction that serves as the basis for the criminal\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                 3679\ncharge.” DeGeorge, 380 F.3d at 1220, quoting United States\nv. Vizcarra-Martinez, 66 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir. 1995). In\nUnited States v. Montgomery, 384 F.3d 1050, 1062 (9th Cir.\n2004), we held that a government report detailing individual\nfraudulent acts was “inextricably intertwined” with the under-\nlying conspiracy charge because the acts themselves com-\nprised the conspiracy. Therefore, the report was admissible\nwithout regard to Rule 404(b). Similarly, in United States v.\nLillard, 354 F.3d 850, 854 (9th Cir. 2003), we concluded that\nthe defendant’s theft of cocaine from a shipment, which was\nitself the basis for the conspiracy, was “inextricably inter-\ntwined” with the conspiracy charge.\n\n   [2] Second, prior act evidence may be admitted without\nregard to Rule 404(b) “when it [is] necessary to do so in order\nto permit the prosecutor to offer a coherent and comprehensi-\nble story regarding the commission of the crime.” DeGeorge,\n380 F.3d at 1220, quoting Vizcarra-Martinez, 66 F.3d at\n1012-13. “A jury is entitled to know the circumstances and\nbackground of a criminal charge. It cannot be expected to\nmake its decision in a void—without knowledge of the time,\nplace, and circumstances of the acts which form the basis of\nthe charge.” United States v. Daly, 974 F.2d 1215, 1217 (9th\nCir. 1992), quoting United States v. Moore, 735 F.2d 289, 292\n(8th Cir. 1984). In United States v. Beckman, 298 F.3d 788,\n794 (9th Cir. 2002), the defendant was charged with import-\ning over 1,500 pounds of marijuana. His defense was that he\nwas tricked into transporting the marijuana by the chief gov-\nernment cooperating witness. This witness testified at length\nabout prior drug runs that Beckman had made on his behalf.\nWe held that the witness’s testimony was “inextricably inter-\ntwined” with the charged offense, because it was “intended to\nestablish [the witness’s] relationship to Beckman [and] to\nshow that the relationship was ongoing . . . .” Id.\n\n   [3] The fact that Curtin was in possession of stories detail-\ning sex with children at the time he went to meet “Christy”\nis insufficient to support the introduction of the stories with-\n\f3680               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nout regard to Rule 404(b). Curtin was charged with traveling\nacross state lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with a\nminor, and with attempting to persuade a minor to engage in\nsex. The possession or content of the stories was not a part of\nthe “transaction” that led to the present charges. Second, the\nadmission of the stories was not required for the prosecution\nto “offer a coherent story.” The prosecution would have had\nno difficulty in presenting all relevant evidence, including the\n“chat” conversations, Curtin’s admission that he was “M-\n42SOCAL,” and Curtin’s behavior at the meeting place, with-\nout the admission of the stories. Thus, the stories were not\n“inextricably intertwined” with the charged crimes.\n\n                              B.\n\n   In the alternative, the government contends that the stories\nare admissible under Rule 404(b) regardless of whether they\nare inextricably intertwined with the crime. We review a dis-\ntrict court’s admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) for an\nabuse of discretion. United States v. Romero, 282 F.3d 683,\n688 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   [4] We use a four-part test to determine whether evidence\nis admissible under Rule 404(b). United States v. Spillone,\n879 F.2d 514, 518 (9th Cir. 1989). First, “there must be suffi-\ncient evidence to support the jury’s finding that the defendant\ncommitted the other [act].” Id. Second, “the other [act] must\nnot be too remote [in time].” Id. at 519. Third, when admitted\nto prove intent, “the prior act must be similar.” Id. Finally,\n“the prior act must be introduced in order to prove a material\nelement of the case.” Id. The main issue here lies in the third\nelement: whether there is similarity between the possession of\nthe stories and the crime with which Curtin is charged.\n\n  Curtin objected to admission of the stories in the district\ncourt, relying on Guam v. Shymanovitz, 157 F.3d 1154 (9th\nCir. 1998) (as amended). Shymanovitz was a middle-school\nguidance counselor who was charged with sexually and physi-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                         3681\ncally abusing several of the boys under his supervision. Id. at\n1155. Prior to trial, the government sought to introduce two\nmagazine articles from sexually explicit magazines found in\nShymanovitz’s home, arguing that they were relevant to\nestablishing intent. The articles were both presumably fic-\ntional stories. One depicted sex between a father and son,\nwhile the other depicted sex between a priest and a child. The\ncourt deferred ruling on the motion.\n\n   At trial, the court permitted a police officer to testify that\nat Shymanovitz’s house she seized, among other things, con-\ndoms, surgical gloves, children’s underwear, and sexually\nexplicit magazines. The officer testified in great detail, over\ndefense counsel’s objections, about the contents of four of\nthese magazines. She told the jury that the magazines con-\ntained explicit photographs of homosexual sex and described\nthe photographs and the contents of the two articles in detail.\nThe two articles were subsequently entered into evidence. Id.\nat 1155.\n\n   [5] Both Shymanovitz and this appeal address whether the\nreading material at issue was admissible under Rule 404(b).\nWe concluded in Shymanovitz that the magazine articles\nfailed to constitute a Rule 404(b) “bad act.” “[P]ossession of\nlawful reading material is simply not the type of conduct con-\ntemplated by Rule 404(b).” Id. at 1159. Additionally, we held\nthat possession of lawful reading material was not similar to\nactual criminal conduct, thus failing the third criterion of the\nSpillone test. “[T]here is simply no doubt that a wide gulf sep-\narates the act of possessing written descriptions or stories\nabout criminal conduct from the act of committing the\noffenses described.” Id.1\n  1\n   The dissent argues that this case differs from Shymanovitz because the\ncrimes at issue in that case did not involve subjective intent. But even if\nShymanovitz involves slightly different facts, its legal rule does not distin-\nguish between specific intent crimes and other crimes. “Under the govern-\nment’s theory, the case against an accused child molester would be\n\f3682                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   [6] On the issue of similarity, Shymanovitz conforms with\nthe rest of our case law. In Vizcarra-Martinez, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy to possess a chemical with rea-\nson to believe it would be used to make methamphetamine. 66\nF.3d at 1009. The district court admitted evidence that\nVizcarra-Martinez was in possession of a personal-use\namount of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest. We\nreversed. “We simply cannot assume . . . that Vizcarra-\nMartinez’s use of methamphetamine tended to prove that he\nknew that the chemical in his possession would be used in the\nmethamphetamine manufacturing process.” Vizcarra-\nMartinez, 66 F.3d at 1015. The cases in which we have\n\nstronger if he owned a copy of Nabokov’s Lolita, and any murder defen-\ndant would be unfortunate to have in his possession a collection of Agatha\nChristie mysteries . . . .” Shymanovitz, 157 F.3d at 1159. Put simply, Shy-\nmanovitz is replete with language that dictates the outcome of this appeal.\nWe may not ignore its controlling effect on this case. See Barapind v.\nEnomoto, 400 F.3d 744, 751 n.8 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (per curiam).\n   The dissent’s discussion of cases like United States v. McCollum, 732\nF.2d 1419, 1425 (9th Cir. 1984), which involve the admission of similar\nprior criminal convictions to prove intent, is equally off point. In McCol-\nlum, we allowed admission of a prior conviction for armed robbery to\nnegate the defendant’s defense of acting under hypnosis. The relationship\nbetween the prior crime and the act charged is obviously far closer in\nMcCollum’s case than it is in Curtin’s. Curtin’s case involves otherwise\nlawful reading material that is not similar to the crime with which he is\nbeing charged. Essentially, the government here seeks to introduce posses-\nsion of material that describes one type of criminal conduct, namely incest\nwith minors, to prove intent to commit another type of criminal conduct,\nnamely crossing state borders to have sex with a minor. This is impermis-\nsible under our caselaw.\n   The dissent also argues at length that Curtin’s case is different because\nCurtin was actually in possession of the stories at the time of his arrest.\nHowever, the government never argued relevance based on physical pos-\nsession. In any event, this is a fallacious distinction because the stories\nwere saved as documents to Curtin’s handheld computer. In the absence\nof any evidence to the contrary, we should not infer that Curtin planned\nto “use” the stories or had the stories in mind simply because he was car-\nrying his computer at the time of his arrest.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                 3683\nallowed Rule 404(b) evidence show a much stronger connec-\ntion between the “other act,” which is often a crime in itself,\nand the charged crime. In United States v. Vo, 413 F.3d 1010,\n1018-19 (9th Cir. 2005), where the defendant was charged\nwith possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute,\nwe allowed the admission of a prior conviction for drug sell-\ning. “Vo’s prior conviction was evidence of his knowledge of\ndrug trafficking and distribution in general. The conviction\ntended to show that Vo was familiar with distribution of ille-\ngal drugs and that his actions in this case were not an accident\nor a mistake.” Id. at 1019.\n\n   [7] Shymanovitz does recognize a narrow exception for\n“modus operandi” evidence: evidence involving acts by the\ndefendant that are “so nearly identical in method as to ear-\nmark the charged offense the handiwork of the accused and\nthat are so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.”\nId. at 1159 n.9 (internal punctuation and citation omitted).\n“[U]se of modus operandi evidence is rare, and the similari-\nties must be specific and detailed and clearly set the particular\noffense apart from the general body of such offenses.” Id.\n\n   [8] The evidence in this case is not sufficiently detailed and\nspecific to fall within the exception. The stories did not\ndescribe specific methods of committing the first offense with\nwhich Curtin was charged: traveling across state borders to\nhave sex with a minor. Rather, the stories mostly involved\nexplicit descriptions of incest. Thus, the stories do not reveal\na relevant modus operandi to commit the charged crime, and\nare inadmissible. The issue is closer with regard to the charge\nof use of an interstate facility to attempt to persuade a minor\nto engage in sex. The government argued that the language in\nthe stories was similar to the language used by Curtin in his\n“chat” conversations. We conclude that Shymanovitz fore-\ncloses our acceptance of the government’s position. The con-\nduct with which Curtin was charged, and the language that\nCurtin used, can “hardly be construed as either distinctive or\nremarkable in the universe of sexual offenses against minors.”\n\f3684                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nId. Compare United States v. Dhingra, 371 F.3d 557, 566-67\n(9th Cir. 2004) (as amended) (allowing introduction of Rule\n404(b) modus operandi evidence where “[i]n both instances,\nDhingra contacted a minor under the age of 18 years over\n[instant messenger] for the purpose of soliciting sexual activ-\nity, arranged to meet, and at the meeting attempted to engage\nin sexual activity by persuasion and coercion.”). The similari-\nties between the stories and Curtin’s conduct were not distinc-\ntive or unusual enough to render the stories admissible as\nmodus operandi evidence.2\n  2\n    Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, we have not “made relevant litera-\nture off limits in the Ninth Circuit as a matter of law.” Nor do we “ham-\nstring[ ] the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Circuit with adults\nwho see children as sexual prey.” As pointed out above, in this case the\nprosecution may rely on Curtin’s presence in a chat room called “ltgirlsex-\nchat,” the “chat” conversations themselves, Curtin’s admission that he was\n“M-42SOCAL,” and Curtin’s behavior at the meeting place.\n   In terms of otherwise lawfully-possessed literature, modus operandi evi-\ndence and inextricably intertwined evidence remain admissible. Here,\nhowever, the jury was asked “to infer from behavior on one occasion\nsomething about the nature of a person and then to infer from that how the\nperson probably would have behaved on another occasion when the only\nconnection between the two occasions is that the [jury] believes that peo-\nple of a certain type would act the same way both times.” 1 Stephen A.\nSaltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual § 404.02[9] (8th ed.\n2002). Without more of a connection between the literature and the\naccused crimes, the literature is no more than character evidence intro-\nduced to show propensity, and highly prejudicial character evidence at\nthat.\n   The dissent argues at length that the evidence was necessary to refute\nCurtin’s testimony and “aggressive defense” of his intent to meet an adult,\nand attempts to distinguish Shymanovitz because Curtin actually testified.\nHowever, the stories were not offered for impeachment, on which we\nexpress no opinion. Nor do we believe that the stories were necessary\ngiven the strength of other evidence introduced by the government. In any\nevent, evidence is not admissible solely because it may be necessary or\nhelpful. Wholly apart from its prejudicial effect, we have held that “[t]he\nmere possession of reading material that describes a particular type of\nactivity makes it neither more nor less likely that a defendant would inten-\ntionally engage in the conduct described and thus fails to meet the test of\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                        3685\n   The government relies on United States v. Allen, 341 F.3d\n870 (9th Cir. 2003), to distinguish Shymanovitz. In Allen, the\ndefendants were charged with violating federally protected\nrights on the basis of race and religion. We allowed the intro-\nduction of “skinhead and white supremacist evidence,”\nincluding color photographs of the defendant’s tattoos (e.g.,\nswastikas), Nazi-related literature, group photographs includ-\ning some of the defendants (e.g., in “Heil Hitler” poses and\nstanding before a swastika that they later set on fire), and\nother skinhead paraphernalia. Id. at 885-86. We distinguished\nShymanovitz: “Key to our reasoning [in Shymanovitz] was the\nfact that the testimony . . . was not relevant to proving any of\nthe elements of the crime for which the defendant was con-\nvicted . . . .” Id. at 887 n.25. The government thus contends\nthat, when read together, “Shymanovitz and Allen stand for the\nprinciple that relevant literature is admissible to prove intent.”\n\n   [9] However, the government’s comparison to Allen does\nnot save the day. First, many of the items admitted into evi-\ndence in Allen involved more than the possession of reading\nmaterial. The defendants were active participants in “Heil Hit-\nler” poses and had posed with and burned a large swastika.\nSecond, unlike in Shymanovitz, there is no indication that the\nreading material in Allen was fictional. Third, the evidence at\nissue in this case, and in Shymanovitz, was extremely prejudi-\ncial. Finally, it is possible that the evidence in Allen would\nhave been admissible under the “inextricably intertwined”\nexception outlined above. Our holding here is controlled by\nShymanovitz. The district court committed an abuse of discre-\ntion by admitting the stories.\n\nrelevancy under Rule 401.” Shymanovitz, 157 F.3d at 1158. Here, the\nmaterials in Curtin’s possession told stories of incestuous sexual acts that\nwere different from those he was accused of intending to perpetrate. They\nwere offered as substantive evidence of guilt, and we simply hold that\ntheir admission in this case was an abuse of discretion.\n\f3686                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n                               C.\n\n   The government fails to argue harmless error and thus the\nissue is ordinarily waived. See United States v. Varela-Rivera,\n279 F.3d 1174, 1180 (9th Cir. 2002). We may, however, con-\nsider harmlessness sua sponte in “those unusual cases in\nwhich the harmlessness of any error is clear beyond serious\ndebate and further proceedings are certain to replicate the\noriginal result.” United States v. Gonzalez-Flores, 418 F.3d\n1093, 1100 (9th Cir. 2005). “[T]he court’s certainty as to the\nharmlessness of the error . . . is of particular importance.” Id.\nat 1101 (citations omitted). “[E]rror is harmless if we can say\nwith fair assurance that it did not have a substantial effect,\ninjurious to the defendant, on the jury’s decision-making pro-\ncess.” Arnold v. Runnels, 421 F.3d 859, 867 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(citations omitted).\n\n   [10] Here, we do not have the requisite level of certainty\nthat the error was harmless to consider the issue sua sponte.\nMost of the sexual activity described in the stories admitted\nfrom Curtin’s PDA was incestuous, a particularly prejudicial\ntaboo. The admitted stories were so highly disturbing that\neven the district court judge stated he was unable to read\nthem. The issue of harmless error is waived.\n\n                              III.\n\n   Curtin contends in his reply brief that the district court\nabused its discretion pursuant to Rule 403 by admitting the\nstories because the probative value of the stories is substan-\ntially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Curtin.\nHowever, Curtin did not specifically and distinctly make a\nRule 403 argument in his opening brief. “[O]n appeal, argu-\nments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed\nwaived.” Smith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(citation omitted); see also Greenwood v. FAA, 28 F.3d 971,\n977 (9th Cir. 1994). The argument is waived. In any event, for\nthe same reason we cannot say that the error was harmless, we\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                 3687\ncannot say that the admission of the materials on Curtin’s\nPDA was not unduly prejudicial.\n\n                              IV.\n\n   [11] Curtin argues that the government’s failure to request\na copy of the surveillance video from the casino violated due\nprocess and entitled him to a spoliation instruction. We dis-\nagree. The government’s duty to preserve evidence arises\nwhen the evidence “possess[es] an exculpatory value that was\napparent before the evidence was destroyed, and [is] of such\na nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain compa-\nrable evidence by other reasonably available means.” Califor-\nnia v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 489 (1984). “Unless a\ncriminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the\npolice, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not\nconstitute a denial of due process of law.” Arizona v. Young-\nblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988). As Curtin failed to show that\nthe video had any exculpatory value, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in declining Curtin’s request for a spolia-\ntion instruction.\n\n   [12] Curtin also argues that the district court failed to\ninstruct adequately on what constitutes a substantial step. The\ndistrict court instructed in accord with the model jury instruc-\ntions that “mere preparation was not a substantial step.” See\nModel Crim. Jury Instr. 9th Cir. § 5.3 (2003). This fairly and\nadequately covered the issue. See United States v. Echeverry,\n759 F.2d 1451, 1455 (9th Cir. 1985) (“So long as the instruc-\ntions fairly and adequately cover the issues presented, the\njudge’s formulation of those instructions or choice of lan-\nguage is a matter of discretion.”).\n\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART;\nREMANDED.\n\f3688               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nTROTT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   During the 20th Century, the four walls of a family’s home\nprovided substantial protection from marauding sexual preda-\ntors on the prowl for children and unsuspecting minors to\nassault. Locked doors and windows could normally safeguard\na dwelling from invasion, as well as shelter parents’ vulnera-\nble children from harm. Distant parks, playgrounds, malls,\nand sidewalks surrounding school yards were the child\nmolester’s preferred hunting grounds. No longer. Now, the\nInternet is upon us, and it allows cunning sexual vultures\nrepeatedly to enter the bedrooms of immature children where,\nby seductive and calculating means, unwary children are\nenticed to leave the security of their homes and to venture into\nunspeakable dangers. Moreover, the invaders themselves do\nso invisibly, appearing only on a video screen, unseen by the\nunsuspecting adults on site. This case provides an example of\nthis frightful situation which generations not yet familiar with\nthe dark side of the Internet have been slow to recognize.\n\n   With the walls of our homes breached by the Internet, our\nnext best defense is the law. Unfortunately, this case reveals\nthat the laws and the rules of evidence upon which society\nrelies to protect itself from cruel deviancy are now as porous\nas the walls of our homes, allowing lawbreakers to pull the\nwool over the eyes of the jurors delegated to ensure that our\nlaws are faithfully implemented. It seems that the law of rele-\nvancy is now more concerned with protecting a sexual preda-\ntor’s obscene manuals on what to do to children than with\nprotecting the real children upon whom they practice their\nperversions, as this case illustrates.\n\n   Curtin’s explanation to the jury for his Internet behavior\nwith “christy13” and trip to Las Vegas was that he intended\nto act out an incestuous sexual fantasy with her, but that he\nexpected her to be an adult who would pretend to be his inno-\ncent unspoiled daughter. Although he called his sexual fan-\ntasy “daddy daughter,” he denied that the “daughter” would\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                3689\nbe a minor. If worthy of belief, this intent would defeat the\nprosecution’s case, which required proof of an intent to\nengage a minor in unlawful sexual activity. However, Curtin\nhad on his person at the time of his anticipated encounter with\n“christy13” obscene literature tending without ambiguity to\nprove that the object of his incest fantasy was a child, not an\nadult. My respected colleagues conclude that the district court\nerred in admitting this inculpatory literature because — as a\nmatter of law — it was not relevant. I disagree. Therefore, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n   The evidence developed against Kevin Curtin by the Las\nVegas Metropolitan Police Department suggests on its face\nthat he is a dangerous predatory pedophile who uses the Inter-\nnet electronically to enter the homes of his immature juvenile\nfemale victims in order to lure them into danger. Curtin’s\nM.O., or modus operandi, involving calculated “grooming”\nand enticement is well known to the police who work this\ndetail. Here, Curtin contacted his prey through a chat room\ncalled “ltgirlsexchat,” which, according to the evidence, is a\nplace on the Internet where people go to talk sex with little\ngirls. The evidence reveals also that he planned a family cover\nstory for his time with his victim. He, as Uncle Kevin, would\nintroduce her as his “niece.” In addition, he asked her if she\nwas working with the police in order “to get guys who make\nout with 14-year-old girls.” These aspects of the govern-\nment’s evidence would seem to portray the subjective intent\nrequired by the charges filed against him and a keen aware-\nness of the unlawful nature of what he was doing.\n\n  But wait, he protests, what you see and what you read on\nmy exchanges with “christy13” is not what you get. I’m not\nan online predator trolling for naive juveniles, my true intent\n— hard to discern though it may be — is to sexually hook-up\nwith mature females who are hanging out in juvenile chat\nrooms posing as minors. I’m merely a “lonely divorcee [sic]\n\f3690                 UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nlooking for an older woman who may have a place to go,”\nbecause I do not have a place of my own. It’s just a game of\nrole playing. “[N]ormally in this sort of thing it would be a\nfantasy. Sort of like daddy/daughter or along those lines.” My\nreal intent was to hook up with a thirty to forty year-old role\nplaying woman pretending to be 14-year-old who was inter-\nested in actualizing such an incestuous sexual fantasy, cer-\ntainly not a minor. But of course, this is “my first time.” “I\nhaven’t ever kissed anyone but my wife since — in fifteen\nyears.” And, by the way, “no one ever sends a picture of what\nthey actually look like.” Moreover, everything I wrote to\n“christy13” that makes it appear that I understood her to be\na minor? It was just a lie.\n\n  How did I know — unsophisticated though I certainly am\n— that “christy13” was an older woman even though she said\nshe was only fourteen? As I explained to the police:\n\n      Q.1 Now as far as this person, they told you that\n          they were fourteen.\n\n      A.   Right.\n\n      Q.   Did they tell you anything else, who they lived\n           with or anything like that?\n\n      A.   Uhm, I . . . I’m not hesitating to give you infor-\n           mation. It is not unusual to go on and do\n           exchanges with many, many, many people.\n           Uhm, and it . . . it is unusual to the point where\n           this is the first attempt that I’ve had to actually\n           meet anyone. But because of that, it’s difficult\n           for me to say which person and done which\n           thing and at which time. So I don’t . . . I’m . . .\n  1\n   This conversation was between Curtin, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police\nDepartment Detective Castaneda, and FBI special agent Flaherty. Here,\nCurtin is responding to questions asked by Detective Castaneda.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3691\n     I’m not intending to be vague. I just, uh, I can’t\n     remember who said what.\n\nQ.   So you don’t remember if Kristy [sic] told you\n     that she lived with her mother and father or any-\n     thing like that?\n\nA.   I believe she said that but, uhm, again, that\n     would be . . . if that were the case (laughing).\n     I know I’m sounding like all these if, and’s and\n     . . . but if that were the case, it would be part\n     of the fantasy, uh, on it. It wouldn’t be, uhm . . .\n     I would not expect . . . uh, let me rephrase that.\n     I would expect anyone who’s participating in\n     this sort of thing to have their own place where\n     one would go back and . . . and do the role play-\n     ing . . . .\n\n                          ...\n\nQ.   And what were kinda some of the things that\n     she says that, uh, she has or has not done?\n\nA.   Uhm, she had said that she didn’t have any\n     experience whatsoever with guys. Uhm, which\n     again is a fairly common thing. And adds to my\n     credence to my whole idea of . . . of a, uhm,\n     fantasy because, you know, I . . . I’m not com-\n     pletely, uh, conversant with what’s going on\n     with kids today, but I don’t know of 14-year-old\n     girls who haven’t at least kissed someone or,\n     you know, fooled around somewhat or ___,\n\n                             ...\n\n     Uhm, the . . . the, uh, the picture that was sent\n     was this attractive 14-year-old girl who, uh . . .\n     uh, had never done anything with anyone, but\n\f3692                 UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n          was willing to suddenly, uh, jump into bed . . .\n          bed with a . . . a strange 42-year-old person\n          from Riverside is beyond anything that I would\n          imagine could be. You know, I . . . uh, I could\n          see, uh, I could see an Internet connection along\n          those lines if it went on for months and months\n          and months and months and you grew a . . . an\n          attachment and that sort of a thing. What brings\n          it beyond any level of credence to me that it’s\n          actually possibly a 14-year-old girl is that\n          you’ve got this innocent 14-year-old girl who’s\n          going to, you know, jump into bed with some\n          guy, uh, after talking to him for two days.\n          That’s what led me to believe that there’s no\n          way on earth that it was . . .\n\n     Q.2 But, I mean, coming here, you had no idea, no\n         way of knowin’ that it wasn’t a 14-year-old girl\n         named Kristy [sic]. Am I right? Other than what\n         you . . . you think it may be a fantasy, but as far\n         as what y’all talked about, am I right in sayin’\n         that you had no way of knowin’?\n\n     A.   You are right in saying that there is no concrete\n          way that I could have known, uhm, that it\n          wasn’t a 14-year-old girl. However . . . (Both\n          talking at once)\n\n     Q.   ___. Oh, no, go ahead. Keep goin’.\n\n     A.   Uhm, I deal with people all of the time and my\n          experience has never been that someone who is,\n          uh, an attractive person who’s . . . who saved\n          themself, not even kissed and not done any-\n          thing, and, uh, uh . . .\n 2\n  At this point Special Agent Flaherty questioned Curtin.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3693\nNot bad for a first-timer who had not kissed anyone but his\nwife in fifteen years.\n\n   Curtin’s cover story and protestations of “no criminal\nintent” notwithstanding, federal prosecutors charged him with\none count of interstate travel with intent to engage in a sexual\nact with a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), and one\ncount of the use of an interstate facility to persuade a minor\nto engage in unlawful sexual conduct, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 2422(b). Both charges required the government to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtin acted with the\nintent to engage a person under the age of eighteen years in\nunlawful sexual behavior. To quote the court in its concluding\ninstructions to the jury:\n\n       In order for the defendant to be found guilty of\n    [§ 2423(b)], the Government must prove each of the\n    following elements, beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n       First, the defendant used a facility or means of\n    interstate commerce.\n\n                              ...\n\n      Second, the defendant knowingly intended to per-\n    suade, induce, entice, or coerce Christy into engag-\n    ing in sexual activity for which he could be\n    prosecuted under the laws of the state of Nevada.\n\n       Third, the defendant believed Christy had not\n    attained the age of 16 years. . . .\n\n       Under the laws of the state of Nevada, it is an\n    offense to commit statutory sexual seduction.\n    Nevada law defines statutory sexual seduction as\n    ordinary sexual intercourse, anal intercourse, cunni-\n    lingus, or fellatio committed by a person 18 years of\n\f3694               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    age or older with a person under the age of 16 years.\n\n\n                             ...\n\n       [D]efendant’s subsequent conduct may be consid-\n    ered by you or the question of the defendant’s intent\n    at the time he communicated on the Internet or trav-\n    eled in interstate commerce.\n\n      [T]he fact that Christy was an undercover agent\n    posing as a 14-year-old girl and that no actual minor\n    child was victimized in this case is not a defense\n    ....\n\n                              II\n\n   Prior to the trial, it became clear that the only disputed\nissue in this case would be Curtin’s subjective intent: did he\nintend to hook up with a 30 to 40 year-old woman who liked\nto pretend she was a child having incestuous sex with her\ndaddy, or with a pubescent minor? Curtin went so far as to\nfile a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the\n“undisputed and uncontested facts” made it patently obvious\nthat the government had “no credible evidence to suggest that\n[Curtin’s] subjective intentions were to travel to Las Vegas to\nhave sex with a minor”:\n\n       Curtin did not possess an intent to have sex with\n    a 14 year old girl when he got into his car and drove\n    to Las Vegas; the overwhelming evidence points the\n    other way. His voluntary statement, given minutes\n    after he was stopped by the police, shows this. He\n    thought it was all too easy, that no 14 year old was\n    going to just hop into bed with a 42 year old after\n    two chat sessions, especially a pretty girl. As he said\n    in his statement, her Mary Poppins naivety was\n    beyond any level of credence. It was so easy and\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3695\n    uncredible that he even wondered if it could have\n    been police. In any event, he was not concerned,\n    because when he left California to go to Las Vegas,\n    he was going to find work, and at the time he left\n    California to travel to Nevada, he had no intentions\n    of having relations with a minor, as irrebuttably\n    shown by the fact that he did not so much as talk to\n    the person. This meeting was the litmus test of his\n    true intentions in this nebulous and hazy situation.\n    He clearly and without question passed this test.\n    When he calmly and simply walked away, the police\n    wanted to know why. He told them. He clearly and\n    unequivocally explained that he did not talk to this\n    person because he stopped by the Suncoast with the\n    hope and intentions of meeting an older woman.\n    HAD HE BEEN THERE TO MEET A MINOR, AS\n    IS THE CRUX OF THIS INDICTMENT, THEN HE\n    WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AT\n    THAT POINT.\n\n    . . . Curtin’s intentions were to try to meet a 30-40\n    year old woman who had been fantasizing. It is not\n    even close. . . .\n\n       As the defendant’s intent was not to have sex with\n    a minor, nor to entice a minor, nor to travel interstate\n    to have sex with a minor, . . . this case must be dis-\n    missed. In the instant case, the defendant did not\n    think he was dealing with a minor. The police knew\n    there [was] not a minor and in fact there was not a\n    minor.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n   Thus, the line was drawn by Curtin. His defense was a mat-\nter of record. The trial would be about intent and what was in\nCurtin’s mind during his undisputed conduct with “chris-\nty13.” This was the issue, the only issue: subjective inten-\n\f3696               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\ntions. As counsel for Curtin said in his opening statement,\n“[Curtin] thought it was someone his age that he was dealing\nwith and that they would role play in a situation much like a\ndad and a daughter.” Counsel concluded on this what-was-in-\nCurtin’s-mind theme by telling the jury that “this is the type\nof crime that is a situation where you have to look at the\nthoughts.” To prevail, of course, Curtin would not be called\nupon to satisfy the jury that his defense was true. All he had\nto do is raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a single juror.\n\n                              III\n\n   Confronted with Curtin’s aggressive fantasy intent defense\n— to sexually play daddy/daughter incest, not with a minor\nbut with an adult — and facing the traditional daunting bur-\nden of proof, the government offered stories contained on\nCurtin’s PDA, or “personal digital assistant.” These stories\nwere offered pursuant to Fed. R.

From the begin-\nning, the government was put on notice by the court that in\norder for the stories to be properly admitted, each story would\nhave to comport to the admissibility conditions of Fed.

It\nconsisted of approximately 140 stories containing graphic\ndescriptions of sexual acts with minors. Not a single story on\nCurtin’s PDA was about daddy/daughter role playing with\nadults. The stories admitted in evidence are built around dad-\ndies having sexual relations with child daughters, not adults,\nand the content of the stories parallel Curtin’s email\nexchanges with his target.

Smiley face.\n\n   Under the circumstances of this case, and especially given\nthe nature of the defense, were the stories in Curtin’s PDA of\nsexual contact with minors relevant? Certainly. The stories\nconsisted by anyone’s logic of “evidence having any tendency\nto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable\nthan it would be without the evidence.” Fed. R. Evid. 401. As\nacknowledged by the Supreme Court:\n\n    Extrinsic acts evidence may be critical to the estab-\n    lishment of the truth as to a disputed issue, especially\n    when that issue involves the actor’s state of mind\n    and the only means of ascertaining that mental state\n    is by drawing inferences from conduct.\n\nHuddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 685 (1988).\n\n   Curtin’s possession in his PDA of these stories on his per-\nson at the time of his intended encounter with “christy13”\nclearly illuminates his thoughts and his subjective intent to\ncarry out his daddy/daughter sexual initiation escapades with\na juvenile, not an adult. Any lingering question of relevancy\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                        3707\nwas put to rest by Curtin’s defense that it was all a fantasy\ndirected at an adult.4 The similarities between the solicitous\n“grooming” email conversations and the content of the stories\nis readily apparent.5\n\n   However, the district court did not admit all 140 stories,\nonly five, taking great care in the exercise of its discretion to\nrestrict their use to the main issue and to eliminate possible\nundue prejudice.\n\n                                    IV\n\n   With all respect to my colleagues, Guam v. Shymanovitz,\n157 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 1998), does not dictate the outcome\nof this case, and its holding does not as a matter of law render\nabusive the district court’s exercise of discretion. In the par-\nlance of the profession, Shymanovitz is distinguishable.\n\n   First, unlike the specific intent crimes with which Curtin\nwas charged, the combination of crimes in Shymanovitz —\ngenerally unlawful sexual activity with minors — required an\nentirely different type of mens rea from the specific intent\nrequired here. One of the crimes charged in Shymanovitz,\n“sexual penetration,” did “not include any requirement that\nthe defendant act with intent,” id. at 1157, just that the defen-\ndant have engaged in sexual penetration with the victim. The\n  4\n     The government may offer in its case in chief evidence rebutting an\nexpected defense. United States v. Halbert, 640 F.2d 1000, 1004 (9th Cir.\n1981); United States v. Necoechea, 986 F.2d 1273, 1280 n.4 (9th Cir.\n1993); United States v. Henderson, 717 F.2d 135, 137 (4th Cir. 1983).\n   5\n     The record shows that the trial judge required the government to go\nthrough each story it sought to admit and identify that portion of the story\nthat was similar to the Curtin’s enticement of “christy13.” See infra Part\nV. The majority opinion does not take issue with this analysis. Rather, the\nmajority asserts that as a matter of law, reading material is categorically\nirrelevant and dissimilar for the purposes of Fed. R. Evid. 401 and 404(b).\nAs set forth below, this unwarranted assertion is legally flawed, and con-\ntrary to congressional intent.\n\f3708               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nother crime, sexual contact with a minor, required touching\nthat was intentional rather than accidental. Moreover, the\nactual purpose of the person doing the touching was immate-\nrial. As Judge Reinhardt explained,\n\n    [T]he charges based on sexual contact require the\n    government to prove that any touching on Shy-\n    manovitz’ part was intentional, and that a reasonable\n    person could construe the touching to be for a sexual\n    purpose.\n\n       Whether Shymanovitz’s actual purpose in touch-\n    ing the alleged victims was sexual arousal or gratifi-\n    cation, however, or whether he was actually aroused\n    or gratified by the touching is immaterial to the\n    offenses, including the charges based on improper\n    sexual contact. Instead, the question in the latter cat-\n    egory of cases is whether a reasonable person could\n    construe the touching to be for such a purpose. The\n    test, under the sexual contact statute, is an objective\n    not a subjective one. In short, it is the character of\n    the touching that is at issue, not the purpose of the\n    intentional toucher. Accordingly, the government’s\n    current and sole justification for admitting the chal-\n    lenged evidence goes, once again, to the proof of an\n    element immaterial to the offense.\n\nId. at 1158 (emphasis added).\n\n   Second, the defense in Shymanovitz was not that the alleged\ntouching and penetration were not accompanied by any requi-\nsite state of mind, but that the acts charged as crimes never\nhappened. “His counsel argued that the boys and some of the\nparents had concocted the allegations against him . . . .” Id.\nat 1154. Moreover, Shymanovitz\n\n    . . . never testified at trial that he believed sexual\n    conduct with minors to be legal. Nor was there testi-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                        3709\n      mony to indicate that he somehow lacked knowledge\n      of or familiarity with fellatio, anal intercourse, or\n      other general aspects of homosexual sex. Moreover,\n      neither knowledge of the illegality of the conduct of\n      which he was accused nor knowledge of the nature\n      of the specific acts identified by the prosecutor con-\n      stituted an element of the offense. More important,\n      such knowledge would in no way tend to prove his\n      guilt on any of the charges brought against him.\n      Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that the govern-\n      ment introduced the magazines to address the issues\n      it argued they were relevant to during the prosecu-\n      tor’s closing arguments.\n\nId. at 1156.\n\n  In contrast, Curtin did testify at the trial, tendering an ener-\ngetic defense that his intent was to couple with an adult\nfemale, not a juvenile. Shymanovitz’s defense had nothing to\ndo with intent or state of mind.\n\n  Third, the stories were in Curtin’s possession when he\nentered the casino in order to meet his target. Not so in Shy-\nmanovitz.\n\n   Thus, given that the evidence under scrutiny in Shy-\nmanovitz was (1) not probative of any issue in the case, and\n(2) not relevant to Shymanovitz’s factual defense, it was\nappropriate for the panel to conclude as a matter of law that\nit was not properly received pursuant to Rule 401 or 404(b).\nThe evidence simply failed Rule 401’s definition of relevancy\nand, therefore, also failed Rule 404(b). The evidence did not\nilluminate “a fact of consequence to the determination of the\naction,” and was nothing more than an attempt to slime the\ndefendant. Id. at 1154 (referring to the prosecutor’s “untem-\npered and provocative references” to the evidence).6\n  6\n   The majority places great significance on our statement in Shymanovitz\nthat “there is simply no doubt that a wide gulf separates the act of possess-\n\f3710                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   We recognized the limited reach of Shymanovitz in United\nStates v. Allen, 341 F.3d 870 (9th Cir. 2003). The defendants\nin Allen were charged with intimidating or interfering with a\nperson’s housing rights on account of race or color, in viola-\ntion of 42 U.S.C. § 3631. In order to satisfy the statute’s\nrequirement of a showing of racial animus, the government\noffered, and we admitted:\n\n     . . . skinhead and white supremacist evidence,\n     including color photographs of their tattoos (e.g.,\n     swastikas and other symbols of white supremacy),\n     Nazi-related literature, group photographs including\n     some of the defendants (e.g., in “Heil Hitler” poses\n     and standing before a large swastika that they later\n     set on fire), and skinhead paraphernalia (e.g. combat\n     boots, arm-bands with swastikas, and a registration\n     form for the Aryan Nations World Congress).\n\nId. at 885-886. The district court ruled (1) that this potentially\ninflammatory evidence was relevant to proving the defen-\ndants’ motive, intent and plan, and (2) that its prejudicial\npotential did not substantially outweigh its probative value as\ndemanded by Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n   On appeal, the Allen defendants challenged the trial court’s\nruling on the ground that the evidence was unfairly prejudi-\ncial. We disagreed, relying in large measure on our decision\nin United States v. Skillman, 922 F.2d 1370 (9th Cir. 1991),\n\ning written descriptions or stories about criminal conduct from the act of\ncommitting the offenses described.” (Emphasis added.) From that state-\nment the majority asserts that reading material can never be relevant to\nany crime. This over-generalization best illustrates the majorities failure\nto appreciate the fact that the “offense described” in Shymanovitz was not\na specific intent crime. Thus, because specific intent was not an issue,\nreading material admitted to show intent would never be relevant. Here,\nas illustrated by subsequent case law, where specific intent is at issue,\nreading material can be relevant.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3711\na race-motivated cross burning case wherein “skinhead” liter-\nature and materials found in Skillman’s garage and on his per-\nson at the time of his arrest was used to prove Skillman’s state\nof mind at the time of the crime, even though the government\ncould not establish that Skillman was a skinhead. In Skillman\nwe said,\n\n    Skillman principally relies on United States v. Gil-\n    lespie, 852 F.2d 475, 479 (9th Cir. 1988), where we\n    found it was an abuse of discretion to admit evidence\n    of homosexual conduct of the appellant with his\n    adoptive father in a case where the appellant was\n    charged with transporting his three-year-old god-\n    daughter for illegal sexual purposes. Gillespie is\n    inapposite since the alleged homosexual conduct did\n    not tend to establish a violation of the statutes in\n    issue. Here, the skinhead evidence tended to estab-\n    lish Skillman’s racial animus and that he might act\n    on his beliefs. Skillman also contends that the skin-\n    head references were cumulative to other animus\n    evidence, including Exhibit 3, the business card with\n    the racist poem found in his wallet as well as\n    Milum’s and Becky’s testimony on Skillman’s prior\n    race statements. We conclude this evidence was not\n    “needless[ly]” cumulative in light of the difficulty in\n    establishing the requisite racial animus and Skill-\n    man’s theory-of-defense that he was a mere passive\n    bystander at the crime. The district court’s evalua-\n    tion under Rule 403 and the admission of the evi-\n    dence was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n922 F.2d at 1374 (emphasis added).\n\n   Accordingly, because we perceived in Allen the difference\nbetween cases involving specific intent and those that do not,\nwe had no difficulty explaining why Shymanovitz, like Gilles-\npie, was inapposite:\n\f3712               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    The defendants cite to our decision in Guam v. Shy-\n    manovitz, 157 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 1998), to support\n    their argument that the admission of the skinhead\n    and white supremacy evidence was unduly prejudi-\n    cial. In Shymanovitz, we concluded that the district\n    court abused its discretion by allowing the govern-\n    ment to introduce testimony about the contents of\n    magazines found at the defendant’s apartment,\n    including photographs of men masturbating, ejacu-\n    lating, using sex toys, and engaging in oral and anal\n    sex (among other things), to prove the defendant’s\n    intent in committing sexual acts with minors. 157\n    F.3d at 1155. Key to our reasoning was the fact that\n    the testimony was highly prejudicial and was not rel-\n    evant to proving any of the elements of the crime for\n    which the defendant was convicted (unlawful sexual\n    activity with minors). Id. at 1157-60. In contrast, the\n    skinhead and white supremacy evidence here was\n    relevant to proving the element of intent in both\n    §§ 241 and 245(b)(2)(B). Moreover, in light of the\n    government’s heavy burden of proving racial ani-\n    mus, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discre-\n    tion to admit the evidence.\n\nAllen, 341 F.3d at 887, n.25 (emphasis added).\n\n   My colleagues attempt — unconvincingly I believe — to\ndistinguish Allen on the basis of insignificant differences\nbetween the evidence in Allen and the evidence here. They\npoint out (1) that “the evidence in Allen involved more than\nthe possession of reading material,” including photographs\nshowing some of the defendants as active participants in “Heil\nHitler” poses, (2) that the Nazi literature in Allen may not\nhave been “fictional,” and (3) that “the evidence in this case,\nand in Shymanovitz was extremely prejudicial,” apparently as\nopposed to the evidence in Allen.\n\f                      UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3713\n   These minor differences are utterly insufficient to render\nAllen inapposite. First, that Allen involved evidence in addi-\ntion to reading material is inconsequential, as each “offer of\nevidence is to be evaluated independently under the Federal\nRules of Evidence and the relevant case law.” United States\nv. Bertoli, 854 F.Supp. 975, 1079 (D.N.J. 1994) vacated in\npart on unrelated grounds, 40 F.3d 1384 (3d Cir. 1994). Sec-\nond, I fail to see any material difference between real stories\nof sexual perversion and fictional stories of the same ilk. Both\nserve to excite sexual criminals and to fuel their perverted\nintentions. Moreover, whether a story’s plot is fictional is not\nmaterial to the question of whether the content of that story\nrelates to and is similar to the conduct of the alleged criminal\n— thereby satisfying the requirements of Rules 401 and\n404(b). Third, the majority’s assertion that “the evidence at\nissue in this case and in Shymanovitz [as opposed to Allen]\nwas extremely prejudicial,” and thus distinguishable, fails to\nappreciate how the rules of evidence operate. Prejudice is a\nseparate basis for exclusion that requires an independent anal-\nysis under Fed. R. Evid. 403 after it is determined that an\noffer of evidence is relevant and admissible. See Weisgram v.\nMarley, 528 U.S. 440, 453 n.9 (2000). As admitted by my\ncolleges, the prejudice argument was waived by Curtin and is\nnot an issue before us.7\n\n   Ultimately, the majority’s reasons for distinguishing Allen\nare inadequate, especially when viewed in the light of the “lit-\nerary” evidence approved in Skillman on which Allen relied.\nThe evidence in Skillman included a “poem containing racial\nepithets” on the back of a business card in Skillman’s pocket.\nWe did not segregate out of our holding in Allen, the Nazi lit-\nerature in his possession. Although literature per se has no\nspecial protection in this context as evidence — under the\n  7\n   The majority’s implication that possession of Nazi and white suprem-\nacy skinhead literature is not “extremely prejudicial” is hard to compre-\nhend as the movement is directly associated with one of the most well-\nknown tragedies of humankind.\n\f3714                 UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nFirst Amendment or otherwise — my colleagues have effec-\ntively made relevant literature categorically off-limits as a\nsource of evidence as to a person’s subjective intent.\n\n   One way to test the relevancy of Curtin’s recent PDA\ndownloads (and to illustrate the difference between the setting\nhere and the circumstances in Shymanovitz) is to envision\nwhat we would certainly hold if Curtin’s PDA stories8 were\nof role playing daddy/daughter incest with female adults —\nnot minors — and the district court had excluded the stories\nas “irrelevant.” Curtin would have attempted to admit the sto-\nries into evidence to demonstrate that he intended to meet an\nadult. Without a doubt, a convicted Curtin would assert on\nappeal that the content of the stories shed light on his subjec-\ntive intent and — as counsel put it to the jurors — his\n“thoughts” as he communicated with “christy13,” and as he\ntraveled interstate with the stories in his pocket to meet her;\nand there is no doubt that we would agree. Why? Because the\nstories would have a “tendency to make the existence of any\nfact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence.” Fed. R. Evid. 401. Such stories would corroborate\nhis claim of adult incest fantasy. How else could he do that\nwithout evidence of “other acts,” as they are called? Con-\nversely, the absence of such adult stories coupled with the\npresence of stories wherein children are the objects of the sex-\nual appetites of adults is equally relevant to prove the govern-\nment’s case and to confront Curtin’s defense. Relevancy boils\ndown to what our human experiences tell us, sometimes cal-\nled common sense.\n\n  As explained in “McCormick on Evidence,” Third Edition,\nHornbook Series, Lawyers Edition,\n  8\n   Or, maybe the testimony of a woman with whom he had played daddy/\ndaughter.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3715\n    [H]ow can a judge know whether the evidence could\n    reasonably affect an assessment of the probability of\n    the fact to be inferred? In some instances, scientific\n    research may show that the fact in issue is more\n    likely to be true (or false) when such evidence is\n    present than when it is not. Ordinarily, however, the\n    answer must lie in the judge’s own experience, [the\n    judge’s] general knowledge, and [the judge’s]\n    understanding of human conduct and motivation.\n\nId., § 184 (emphasis added).\n\n   In Internet “sting” cases such as this involving claims of\nentrapment, the issue of what a defendant’s state of mind was\nimmediately prior to his contact with a sexual target purport-\ning to be a minor is routinely a serious point of contention.\nWe call the issue one of “predisposition,” and it is primarily\na question of fact. In United States v. Poehlman, 217 F.3d 692\n(9th Cir. 2000), for example, Poehlman, a cross-dresser, was\ncharged with willingly crossing state lines to have sex with\nminors, but it appeared that when first contacted by the gov-\nernment, he was looking for adults with whom to engage in\nhis “proclivities,” not children. However, the undercover offi-\ncer with whom he was corresponding deftly turned Poehl-\nman’s prurient interest to children, and he responded\naccordingly. In court, charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C.\nSection 2423(b), Poehlman relied on his initial interest in\nadults to demonstrate a lack of predisposition to involve\nminors in his sexual plans, arguing that the government took\nadvantage of that lawful interest and unlawfully used it to\nsteer him to children. In concluding that he had indeed been\nentrapped, we said, “The government thus played on Poehl-\nman’s obvious need for an adult relationship, for acceptance\nof his sexual proclivities and for a family, to draw him even\ndeeper into a sexual fantasy world involving these imaginary\ngirls.” Id. at 702.\n\n   To what evidence did we look to verify a factually fatal\nlack of predisposition on Poehlman’s part to target minors?\n\f3716               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nThe same kind of material we now place “off limits” as a mat-\nter of law:\n\n    By analogy, the fact that Poehlman willingly crossed\n    state lines to have sex with minors after his pro-\n    longed and steamy correspondence with Sharon can-\n    not, alone, support a finding of predisposition. It is\n    possible, after all, that it was the government’s\n    inducement that brought Poehlman to the point\n    where he became willing to break the law. As in\n    Jacobson, we must consider what evidence there is\n    as to Poehlman’s state of mind prior to his contact\n    with Sharon.\n\n    On this score, the record is sparse indeed; it is easier\n    to say what the record does not confirm than what\n    it does. The government produced no e-mails or chat\n    room postings where Poehlman expressed an interest\n    in sex with children, or even the view that sex with\n    children should be legalized. Nor did the government\n    produce any notes, tapes, magazines, photographs,\n    letters or similar items which disclosed an interest in\n    sex with children, despite a thorough search of Poe-\n    hlman’s home. There was no testimony from the\n    playmates of Poehlman’s children, his ex-wife or\n    anyone else indicating that Poehlman had behaved\n    inappropriately toward children or otherwise mani-\n    fested a sexual interest in them.\n\nUnited States v. Poehlman, 217 F.3d at 703-704 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n  Thus, the absence in context, and by implication the pres-\nence of child-oriented materials becomes acutely relevant to\na defendant’s material state of mind “prior to his contact”\nwith the object of his sexual attention, and, as Poehlman\nreveals, such evidence is not only admissible, but critical. The\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3717\nnow-confused dissonance in the law of our circuit on this\nissue is regrettable, to say the least.\n\n   The circumstances here are analogous to those confronted\nby the Tenth Circuit in two cases, United States v. Viefhaus,\n168 F.3d 392 (10th Cir. 1999) (per curiam); and United States\nv. Magleby, 241 F.3d 1306 (10th Cir. 2001). Viefhaus had\nbeen charged with the use of a telephone to transmit a bomb\nthreat. To illustrate (as required by the Supreme Court in\nWatts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705 (1969)) that the threat\nmade by Viefhaus was a “true threat” and not just “political\nhyperbole,” the court admitted “literature espousing hate and\nviolence” and “Nazi propaganda” found in his home. Id. at\n394-395. In turning away Viefhaus’s challenge to this evi-\ndence, the court said, citing United States v. Cox, 957 F.2d\n267 (6th Cir. 1992),\n\n       When the defendant offers lack of intent as a\n    defense, even though the government does not have\n    to prove subjective intent as an element of the\n    offense, the circumstances surrounding the making\n    of the calls becomes relevant. The evidence offered\n    clearly was probative of defendant’s state of mind\n    and tends to counter his allegation of benign pur-\n    pose.\n\n                            ...\n\n       The only way a jury could properly assess the sin-\n    cerity of Viefhaus’ beliefs, as well as the likely\n    effect Viefhaus’ message would have on an objec-\n    tive listener, was to examine the circumstances in\n    which the comments were made. Although admis-\n    sion of this evidence was harmful to Viefhaus, its\n    probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect.\n\nViefhaus, 168 F.3d at 397 (sustaining conviction under 18\nU.S.C. § 875(c)) (internal citations omitted).\n\f3718               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   In Magleby the defendant was charged with burning a cross\non the property of an interracial family. Recognizing that\n“[d]irect evidence of the defendant’s intent is seldom avail-\nable,” and that “[i]ntent can be proven from surrounding cir-\ncumstances,” 241 F.3d at 1321, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the\nadmission in evidence of vile racist song lyrics frequently\nsung on occasion by the defendant, which referred repeatedly\nto African-Americans as “niggers.” The court said,\n\n       We now turn to Mr. Magleby’s argument that the\n    lyrics are irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n    Although the admission of the lyrics to the Screw-\n    driver song was certainly harmful to Mr. Magleby’s\n    case, we conclude that its probative value out-\n    weighed its prejudicial effect. This evidence is pro-\n    bative both of Mr. Magleby’s racial animus under 42\n    U.S.C. § 3631(a) and of his intent under 18 U.S.C.\n    § 241.\n\n       In United States v. Viefhaus, 168 F.3d 392 (10th\n    Cir. 1999), we held that the context in which an\n    alleged threat is made is probative of whether a “true\n    threat” exists. Id. at 398. In Viefhaus, the defendant\n    was convicted of making threats against, interalia,\n    African-Americans, Jews, and federal law enforce-\n    ment on an answering machine “hotline.” The defen-\n    dant asserted as a defense that he lacked the intent\n    requisite to make a true threat. We upheld the\n    admission of racially inflammatory items as relevant\n    to the defendant’s intent.\n\n                             ...\n\n       As did the defendant in Viefhaus, Mr. Magleby\n    denies having the requisite intent under 42 U.S.C.\n    § 3631(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 241. The lyrics to the\n    Screwdriver song, as well as the evidence that Mr.\n    Magleby knew the lyrics and could sing along with\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3719\n    them, are probative of his intent under these sections.\n    First, § 3631(a) requires that the government prove\n    beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Magleby tar-\n    geted the Henrys because of their race. The lyrics\n    and Mr. Magleby’s familiarity with them are proba-\n    tive of his racial animus in burning the cross. Sec-\n    ond, under § 241, the government must prove\n    beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Magleby had the\n    specific intent to “oppress, threaten or intimidate”\n    the Henrys in the enjoyment of their federally pro-\n    tected right to occupy property. Context is important\n    in determining whether a true threat has been made.\n\n                             ...\n\n       The necessity of demonstrating the context in\n    which the cross was burned renders the Screwdriver\n    lyrics and other evidence of hostility toward the\n    presence of African-Americans in this country intrin-\n    sic to a violation of § 241. And, as in Viefhaus, the\n    only way the jury could properly determine the mes-\n    sage conveyed by Mr. Magleby’s cross-burning and\n    the foreseeable effect it would have on the Henrys\n    was to examine the circumstances in which the\n    cross-burning was conceived, planned, and executed.\n    We fine that the district court did not abuse its dis-\n    cretion in admitting the song lyrics into evidence.\n\nId. at 1319 (emphasis added). I note that part of the evidence\nused to show Magleby’s subjective intent was the circum-\nstance that he had watched a movie, “Mississippi Burning,”\nprior to the cross-burning. Id. at 1313.\n\n   Indeed, in similar contexts we have routinely held that cir-\ncumstances surrounding an alleged crime become more rele-\nvant when the defendant makes his intent a disputed issue.\nTake the case of Larry McCollum. McCollum claimed that\nalthough he entered a bank and gave an employee a note\n\f3720               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\ndemanding $100,000 he had “no criminal intent” to commit\nrobbery because he was acting involuntarily under the influ-\nence of hypnosis. The district court admitted a prior convic-\ntion for armed robbery to counter his defense of a lack of\nintent. We affirmed, holding as follows:\n\n    In this case, . . . the defense conceded that McCol-\n    lum performed all acts charged by the prosecution.\n    The key issue, indeed the only disputed issue, was\n    whether McCollum acted with intent to rob the bank.\n    Where the mental state to be inferred from undis-\n    puted overt acts of a defendant is the crucial issue,\n    evidence of past criminal acts has generally been\n    found insufficiently prejudicial to warrant exclusion.\n\nUnited States v. McCollum, 732 F.2d 1419, 1425 (9th Cir.\n1984) (emphasis added); United States v. Verduzco, 373 F.3d\n1022 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting McCollum and affirming the\nuse of evidence of other similar criminal acts to counter an\naffirmative defense of duress).\n\n   With the utmost respect to my colleagues, they seem\nmoved to brush McCollum aside by their assumption that the\nincest materials on Curtin’s PDA were “otherwise lawful\nreading material.” This premise is doubtful at best. Obscenity,\nwhich is described as a work which appeals to the prurient\ninterest and which describes sexual conduct in a patently\noffensive way, and which when judged by contemporary\ncommunity standards lacks serious literacy, artistic, political,\nor scientific value, is not protected by the First Amendment.\nMiller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 (1973). I will leave\nit to the reader to decide whether “Love for the World” and\n“Restrictions” are otherwise lawful reading material. How-\never, even if they were to be seen as lawful, this fact in no\nway renders them outside the scope of Rule 404(b). Rule\n404(b) on its face covers “other crimes, wrongs, or acts.” All\nrelevant extrinsic acts are presumptively admissible, subject\nto Rule 403. The act of possession of reading material falls\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3721\nwithin this Rule, whether lawful or not — so long as the act\nof possession is relevant.\n\n  Bottom line? McCollum is apposite.\n\n   The precedents discussing the use of other evidence to\nestablish criminal intent where intent is denied are literally\nendless. In United States v. Brunson, 657 F.2d 110, 115 (7th\nCir. 1981), our sister circuit said,\n\n    The remainder of appellant’s contentions are equally\n    unpersuasive. Appellant complains that the trial\n    judge erred in admitting the Government’s evidence\n    of appellant’s prior allegedly criminal conduct relat-\n    ing to counterfeiting after appellant had admitted\n    that conduct on the stand. The evidence, as stated\n    previously, was offered and admitted in rebuttal to\n    appellant’s main defense that he did not intend to use\n    the counterfeit money to defraud anyone. The admis-\n    sion for such purposes was clearly proper both\n    because intent was a necessary element of the crime\n    and because of appellant’s chosen defense.\n    Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); United States v. Weidman, 572\n    F.2d 1199, 1202 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439\n    U.S. 821, 99 S.Ct. 87, 58 L.Ed.2d 113; United States\n    v. Semak, 536 F.2d 1142, 1145 (6th Cir. 1976);\n    United States v. Onori, 535 F.2d 938, 943 (5th Cir.\n    1976).\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n  As was said in the English case of Regina v. Gill, (1963)\n1 W.L.R. 841, 846 (Crim. App.):\n\n    The accused, either by the cross-examination of the\n    prosecution witnesses or by evidence called on his\n    behalf, or by a combination of the two, must place\n    before the court such material as makes duress a live\n\f3722               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    issue fit and proper to be left to the jury. But, once\n    he has succeeded in doing this, it is then for the\n    Crown to destroy that defence in such a manner as\n    to leave in the jury’s minds no reasonable doubt that\n    the accused cannot be absolved on the grounds of the\n    alleged compulsion.\n\n(quoted in United States v. Hearst, 563 F.2d 1331, 1336 n.2\n(9th Cir. 1977)).\n\fUNITED STATES v. CURTIN            3723\n                          Volume 2 of 2\n\f3724                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n                               V\n\n  My colleagues have concluded that the district court\n“abused” its discretion in admitting this evidence. Far from it.\nIn fact, the district court’s conduct is a model of appropriate\njudicial decision making, as a close reading of the record\nreveals.\n\n   Because my colleagues’ conclusion that the district court\nabused its discretion is inconsistent with the record, I repro-\nduce relevant parts of it in (excruciating) detail. The record\nspeaks for itself better than characterization and adjectives. In\nsummary, what we see is a court taking great care to follow\nthe law and to protect the rights of the defendant. The court:\n\n    (1)   considered Shymanovitz and Allen,\n\n    (2)   accepted our legal guidance in Allen, and deter-\n          mined that Shymanovitz was distinguishable,\n\n    (3)   required that the five stories admitted be factu-\n          ally similar to the facts of the defendants\n          approach to and enticement of “christy13,”\n          consistent with relevant case law interpreting\n          Rule 404(b).\n\n    (4)   blocked the government from introducing\n          approximately 135 stories, because they were\n          redundant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudi-\n          cial,\n\n    (5)   acceded to the defense’s request not to high-\n          light particularly damaging parts of the stories,\n\n    (6)   ruled after careful consideration — and as\n          required by Fed. R. Evid. 403 — that the pro-\n          bative value of these stories was not under-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3725\n          mined by their potentially unduly prejudicial\n          effect, and\n\n    (7)   gave multiple cautionary instructions to the\n          jury as required by Fed. R. Evid. 105 as to what\n          the stories were admissible to prove, including\n          what purposes for which the jury could not\n          consider them.\n\nI elaborate.\n\n   To begin with, the district court was acutely aware of the\nShymanovitz case. Long before the trial, the defense brought\nit to the court’s attention in a “motion in limine to exclude,”\na motion that was not successful. [C.R. 22] The government\nresponded in writing on July 8, 2003:\n\n    Defendant relies on Guam v. Shymanovitz for the\n    contention that “mere possession of fictional reading\n    material that describes a particular type of activity\n    [would] not make it more or less likely that a defen-\n    dant would intentionally engage in the conduct\n    described.” Defense Motion in Limine, p.4, lines 25-\n    27 (June 30, 2004). However, Shymanovitz can be\n    distinguished from the present case based on the\n    Ninth Circuit’s statutory interpretation and the dif-\n    ferences between the relevant statute in Shymanovitz\n    and the statutes the Defendant is accused of violat-\n    ing. [C.R. 34].\n\n   To demonstrate the asserted distinction, the government\nrelied on Allen:\n\n    [T]he Ninth Circuit has expanded further that\n    “[key]” to our reasoning [in Shymanovitz] was the\n    fact that the testimony was not relevant to proving\n    any of the elements of the crime for which the defen-\n    dant was convicted.” United States v. Allen, 341 F.3d\n\f3726               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    870, 887, n.25 (9th Cir. 2003). . . . By the above rea-\n    soning of the Ninth Circuit, this court clearly may\n    admit literature in the possession of the defendant for\n    the purpose of proving an element of the crime. It\n    can only be presumed that the more fundamental the\n    element is to the crime charged, the more the balance\n    weighs in favor of admission because [Fed. R. Evid.]\n    404(b) is a “rule of inclusion.” United States v.\n    Ayers, 924 F.2d 1468, 1472 (9th Cir. 1992). [C.R.\n    34]\n\n   Next, we go to Day Two of the trial. After testimony on\nDay One from the detective who corresponded as “christy13”\nwith the defendant and who questioned him after his arrest,\nthe government called as a witness a computer expert who\nworked for the FBI and who had recovered the disputed sto-\nries from Curtin’s PDA. When the government then attempted\nto offer the entirety of one of these stories in evidence, the\ndistrict court intervened, and the following occurred outside\nthe presence of the jury:\n\n    MS. KOPPE: That [story] came off of the Defen-\n    dant’s PDA?\n\n    WITNESS: Yes, off the — this is another one of the\n    144 stories that were — were in that Documents to\n    Go\n\n                             ...\n\n    MS. KOPPE: What is the title of that story, if you\n    could look on the second page?\n\n    WITNESS: Melanie’s Busy Day (phonetic).\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Your Honor, we would move to admit\n    that story for modus operandi, intent, preparation,\n    and knowledge.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3727\nMR. POTTER [counsel for the defendant]: Your\nHonor, I would object and I would renew the same\nmotion [to exclude the stories] that — we’re talking\nabout —\n\nTHE COURT: I do have a problem. I’m about ready\nto grant the objection, Counsel. If you’d come over\nto the sidebar just a moment.\n\n(Sidebar at 03:26:24 p.m.)\n\nTHE COURT: I had understood [from pretrial dis-\ncussions] what you were going to do is, in order to\nfacilitate the foundation, was to introduce particular\nparts.\n\nI have no problem with your asking him generally\nwhat is the story about, is it a story about sex\nbetween an adult and a minor.\n\nI had thought you were going to ask specific ques-\ntions about specific parts of it that tended to show,\nassuming that the debtor (sic) read it, and intent that\nwould correspond to your alleged intent for him or\nhis modus operandi, his knowledge.\n\nThat’s what I thought you were going to do.\n\nMS. KOPPE: That —\n\nTHE COURT: Because, otherwise, if all you’re\ndoing is offering these generally and you’re just stat-\ning the purpose, we don’t have sufficient foundation.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Well, your Honor, that is what we’re\ngoing to do. The problem is we need to get them\nthrough this witness because he’s the one who did\nthe examination of the PDA.\n\f3728               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    We’re going to use another witness to testify to them\n    because he scanned them and someone else —\n\n    THE COURT: All right. Then all you need to ask\n    this witness is, are they on the PDA, and what\n    you’ve already asked, do they have to be opened,\n    unzipped —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Right.\n\n    THE COURT: — before they’re transferred.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: But I was just admitting them through\n    him because he’s the one who found them. That’s —\n\n    THE COURT: Well, then I have a problem because\n    you have not done sufficient foundation. I think\n    you’ve done enough with this witness (indiscernible)\n    to tie it into intent and knowledge, method, prepara-\n    tion.\n\n    You need to have a witness on the stand who you go\n    through with, here is the section that relates to intent;\n    here’s something that shows common language with\n    the e-mails; here’s something that shows method\n    that’s actually present —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Right.\n\n    THE COURT: — allegedly in this case. That’s\n    required for the foundation.\n\n    I think it would only be appropriate then to admit the\n    document. I mean, you can admit it before, subject\n    to showing that foundation and then proceed to —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Okay.\n\f              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3729\nTHE COURT: — point out those particular areas.\n\nMS. KOPPE: I can move for the conditional admis-\nsion of them once he identifies them, if that’s —\n\nTHE COURT: Subject to further foundation.\n\nMS. STANISH [counsel for the government]: And to\nexpedite it, perhaps just introduce them as a bulk\nexhibit. These all came off the PDA (indiscernible)\n—\n\nMS. KOPPE: Establishing —\n\nTHE COURT: Subject to establishing the foundation\nthat I require.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Right.\n\nMR. POTTER: Well, my gut is the exhibit coming\nin, it’s — he’s testifying as to what his belief is.\n\nThe entire exhibit doesn’t need to come in because\nthe very exhibit doesn’t show what we talked about.\nThese stories are not even dealing with the same act.\n\nI mean, these are prepubescent-type stories, at least\nsome of them are.\n\nTHE COURT: Yeah.\n\nMR. POTTER: And that’s completely (indiscernible)\n—\n\nTHE COURT: I think I’d have to overrule that if,\nand only if, you can show — for example, if you\nshow here’s common language to what he used in\nhis e-mail.\n\f3730               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    Or if you can show, for example, that here is com-\n    mon method. This is — here’s a story that describes\n    how you cultivate, and that’s just exactly how he did\n    it here.\n\n    Then you’ve established the foundation, in which\n    case I think it’s appropriate, subject to the limiting\n    instruction, to have the story admitted.\n\n    MR. POTTER: The only thing I would point out is\n    that in, like, sexual assault cases where — or, sexual\n    abuse type cases, when they bring in the prior bad\n    acts — and what the courts have looked at is the\n    same type of abuse and the same kind of factors, if\n    it’s age or if it’s —\n\n    THE COURT: Right.\n\n    MR. POTTER: — convenience, meaning opportu-\n    nity. We don’t have that here. (Indiscernible). These\n    stories are completely different, your Honor.\n\n    THE COURT: They are. And, of course, either on\n    voir dire or out of the presence of the jury you can\n    point that out and I can rule.\n\n    In spite of what’s read outside the presence of the\n    jury, there’s insufficient foundation for that particu-\n    lar story, you point that out [sic] them.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Well, your Honor, Counsel, first of all,\n    argued in his opening that this is all about fantasy\n    and these are all about the defendant’s fantasies.\n\n    THE COURT: I understand. I understand.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: And this shows what his fantasies are\n    and this shows his intent. Counsel argued he never\n    had the intent to have sex with a child.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3731\nThis goes to show that he has intent. They show —\ncertain [sic] of the stories show other things as well.\nBut —\n\nTHE COURT: I’m inclined to agree with you that\none or a few or a general testimony about, generally,\nthat they’re — we don’t know this yet, but generally\nthere are a hundred-and-some-odd stories and they\nall deal with — none of them deal with sex between\ntwo adults.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Right. I was getting into that actually.\n\nTHE COURT: They all deal with — I have no prob-\nlem with your asking that kind of — this isn’t the\nright witness to ask it.\n\nMS. STANISH: Your Honor, may I make a sugges-\ntion that hopefully can expedite and clarify this with-\nout posing a problem for the jury?\n\nThe documents were located on the PDA obviously\nin his possession. The documents speak for them-\nselves.\n\nIt seems to me, your Honor, that perhaps a way to\nresolve this is to have a preliminary determination by\nyour Honor with respect to each of these documents.\n\nThat would be a preliminary legal determination as\nto whether your Honor is satisfied that the contents\nsatisfies the 404(b).\n\nTHE COURT: I don’t care whether you do it out —\nI would just assume that you would do it outside the\npresence of the jury. That’s fine. Or you can do it in\nthe presence of the jury, but, again, you must tie\neach one in.\n\f3732               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    I’m going to let you ask, generally, the question even\n    without admitting them, do all of these stories relate\n    to sex between an adult and a minor. I’ll let you ask\n    that question.\n\n    But if you want the story in, you must ask with\n    respect to that story, regarding those particular\n    parts that deal with intent, method —\n\n    MS. STANISH: Well, your Honor, can I suggest this\n    then? It’s my understanding — and I’ve read these\n    stories — each story involves sex with a minor.\n\n    THE COURT: You can ask that question.\n\n    MS. STANISH: And that being said, your Honor,\n    each — then each story is, in fact, offered for the\n    purpose of establishing intent.\n\n    THE COURT: No, then I think the objective is good.\n    It’s prejudicial. It goes — I mean, let’s say on his\n    PDA he has 100 and over on his general computer\n    he has 500 stories that just deal with sex between\n    adults.\n\n    Or let’s say there are other stories there that deal\n    with fantasizing sex between two adults, one of them\n    role-playing a minor. You could just as well take the\n    inference he just likes to read sex stories, that’s all.\n\n    It’s only because you can tie it into a particular\n    intent, otherwise I’m not going to let him read the\n    story. It’s prejudicial. It’s inflammatory.\n\n    MS. STANISH: Well, I understand what you’re say-\n    ing. That would be more of a 404(3) [sic] ruling, as\n    I understand it, as to prejudice.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3733\nBut just so I’m clear and that we know what direc-\ntion to go, your Honor, the intent that’s involved in\nthis particular offense is to establish, of course, that\nhe crossed the state lines in order to have intent [sic]\nwith a minor.\n\nTHE COURT: I understand clearly, and I think I’ve\ngiven you my ruling.\n\nIf what you’re doing is just saying here’s some PDA\nstories and it shows that they were between adult\nand minors, that to admit them, the whole bulk of\nthem, the prejudice outweighs the relevant portion;\nthat is, it relates to his intent.\n\nBut if you want to ask, generally, before they’re\nadmitted, do they all pertain to that kind of sex\n(indiscernible) question.\n\nAnd if you want to admit any one of them particu-\nlarly so that the jury has the right to read the entire\ndarned story, you’ve got to tie it in, portions of it, to\nthe particular four objectives you’ve told me it’s\noffered for. Okay?\n\nMS. STANISH: Okay.\n\nTHE COURT: And you can either do that with this\nwitness or a subsequent, to reach those particular\nportions that tie it in first before I admit the entire\nstory.\n\nMS. STANISH: And do you have a preference, your\nHonor, whether we do this in front of the jury or —\n\nTHE COURT: It’s okay with me. In other words,\nmaybe you haven’t done the homework yet to even\ndo that. You just wanted them in, generally.\n\f3734              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: No, we have looked through them and,\n    you know, we picked the 21 stories —\n\n    THE COURT: Right.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: — that were —\n\n    THE COURT: Hopefully because they related to one\n    of those four objectives.\n\n    MS. STANISH: Right. And intent is, of course, at\n    least in my view, the predominant purpose for which\n    these are admissible. And I think I understand your\n    Honor now to say that these do, in fact, relate to\n    intent.\n\n    Your bigger concern is one of prejudice; that we’re\n    not bringing in the 156, but we can bring in a sam-\n    pling of the stories that just deal with the intent\n    issue.\n\n    THE COURT: So what you’re telling me is there\n    isn’t anything in these stories that relate to method\n    or any common language to (indiscernible) —\n\n    MS. STANISH: No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying\n    all of them do have in common the intent issue.\n\n    And honestly, Ms. Koppe prepared this part of the\n    case more than I did. They all, though, deal with\n    intent. Others have other purposes for which they\n    could be offered.\n\n    I’m just trying to come up with a solution —\n\n    THE COURT: Well, then you can ask the witness\n    with respect to this story. Hopefully it’s got some-\n\f                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3735\nthing else to do with knowledge; here’s how you cul-\ntivate a young person, or method.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Or knowledge (indiscernible).\n\nTHE COURT: But assuming it doesn’t and all\nyou’re offering it for is intent, you’ll tell me that. But\nhopefully you’ll have a witness that says this talks\nabout sex with a minor.\n\nYou’ll also tell me that there is a witness that will\ntell us that’s what all these stories relate to, including\nthe ones we’re not admitting here. So that otherwise\n(indiscernible) the same time, having the stuff, read-\ning the stuff.\n\nMS. STANISH: I agree, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: So —\n\nMS. STANISH: But 404(b), of course, doesn’t\nrequire that.\n\nAnother solution I might suggest, just to make this\ngo smooth, really, is I’ve seen cases, for instance,\nwhere there’s possession or a number of photographs\nof defendant’s genitalia, for instance.\n\nAnd we’re allowed to bring it in because it does\nrelate to the issue of eliciting and inducing the\nminor.\n\nTHE COURT: Right.\n\nMS. STANISH: But because there’s so many — the\n404(3) [sic] concerns —\n\nTHE COURT: You do a couple.\n\f3736              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. STANISH: — then we just put in a few. Would\n    your Honor be satisfied if we put in just a fewer\n    number? I understand we could —\n\n    THE COURT: No, I didn’t even discuss that.\n\n    MS. STANISH: Okay. I wasn’t sure —\n\n    THE COURT: I have a problem with all of them.\n\n    MS. STANISH: I was trying to — pardon me?\n\n    THE COURT: I don’t have a problem with all of\n    them as long as you do what I ask you to do.\n\n    Ms. STANISH: Yes, sir. All right.\n\n                            ...\n\n    MS. STANISH: After consulting with Mr. Potter, I\n    think the parties agree that this would be best done\n    as a preliminary legal determination as to each one.\n    We don’t want to taint the jury at this point.\n\n                            ...\n\n    THE COURT: Thank you.\n\n    (Jury out at 03:43:13 p.m.)\n\n                            ...\n\n    THE WITNESS: These — these — these exhibits\n    are —\n\n    THE COURT: You can leave those there and you\n    retrieve your notes.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3737\n                         ...\n\nTHE COURT: Thank you. Now, for the record,\nwe’re going to take up with respect to each of these\nstories.\n\nIf you’ve marked sections that relate to any one of\nthose four objectives for which you’re offering it,\noutside the presence of the jury, as foundation for its\nproffer.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, we would state, initially,\nthat each story does show intent to engage in sex\nwith children.\n\nTHE COURT: Because, generally, it’s a story of sex\nbetween an adult and child.\n\nMS. KOPPE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. You’ll tell me if any one of\nthem do [sic] not involve actual description of sex\nbut, rather, is simply method, for example, of culti-\nvating a child rather than actual description of sex\nbetween adult and child.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, the story that was already\nadmitted and testified about, My Little Sister, con-\ntains language about a nine year old engaging in sex\nand about the sex hurting at first but the nine —\n\nTHE COURT: With a brother, correct?\n\nMS. KOPPE: I’m sorry?\n\nTHE COURT: Just be a little more complete with\nme, please. Sex between a nine-year-old girl and her\nbrother.\n\f3738                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: Yes.\n\n                               ...\n\n    THE COURT: Go ahead. I’m sorry. The fact that it\n    did not hurt.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: The fact that it hurt at first. She was\n    told that it will stop hurting and that it will feel a lot\n    better. And that she then says it’s okay, it’s starting\n    to feel good.\n\n    That’s similar to language the defendant used when\n    he told Christy that the sex would — he would take\n    it slowly and that it would feel really good.\n\n    The next story, which is Love For The World —\n\n    MR. POTTER: Your Honor, are we going to go\n    through them one at a time or —\n\n    THE COURT: We’re going to go through them one\n    at a time.\n\n    It might be helpful, too, if you had just told us on\n    which page — if you have marked — I’m assuming\n    we have the same format even though — well, they\n    do have page numbers, even though they don’t occur\n    between the pages — there between the various\n    items.\n\n    Did you intend to have us — to relate to us which\n    items — for example, are you going to have a wit-\n    ness read particular parts, leaving the entire exhibit\n    for the jury?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: I think that they do have other things\n    in them.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3739\n                         ...\n\nTHE COURT: Just go ahead and tell us which parts\nyou have marked that relay the particular content\nthat you’ve told us about.\n\nMS. KOPPE: I could have a witness read them. But\nthe content that I was speaking about started at the\nbottom of the page that’s marked 4. It’s marked 4\ntowards the top, and it goes through the part that’s\nmarked 5. The story I don’t see what —\n\nTHE COURT: So, page 4. Uh-huh. Okay. I’ve\nmarked that on my copy.\n\nThat way Mr. Potter, over the evening, of course,\ncan review them to see if, in fact, they support the\nfoundational purpose for which you’re offering it.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, if we can come back to\nthe second story. I’m going to need to look through\nthat myself.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay.\n\nMS. STANISH: (Indiscernible) expedite it.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, Ms. Stanish has just sug-\ngested, this would probably expedite it, if first thing\nin the morning we provide both your Honor and\ndefense counsel with the highlighted portions of\nthese stories.\n\nTHE COURT: You don’t have that here?\n\nMS. KOPPE: I do have highlighted portions, but I\ndon’t have copies that are highlighted for both your\nHonor and for counsel.\n\f3740              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n                            ...\n\n    THE COURT: Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter, or do\n    you need a little time to look at them?\n\n    MR. POTTER: I probably need to look at them, but\n    I don’t know if —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: I can keep going through it.\n\n    MR. POTTER: Do you have a public copier, by\n    chance?\n\n    THE COURT: We do have a copy machine, of\n    course. The problem is whether or not the highlight-\n    ing would show through on a copy, I suppose. What\n    color is the highlighting?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Blue.\n\n    THE COURT: Blue. Would that show up on a cop-\n    ier? It does. Then, of course, we can take them and\n    provide you a xerox copy of each of these over the\n    evening recess.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: That’s fine. Either way.\n\n    MR. POTTER: All right.\n\n                            ...\n\n    THE COURT: — and just as you’ve been doing,\n    identify the purpose and, with respect to foundation,\n    without telling us particular paragraphs, which you\n    will give us by way of the copy we’ll provide\n    tonight.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Okay.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3741\nTHE COURT: If you’ll just tell me the foundational\npurpose and what general parts of the story, just as\nyou did with the first story; that is, did not hurt, felt\ngood, et cetera.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Okay. Your Honor, skipping the sec-\nond story for the moment, the story Melanie’s Busy\nDay —\n\nTHE COURT: Uh-huh.\n\nMS. KOPPE: — there’s language concerning a child\nmasturbating, as the defendant wanted this child to\nmasturbate.\n\nThere’s also language of the adult — it’s actually her\nfather — telling her how pretty she is. There’s also\nlanguage that both of her parents perform oral sex on\nher, and the defendant talks about performing oral\nsex on her. And —\n\nTHE COURT: And, again, this is the general intent\nyou talked about before.\n\nMS. KOPPE: This is general intent as well as modus\noperandi and preparation —\n\nTHE COURT: Okay.\n\nMS. KOPPE: — and knowledge. And I can give you\nwhere those parts are.\n\nTHE COURT: You’ll give it to us in the form of the\ncopy we’re going to provide.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Okay.\n\nTHE COURT: They’re marked, I assume.\n\f3742               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: In that same story, your Honor, the lit-\n    tle girl is also given oral sex by her grandfather and\n    the grandfather also talks about how pretty she is.\n\n    Going to the next story, which is called Missing Big\n    Brother.\n\n    THE COURT: Again, I’m going to assume general\n    intent on each of these unless you tell me otherwise.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: That’s right. This story talks about —\n\n    MR.    POTTER: Which one is this one now?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: This is Missing Big Brother. The big\n    brother engaging in — big brother is 18, it looks\n    like, and the girl is 14.\n\n    It talks about the girl not wearing any panties under-\n    neath her skirt. It’s one of the things the defendant\n    talked about.\n\n    It talked about how when he had sex with her, he\n    didn’t want to hurt her during sex and he wanted her\n    to like it so much she would be continuously coming\n    back to him. The defendant talked about how he\n    would make it feel good for this little girl.\n\n    And that we offer also for intent, but as well for\n    modus operandi, preparation, and knowledge.\n\n    The next story is I’m Being Molested, and it also\n    talks about sex for children not hurting and how can\n    it be called abuse when it felt good and they were\n    asking for it after it happened, the girls, and it\n    involved sex with their father.\n\n    It also says that, did it hurt? I suppose a little but\n    then it felt good. And it talks more about you may\n\f              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3743\ncall it molestation, you can call it abuse, we don’t\nthink about it that way in this family.\n\nThis story, The Good Girl, which is the next story,\nis where the defendant — excuse me, the defendant\nin his chat talked about how he was willing to be\npatient and wait until Christy was ready to have sex\nwith him.\n\nThis person talks about the same thing to the girl. I\nbelieve she’s 14 at the time. And talks about fooling\naround without having sex, which the defendant also\ndiscussed.\n\nIt goes toward modus operandi, intent, preparation,\nand knowledge.\n\nThe next story should be Pregnant No. 2 (phonetic).\nThis story contains language similar to that used by\nthe defendant in chats concerning oral sex.\n\nIt also talks about how the defendant was talking\nabout how being naked is more comfortable than\nbeing clothed.\n\nIn this story, the girl talks about how her clothing\ndrivers [sic] her crazy. It’s too abrasive. And it\ntalked about oral sex as well.\n\nAnd goes toward modus operandi, intent, prepara-\ntion, and knowledge.\n\nThe story, A Relative Language — excuse me, A\nRelative Interest, has language concerning — the\ndefendant had spoken to Christy about imagining his\ntongue sliding along inside of her.\n\nThis has language similar to that regarding oral sex,\nand it’s clearly with a child as well.\n\f3744               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    It goes towards intent, modus operandi, preparation,\n    and knowledge.\n\n    The story, Restrictions, has the father telling his\n    daughter, who is a child, that she’s sexy, that she\n    should wear barely any clothes, that she should walk\n    around naked, that she’s cute, sexy again, and talks\n    about — it shows a way of seducing — it’s a meth-\n    odology of seducing a child, basically.\n\n    There are several descriptions of the father getting\n    his daughter to engage in sex with him, basically, bit\n    by bit.\n\n    It goes towards intent, modus operandi, preparation,\n    and knowledge.\n\n    The next story is A Matter Of Taste, and that story\n    talks about — it has a description of giving male oral\n    sex and wanting the minor to feel good during oral\n    sex. I believe the girl is 12 in this story.\n\n    Starting on page 12 where she’s talking about giving\n    oral sex to her father and that she does it better than\n    anyone else. And the defendant said in his chats that\n    he would teach Christy how to do that. It also talks\n    — well, it talks more about that.\n\n    And that goes towards modus operandi, intent, prep-\n    aration, and knowledge.\n\n    This story, Teaching The Kids, has a lesson on how\n    to introduce children into sex. It’s parents talking to\n    their children.\n\n    It looks like there are three sons and two daughters.\n    The oldest son is 15, the youngest is 11. And the two\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                     3745\ngirls are young. I don’t see their age in the front page\nbut it will be in here.\n\nThe parents decide it’s time for the kids to learn\nabout sex, and there’s a methodology of how they\nseduce the children into engaging in sex.\n\nIt goes to intent, knowledge, modus operandi. It also\ntalks about oral sex, which the defendant talked\nabout in his chats.\n\nThe next story is called Mommy Juice (phonetic).\nAnd that story has a conversation with a mother\nteaching her children about sex and telling them that\nit will feel good before she has them engage in it.\nThere’s a part where it says, basically, that sex feels\ngood to adolescent girls.\n\nIt goes towards modus operandi, intent. And it also\nhas one of the girls, afterwards, telling her dad that\nit feels good. It goes towards modus operandi, intent,\nknowledge, and preparation.\n\nThe story My Sister And I has language about oral\nsex, engaging in oral sex with a minor and trying to\nplease her. The defendant talked about how he\nwould have Christy orgasm numerous times, and this\nstory talks about that as well.\n\nIt goes towards preparation, knowledge, intent,\nmodus operandi.\n\nThere’s a fairly long description of performing oral\nsex on the minor. And then there’s a part where the\nminor says if it hurts, you have to stop, and he prom-\nises to do so.\n\n                          ...\n\f3746               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: The story Now Kids (phonetic), con-\n    tains statements that sex is fun for everyone, espe-\n    cially young girls.\n\n    The father tells her, it feels real good, doesn’t it? The\n    girl then has sex with her older brother and tells him\n    it felt really good; all language that the defendant\n    said he would do with Christy.\n\n    That goes also towards knowledge, intent, modus\n    operandi, motive.\n\n    The story Getting Out Of Hand also contains state-\n    ments about sex being fun for young girls and feel-\n    ing good. And that goes towards knowledge, intent.\n\n    The next story is — that story also talks about oral\n    sex, which the defendant also talked about.\n\n    The story Peeping In On My Daughter has a 14 year\n    old stating that she’s not too young to engage in sex-\n    ual intercourse.\n\n    It contains a statement that sex is fun for young girls\n    and also how sex feels good and teaching her how to\n    give oral sex to a man. And it looks like it’s her\n    grandfather having sex with her. It goes to intent,\n    motive, and knowledge.\n\n    The story Horny Nieces has a discussion between\n    ten-year-old girls and their father concerning\n    whether the — will engage with their uncle who is\n    coming to visit.\n\n    The father tells the girls that they should be careful\n    when talking about it because some people think sex\n    with children is wrong and their uncle may be one of\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                     3747\nthem. The story also contains the idea that the young\ngirls enjoy sex and that it feels good to them.\n\nThis certainly shows knowledge that this is a crime\nand it’s illegal and that there are people who believe\nthat, and it shows motive and intent as well.\n\nThe story Heck Of A Job (phonetic) is a story about\na guy who meets twins who are seven or eight years\nold. They never say for sure exactly how old they\nare, but they’re young; seven or eight.\n\nAnd he goes to their house and engages in — well,\nfirst it’s a store and then at their house, engages in\nsteps in order to — basically it’s a methodology of\nseducing them into engaging in sex with him.\n\nAnd it shows knowledge and intent, modus operandi\nand preparation. It also talks about oral sex on a\nfemale that’s similar to the discussions the defendant\nhad in the chats.\n\nThe story, Consent, contains a discussion of consent\nversus rape concerning young girls having sex. And\nthe — contains the basic idea that even though the\ngirl is young and below the age of consent, if, in fact,\nshe consents, how can it be called rape. And that\nshows the defendant’s intent.\n\nThe next story, Daddy’s Lessons, talks about how\nsex only hurts at first. It has descriptions of oral sex\non a man.\n\nThis is basically graphic language. It’s the story of\nyoung children having sex with their parents and\nwith each other.\n\f3748               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    After everyone has had sex with each other, the\n    mother sits them down and tells them that they can\n    never tell anyone what they do in their house.\n\n    She explains to them what statutory rape is. She tells\n    them that what they engage in is, in fact, statutory\n    rape and tells the kids that their parents would go to\n    jail if they tell anyone, if anyone knows what hap-\n    pens in their house.\n\n    She also tells them that because of this type of crime,\n    if her father goes — if their father goes to jail, then\n    they — he would be killed because people don’t like\n    people who commit this type of crime.\n\n    And the final story is Playing Adult Games With Lit-\n    tle Sister. It contains descriptions of manipulating\n    children into engaging in sexual acts.\n\n    The mother, the adult, starts the manipulation and\n    the rest of the story kind of escalates that manipula-\n    tion, and it’s a bit of a methodology of how to get\n    these kids to engage in sexual acts.\n\n    There is also a part where they talk about our fanta-\n    sies, basically, of sex — children having sex and\n    how they were going to be coming [sic] true because\n    of what’s happening to their children.\n\n    This shows intent, modus operandi, knowledge,\n    motive, and preparation.\n\n    THE COURT: Okay. Can we give those to Paula and\n    ask her to run them and hopefully the blue part will\n    show through so that — we’ll give you a copy. You\n    already have copies but, of course, this will be a\n    copy of the markings. Okay?\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                     3749\n    And then if you — for purposes of demonstration to\n    the Court or objection to the Court, before the jury\n    comes in tomorrow morning, if you would make\n    your objection; that is, this one just simply does not\n    go to that particular purpose, the language isn’t there\n    or whatever, if you’ll make that before we bring the\n    jury back.\n\n    Anything further? Thank you, very much. We’ll\n    reconvene, please, tomorrow morning at 9:00.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n  Thus, the record reveals that the trial judge correctly\nrequired the government to demonstrates that the five stories\nadmitted were factually similar to the defendants interaction\nwith “christy13.”\n\n   Day Three began on the same issue, with counsel for Curtin\ncontinuing to rely on Shymanovitz and Rule 403 to block the\nintroduction of the stories. The government responded as fol-\nlows:\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Your Honor, first of all, as far as Mr.\n    Potter’s argument that the articles are, in themselves,\n    legal, 404(b) does not require that the other acts be\n    illegal acts or even bad acts. It just requires that they\n    be other acts that show one of the elements listed in\n    404(b).\n\n    These stories, every single one of them, proves\n    intent. Every single one of them shows the defen-\n    dant’s intent. They all talk about sex with children.\n    They all talk about intent to have sex with children.\n\n    The fact that the defendant possessed over 140 of\n    these stories and carried them around with him, go\n    directly against his defense that he had no intent to\n\f3750              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    engage in sex with children, that that was not any-\n    thing he wanted to do.\n\n                            ...\n\n    The defendant is the one who has immersed himself\n    in this fantasy defense. The defendant is the one who\n    is saying I didn’t have the intent. I never had that\n    intent.\n\n    And these stories that the defendant possessed and\n    that the defendant carried around with him every-\n    where he went and when he was committing this\n    crime, they show his intent.\n\n                            ...\n\n    In Allen (phonetic) the Ninth Circuit found that the\n    literature in that case did go to an element of the\n    crime and specifically distinguished that case from\n    Shimonowitz [sic] because it said that the stories in\n    that case did not go to an element of the crime.\n\n    These stories not only go to an element of the crime\n    — intent is one of the most important elements of\n    the crime, actually — it goes to the element of the\n    crime that the defendant himself is attacking, pretty\n    much the only element the defendant is attacking.\n    And the defendant possessed these stories.\n\n    As far as 403, your Honor, these stories are not more\n    prejudicial than they are probative. They’re clearly\n    probative.\n\n                            ...\n\n   The court continued to be concerned about the number of\nstories that should go to the jury:\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3751\n    THE COURT: Now, the last issue I wanted to\n    address is I sure don’t want to impose upon the jury\n    the feeling that they have to read this entire book.\n    How many stories was this?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Your Honor, that was 21 stories.\n    We’re going to narrow it down —\n\n    THE COURT: You’re going to limit it down to —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: — to 12.\n\n    THE COURT: — about half of it. That’s helpful but\n    it’s still, number one, it’s potentially redundant —\n    like I said, after you get past the first story — and\n    it’s also potentially biasing.\n\n    In other words, we want the jury to limit themselves\n    to these four issues — intent, methodology, prepara-\n    tion, and knowledge — and trying not to overempha-\n    size this evidence in the context of all other\n    evidence.\n\n    I simply want to make it very clear to the jury, you\n    must not let this type of evidence bias you against\n    the defendant. He has a constitutional right to pos-\n    sess such. But you must, and may, only take it for\n    the four proffered reasons.\n\n   At this point, and having caused the number of stories to be\nreduced to five, the court addressed a final issue: whether to\npermit the jurors to read the entirety of each story, or just\nhighlighted “snippets,” the particular parts of each story going\ndirectly to the defendant’s intent. The “snippets” had been\npreviously highlighted in blue by the prosecution. The court\nsaid,\n\f3752                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n      So, the only last question I had in my head is assum-\n      ing that I let you introduce, in total, the first story,\n      maybe the second one, which was, as much as I\n      could read, other than the snippets in the other stories,9\n      I did have a question overnight.\n\n      I still haven’t quite resolved in my mind as to\n      whether I should let you admit the entire rest of the\n      other stories, other than just the snippets.\n\n                                    ...\n\n      MS. STANISH: I think it’s problematic to put, let’s\n      say, Agent Flaherty on the stand and have her say\n      this portion relates to this purpose —\n\n      THE COURT: But don’t you think it would be more\n      proper, at a minimum, if you don’t do that. That\n      would be my preference, that you do it that way.\n\n      But if you don’t do that, at a minimum, to put a wit-\n      ness on the stand who says we have highlighted\n      those portions of the stories that relate to the four\n      intended purposes.\n\n      I mean, if we admit it, generally, and tell the jury\n      you’ve got to search through these stories for those\n      intended purposes, then we’ve allowed the prejudi-\n      cial effect of the volume and redundancy of the story\n      to outweigh the four purposes.\n\n                                    ...\n  9\n    My colleagues’ claim that the district court “was unable to read the sto-\nries” is not supported by the record. The court clearly had its own copies\nand read the “snippets” which highlighted the material that makes the sto-\nries relevant. Curtin does not object to the use of the entire story in lieu\nof the snippets.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3753\n    THE COURT: . . . But wouldn’t it be more appropri-\n    ate, at a minimum, for you to have the witness testify\n    that I have marked in blue — I mean, leaving it for\n    the jury finally to decide whether it really is proof of\n    these four elements.\n\n    But have you marked portions of these stories in\n    blue? Yes. For what purpose? To show that they\n    relate to either intent, or method, or preparation, or\n    knowledge.\n\n                              ...\n\n    MR. POTTER: We’re going to be doing the snip-\n    pets, then, is that —\n\n    THE COURT: We would not be reading the snip-\n    pets. We would be leaving it for the jury to find the\n    snippets in those one — for the purposes for which\n    I tell them are relevant; one, two, three —\n\n    MR. POTTER: I think that’s —\n\n    THE COURT: — four, five stories.\n\n    MR. POTTER: If they’re getting the whole story and\n    then the snippets then emphasize. I mean, now\n    they’re getting . . . they’re getting their attention\n    drawn to something.\n\n    I mean, you make the decision of what is relevant\n    and whether it is passed the muster of these four ele-\n    ments.\n\n    And, now, I think if we’re going to give them the\n    whole story, then they should be blank stories.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\f3754                  UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   The issues having been resolved, the court then pre-\ninstructed the jurors10 as per Fed. R. Evid. 105 as to the lim-\nited purpose for which they could use this evidence the jury\nwas about to hear, an instruction which the jurors heard more\nthan once:\n\n       THE COURT: I’m going to allow the prosecution to\n       reopen their examination for a few additional min-\n       utes. They want to proffer some additional exhibits.\n\n       And, therefore, I’m going to give you a brief instruc-\n       tion with respect to these exhibits. I gave you, ini-\n       tially, the same instruction yesterday. I’m going to\n       give you the official version and then explain it\n       briefly.\n\n       You are about to hear testimony that the defendant\n       had articles on his PDA that relate to other acts not\n       charged here.\n\n       I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted\n       only for the limited purpose of being considered by\n       you on the question of the defendant’s intent,\n       method, preparation, or knowledge, and for no other\n       purpose. Let me explain the instruction just briefly.\n\n       We all have, thank goodness, a constitutional right to\n       have whatever literature we want in our homes, on\n       our PDAs, on our computers.\n\n       A person cannot be charged nor convicted of litera-\n       ture that they read or that they possess. That’s why\n       I’m giving you the instruction.\n\n       But the Government has the obligation to prove,\n       beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had\n  10\n    As did the court in Allen, 341 F.3d at 887, n.24.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3755\nthe wrongful intent. They may offer possession of\nsuch literature to show that.\n\nFor example, most all crimes, state or federal, have,\nat a minimum, at least two elements. I’ll instruct you\nat the end of the case on what the elements of these\ncrimes are. And the Government must prove every\none of them, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBut most all crimes have a minimum of two ele-\nments: One, some conduct that’s specified in the\nstatute; and number two, a wrongful state of mind or\nintent.\n\nThe simplest example I can think of is murder. There\nis an act, homicide. And there’s a wrongful intent,\nthe wrongful taking of another person’s life.\n\nIf you don’t have that intent, you haven’t committed\nthe crime. If you’re involved in an accident in your\ncar and, unfortunately, someone loses their life in\nthat accident, you are not guilty of murder.\n\nThere is a homicide, to be sure, but there is no\nwrongful intent. And, therefore, you’re not charged,\nnor convicted, nor alleged with committing a crimi-\nnal act. You may be sued in court civilly, of course.\nTherefore, there are two elements.\n\nYou may take this kind of evidence on the question\nof whether the defendant actually possessed the\nintent.\n\nYou may also take it on the additional questions\nwhich go to the question of intent, whether he prac-\nticed in this alleged conduct methodology consistent\nwith literature that he had or tending to show that he\nprepared to commit the acts or that he had knowl-\n\f3756                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    edge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act\n    was illegal.\n\n    Again, the prosecution does not have to show that a\n    defendant knew an act was illegal, simply that he\n    committed the act and that he knew it was wrongful\n    or that he had the wrongful intent. They don’t have\n    to prove that he knew it was illegal.\n\n    But evidence tending to show that he knew it was\n    illegal may or may not tend to show that he had the\n    intent.\n\n    So, for those four reasons, only, the Government is\n    offering to show that the defendant possessed this lit-\n    erature; intent, method, preparation, and knowledge.\n    And you may only take it for that purpose.\n\n    Again, you have a constitutional right. You have that\n    right. You would want to protect the defendant’s\n    right to posses any kind of literature and to read it or\n    not read it.\n\n    You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias\n    you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate\n    question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that.\n\n    I’ll repeat, finally, in conclusion, the official instruc-\n    tion.\n\n    You are about to hear testimony that the defendant\n    possessed various types of articles on his PDA\n    regarding other acts not charged here.\n\n    I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted\n    only for the limited purpose of being considered by\n    you on the question of the defendant’s intent,\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3757\n    method, preparation, or knowledge and for no other\n    purpose.\n\n    I hope you understand the instruction. With that, I’ll\n    permit the prosecution to proceed again today.\n\n                              VI\n\n   My colleagues’ opinion stands for the questionable propo-\nsition that a trial court simply has no discretion in a case\ninvolving pedophilia to admit obscene sexual literature, even\nthough the literature — as it does here — (1) sheds probative\nlight on a defendant’s relevant subjective intent, and (2)\nrebuts a defendant’s primary defense of no criminal mens rea.\nMy colleagues have made relevant literature off limits in the\nNinth Circuit as a matter of law.\n\n   Ironically, Rule 404(b), a rule of inclusion, references at\nleast three categories of other “acts” encompassing the inner\nworkings of the mind: motive, intent, and knowledge. Once\nit has been established that the evidence offered serves one of\nthese purposes, the relevant Advisory Committee notes make\nit clear that the “only” conditions justifying the exclusion of\nthe evidence are those described in Rule 403: unfair prejudice,\nconfusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwaste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evi-\ndence:\n\n       Note to Subdivision (b). The second sentence of\n    Rule 404(b) as submitted to the Congress began with\n    the words “This subdivision does not exclude the\n    evidence when offered”. The Committee amended\n    this language to read “It may, however, be admissi-\n    ble”, the words used in the 1971 Advisory Commit-\n    tee draft, on the ground that this formulation\n    properly placed greater emphasis on admissibility\n    than did the final Court version. House Report No.\n    93-650.\n\f3758               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n       Note to Subdivision (b). This rule provides that\n    evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not\n    admissible to prove character but may be admissible\n    for other specified purposes such as proof of motive.\n\n       Although your committee sees no necessity in\n    amending the rule itself, it anticipates that the use of\n    the discretionary word “may” with respect to the\n    admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts\n    is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on\n    the trial judge. Rather, it is anticipated that with\n    respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the\n    trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of those\n    considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e., prejudice,\n    confusion or waste of time. Senate Report No. 93-\n    1277.\n\n  The Supreme Court embraced this understanding of Rule\n404(b) and its handling of “other acts” in Huddleston v.\nUnited States, 485 U.S. 681 (1998):\n\n    Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)—which applies in\n    both civil and criminal cases—generally prohibits\n    the introduction of evidence of extrinsic acts that\n    might adversely reflect on the actor’s character,\n    unless that evidence bears upon a relevant issue in\n    the case such as motive, opportunity, or knowledge.\n    Extrinsic acts evidence may be critical to the estab-\n    lishment of the truth as to a disputed issue, especially\n    when that issue involves the actor’s state of mind\n    and the only means of ascertaining that mental state\n    is by drawing inferences from conduct.\n\nId. at 685 (emphasis added).\n\n  Moreover, the Court explicitly embraced the Advisory\nCommittee’s understanding of the Rule as reflecting the intent\nof Congress:\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3759\nPetitioner’s reading of Rule 404(b) as mandating a\npreliminary finding by the trial court that the act in\nquestion occurred not only superimposes a level of\njudicial oversight that is nowhere apparent from the\nlanguage of that provision, but it is simply inconsis-\ntent with the legislative history behind Rule 404(b).\nThe Advisory Committee specifically declined to\noffer any “mechanical solution” to the admission of\nevidence under 404(b). Rather, the Committee indi-\ncated that the trial court should assess such evidence\nunder the usual rules for admissibility: “The determi-\nnation must be made whether the danger of undue\nprejudice outweighs the probative value of the evi-\ndence in view of the availability of other means of\nproof and other factors appropriate for making deci-\nsions of this kind under Rule 403.” [S]ee also, S Rep\nNo. 93-1277, p 25 (1974) (“[I]t is anticipated that\nwith respect to permissible uses for such evidence,\nthe trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of\nthose considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e. preju-\ndice, confusion or waste of time”).\n\nPetitioner’s suggestion that a preliminary finding is\nnecessary to protect the defendant from the potential\nfor unfair prejudice is also belied by the Reports of\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate. The\nHouse made clear that the version of Rule 404(b)\nwhich became law was intended to “plac[e] greater\nemphasis on admissibility than did the final Court\nverison.” The Senate echoed this theme: “[T]he use\nof the discretionary word ‘may’ with respect to the\nadmissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or other\nacts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion\non the trial judge.” Thus, Congress was not nearly so\nconcerned with the potential prejudicial effect of\nRule 404(b) evidence as it was with ensuring that\nrestrictions would not be placed on the admission of\nsuch evidence.\n\f3760                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nId. at 688, 689 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the majori-\nty’s exclusionary holding defies not only the clear purpose of\nthe Rule itself, but the Supreme Court’s authoritative guid-\nance.\n\n   This holding is not only legally wrong, but it extinguishes\nthe discretion of a district court to decide questions of rele-\nvancy, inappropriately converting our standard of review from\none that examines for an abuse of discretion into one that\nlooks at a relevancy decision de novo. Their holding is a twis-\ntification of the principle that an error of law necessarily ren-\nders abusive an exercise of discretion based on that error.\nHere, there was no error of law. The evidence was relevant,\nperiod; and, as we observed in United States v. Hearst, 563\nF.2d at 1337, n.3, “relevance is the essential criterion.” Curtin\nhad this evidence on his person when he entered the casino\nexpecting to find “christy13.” An officer testified that Curtin\n“had a Palm device, a PDA, and he was looking at — at it.\nHe was looking at the screen [for five minutes] and he kept\non looking up as if he was trying to verify the time or loca-\ntion.” Curtin conceded in his testimony that he personally had\ndownloaded these stories through a computer to his PDA\nbecause he believed they were “quite erotic.” [Day 4, p. 23]\nThe particular erotic story that attracted his attention was\nabout a “17 year-old girl,” and he downloaded them to find\nmore of the same. [Day 4, p. 56] He caused them to be put\nout on his PDA in December, 2003, just two and one-half\nmonths before contacting “christy13.” Curtin conceded\n“skimming” some of the downloaded stories.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n  This case in combination with Shymanovitz improperly\nhamstrings the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Cir-\ncuit with adults who see children as sexual prey. Congress has\nenacted a law protecting minors from this behavior, but we\nhave misinterpreted the Rules of Evidence to make the law\ninordinately difficult to enforce. Without justification, this\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3761\nholding handcuffs jurors when confronted with “no intent”\ndefenses, turning such trials into the equivalent of “he said,\nshe said” conundrums. My experience with jurors is that con-\nfronted with these situations, they want context, corroborating\nevidence, and other pertinent information which helps them\nsort out conflicting claims and assertions. Why? Not because\nit is prejudicial, but because it is relevant, whether it cuts for\nor against a defendant. As recognized by the Tenth Circuit in\nViefhaus and Magleby, context and circumstances are impor-\ntant, and relevant literature can be used to this end — even if\nit is obscene. Now, we leave the jury high and dry without rel-\nevant evidence to look to in order to ensure the validity of\ntheir verdict. Such a handicap is legally wrong as well as\nunwise. At the very least, the district court’s decision regard-\ning the evidence eventually submitted to the jury was far from\nabusive. If somehow it is correct that Shymanovitz commands\nthis result, then Shymanovitz is seriously defective and must\nbe reconsidered. Thus, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

CURTIN                 3673\nDaniel J. Bogden, United States Attorney; Nancy J. Koppe,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Las Vegas, Nevada, for\nrespondent United States of America.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nWALLACE, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Curtin appeals from his conviction and sentence for travel-\ning across state lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with\na minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), and of use of an\ninterstate facility to attempt to persuade a minor to engage in\nsex, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). We have jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm in part, reverse in\npart, and remand for a new trial.\n\n                               I.\n\n   On the afternoon of February 11, 2004, Las Vegas Metro-\npolitan Police Department Detective Michael Castaneda was\nacting undercover on the Internet as a 14-year-old girl using\nthe screen name “christine13.” Castaneda entered a chat chan-\nnel labeled “ltgirlsexchat” and received an instant message\nfrom Curtin, who used the screen name “M-42SOCAL.”\n\n   The detective, as “Christy,” and Curtin “chatted” through\ninstant messaging for approximately four hours. They\nexchanged photos early in the conversation. Castaneda sent\nCurtin a picture of a female police officer, taken when she\nwas fourteen years old. Curtin said his name was “Kenny”\nand that he was forty-two years old, divorced, and living in\nAnaheim, California. He told Christy that he was planning to\ntravel to Las Vegas on Friday, February 13 and invited her to\ngo to a “Penn and Teller” show on Sunday, February 15.\nChristy agreed.\n\f3674               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   Curtin extensively discussed sex with Christy during this\nconversation, saying that he would love for her to “spend the\nnight” after the show and hoped to “get a room.” Curtin told\nChristy “I want to make you happy . . . . If you were mastur-\nbating and fantasizing about sex, I’d love to have sex with\nyou.” He added that they “could just make out or I could just\ngive you oral sex or we could just fool around.” Finally, Cur-\ntin made plans to meet Christy in the bowling alley of a Las\nVegas casino at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 15. At the end\nof the conversation, Curtin asked Christy to try sleeping\nnaked that night, and to “imagine my face moving between\nyour legs and licking you. Imagine my tongue penetrating\nyou.”\n\n   The next day, Curtin sent Christy an email message saying\n“I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to Sunday.\nWe’re going to have a great time.” The detective and Curtin\nlater that day had another “chat” during which Curtin contin-\nued to make explicit references to having sex with Christy.\nCurtin concluded the “chat” by confirming their meeting and\ntelling Christy he would introduce her to Penn and Teller as\nhis niece, adding, “Let’s not get caught, ever.”\n\n   On that Sunday, the police officer whose picture was sent\nto Curtin waited in the bowling alley as a decoy, dressed in\nthe clothes that Christy indicated she would be wearing. Eight\nto ten other law enforcement officers were also present. Cur-\ntin entered the bowling alley at 1:45 p.m. and walked towards\nthe area where the decoy officer was sitting. He walked past\nher and then turned and walked past her again, looking at her\neach time. Curtin then left the area where the decoy was sit-\nting and went to the back of the bowling alley, where he used\nhis personal digital assistant. At the request of law enforce-\nment officers, a casino security guard approached Curtin and\nasked for identification. Curtin showed the guard a United\nStates passport and subsequently left the bowling alley area of\nthe casino.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                 3675\n   Curtin reentered the bowling alley approximately 2:05 p.m.\nHe looked around and again walked to the area where the\ndecoy officer was sitting. After less than a minute, he moved\neven closer to her, looking in her direction the entire time. He\nstopped behind the officer and she turned and said “hi” to\nhim. Whether he said “hi” in return is disputed.\n\n   He then left the bowling alley and started getting into a van,\nat which point law enforcement officers stopped and asked\nhim for identification. He was detained by police and advised\nof his rights under Miranda. After Curtin waived these rights,\nhe agreed to speak with the law enforcement officers. In a\nvoluntary statement, he stated that he had traveled by car to\nLas Vegas for meetings. He explained that he was at the\nbowling alley to meet a female friend he had met on the inter-\nnet. He admitted to using the screen name and email address\nused to contact Christy. Curtin explained that he often enters\nchat rooms and “role play[s]” as if he is engaged in “daddy/\ndaughter” type conversations, and that he expected Christy to\nbe a thirty- to forty-year-old woman pretending to be a girl.\n\n   Curtin was then arrested by the Las Vegas police. Upon\nsearching his van and hotel room, police seized his digital\nassistant and laptop computer. The digital assistant contained\nover 140 stories about adults having sex with children. The\nlaptop contained a list of chat channels that Curtin had\naccessed in the past, as well as pictures of girls whose names\nmatched some of those in his “chat” list.\n\n   Curtin was indicted on one count of travel with intent to\nengage in a sexual act with a juvenile, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 2423(b), and one count of coercion and enticement,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). Curtin filed two motions\nin limine asking the district court to exclude the stories found\non his digital assistant from evidence. The district court\ndenied these motions in limine. On the second day of trial, the\ngovernment offered two of the stories, “My Little Sister” and\n“Love for the World,” to show modus operandi, intent, prepa-\n\f3676                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nration, and knowledge. They were admitted over Curtin’s\nobjection. The engineer who extracted the stories from the\ndigital assistant testified that both stories were about a father\nhaving sex with his young daughter and the daughter’s enjoy-\nment of the experience. However, when the government\nsought to introduce a third story, “Melanie’s Busy Day,” the\ndistrict court stopped the questioning. The court allowed the\ngovernment to ask general questions without admitting the\nstories, such as whether they all related to sex between a\nminor and an adult. However, recognizing the highly prejudi-\ncial nature of the stories, the court held that the story could\nbe entered into evidence only if it tied into Curtin’s intent,\nknowledge, preparation, or modus operandi.\n\n   The government then asked the court to make a preliminary\nlegal determination about the admissibility of the remaining\nstories. The government argued that “Melanie’s Busy Day”\nwas admissible to show general intent, modus operandi, prep-\naration, and knowledge because it had language similar to that\nused by Curtin in his email to Christy, namely, language con-\ncerning oral sex and a child masturbating. The government\nargued that “Missing Big Brother,” which discussed how the\nadult did not want to hurt the child during sex, was also\nadmissible for intent, modus operandi, preparation, and\nknowledge. The government made similar arguments with\nregard to seventeen other stories, with titles such as “I’m\nBeing Molested,” “The Good Girl,” “A Relative Interest,”\n“Restrictions,” “Teaching the Kids,” and “Mommy Juice.”\n\n   The following morning, Curtin renewed his objection to the\nadmission of the stories, arguing that they were highly preju-\ndicial and were being admitted to show propensity. The dis-\ntrict court held that if the government could cite a part of the\nstory that related to one of the permissible purposes under\nFederal Rule of Evidence Rule 404(b), then the court would\nadmit the entire story to show general intent.\n\n   The district court admitted to being unable to read the sto-\nries because they were so disturbing. “I thought about this\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3677\nproblem overnight because I want to address the relative over-\nwhelming prejudice versus the purpose. I read the first story\nand a little bit of the second. That’s as far as I could get,\nwhich is confirming [defense counsel’s] statement. It has a\ntendency to overwhelm you and overwhelm the jury.” How-\never, after more argument, the district court agreed to give a\nlimiting instruction and to admit five of the stories: “My Little\nSister” (which involved incest and the impregnation of a nine-\nyear-old girl), “Love for the World” (which involved incest),\n“Restrictions” (same), “Daddy’s Lessons” (same), and “Mela-\nnie’s Busy Day” (which involved an eleven-year-old girl initi-\nating sex with, among others, her father and her teacher).\n\n  The limiting instruction given was as follows:\n\n       A person cannot be charged nor convicted of liter-\n    ature that they read or that they possess. That’s why\n    I’m giving you the instruction.\n\n       But the Government has the obligation to prove,\n    beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had\n    the wrongful intent. They may offer possession of\n    such literature to show that. . . .\n\n       You may take this kind of evidence on the ques-\n    tion of whether the defendant actually possessed the\n    intent.\n\n       You may also take it on the additional questions\n    which go to the question of intent, whether he prac-\n    ticed in this alleged conduct methodology consistent\n    with literature that he had or tending to show that he\n    prepared to commit the acts or that he had knowl-\n    edge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act\n    was illegal. . . .\n\n       So, for those four reasons, only, the Government\n    is offering to show that the defendant possessed this\n\f3678                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    literature; intent, method, preparation, and knowl-\n    edge. And you may only take it for that purpose.\n\n       Again, you have a constitutional right. You have\n    that right. You would want to protect the defendant’s\n    right to possess any kind of literature and to read it\n    or not read it.\n\n      You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias\n    you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate\n    question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that.\n\n                               II.\n\n   Curtin contends that the five stories were inadmissible\ncharacter evidence, introduced to show propensity in violation\nof Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The govern-\nment responds that the stories fall outside the parameters of\nRule 404(b) because they are inextricably intertwined with the\ncharged crimes. Alternatively, the government argues that the\nstories were properly admitted under Rule 404(b) to prove\nCurtin’s intent.\n\n                               A.\n\n   The government argues that the admitted stories were “in-\nextricably intertwined” with the facts giving rise to the indict-\nment against Curtin and therefore not “other acts” evidence\nwithin the scope of Rule 404(b). We review de novo the ques-\ntion of whether the evidence was within the scope of Rule\n404(b). See United States v.

Similarly, in United States v.\nLillard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784716\"><a href=\"/opinion/784716/united-states-v-lonnie-lillard/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (9th Cir. 2003), we concluded that\nthe defendant’s theft of cocaine from a shipment, which was\nitself the basis for the conspiracy, was “inextricably inter-\ntwined” with the conspiracy charge.\n\n   [2] Second, prior act evidence may be admitted without\nregard to Rule 404(b) “when it [is] necessary to do so in order\nto permit the prosecutor to offer a coherent and comprehensi-\nble story regarding the commission of the crime.” DeGeorge,\n380 F.3d at 1220, quoting Vizcarra-Martinez, 66 F.3d at\n1012-13. “A jury is entitled to know the circumstances and\nbackground of a criminal charge.

His defense was that he\nwas tricked into transporting the marijuana by the chief gov-\nernment cooperating witness. This witness testified at length\nabout prior drug runs that Beckman had made on his behalf.\nWe held that the witness’s testimony was “inextricably inter-\ntwined” with the charged offense, because it was “intended to\nestablish [the witness’s] relationship to Beckman [and] to\nshow that the relationship was ongoing . . . .” Id.\n\n   [3] The fact that Curtin was in possession of stories detail-\ning sex with children at the time he went to meet “Christy”\nis insufficient to support the introduction of the stories with-\n\f3680               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nout regard to Rule 404(b). Curtin was charged with traveling\nacross state lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with a\nminor, and with attempting to persuade a minor to engage in\nsex. The possession or content of the stories was not a part of\nthe “transaction” that led to the present charges. Second, the\nadmission of the stories was not required for the prosecution\nto “offer a coherent story.” The prosecution would have had\nno difficulty in presenting all relevant evidence, including the\n“chat” conversations, Curtin’s admission that he was “M-\n42SOCAL,” and Curtin’s behavior at the meeting place, with-\nout the admission of the stories. Thus, the stories were not\n“inextricably intertwined” with the charged crimes.\n\n                              B.\n\n   In the alternative, the government contends that the stories\nare admissible under Rule 404(b) regardless of whether they\nare inextricably intertwined with the crime.

Third, when admitted\nto prove intent, “the prior act must be similar.” Id. Finally,\n“the prior act must be introduced in order to prove a material\nelement of the case.” Id. The main issue here lies in the third\nelement: whether there is similarity between the possession of\nthe stories and the crime with which Curtin is charged.\n\n  Curtin objected to admission of the stories in the district\ncourt, relying on Guam v. Shymanovitz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758521\"><a href=\"/opinion/758521/98-cal-daily-op-serv-6769-98-daily-journal-dar-9403-people-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\nCir. 1998) (as amended). Shymanovitz was a middle-school\nguidance counselor who was charged with sexually and physi-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                         3681\ncally abusing several of the boys under his supervision. Id. at\n1155. Prior to trial, the government sought to introduce two\nmagazine articles from sexually explicit magazines found in\nShymanovitz’s home, arguing that they were relevant to\nestablishing intent. The articles were both presumably fic-\ntional stories. One depicted sex between a father and son,\nwhile the other depicted sex between a priest and a child. The\ncourt deferred ruling on the motion.\n\n   At trial, the court permitted a police officer to testify that\nat Shymanovitz’s house she seized, among other things, con-\ndoms, surgical gloves, children’s underwear, and sexually\nexplicit magazines. The officer testified in great detail, over\ndefense counsel’s objections, about the contents of four of\nthese magazines. She told the jury that the magazines con-\ntained explicit photographs of homosexual sex and described\nthe photographs and the contents of the two articles in detail.\nThe two articles were subsequently entered into evidence. Id.\nat 1155.\n\n   [5] Both Shymanovitz and this appeal address whether the\nreading material at issue was admissible under Rule 404(b).\nWe concluded in Shymanovitz that the magazine articles\nfailed to constitute a Rule 404(b) “bad act.” “[P]ossession of\nlawful reading material is simply not the type of conduct con-\ntemplated by Rule 404(b).” Id. at 1159. Additionally, we held\nthat possession of lawful reading material was not similar to\nactual criminal conduct, thus failing the third criterion of the\nSpillone test. “[T]here is simply no doubt that a wide gulf sep-\narates the act of possessing written descriptions or stories\nabout criminal conduct from the act of committing the\noffenses described.” Id.1\n  1\n   The dissent argues that this case differs from Shymanovitz because the\ncrimes at issue in that case did not involve subjective intent. But even if\nShymanovitz involves slightly different facts, its legal rule does not distin-\nguish between specific intent crimes and other crimes. “Under the govern-\nment’s theory, the case against an accused child molester would be\n\f3682                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   [6] On the issue of similarity, Shymanovitz conforms with\nthe rest of our case law. In Vizcarra-Martinez, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy to possess a chemical with rea-\nson to believe it would be used to make methamphetamine. 66\nF.3d at 1009. The district court admitted evidence that\nVizcarra-Martinez was in possession of a personal-use\namount of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest. We\nreversed. “We simply cannot assume . . . that Vizcarra-\nMartinez’s use of methamphetamine tended to prove that he\nknew that the chemical in his possession would be used in the\nmethamphetamine manufacturing process.” Vizcarra-\nMartinez, 66 F.3d at 1015.

In McCol-\nlum, we allowed admission of a prior conviction for armed robbery to\nnegate the defendant’s defense of acting under hypnosis. The relationship\nbetween the prior crime and the act charged is obviously far closer in\nMcCollum’s case than it is in Curtin’s. Curtin’s case involves otherwise\nlawful reading material that is not similar to the crime with which he is\nbeing charged. Essentially, the government here seeks to introduce posses-\nsion of material that describes one type of criminal conduct, namely incest\nwith minors, to prove intent to commit another type of criminal conduct,\nnamely crossing state borders to have sex with a minor. This is impermis-\nsible under our caselaw.\n   The dissent also argues at length that Curtin’s case is different because\nCurtin was actually in possession of the stories at the time of his arrest.\nHowever, the government never argued relevance based on physical pos-\nsession. In any event, this is a fallacious distinction because the stories\nwere saved as documents to Curtin’s handheld computer. In the absence\nof any evidence to the contrary, we should not infer that Curtin planned\nto “use” the stories or had the stories in mind simply because he was car-\nrying his computer at the time of his arrest.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                 3683\nallowed Rule 404(b) evidence show a much stronger connec-\ntion between the “other act,” which is often a crime in itself,\nand the charged crime. In United States v.

The conviction\ntended to show that Vo was familiar with distribution of ille-\ngal drugs and that his actions in this case were not an accident\nor a mistake.” Id. at 1019.\n\n   [7] Shymanovitz does recognize a narrow exception for\n“modus operandi” evidence: evidence involving acts by the\ndefendant that are “so nearly identical in method as to ear-\nmark the charged offense the handiwork of the accused and\nthat are so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.”\nId. at 1159 n.9 (internal punctuation and citation omitted).\n“[U]se of modus operandi evidence is rare, and the similari-\nties must be specific and detailed and clearly set the particular\noffense apart from the general body of such offenses.” Id.\n\n   [8] The evidence in this case is not sufficiently detailed and\nspecific to fall within the exception. The stories did not\ndescribe specific methods of committing the first offense with\nwhich Curtin was charged: traveling across state borders to\nhave sex with a minor. Rather, the stories mostly involved\nexplicit descriptions of incest. Thus, the stories do not reveal\na relevant modus operandi to commit the charged crime, and\nare inadmissible. The issue is closer with regard to the charge\nof use of an interstate facility to attempt to persuade a minor\nto engage in sex. The government argued that the language in\nthe stories was similar to the language used by Curtin in his\n“chat” conversations. We conclude that Shymanovitz fore-\ncloses our acceptance of the government’s position. The con-\nduct with which Curtin was charged, and the language that\nCurtin used, can “hardly be construed as either distinctive or\nremarkable in the universe of sexual offenses against minors.”\n\f3684                    UNITED STATES v.

The similari-\nties between the stories and Curtin’s conduct were not distinc-\ntive or unusual enough to render the stories admissible as\nmodus operandi evidence.2\n  2\n    Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, we have not “made relevant litera-\nture off limits in the Ninth Circuit as a matter of law.” Nor do we “ham-\nstring[ ] the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Circuit with adults\nwho see children as sexual prey.” As pointed out above, in this case the\nprosecution may rely on Curtin’s presence in a chat room called “ltgirlsex-\nchat,” the “chat” conversations themselves, Curtin’s admission that he was\n“M-42SOCAL,” and Curtin’s behavior at the meeting place.\n   In terms of otherwise lawfully-possessed literature, modus operandi evi-\ndence and inextricably intertwined evidence remain admissible. Here,\nhowever, the jury was asked “to infer from behavior on one occasion\nsomething about the nature of a person and then to infer from that how the\nperson probably would have behaved on another occasion when the only\nconnection between the two occasions is that the [jury] believes that peo-\nple of a certain type would act the same way both times.” 1 Stephen A.\nSaltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual § 404.02[9] (8th ed.\n2002). Without more of a connection between the literature and the\naccused crimes, the literature is no more than character evidence intro-\nduced to show propensity, and highly prejudicial character evidence at\nthat.\n   The dissent argues at length that the evidence was necessary to refute\nCurtin’s testimony and “aggressive defense” of his intent to meet an adult,\nand attempts to distinguish Shymanovitz because Curtin actually testified.\nHowever, the stories were not offered for impeachment, on which we\nexpress no opinion. Nor do we believe that the stories were necessary\ngiven the strength of other evidence introduced by the government. In any\nevent, evidence is not admissible solely because it may be necessary or\nhelpful. Wholly apart from its prejudicial effect, we have held that “[t]he\nmere possession of reading material that describes a particular type of\nactivity makes it neither more nor less likely that a defendant would inten-\ntionally engage in the conduct described and thus fails to meet the test of\n\f                       UNITED STATES v.

In Allen, the\ndefendants were charged with violating federally protected\nrights on the basis of race and religion. We allowed the intro-\nduction of “skinhead and white supremacist evidence,”\nincluding color photographs of the defendant’s tattoos (e.g.,\nswastikas), Nazi-related literature, group photographs includ-\ning some of the defendants (e.g., in “Heil Hitler” poses and\nstanding before a swastika that they later set on fire), and\nother skinhead paraphernalia. Id. at 885-86. We distinguished\nShymanovitz: “Key to our reasoning [in Shymanovitz] was the\nfact that the testimony . . . was not relevant to proving any of\nthe elements of the crime for which the defendant was con-\nvicted . . . .” Id. at 887 n.25. The government thus contends\nthat, when read together, “Shymanovitz and Allen stand for the\nprinciple that relevant literature is admissible to prove intent.”\n\n   [9] However, the government’s comparison to Allen does\nnot save the day. First, many of the items admitted into evi-\ndence in Allen involved more than the possession of reading\nmaterial. The defendants were active participants in “Heil Hit-\nler” poses and had posed with and burned a large swastika.\nSecond, unlike in Shymanovitz, there is no indication that the\nreading material in Allen was fictional. Third, the evidence at\nissue in this case, and in Shymanovitz, was extremely prejudi-\ncial. Finally, it is possible that the evidence in Allen would\nhave been admissible under the “inextricably intertwined”\nexception outlined above. Our holding here is controlled by\nShymanovitz.

CURTIN\nTROTT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   During the 20th Century, the four walls of a family’s home\nprovided substantial protection from marauding sexual preda-\ntors on the prowl for children and unsuspecting minors to\nassault. Locked doors and windows could normally safeguard\na dwelling from invasion, as well as shelter parents’ vulnera-\nble children from harm. Distant parks, playgrounds, malls,\nand sidewalks surrounding school yards were the child\nmolester’s preferred hunting grounds. No longer. Now, the\nInternet is upon us, and it allows cunning sexual vultures\nrepeatedly to enter the bedrooms of immature children where,\nby seductive and calculating means, unwary children are\nenticed to leave the security of their homes and to venture into\nunspeakable dangers. Moreover, the invaders themselves do\nso invisibly, appearing only on a video screen, unseen by the\nunsuspecting adults on site. This case provides an example of\nthis frightful situation which generations not yet familiar with\nthe dark side of the Internet have been slow to recognize.\n\n   With the walls of our homes breached by the Internet, our\nnext best defense is the law. Unfortunately, this case reveals\nthat the laws and the rules of evidence upon which society\nrelies to protect itself from cruel deviancy are now as porous\nas the walls of our homes, allowing lawbreakers to pull the\nwool over the eyes of the jurors delegated to ensure that our\nlaws are faithfully implemented. It seems that the law of rele-\nvancy is now more concerned with protecting a sexual preda-\ntor’s obscene manuals on what to do to children than with\nprotecting the real children upon whom they practice their\nperversions, as this case illustrates.\n\n   Curtin’s explanation to the jury for his Internet behavior\nwith “christy13” and trip to Las Vegas was that he intended\nto act out an incestuous sexual fantasy with her, but that he\nexpected her to be an adult who would pretend to be his inno-\ncent unspoiled daughter. Although he called his sexual fan-\ntasy “daddy daughter,” he denied that the “daughter” would\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                3689\nbe a minor. If worthy of belief, this intent would defeat the\nprosecution’s case, which required proof of an intent to\nengage a minor in unlawful sexual activity. However, Curtin\nhad on his person at the time of his anticipated encounter with\n“christy13” obscene literature tending without ambiguity to\nprove that the object of his incest fantasy was a child, not an\nadult. My respected colleagues conclude that the district court\nerred in admitting this inculpatory literature because — as a\nmatter of law — it was not relevant. I disagree. Therefore, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n   The evidence developed against Kevin Curtin by the Las\nVegas Metropolitan Police Department suggests on its face\nthat he is a dangerous predatory pedophile who uses the Inter-\nnet electronically to enter the homes of his immature juvenile\nfemale victims in order to lure them into danger. Curtin’s\nM.O., or modus operandi, involving calculated “grooming”\nand enticement is well known to the police who work this\ndetail. Here, Curtin contacted his prey through a chat room\ncalled “ltgirlsexchat,” which, according to the evidence, is a\nplace on the Internet where people go to talk sex with little\ngirls. The evidence reveals also that he planned a family cover\nstory for his time with his victim. He, as Uncle Kevin, would\nintroduce her as his “niece.” In addition, he asked her if she\nwas working with the police in order “to get guys who make\nout with 14-year-old girls.” These aspects of the govern-\nment’s evidence would seem to portray the subjective intent\nrequired by the charges filed against him and a keen aware-\nness of the unlawful nature of what he was doing.\n\n  But wait, he protests, what you see and what you read on\nmy exchanges with “christy13” is not what you get. I’m not\nan online predator trolling for naive juveniles, my true intent\n— hard to discern though it may be — is to sexually hook-up\nwith mature females who are hanging out in juvenile chat\nrooms posing as minors. I’m merely a “lonely divorcee [sic]\n\f3690                 UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nlooking for an older woman who may have a place to go,”\nbecause I do not have a place of my own. It’s just a game of\nrole playing. “[N]ormally in this sort of thing it would be a\nfantasy. Sort of like daddy/daughter or along those lines.” My\nreal intent was to hook up with a thirty to forty year-old role\nplaying woman pretending to be 14-year-old who was inter-\nested in actualizing such an incestuous sexual fantasy, cer-\ntainly not a minor. But of course, this is “my first time.” “I\nhaven’t ever kissed anyone but my wife since — in fifteen\nyears.” And, by the way, “no one ever sends a picture of what\nthey actually look like.” Moreover, everything I wrote to\n“christy13” that makes it appear that I understood her to be\na minor? It was just a lie.\n\n  How did I know — unsophisticated though I certainly am\n— that “christy13” was an older woman even though she said\nshe was only fourteen? As I explained to the police:\n\n      Q.1 Now as far as this person, they told you that\n          they were fourteen.\n\n      A.   Right.\n\n      Q.

Both charges required the government to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtin acted with the\nintent to engage a person under the age of eighteen years in\nunlawful sexual behavior. To quote the court in its concluding\ninstructions to the jury:\n\n       In order for the defendant to be found guilty of\n    [§ 2423(b)], the Government must prove each of the\n    following elements, beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n       First, the defendant used a facility or means of\n    interstate commerce.\n\n                              ...\n\n      Second, the defendant knowingly intended to per-\n    suade, induce, entice, or coerce Christy into engag-\n    ing in sexual activity for which he could be\n    prosecuted under the laws of the state of Nevada.\n\n       Third, the defendant believed Christy had not\n    attained the age of 16 years. . . .\n\n       Under the laws of the state of Nevada, it is an\n    offense to commit statutory sexual seduction.\n    Nevada law defines statutory sexual seduction as\n    ordinary sexual intercourse, anal intercourse, cunni-\n    lingus, or fellatio committed by a person 18 years of\n\f3694               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    age or older with a person under the age of 16 years.\n\n\n                             ...\n\n       [D]efendant’s subsequent conduct may be consid-\n    ered by you or the question of the defendant’s intent\n    at the time he communicated on the Internet or trav-\n    eled in interstate commerce.\n\n      [T]he fact that Christy was an undercover agent\n    posing as a 14-year-old girl and that no actual minor\n    child was victimized in this case is not a defense\n    ....\n\n                              II\n\n   Prior to the trial, it became clear that the only disputed\nissue in this case would be Curtin’s subjective intent: did he\nintend to hook up with a 30 to 40 year-old woman who liked\nto pretend she was a child having incestuous sex with her\ndaddy, or with a pubescent minor? Curtin went so far as to\nfile a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the\n“undisputed and uncontested facts” made it patently obvious\nthat the government had “no credible evidence to suggest that\n[Curtin’s] subjective intentions were to travel to Las Vegas to\nhave sex with a minor”:\n\n       Curtin did not possess an intent to have sex with\n    a 14 year old girl when he got into his car and drove\n    to Las Vegas; the overwhelming evidence points the\n    other way. His voluntary statement, given minutes\n    after he was stopped by the police, shows this. He\n    thought it was all too easy, that no 14 year old was\n    going to just hop into bed with a 42 year old after\n    two chat sessions, especially a pretty girl. As he said\n    in his statement, her Mary Poppins naivety was\n    beyond any level of credence. It was so easy and\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3695\n    uncredible that he even wondered if it could have\n    been police. In any event, he was not concerned,\n    because when he left California to go to Las Vegas,\n    he was going to find work, and at the time he left\n    California to travel to Nevada, he had no intentions\n    of having relations with a minor, as irrebuttably\n    shown by the fact that he did not so much as talk to\n    the person. This meeting was the litmus test of his\n    true intentions in this nebulous and hazy situation.\n    He clearly and without question passed this test.\n    When he calmly and simply walked away, the police\n    wanted to know why. He told them. He clearly and\n    unequivocally explained that he did not talk to this\n    person because he stopped by the Suncoast with the\n    hope and intentions of meeting an older woman.\n    HAD HE BEEN THERE TO MEET A MINOR, AS\n    IS THE CRUX OF THIS INDICTMENT, THEN HE\n    WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AT\n    THAT POINT.\n\n    . . . Curtin’s intentions were to try to meet a 30-40\n    year old woman who had been fantasizing. It is not\n    even close. . . .\n\n       As the defendant’s intent was not to have sex with\n    a minor, nor to entice a minor, nor to travel interstate\n    to have sex with a minor, . . . this case must be dis-\n    missed. In the instant case, the defendant did not\n    think he was dealing with a minor. The police knew\n    there [was] not a minor and in fact there was not a\n    minor.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n   Thus, the line was drawn by Curtin. His defense was a mat-\nter of record. The trial would be about intent and what was in\nCurtin’s mind during his undisputed conduct with “chris-\nty13.” This was the issue, the only issue: subjective inten-\n\f3696               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\ntions. As counsel for Curtin said in his opening statement,\n“[Curtin] thought it was someone his age that he was dealing\nwith and that they would role play in a situation much like a\ndad and a daughter.” Counsel concluded on this what-was-in-\nCurtin’s-mind theme by telling the jury that “this is the type\nof crime that is a situation where you have to look at the\nthoughts.” To prevail, of course, Curtin would not be called\nupon to satisfy the jury that his defense was true. All he had\nto do is raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a single juror.\n\n                              III\n\n   Confronted with Curtin’s aggressive fantasy intent defense\n— to sexually play daddy/daughter incest, not with a minor\nbut with an adult — and facing the traditional daunting bur-\nden of proof, the government offered stories contained on\nCurtin’s PDA, or “personal digital assistant.” These stories\nwere offered pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) for two equally\nappropriate purposes: (1) to prove that Curtin harbored the\nsubjective intent made unlawful by law, and (2) to rebut Cur-\ntin’s defense that the daughter in his daddy/daughter sexual\nfantasy was an adult pretending to be a child. From the begin-\nning, the government was put on notice by the court that in\norder for the stories to be properly admitted, each story would\nhave to comport to the admissibility conditions of Fed. R.\nEvid. 401 and 404(b) as well as the probative versus prejudice\nlimitations found in Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n   What was the content of the material on Curtin’s PDA? It\nconsisted of approximately 140 stories containing graphic\ndescriptions of sexual acts with minors. Not a single story on\nCurtin’s PDA was about daddy/daughter role playing with\nadults. The stories admitted in evidence are built around dad-\ndies having sexual relations with child daughters, not adults,\nand the content of the stories parallel Curtin’s email\nexchanges with his target.

As Judge Reinhardt explained,\n\n    [T]he charges based on sexual contact require the\n    government to prove that any touching on Shy-\n    manovitz’ part was intentional, and that a reasonable\n    person could construe the touching to be for a sexual\n    purpose.\n\n       Whether Shymanovitz’s actual purpose in touch-\n    ing the alleged victims was sexual arousal or gratifi-\n    cation, however, or whether he was actually aroused\n    or gratified by the touching is immaterial to the\n    offenses, including the charges based on improper\n    sexual contact. Instead, the question in the latter cat-\n    egory of cases is whether a reasonable person could\n    construe the touching to be for such a purpose. The\n    test, under the sexual contact statute, is an objective\n    not a subjective one. In short, it is the character of\n    the touching that is at issue, not the purpose of the\n    intentional toucher. Accordingly, the government’s\n    current and sole justification for admitting the chal-\n    lenged evidence goes, once again, to the proof of an\n    element immaterial to the offense.\n\nId. at 1158 (emphasis added).\n\n   Second, the defense in Shymanovitz was not that the alleged\ntouching and penetration were not accompanied by any requi-\nsite state of mind, but that the acts charged as crimes never\nhappened. “His counsel argued that the boys and some of the\nparents had concocted the allegations against him . . . .” Id.\nat 1154. Moreover, Shymanovitz\n\n    . . . never testified at trial that he believed sexual\n    conduct with minors to be legal. Nor was there testi-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v.

Moreover,\n      neither knowledge of the illegality of the conduct of\n      which he was accused nor knowledge of the nature\n      of the specific acts identified by the prosecutor con-\n      stituted an element of the offense. More important,\n      such knowledge would in no way tend to prove his\n      guilt on any of the charges brought against him.\n      Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that the govern-\n      ment introduced the magazines to address the issues\n      it argued they were relevant to during the prosecu-\n      tor’s closing arguments.\n\nId. at 1156.\n\n  In contrast, Curtin did testify at the trial, tendering an ener-\ngetic defense that his intent was to couple with an adult\nfemale, not a juvenile. Shymanovitz’s defense had nothing to\ndo with intent or state of mind.\n\n  Third, the stories were in Curtin’s possession when he\nentered the casino in order to meet his target. Not so in Shy-\nmanovitz.\n\n   Thus, given that the evidence under scrutiny in Shy-\nmanovitz was (1) not probative of any issue in the case, and\n(2) not relevant to Shymanovitz’s factual defense, it was\nappropriate for the panel to conclude as a matter of law that\nit was not properly received pursuant to Rule 401 or 404(b).\nThe evidence simply failed Rule 401’s definition of relevancy\nand, therefore, also failed Rule 404(b). The evidence did not\nilluminate “a fact of consequence to the determination of the\naction,” and was nothing more than an attempt to slime the\ndefendant.

This over-generalization best illustrates the majorities failure\nto appreciate the fact that the “offense described” in Shymanovitz was not\na specific intent crime. Thus, because specific intent was not an issue,\nreading material admitted to show intent would never be relevant.

Gillespie is\n    inapposite since the alleged homosexual conduct did\n    not tend to establish a violation of the statutes in\n    issue. Here, the skinhead evidence tended to estab-\n    lish Skillman’s racial animus and that he might act\n    on his beliefs.

In Shymanovitz, we concluded that the district\n    court abused its discretion by allowing the govern-\n    ment to introduce testimony about the contents of\n    magazines found at the defendant’s apartment,\n    including photographs of men masturbating, ejacu-\n    lating, using sex toys, and engaging in oral and anal\n    sex (among other things), to prove the defendant’s\n    intent in committing sexual acts with minors. 157\n    F.3d at 1155. Key to our reasoning was the fact that\n    the testimony was highly prejudicial and was not rel-\n    evant to proving any of the elements of the crime for\n    which the defendant was convicted (unlawful sexual\n    activity with minors). Id. at 1157-60. In contrast, the\n    skinhead and white supremacy evidence here was\n    relevant to proving the element of intent in both\n    §§ 241 and 245(b)(2)(B).

They\npoint out (1) that “the evidence in Allen involved more than\nthe possession of reading material,” including photographs\nshowing some of the defendants as active participants in “Heil\nHitler” poses, (2) that the Nazi literature in Allen may not\nhave been “fictional,” and (3) that “the evidence in this case,\nand in Shymanovitz was extremely prejudicial,” apparently as\nopposed to the evidence in Allen.\n\f                      UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3713\n   These minor differences are utterly insufficient to render\nAllen inapposite. First, that Allen involved evidence in addi-\ntion to reading material is inconsequential, as each “offer of\nevidence is to be evaluated independently under the Federal\nRules of Evidence and the relevant case law.” United States\nv.

Sec-\nond, I fail to see any material difference between real stories\nof sexual perversion and fictional stories of the same ilk.

Moreover, whether a story’s plot is fictional is not\nmaterial to the question of whether the content of that story\nrelates to and is similar to the conduct of the alleged criminal\n— thereby satisfying the requirements of Rules 401 and\n404(b). Third, the majority’s assertion that “the evidence at\nissue in this case and in Shymanovitz [as opposed to Allen]\nwas extremely prejudicial,” and thus distinguishable, fails to\nappreciate how the rules of evidence operate. Prejudice is a\nseparate basis for exclusion that requires an independent anal-\nysis under Fed. R. Evid. 403 after it is determined that an\noffer of evidence is relevant and admissible. See Weisgram v.\nMarley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118337\"><a href=\"/opinion/118337/weisgram-v-marley-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 n.9 (2000). As admitted by my\ncolleges, the prejudice argument was waived by Curtin and is\nnot an issue before us.7\n\n   Ultimately, the majority’s reasons for distinguishing Allen\nare inadequate, especially when viewed in the light of the “lit-\nerary” evidence approved in Skillman on which Allen relied.\nThe evidence in Skillman included a “poem containing racial\nepithets” on the back of a business card in Skillman’s pocket.\nWe did not segregate out of our holding in Allen, the Nazi lit-\nerature in his possession. Although literature per se has no\nspecial protection in this context as evidence — under the\n  7\n   The majority’s implication that possession of Nazi and white suprem-\nacy skinhead literature is not “extremely prejudicial” is hard to compre-\nhend as the movement is directly associated with one of the most well-\nknown tragedies of humankind.\n\f3714                 UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nFirst Amendment or otherwise — my colleagues have effec-\ntively made relevant literature categorically off-limits as a\nsource of evidence as to a person’s subjective intent.\n\n   One way to test the relevancy of Curtin’s recent PDA\ndownloads (and to illustrate the difference between the setting\nhere and the circumstances in Shymanovitz) is to envision\nwhat we would certainly hold if Curtin’s PDA stories8 were\nof role playing daddy/daughter incest with female adults —\nnot minors — and the district court had excluded the stories\nas “irrelevant.” Curtin would have attempted to admit the sto-\nries into evidence to demonstrate that he intended to meet an\nadult. Without a doubt, a convicted Curtin would assert on\nappeal that the content of the stories shed light on his subjec-\ntive intent and — as counsel put it to the jurors — his\n“thoughts” as he communicated with “christy13,” and as he\ntraveled interstate with the stories in his pocket to meet her;\nand there is no doubt that we would agree. Why? Because the\nstories would have a “tendency to make the existence of any\nfact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence.” Fed. R. Evid. 401. Such stories would corroborate\nhis claim of adult incest fantasy. How else could he do that\nwithout evidence of “other acts,” as they are called? Con-\nversely, the absence of such adult stories coupled with the\npresence of stories wherein children are the objects of the sex-\nual appetites of adults is equally relevant to prove the govern-\nment’s case and to confront Curtin’s defense. Relevancy boils\ndown to what our human experiences tell us, sometimes cal-\nled common sense.\n\n  As explained in “McCormick on Evidence,” Third Edition,\nHornbook Series, Lawyers Edition,\n  8\n   Or, maybe the testimony of a woman with whom he had played daddy/\ndaughter.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v.

In some instances, scientific\n    research may show that the fact in issue is more\n    likely to be true (or false) when such evidence is\n    present than when it is not.

In United States v. Poehlman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769300\"><a href=\"/opinion/769300/united-states-v-mark-douglas-poehlman/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(9th Cir. 2000), for example, Poehlman, a cross-dresser, was\ncharged with willingly crossing state lines to have sex with\nminors, but it appeared that when first contacted by the gov-\nernment, he was looking for adults with whom to engage in\nhis “proclivities,” not children. However, the undercover offi-\ncer with whom he was corresponding deftly turned Poehl-\nman’s prurient interest to children, and he responded\naccordingly. In court, charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C.\nSection 2423(b), Poehlman relied on his initial interest in\nadults to demonstrate a lack of predisposition to involve\nminors in his sexual plans, arguing that the government took\nadvantage of that lawful interest and unlawfully used it to\nsteer him to children. In concluding that he had indeed been\nentrapped, we said, “The government thus played on Poehl-\nman’s obvious need for an adult relationship, for acceptance\nof his sexual proclivities and for a family, to draw him even\ndeeper into a sexual fantasy world involving these imaginary\ngirls.” Id. at 702.\n\n   To what evidence did we look to verify a factually fatal\nlack of predisposition on Poehlman’s part to target minors?\n\f3716               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nThe same kind of material we now place “off limits” as a mat-\nter of law:\n\n    By analogy, the fact that Poehlman willingly crossed\n    state lines to have sex with minors after his pro-\n    longed and steamy correspondence with Sharon can-\n    not, alone, support a finding of predisposition. It is\n    possible, after all, that it was the government’s\n    inducement that brought Poehlman to the point\n    where he became willing to break the law. As in\n    Jacobson, we must consider what evidence there is\n    as to Poehlman’s state of mind prior to his contact\n    with Sharon.\n\n    On this score, the record is sparse indeed; it is easier\n    to say what the record does not confirm than what\n    it does. The government produced no e-mails or chat\n    room postings where Poehlman expressed an interest\n    in sex with children, or even the view that sex with\n    children should be legalized. Nor did the government\n    produce any notes, tapes, magazines, photographs,\n    letters or similar items which disclosed an interest in\n    sex with children, despite a thorough search of Poe-\n    hlman’s home. There was no testimony from the\n    playmates of Poehlman’s children, his ex-wife or\n    anyone else indicating that Poehlman had behaved\n    inappropriately toward children or otherwise mani-\n    fested a sexual interest in them.\n\nUnited States v. Poehlman, 217 F.3d at 703-704 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n  Thus, the absence in context, and by implication the pres-\nence of child-oriented materials becomes acutely relevant to\na defendant’s material state of mind “prior to his contact”\nwith the object of his sexual attention, and, as Poehlman\nreveals, such evidence is not only admissible, but critical.

And, as in Viefhaus, the\n    only way the jury could properly determine the mes-\n    sage conveyed by Mr. Magleby’s cross-burning and\n    the foreseeable effect it would have on the Henrys\n    was to examine the circumstances in which the\n    cross-burning was conceived, planned, and executed.\n    We fine that the district court did not abuse its dis-\n    cretion in admitting the song lyrics into evidence.\n\nId. at 1319 (emphasis added). I note that part of the evidence\nused to show Magleby’s subjective intent was the circum-\nstance that he had watched a movie, “Mississippi Burning,”\nprior to the cross-burning. Id. at 1313.\n\n   Indeed, in similar contexts we have routinely held that cir-\ncumstances surrounding an alleged crime become more rele-\nvant when the defendant makes his intent a disputed issue.\nTake the case of Larry McCollum. McCollum claimed that\nalthough he entered a bank and gave an employee a note\n\f3720               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\ndemanding $100,000 he had “no criminal intent” to commit\nrobbery because he was acting involuntarily under the influ-\nence of hypnosis. The district court admitted a prior convic-\ntion for armed robbery to counter his defense of a lack of\nintent. We affirmed, holding as follows:\n\n    In this case, . . . the defense conceded that McCol-\n    lum performed all acts charged by the prosecution.\n    The key issue, indeed the only disputed issue, was\n    whether McCollum acted with intent to rob the bank.\n    Where the mental state to be inferred from undis-\n    puted overt acts of a defendant is the crucial issue,\n    evidence of past criminal acts has generally been\n    found insufficiently prejudicial to warrant exclusion.\n\nUnited States v.

Obscenity,\nwhich is described as a work which appeals to the prurient\ninterest and which describes sexual conduct in a patently\noffensive way, and which when judged by contemporary\ncommunity standards lacks serious literacy, artistic, political,\nor scientific value, is not protected by the First Amendment.\nMiller v.

I will leave\nit to the reader to decide whether “Love for the World” and\n“Restrictions” are otherwise lawful reading material. How-\never, even if they were to be seen as lawful, this fact in no\nway renders them outside the scope of Rule 404(b). Rule\n404(b) on its face covers “other crimes, wrongs, or acts.” All\nrelevant extrinsic acts are presumptively admissible, subject\nto Rule 403.

CURTIN\n                               V\n\n  My colleagues have concluded that the district court\n“abused” its discretion in admitting this evidence. Far from it.\nIn fact, the district court’s conduct is a model of appropriate\njudicial decision making, as a close reading of the record\nreveals.\n\n   Because my colleagues’ conclusion that the district court\nabused its discretion is inconsistent with the record, I repro-\nduce relevant parts of it in (excruciating) detail. The record\nspeaks for itself better than characterization and adjectives. In\nsummary, what we see is a court taking great care to follow\nthe law and to protect the rights of the defendant. The court:\n\n    (1)   considered Shymanovitz and Allen,\n\n    (2)   accepted our legal guidance in Allen, and deter-\n          mined that Shymanovitz was distinguishable,\n\n    (3)   required that the five stories admitted be factu-\n          ally similar to the facts of the defendants\n          approach to and enticement of “christy13,”\n          consistent with relevant case law interpreting\n          Rule 404(b).\n\n    (4)   blocked the government from introducing\n          approximately 135 stories, because they were\n          redundant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudi-\n          cial,\n\n    (5)   acceded to the defense’s request not to high-\n          light particularly damaging parts of the stories,\n\n    (6)   ruled after careful consideration — and as\n          required by Fed. R. Evid. 403 — that the pro-\n          bative value of these stories was not under-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3725\n          mined by their potentially unduly prejudicial\n          effect, and\n\n    (7)   gave multiple cautionary instructions to the\n          jury as required by Fed. R. Evid. 105 as to what\n          the stories were admissible to prove, including\n          what purposes for which the jury could not\n          consider them.\n\nI elaborate.\n\n   To begin with, the district court was acutely aware of the\nShymanovitz case. Long before the trial, the defense brought\nit to the court’s attention in a “motion in limine to exclude,”\na motion that was not successful. [C.R. 22] The government\nresponded in writing on July 8, 2003:\n\n    Defendant relies on Guam v. Shymanovitz for the\n    contention that “mere possession of fictional reading\n    material that describes a particular type of activity\n    [would] not make it more or less likely that a defen-\n    dant would intentionally engage in the conduct\n    described.” Defense Motion in Limine, p.4, lines 25-\n    27 (June 30, 2004). However, Shymanovitz can be\n    distinguished from the present case based on the\n    Ninth Circuit’s statutory interpretation and the dif-\n    ferences between the relevant statute in Shymanovitz\n    and the statutes the Defendant is accused of violat-\n    ing. [C.R. 34].\n\n   To demonstrate the asserted distinction, the government\nrelied on Allen:\n\n    [T]he Ninth Circuit has expanded further that\n    “[key]” to our reasoning [in Shymanovitz] was the\n    fact that the testimony was not relevant to proving\n    any of the elements of the crime for which the defen-\n    dant was convicted.” United States v.

By the above rea-\n    soning of the Ninth Circuit, this court clearly may\n    admit literature in the possession of the defendant for\n    the purpose of proving an element of the crime. It\n    can only be presumed that the more fundamental the\n    element is to the crime charged, the more the balance\n    weighs in favor of admission because [Fed. R. Evid.]\n    404(b) is a “rule of inclusion.” United States v.\n    Ayers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1468</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1472 (9th Cir. 1992). [C.R.\n    34]\n\n   Next, we go to Day Two of the trial. After testimony on\nDay One from the detective who corresponded as “christy13”\nwith the defendant and who questioned him after his arrest,\nthe government called as a witness a computer expert who\nworked for the FBI and who had recovered the disputed sto-\nries from Curtin’s PDA. When the government then attempted\nto offer the entirety of one of these stories in evidence, the\ndistrict court intervened, and the following occurred outside\nthe presence of the jury:\n\n    MS. KOPPE: That [story] came off of the Defen-\n    dant’s PDA?\n\n    WITNESS: Yes, off the — this is another one of the\n    144 stories that were — were in that Documents to\n    Go\n\n                             ...\n\n    MS. KOPPE: What is the title of that story, if you\n    could look on the second page?\n\n    WITNESS: Melanie’s Busy Day (phonetic).\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Your Honor, we would move to admit\n    that story for modus operandi, intent, preparation,\n    and knowledge.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3727\nMR. POTTER [counsel for the defendant]: Your\nHonor, I would object and I would renew the same\nmotion [to exclude the stories] that — we’re talking\nabout —\n\nTHE COURT: I do have a problem. I’m about ready\nto grant the objection, Counsel. If you’d come over\nto the sidebar just a moment.\n\n(Sidebar at 03:26:24 p.m.)\n\nTHE COURT: I had understood [from pretrial dis-\ncussions] what you were going to do is, in order to\nfacilitate the foundation, was to introduce particular\nparts.\n\nI have no problem with your asking him generally\nwhat is the story about, is it a story about sex\nbetween an adult and a minor.\n\nI had thought you were going to ask specific ques-\ntions about specific parts of it that tended to show,\nassuming that the debtor (sic) read it, and intent that\nwould correspond to your alleged intent for him or\nhis modus operandi, his knowledge.\n\nThat’s what I thought you were going to do.\n\nMS. KOPPE: That —\n\nTHE COURT: Because, otherwise, if all you’re\ndoing is offering these generally and you’re just stat-\ning the purpose, we don’t have sufficient foundation.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Well, your Honor, that is what we’re\ngoing to do. The problem is we need to get them\nthrough this witness because he’s the one who did\nthe examination of the PDA.\n\f3728               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    We’re going to use another witness to testify to them\n    because he scanned them and someone else —\n\n    THE COURT: All right. Then all you need to ask\n    this witness is, are they on the PDA, and what\n    you’ve already asked, do they have to be opened,\n    unzipped —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Right.\n\n    THE COURT: — before they’re transferred.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: But I was just admitting them through\n    him because he’s the one who found them. That’s —\n\n    THE COURT: Well, then I have a problem because\n    you have not done sufficient foundation. I think\n    you’ve done enough with this witness (indiscernible)\n    to tie it into intent and knowledge, method, prepara-\n    tion.\n\n    You need to have a witness on the stand who you go\n    through with, here is the section that relates to intent;\n    here’s something that shows common language with\n    the e-mails; here’s something that shows method\n    that’s actually present —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Right.\n\n    THE COURT: — allegedly in this case. That’s\n    required for the foundation.\n\n    I think it would only be appropriate then to admit the\n    document. I mean, you can admit it before, subject\n    to showing that foundation and then proceed to —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Okay.\n\f              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3729\nTHE COURT: — point out those particular areas.\n\nMS. KOPPE: I can move for the conditional admis-\nsion of them once he identifies them, if that’s —\n\nTHE COURT: Subject to further foundation.\n\nMS. STANISH [counsel for the government]: And to\nexpedite it, perhaps just introduce them as a bulk\nexhibit. These all came off the PDA (indiscernible)\n—\n\nMS. KOPPE: Establishing —\n\nTHE COURT: Subject to establishing the foundation\nthat I require.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Right.\n\nMR. POTTER: Well, my gut is the exhibit coming\nin, it’s — he’s testifying as to what his belief is.\n\nThe entire exhibit doesn’t need to come in because\nthe very exhibit doesn’t show what we talked about.\nThese stories are not even dealing with the same act.\n\nI mean, these are prepubescent-type stories, at least\nsome of them are.\n\nTHE COURT: Yeah.\n\nMR. POTTER: And that’s completely (indiscernible)\n—\n\nTHE COURT: I think I’d have to overrule that if,\nand only if, you can show — for example, if you\nshow here’s common language to what he used in\nhis e-mail.\n\f3730               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    Or if you can show, for example, that here is com-\n    mon method. This is — here’s a story that describes\n    how you cultivate, and that’s just exactly how he did\n    it here.\n\n    Then you’ve established the foundation, in which\n    case I think it’s appropriate, subject to the limiting\n    instruction, to have the story admitted.\n\n    MR. POTTER: The only thing I would point out is\n    that in, like, sexual assault cases where — or, sexual\n    abuse type cases, when they bring in the prior bad\n    acts — and what the courts have looked at is the\n    same type of abuse and the same kind of factors, if\n    it’s age or if it’s —\n\n    THE COURT: Right.\n\n    MR. POTTER: — convenience, meaning opportu-\n    nity. We don’t have that here. (Indiscernible). These\n    stories are completely different, your Honor.\n\n    THE COURT: They are. And, of course, either on\n    voir dire or out of the presence of the jury you can\n    point that out and I can rule.\n\n    In spite of what’s read outside the presence of the\n    jury, there’s insufficient foundation for that particu-\n    lar story, you point that out [sic] them.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Well, your Honor, Counsel, first of all,\n    argued in his opening that this is all about fantasy\n    and these are all about the defendant’s fantasies.\n\n    THE COURT: I understand. I understand.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: And this shows what his fantasies are\n    and this shows his intent. Counsel argued he never\n    had the intent to have sex with a child.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3731\nThis goes to show that he has intent. They show —\ncertain [sic] of the stories show other things as well.\nBut —\n\nTHE COURT: I’m inclined to agree with you that\none or a few or a general testimony about, generally,\nthat they’re — we don’t know this yet, but generally\nthere are a hundred-and-some-odd stories and they\nall deal with — none of them deal with sex between\ntwo adults.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Right. I was getting into that actually.\n\nTHE COURT: They all deal with — I have no prob-\nlem with your asking that kind of — this isn’t the\nright witness to ask it.\n\nMS. STANISH: Your Honor, may I make a sugges-\ntion that hopefully can expedite and clarify this with-\nout posing a problem for the jury?\n\nThe documents were located on the PDA obviously\nin his possession. The documents speak for them-\nselves.\n\nIt seems to me, your Honor, that perhaps a way to\nresolve this is to have a preliminary determination by\nyour Honor with respect to each of these documents.\n\nThat would be a preliminary legal determination as\nto whether your Honor is satisfied that the contents\nsatisfies the 404(b).\n\nTHE COURT: I don’t care whether you do it out —\nI would just assume that you would do it outside the\npresence of the jury. That’s fine. Or you can do it in\nthe presence of the jury, but, again, you must tie\neach one in.\n\f3732               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    I’m going to let you ask, generally, the question even\n    without admitting them, do all of these stories relate\n    to sex between an adult and a minor. I’ll let you ask\n    that question.\n\n    But if you want the story in, you must ask with\n    respect to that story, regarding those particular\n    parts that deal with intent, method —\n\n    MS. STANISH: Well, your Honor, can I suggest this\n    then? It’s my understanding — and I’ve read these\n    stories — each story involves sex with a minor.\n\n    THE COURT: You can ask that question.\n\n    MS. STANISH: And that being said, your Honor,\n    each — then each story is, in fact, offered for the\n    purpose of establishing intent.\n\n    THE COURT: No, then I think the objective is good.\n    It’s prejudicial. It goes — I mean, let’s say on his\n    PDA he has 100 and over on his general computer\n    he has 500 stories that just deal with sex between\n    adults.\n\n    Or let’s say there are other stories there that deal\n    with fantasizing sex between two adults, one of them\n    role-playing a minor. You could just as well take the\n    inference he just likes to read sex stories, that’s all.\n\n    It’s only because you can tie it into a particular\n    intent, otherwise I’m not going to let him read the\n    story. It’s prejudicial. It’s inflammatory.\n\n    MS. STANISH: Well, I understand what you’re say-\n    ing. That would be more of a 404(3) [sic] ruling, as\n    I understand it, as to prejudice.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3733\nBut just so I’m clear and that we know what direc-\ntion to go, your Honor, the intent that’s involved in\nthis particular offense is to establish, of course, that\nhe crossed the state lines in order to have intent [sic]\nwith a minor.\n\nTHE COURT: I understand clearly, and I think I’ve\ngiven you my ruling.\n\nIf what you’re doing is just saying here’s some PDA\nstories and it shows that they were between adult\nand minors, that to admit them, the whole bulk of\nthem, the prejudice outweighs the relevant portion;\nthat is, it relates to his intent.\n\nBut if you want to ask, generally, before they’re\nadmitted, do they all pertain to that kind of sex\n(indiscernible) question.\n\nAnd if you want to admit any one of them particu-\nlarly so that the jury has the right to read the entire\ndarned story, you’ve got to tie it in, portions of it, to\nthe particular four objectives you’ve told me it’s\noffered for. Okay?\n\nMS. STANISH: Okay.\n\nTHE COURT: And you can either do that with this\nwitness or a subsequent, to reach those particular\nportions that tie it in first before I admit the entire\nstory.\n\nMS. STANISH: And do you have a preference, your\nHonor, whether we do this in front of the jury or —\n\nTHE COURT: It’s okay with me. In other words,\nmaybe you haven’t done the homework yet to even\ndo that. You just wanted them in, generally.\n\f3734              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: No, we have looked through them and,\n    you know, we picked the 21 stories —\n\n    THE COURT: Right.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: — that were —\n\n    THE COURT: Hopefully because they related to one\n    of those four objectives.\n\n    MS. STANISH: Right. And intent is, of course, at\n    least in my view, the predominant purpose for which\n    these are admissible. And I think I understand your\n    Honor now to say that these do, in fact, relate to\n    intent.\n\n    Your bigger concern is one of prejudice; that we’re\n    not bringing in the 156, but we can bring in a sam-\n    pling of the stories that just deal with the intent\n    issue.\n\n    THE COURT: So what you’re telling me is there\n    isn’t anything in these stories that relate to method\n    or any common language to (indiscernible) —\n\n    MS. STANISH: No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying\n    all of them do have in common the intent issue.\n\n    And honestly, Ms. Koppe prepared this part of the\n    case more than I did. They all, though, deal with\n    intent. Others have other purposes for which they\n    could be offered.\n\n    I’m just trying to come up with a solution —\n\n    THE COURT: Well, then you can ask the witness\n    with respect to this story. Hopefully it’s got some-\n\f                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3735\nthing else to do with knowledge; here’s how you cul-\ntivate a young person, or method.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Or knowledge (indiscernible).\n\nTHE COURT: But assuming it doesn’t and all\nyou’re offering it for is intent, you’ll tell me that. But\nhopefully you’ll have a witness that says this talks\nabout sex with a minor.\n\nYou’ll also tell me that there is a witness that will\ntell us that’s what all these stories relate to, including\nthe ones we’re not admitting here. So that otherwise\n(indiscernible) the same time, having the stuff, read-\ning the stuff.\n\nMS. STANISH: I agree, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: So —\n\nMS. STANISH: But 404(b), of course, doesn’t\nrequire that.\n\nAnother solution I might suggest, just to make this\ngo smooth, really, is I’ve seen cases, for instance,\nwhere there’s possession or a number of photographs\nof defendant’s genitalia, for instance.\n\nAnd we’re allowed to bring it in because it does\nrelate to the issue of eliciting and inducing the\nminor.\n\nTHE COURT: Right.\n\nMS. STANISH: But because there’s so many — the\n404(3) [sic] concerns —\n\nTHE COURT: You do a couple.\n\f3736              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. STANISH: — then we just put in a few. Would\n    your Honor be satisfied if we put in just a fewer\n    number? I understand we could —\n\n    THE COURT: No, I didn’t even discuss that.\n\n    MS. STANISH: Okay. I wasn’t sure —\n\n    THE COURT: I have a problem with all of them.\n\n    MS. STANISH: I was trying to — pardon me?\n\n    THE COURT: I don’t have a problem with all of\n    them as long as you do what I ask you to do.\n\n    Ms. STANISH: Yes, sir. All right.\n\n                            ...\n\n    MS. STANISH: After consulting with Mr. Potter, I\n    think the parties agree that this would be best done\n    as a preliminary legal determination as to each one.\n    We don’t want to taint the jury at this point.\n\n                            ...\n\n    THE COURT: Thank you.\n\n    (Jury out at 03:43:13 p.m.)\n\n                            ...\n\n    THE WITNESS: These — these — these exhibits\n    are —\n\n    THE COURT: You can leave those there and you\n    retrieve your notes.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3737\n                         ...\n\nTHE COURT: Thank you. Now, for the record,\nwe’re going to take up with respect to each of these\nstories.\n\nIf you’ve marked sections that relate to any one of\nthose four objectives for which you’re offering it,\noutside the presence of the jury, as foundation for its\nproffer.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, we would state, initially,\nthat each story does show intent to engage in sex\nwith children.\n\nTHE COURT: Because, generally, it’s a story of sex\nbetween an adult and child.\n\nMS. KOPPE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. You’ll tell me if any one of\nthem do [sic] not involve actual description of sex\nbut, rather, is simply method, for example, of culti-\nvating a child rather than actual description of sex\nbetween adult and child.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, the story that was already\nadmitted and testified about, My Little Sister, con-\ntains language about a nine year old engaging in sex\nand about the sex hurting at first but the nine —\n\nTHE COURT: With a brother, correct?\n\nMS. KOPPE: I’m sorry?\n\nTHE COURT: Just be a little more complete with\nme, please. Sex between a nine-year-old girl and her\nbrother.\n\f3738                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: Yes.\n\n                               ...\n\n    THE COURT: Go ahead. I’m sorry. The fact that it\n    did not hurt.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: The fact that it hurt at first. She was\n    told that it will stop hurting and that it will feel a lot\n    better. And that she then says it’s okay, it’s starting\n    to feel good.\n\n    That’s similar to language the defendant used when\n    he told Christy that the sex would — he would take\n    it slowly and that it would feel really good.\n\n    The next story, which is Love For The World —\n\n    MR. POTTER: Your Honor, are we going to go\n    through them one at a time or —\n\n    THE COURT: We’re going to go through them one\n    at a time.\n\n    It might be helpful, too, if you had just told us on\n    which page — if you have marked — I’m assuming\n    we have the same format even though — well, they\n    do have page numbers, even though they don’t occur\n    between the pages — there between the various\n    items.\n\n    Did you intend to have us — to relate to us which\n    items — for example, are you going to have a wit-\n    ness read particular parts, leaving the entire exhibit\n    for the jury?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: I think that they do have other things\n    in them.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3739\n                         ...\n\nTHE COURT: Just go ahead and tell us which parts\nyou have marked that relay the particular content\nthat you’ve told us about.\n\nMS. KOPPE: I could have a witness read them. But\nthe content that I was speaking about started at the\nbottom of the page that’s marked 4. It’s marked 4\ntowards the top, and it goes through the part that’s\nmarked 5. The story I don’t see what —\n\nTHE COURT: So, page 4. Uh-huh. Okay. I’ve\nmarked that on my copy.\n\nThat way Mr. Potter, over the evening, of course,\ncan review them to see if, in fact, they support the\nfoundational purpose for which you’re offering it.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, if we can come back to\nthe second story. I’m going to need to look through\nthat myself.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay.\n\nMS. STANISH: (Indiscernible) expedite it.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Your Honor, Ms. Stanish has just sug-\ngested, this would probably expedite it, if first thing\nin the morning we provide both your Honor and\ndefense counsel with the highlighted portions of\nthese stories.\n\nTHE COURT: You don’t have that here?\n\nMS. KOPPE: I do have highlighted portions, but I\ndon’t have copies that are highlighted for both your\nHonor and for counsel.\n\f3740              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n                            ...\n\n    THE COURT: Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter, or do\n    you need a little time to look at them?\n\n    MR. POTTER: I probably need to look at them, but\n    I don’t know if —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: I can keep going through it.\n\n    MR. POTTER: Do you have a public copier, by\n    chance?\n\n    THE COURT: We do have a copy machine, of\n    course. The problem is whether or not the highlight-\n    ing would show through on a copy, I suppose. What\n    color is the highlighting?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Blue.\n\n    THE COURT: Blue. Would that show up on a cop-\n    ier? It does. Then, of course, we can take them and\n    provide you a xerox copy of each of these over the\n    evening recess.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: That’s fine. Either way.\n\n    MR. POTTER: All right.\n\n                            ...\n\n    THE COURT: — and just as you’ve been doing,\n    identify the purpose and, with respect to foundation,\n    without telling us particular paragraphs, which you\n    will give us by way of the copy we’ll provide\n    tonight.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Okay.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                      3741\nTHE COURT: If you’ll just tell me the foundational\npurpose and what general parts of the story, just as\nyou did with the first story; that is, did not hurt, felt\ngood, et cetera.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Okay. Your Honor, skipping the sec-\nond story for the moment, the story Melanie’s Busy\nDay —\n\nTHE COURT: Uh-huh.\n\nMS. KOPPE: — there’s language concerning a child\nmasturbating, as the defendant wanted this child to\nmasturbate.\n\nThere’s also language of the adult — it’s actually her\nfather — telling her how pretty she is. There’s also\nlanguage that both of her parents perform oral sex on\nher, and the defendant talks about performing oral\nsex on her. And —\n\nTHE COURT: And, again, this is the general intent\nyou talked about before.\n\nMS. KOPPE: This is general intent as well as modus\noperandi and preparation —\n\nTHE COURT: Okay.\n\nMS. KOPPE: — and knowledge. And I can give you\nwhere those parts are.\n\nTHE COURT: You’ll give it to us in the form of the\ncopy we’re going to provide.\n\nMS. KOPPE: Okay.\n\nTHE COURT: They’re marked, I assume.\n\f3742               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: In that same story, your Honor, the lit-\n    tle girl is also given oral sex by her grandfather and\n    the grandfather also talks about how pretty she is.\n\n    Going to the next story, which is called Missing Big\n    Brother.\n\n    THE COURT: Again, I’m going to assume general\n    intent on each of these unless you tell me otherwise.\n\n    MS. KOPPE: That’s right. This story talks about —\n\n    MR.    POTTER: Which one is this one now?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: This is Missing Big Brother. The big\n    brother engaging in — big brother is 18, it looks\n    like, and the girl is 14.\n\n    It talks about the girl not wearing any panties under-\n    neath her skirt. It’s one of the things the defendant\n    talked about.\n\n    It talked about how when he had sex with her, he\n    didn’t want to hurt her during sex and he wanted her\n    to like it so much she would be continuously coming\n    back to him. The defendant talked about how he\n    would make it feel good for this little girl.\n\n    And that we offer also for intent, but as well for\n    modus operandi, preparation, and knowledge.\n\n    The next story is I’m Being Molested, and it also\n    talks about sex for children not hurting and how can\n    it be called abuse when it felt good and they were\n    asking for it after it happened, the girls, and it\n    involved sex with their father.\n\n    It also says that, did it hurt? I suppose a little but\n    then it felt good. And it talks more about you may\n\f              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3743\ncall it molestation, you can call it abuse, we don’t\nthink about it that way in this family.\n\nThis story, The Good Girl, which is the next story,\nis where the defendant — excuse me, the defendant\nin his chat talked about how he was willing to be\npatient and wait until Christy was ready to have sex\nwith him.\n\nThis person talks about the same thing to the girl. I\nbelieve she’s 14 at the time. And talks about fooling\naround without having sex, which the defendant also\ndiscussed.\n\nIt goes toward modus operandi, intent, preparation,\nand knowledge.\n\nThe next story should be Pregnant No. 2 (phonetic).\nThis story contains language similar to that used by\nthe defendant in chats concerning oral sex.\n\nIt also talks about how the defendant was talking\nabout how being naked is more comfortable than\nbeing clothed.\n\nIn this story, the girl talks about how her clothing\ndrivers [sic] her crazy. It’s too abrasive. And it\ntalked about oral sex as well.\n\nAnd goes toward modus operandi, intent, prepara-\ntion, and knowledge.\n\nThe story, A Relative Language — excuse me, A\nRelative Interest, has language concerning — the\ndefendant had spoken to Christy about imagining his\ntongue sliding along inside of her.\n\nThis has language similar to that regarding oral sex,\nand it’s clearly with a child as well.\n\f3744               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    It goes towards intent, modus operandi, preparation,\n    and knowledge.\n\n    The story, Restrictions, has the father telling his\n    daughter, who is a child, that she’s sexy, that she\n    should wear barely any clothes, that she should walk\n    around naked, that she’s cute, sexy again, and talks\n    about — it shows a way of seducing — it’s a meth-\n    odology of seducing a child, basically.\n\n    There are several descriptions of the father getting\n    his daughter to engage in sex with him, basically, bit\n    by bit.\n\n    It goes towards intent, modus operandi, preparation,\n    and knowledge.\n\n    The next story is A Matter Of Taste, and that story\n    talks about — it has a description of giving male oral\n    sex and wanting the minor to feel good during oral\n    sex. I believe the girl is 12 in this story.\n\n    Starting on page 12 where she’s talking about giving\n    oral sex to her father and that she does it better than\n    anyone else. And the defendant said in his chats that\n    he would teach Christy how to do that. It also talks\n    — well, it talks more about that.\n\n    And that goes towards modus operandi, intent, prep-\n    aration, and knowledge.\n\n    This story, Teaching The Kids, has a lesson on how\n    to introduce children into sex. It’s parents talking to\n    their children.\n\n    It looks like there are three sons and two daughters.\n    The oldest son is 15, the youngest is 11. And the two\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                     3745\ngirls are young. I don’t see their age in the front page\nbut it will be in here.\n\nThe parents decide it’s time for the kids to learn\nabout sex, and there’s a methodology of how they\nseduce the children into engaging in sex.\n\nIt goes to intent, knowledge, modus operandi. It also\ntalks about oral sex, which the defendant talked\nabout in his chats.\n\nThe next story is called Mommy Juice (phonetic).\nAnd that story has a conversation with a mother\nteaching her children about sex and telling them that\nit will feel good before she has them engage in it.\nThere’s a part where it says, basically, that sex feels\ngood to adolescent girls.\n\nIt goes towards modus operandi, intent. And it also\nhas one of the girls, afterwards, telling her dad that\nit feels good. It goes towards modus operandi, intent,\nknowledge, and preparation.\n\nThe story My Sister And I has language about oral\nsex, engaging in oral sex with a minor and trying to\nplease her. The defendant talked about how he\nwould have Christy orgasm numerous times, and this\nstory talks about that as well.\n\nIt goes towards preparation, knowledge, intent,\nmodus operandi.\n\nThere’s a fairly long description of performing oral\nsex on the minor. And then there’s a part where the\nminor says if it hurts, you have to stop, and he prom-\nises to do so.\n\n                          ...\n\f3746               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    MS. KOPPE: The story Now Kids (phonetic), con-\n    tains statements that sex is fun for everyone, espe-\n    cially young girls.\n\n    The father tells her, it feels real good, doesn’t it? The\n    girl then has sex with her older brother and tells him\n    it felt really good; all language that the defendant\n    said he would do with Christy.\n\n    That goes also towards knowledge, intent, modus\n    operandi, motive.\n\n    The story Getting Out Of Hand also contains state-\n    ments about sex being fun for young girls and feel-\n    ing good. And that goes towards knowledge, intent.\n\n    The next story is — that story also talks about oral\n    sex, which the defendant also talked about.\n\n    The story Peeping In On My Daughter has a 14 year\n    old stating that she’s not too young to engage in sex-\n    ual intercourse.\n\n    It contains a statement that sex is fun for young girls\n    and also how sex feels good and teaching her how to\n    give oral sex to a man. And it looks like it’s her\n    grandfather having sex with her. It goes to intent,\n    motive, and knowledge.\n\n    The story Horny Nieces has a discussion between\n    ten-year-old girls and their father concerning\n    whether the — will engage with their uncle who is\n    coming to visit.\n\n    The father tells the girls that they should be careful\n    when talking about it because some people think sex\n    with children is wrong and their uncle may be one of\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                     3747\nthem. The story also contains the idea that the young\ngirls enjoy sex and that it feels good to them.\n\nThis certainly shows knowledge that this is a crime\nand it’s illegal and that there are people who believe\nthat, and it shows motive and intent as well.\n\nThe story Heck Of A Job (phonetic) is a story about\na guy who meets twins who are seven or eight years\nold. They never say for sure exactly how old they\nare, but they’re young; seven or eight.\n\nAnd he goes to their house and engages in — well,\nfirst it’s a store and then at their house, engages in\nsteps in order to — basically it’s a methodology of\nseducing them into engaging in sex with him.\n\nAnd it shows knowledge and intent, modus operandi\nand preparation. It also talks about oral sex on a\nfemale that’s similar to the discussions the defendant\nhad in the chats.\n\nThe story, Consent, contains a discussion of consent\nversus rape concerning young girls having sex. And\nthe — contains the basic idea that even though the\ngirl is young and below the age of consent, if, in fact,\nshe consents, how can it be called rape. And that\nshows the defendant’s intent.\n\nThe next story, Daddy’s Lessons, talks about how\nsex only hurts at first. It has descriptions of oral sex\non a man.\n\nThis is basically graphic language. It’s the story of\nyoung children having sex with their parents and\nwith each other.\n\f3748               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    After everyone has had sex with each other, the\n    mother sits them down and tells them that they can\n    never tell anyone what they do in their house.\n\n    She explains to them what statutory rape is. She tells\n    them that what they engage in is, in fact, statutory\n    rape and tells the kids that their parents would go to\n    jail if they tell anyone, if anyone knows what hap-\n    pens in their house.\n\n    She also tells them that because of this type of crime,\n    if her father goes — if their father goes to jail, then\n    they — he would be killed because people don’t like\n    people who commit this type of crime.\n\n    And the final story is Playing Adult Games With Lit-\n    tle Sister. It contains descriptions of manipulating\n    children into engaging in sexual acts.\n\n    The mother, the adult, starts the manipulation and\n    the rest of the story kind of escalates that manipula-\n    tion, and it’s a bit of a methodology of how to get\n    these kids to engage in sexual acts.\n\n    There is also a part where they talk about our fanta-\n    sies, basically, of sex — children having sex and\n    how they were going to be coming [sic] true because\n    of what’s happening to their children.\n\n    This shows intent, modus operandi, knowledge,\n    motive, and preparation.\n\n    THE COURT: Okay. Can we give those to Paula and\n    ask her to run them and hopefully the blue part will\n    show through so that — we’ll give you a copy. You\n    already have copies but, of course, this will be a\n    copy of the markings. Okay?\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                     3749\n    And then if you — for purposes of demonstration to\n    the Court or objection to the Court, before the jury\n    comes in tomorrow morning, if you would make\n    your objection; that is, this one just simply does not\n    go to that particular purpose, the language isn’t there\n    or whatever, if you’ll make that before we bring the\n    jury back.\n\n    Anything further? Thank you, very much. We’ll\n    reconvene, please, tomorrow morning at 9:00.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n  Thus, the record reveals that the trial judge correctly\nrequired the government to demonstrates that the five stories\nadmitted were factually similar to the defendants interaction\nwith “christy13.”\n\n   Day Three began on the same issue, with counsel for Curtin\ncontinuing to rely on Shymanovitz and Rule 403 to block the\nintroduction of the stories. The government responded as fol-\nlows:\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Your Honor, first of all, as far as Mr.\n    Potter’s argument that the articles are, in themselves,\n    legal, 404(b) does not require that the other acts be\n    illegal acts or even bad acts. It just requires that they\n    be other acts that show one of the elements listed in\n    404(b).\n\n    These stories, every single one of them, proves\n    intent. Every single one of them shows the defen-\n    dant’s intent. They all talk about sex with children.\n    They all talk about intent to have sex with children.\n\n    The fact that the defendant possessed over 140 of\n    these stories and carried them around with him, go\n    directly against his defense that he had no intent to\n\f3750              UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    engage in sex with children, that that was not any-\n    thing he wanted to do.\n\n                            ...\n\n    The defendant is the one who has immersed himself\n    in this fantasy defense. The defendant is the one who\n    is saying I didn’t have the intent. I never had that\n    intent.\n\n    And these stories that the defendant possessed and\n    that the defendant carried around with him every-\n    where he went and when he was committing this\n    crime, they show his intent.\n\n                            ...\n\n    In Allen (phonetic) the Ninth Circuit found that the\n    literature in that case did go to an element of the\n    crime and specifically distinguished that case from\n    Shimonowitz [sic] because it said that the stories in\n    that case did not go to an element of the crime.\n\n    These stories not only go to an element of the crime\n    — intent is one of the most important elements of\n    the crime, actually — it goes to the element of the\n    crime that the defendant himself is attacking, pretty\n    much the only element the defendant is attacking.\n    And the defendant possessed these stories.\n\n    As far as 403, your Honor, these stories are not more\n    prejudicial than they are probative. They’re clearly\n    probative.\n\n                            ...\n\n   The court continued to be concerned about the number of\nstories that should go to the jury:\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3751\n    THE COURT: Now, the last issue I wanted to\n    address is I sure don’t want to impose upon the jury\n    the feeling that they have to read this entire book.\n    How many stories was this?\n\n    MS. KOPPE: Your Honor, that was 21 stories.\n    We’re going to narrow it down —\n\n    THE COURT: You’re going to limit it down to —\n\n    MS. KOPPE: — to 12.\n\n    THE COURT: — about half of it. That’s helpful but\n    it’s still, number one, it’s potentially redundant —\n    like I said, after you get past the first story — and\n    it’s also potentially biasing.\n\n    In other words, we want the jury to limit themselves\n    to these four issues — intent, methodology, prepara-\n    tion, and knowledge — and trying not to overempha-\n    size this evidence in the context of all other\n    evidence.\n\n    I simply want to make it very clear to the jury, you\n    must not let this type of evidence bias you against\n    the defendant. He has a constitutional right to pos-\n    sess such. But you must, and may, only take it for\n    the four proffered reasons.\n\n   At this point, and having caused the number of stories to be\nreduced to five, the court addressed a final issue: whether to\npermit the jurors to read the entirety of each story, or just\nhighlighted “snippets,” the particular parts of each story going\ndirectly to the defendant’s intent. The “snippets” had been\npreviously highlighted in blue by the prosecution. The court\nsaid,\n\f3752                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n      So, the only last question I had in my head is assum-\n      ing that I let you introduce, in total, the first story,\n      maybe the second one, which was, as much as I\n      could read, other than the snippets in the other stories,9\n      I did have a question overnight.\n\n      I still haven’t quite resolved in my mind as to\n      whether I should let you admit the entire rest of the\n      other stories, other than just the snippets.\n\n                                    ...\n\n      MS. STANISH: I think it’s problematic to put, let’s\n      say, Agent Flaherty on the stand and have her say\n      this portion relates to this purpose —\n\n      THE COURT: But don’t you think it would be more\n      proper, at a minimum, if you don’t do that. That\n      would be my preference, that you do it that way.\n\n      But if you don’t do that, at a minimum, to put a wit-\n      ness on the stand who says we have highlighted\n      those portions of the stories that relate to the four\n      intended purposes.\n\n      I mean, if we admit it, generally, and tell the jury\n      you’ve got to search through these stories for those\n      intended purposes, then we’ve allowed the prejudi-\n      cial effect of the volume and redundancy of the story\n      to outweigh the four purposes.\n\n                                    ...\n  9\n    My colleagues’ claim that the district court “was unable to read the sto-\nries” is not supported by the record. The court clearly had its own copies\nand read the “snippets” which highlighted the material that makes the sto-\nries relevant. Curtin does not object to the use of the entire story in lieu\nof the snippets.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3753\n    THE COURT: . . . But wouldn’t it be more appropri-\n    ate, at a minimum, for you to have the witness testify\n    that I have marked in blue — I mean, leaving it for\n    the jury finally to decide whether it really is proof of\n    these four elements.\n\n    But have you marked portions of these stories in\n    blue? Yes. For what purpose? To show that they\n    relate to either intent, or method, or preparation, or\n    knowledge.\n\n                              ...\n\n    MR. POTTER: We’re going to be doing the snip-\n    pets, then, is that —\n\n    THE COURT: We would not be reading the snip-\n    pets. We would be leaving it for the jury to find the\n    snippets in those one — for the purposes for which\n    I tell them are relevant; one, two, three —\n\n    MR. POTTER: I think that’s —\n\n    THE COURT: — four, five stories.\n\n    MR. POTTER: If they’re getting the whole story and\n    then the snippets then emphasize. I mean, now\n    they’re getting . . . they’re getting their attention\n    drawn to something.\n\n    I mean, you make the decision of what is relevant\n    and whether it is passed the muster of these four ele-\n    ments.\n\n    And, now, I think if we’re going to give them the\n    whole story, then they should be blank stories.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\f3754                  UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n   The issues having been resolved, the court then pre-\ninstructed the jurors10 as per Fed. R. Evid. 105 as to the lim-\nited purpose for which they could use this evidence the jury\nwas about to hear, an instruction which the jurors heard more\nthan once:\n\n       THE COURT: I’m going to allow the prosecution to\n       reopen their examination for a few additional min-\n       utes. They want to proffer some additional exhibits.\n\n       And, therefore, I’m going to give you a brief instruc-\n       tion with respect to these exhibits. I gave you, ini-\n       tially, the same instruction yesterday. I’m going to\n       give you the official version and then explain it\n       briefly.\n\n       You are about to hear testimony that the defendant\n       had articles on his PDA that relate to other acts not\n       charged here.\n\n       I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted\n       only for the limited purpose of being considered by\n       you on the question of the defendant’s intent,\n       method, preparation, or knowledge, and for no other\n       purpose. Let me explain the instruction just briefly.\n\n       We all have, thank goodness, a constitutional right to\n       have whatever literature we want in our homes, on\n       our PDAs, on our computers.\n\n       A person cannot be charged nor convicted of litera-\n       ture that they read or that they possess. That’s why\n       I’m giving you the instruction.\n\n       But the Government has the obligation to prove,\n       beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had\n  10\n    As did the court in Allen, 341 F.3d at 887, n.24.\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3755\nthe wrongful intent. They may offer possession of\nsuch literature to show that.\n\nFor example, most all crimes, state or federal, have,\nat a minimum, at least two elements. I’ll instruct you\nat the end of the case on what the elements of these\ncrimes are. And the Government must prove every\none of them, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBut most all crimes have a minimum of two ele-\nments: One, some conduct that’s specified in the\nstatute; and number two, a wrongful state of mind or\nintent.\n\nThe simplest example I can think of is murder. There\nis an act, homicide. And there’s a wrongful intent,\nthe wrongful taking of another person’s life.\n\nIf you don’t have that intent, you haven’t committed\nthe crime. If you’re involved in an accident in your\ncar and, unfortunately, someone loses their life in\nthat accident, you are not guilty of murder.\n\nThere is a homicide, to be sure, but there is no\nwrongful intent. And, therefore, you’re not charged,\nnor convicted, nor alleged with committing a crimi-\nnal act. You may be sued in court civilly, of course.\nTherefore, there are two elements.\n\nYou may take this kind of evidence on the question\nof whether the defendant actually possessed the\nintent.\n\nYou may also take it on the additional questions\nwhich go to the question of intent, whether he prac-\nticed in this alleged conduct methodology consistent\nwith literature that he had or tending to show that he\nprepared to commit the acts or that he had knowl-\n\f3756                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n    edge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act\n    was illegal.\n\n    Again, the prosecution does not have to show that a\n    defendant knew an act was illegal, simply that he\n    committed the act and that he knew it was wrongful\n    or that he had the wrongful intent. They don’t have\n    to prove that he knew it was illegal.\n\n    But evidence tending to show that he knew it was\n    illegal may or may not tend to show that he had the\n    intent.\n\n    So, for those four reasons, only, the Government is\n    offering to show that the defendant possessed this lit-\n    erature; intent, method, preparation, and knowledge.\n    And you may only take it for that purpose.\n\n    Again, you have a constitutional right. You have that\n    right. You would want to protect the defendant’s\n    right to posses any kind of literature and to read it or\n    not read it.\n\n    You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias\n    you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate\n    question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that.\n\n    I’ll repeat, finally, in conclusion, the official instruc-\n    tion.\n\n    You are about to hear testimony that the defendant\n    possessed various types of articles on his PDA\n    regarding other acts not charged here.\n\n    I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted\n    only for the limited purpose of being considered by\n    you on the question of the defendant’s intent,\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                   3757\n    method, preparation, or knowledge and for no other\n    purpose.\n\n    I hope you understand the instruction. With that, I’ll\n    permit the prosecution to proceed again today.\n\n                              VI\n\n   My colleagues’ opinion stands for the questionable propo-\nsition that a trial court simply has no discretion in a case\ninvolving pedophilia to admit obscene sexual literature, even\nthough the literature — as it does here — (1) sheds probative\nlight on a defendant’s relevant subjective intent, and (2)\nrebuts a defendant’s primary defense of no criminal mens rea.\nMy colleagues have made relevant literature off limits in the\nNinth Circuit as a matter of law.\n\n   Ironically, Rule 404(b), a rule of inclusion, references at\nleast three categories of other “acts” encompassing the inner\nworkings of the mind: motive, intent, and knowledge. Once\nit has been established that the evidence offered serves one of\nthese purposes, the relevant Advisory Committee notes make\nit clear that the “only” conditions justifying the exclusion of\nthe evidence are those described in Rule 403: unfair prejudice,\nconfusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwaste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evi-\ndence:\n\n       Note to Subdivision (b). The second sentence of\n    Rule 404(b) as submitted to the Congress began with\n    the words “This subdivision does not exclude the\n    evidence when offered”. The Committee amended\n    this language to read “It may, however, be admissi-\n    ble”, the words used in the 1971 Advisory Commit-\n    tee draft, on the ground that this formulation\n    properly placed greater emphasis on admissibility\n    than did the final Court version. House Report No.\n    93-650.\n\f3758               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\n       Note to Subdivision (b). This rule provides that\n    evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not\n    admissible to prove character but may be admissible\n    for other specified purposes such as proof of motive.\n\n       Although your committee sees no necessity in\n    amending the rule itself, it anticipates that the use of\n    the discretionary word “may” with respect to the\n    admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts\n    is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on\n    the trial judge. Rather, it is anticipated that with\n    respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the\n    trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of those\n    considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e., prejudice,\n    confusion or waste of time. Senate Report No. 93-\n    1277.\n\n  The Supreme Court embraced this understanding of Rule\n404(b) and its handling of “other acts” in Huddleston v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112049\"><a href=\"/opinion/112049/huddleston-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998):\n\n    Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)—which applies in\n    both civil and criminal cases—generally prohibits\n    the introduction of evidence of extrinsic acts that\n    might adversely reflect on the actor’s character,\n    unless that evidence bears upon a relevant issue in\n    the case such as motive, opportunity, or knowledge.\n    Extrinsic acts evidence may be critical to the estab-\n    lishment of the truth as to a disputed issue, especially\n    when that issue involves the actor’s state of mind\n    and the only means of ascertaining that mental state\n    is by drawing inferences from conduct.\n\nId. at 685 (emphasis added).\n\n  Moreover, the Court explicitly embraced the Advisory\nCommittee’s understanding of the Rule as reflecting the intent\nof Congress:\n\f               UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                    3759\nPetitioner’s reading of Rule 404(b) as mandating a\npreliminary finding by the trial court that the act in\nquestion occurred not only superimposes a level of\njudicial oversight that is nowhere apparent from the\nlanguage of that provision, but it is simply inconsis-\ntent with the legislative history behind Rule 404(b).\nThe Advisory Committee specifically declined to\noffer any “mechanical solution” to the admission of\nevidence under 404(b). Rather, the Committee indi-\ncated that the trial court should assess such evidence\nunder the usual rules for admissibility: “The determi-\nnation must be made whether the danger of undue\nprejudice outweighs the probative value of the evi-\ndence in view of the availability of other means of\nproof and other factors appropriate for making deci-\nsions of this kind under Rule 403.” [S]ee also, S Rep\nNo. 93-1277, p 25 (1974) (“[I]t is anticipated that\nwith respect to permissible uses for such evidence,\nthe trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of\nthose considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e. preju-\ndice, confusion or waste of time”).\n\nPetitioner’s suggestion that a preliminary finding is\nnecessary to protect the defendant from the potential\nfor unfair prejudice is also belied by the Reports of\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate. The\nHouse made clear that the version of Rule 404(b)\nwhich became law was intended to “plac[e] greater\nemphasis on admissibility than did the final Court\nverison.” The Senate echoed this theme: “[T]he use\nof the discretionary word ‘may’ with respect to the\nadmissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or other\nacts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion\non the trial judge.” Thus, Congress was not nearly so\nconcerned with the potential prejudicial effect of\nRule 404(b) evidence as it was with ensuring that\nrestrictions would not be placed on the admission of\nsuch evidence.\n\f3760                UNITED STATES v. CURTIN\nId. at 688, 689 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the majori-\nty’s exclusionary holding defies not only the clear purpose of\nthe Rule itself, but the Supreme Court’s authoritative guid-\nance.\n\n   This holding is not only legally wrong, but it extinguishes\nthe discretion of a district court to decide questions of rele-\nvancy, inappropriately converting our standard of review from\none that examines for an abuse of discretion into one that\nlooks at a relevancy decision de novo. Their holding is a twis-\ntification of the principle that an error of law necessarily ren-\nders abusive an exercise of discretion based on that error.\nHere, there was no error of law. The evidence was relevant,\nperiod; and, as we observed in United States v. Hearst, 563\nF.2d at 1337, n.3, “relevance is the essential criterion.” Curtin\nhad this evidence on his person when he entered the casino\nexpecting to find “christy13.” An officer testified that Curtin\n“had a Palm device, a PDA, and he was looking at — at it.\nHe was looking at the screen [for five minutes] and he kept\non looking up as if he was trying to verify the time or loca-\ntion.” Curtin conceded in his testimony that he personally had\ndownloaded these stories through a computer to his PDA\nbecause he believed they were “quite erotic.” [Day 4, p. 23]\nThe particular erotic story that attracted his attention was\nabout a “17 year-old girl,” and he downloaded them to find\nmore of the same. [Day 4, p. 56] He caused them to be put\nout on his PDA in December, 2003, just two and one-half\nmonths before contacting “christy13.” Curtin conceded\n“skimming” some of the downloaded stories.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n  This case in combination with Shymanovitz improperly\nhamstrings the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Cir-\ncuit with adults who see children as sexual prey. Congress has\nenacted a law protecting minors from this behavior, but we\nhave misinterpreted the Rules of Evidence to make the law\ninordinately difficult to enforce. Without justification, this\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. CURTIN                  3761\nholding handcuffs jurors when confronted with “no intent”\ndefenses, turning such trials into the equivalent of “he said,\nshe said” conundrums. My experience with jurors is that con-\nfronted with these situations, they want context, corroborating\nevidence, and other pertinent information which helps them\nsort out conflicting claims and assertions. Why? Not because\nit is prejudicial, but because it is relevant, whether it cuts for\nor against a defendant. As recognized by the Tenth Circuit in\nViefhaus and Magleby, context and circumstances are impor-\ntant, and relevant literature can be used to this end — even if\nit is obscene. Now, we leave the jury high and dry without rel-\nevant evidence to look to in order to ensure the validity of\ntheir verdict. Such a handicap is legally wrong as well as\nunwise. At the very least, the district court’s decision regard-\ning the evidence eventually submitted to the jury was far from\nabusive. If somehow it is correct that Shymanovitz commands\nthis result, then Shymanovitz is seriously defective and must\nbe reconsidered. Thus, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
