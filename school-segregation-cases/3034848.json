A\n\nvoter may obtain a blank hardcopy absentee ballot by mail, fax,\n\nor by downloading and printing one from a website.                            The hardcopy\n\nballot must be marked by hand, signed, and returned via mail or\n\nhand-delivery to the voter’s local election board.\n\n     The         National        Federation    of     the    Blind      and     individual\n\ndisabled     Maryland          voters   sued   state       election   officials      under\n\nTitle   II       of    the    Americans     with    Disabilities      Act     (“ADA”)   and\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.                       Plaintiffs allege that\n\nmarking      a        hardcopy     ballot     by    hand    without      assistance      is\n\nimpossible for voters with various disabilities, and that they\n\nhave therefore been denied meaningful access to absentee voting.\n\nAfter a bench trial, the district court found that Maryland’s\n\nprogram,     as        then    structured,     did    not    comport     with     ADA   and\n\nRehabilitation           Act    requirements.        The     district    court     further\n\nfound that plaintiffs’ proposed remedy—the use of an “online\n\nballot marking tool” that would enable disabled voters to mark\n\ntheir ballots electronically—was a reasonable modification that\n\ndid not fundamentally alter Maryland’s absentee voting program.\n\nDefendant election officials now appeal all these aspects of the\n\ndistrict court’s decision.                For the reasons below, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                I.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Elections     in    the    State         of    Maryland    are    overseen       by   the\n\nState Board of Elections (“Board”).                         Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law\n\n§§ 2-101     to    102    (Westlaw        current          through      the    2015     Regular\n\nSession of the General Assembly) (“Elec. Law”).                                The Board is\n\ncomprised of five members.                  Elec. Law § 2-101(a).                   The Board\n\nappoints a State Administrator of Elections who is designated as\n\n“the     chief      State        election             official”       and     tasked         with\n\nadministering Maryland’s election apparatus.                          Id. § 2-103.\n\n       Maryland provides its voters with a number of different\n\nmeans to vote.            Maryland has nearly 2,000 polling places at\n\nwhich    a   voter       may     cast   a       ballot      on    Election      Day.         The\n\noverwhelming majority of these polling places are accessible to\n\nphysically disabled voters and are staffed with election judges\n\ntrained in serving voters with disabilities.                            The polling place\n\nvoting machines have a number of accessibility features designed\n\nto assist disabled voters in casting their ballots.                                 Maryland’s\n\nvoting machines allow voters to magnify the font of the ballot,\n\nto   alter   the     color     contrast,             and   to   position      the   interface\n\nscreen    such     that     voters      can          sit   down   while       casting    their\n\nballots.         The voting machines can also be programed for non-\n\nvisual access by means of an audio ballot; when using the audio\n\nfeatures     a    voter    receives         a    headset        and   numeric       keypad     to\n\n                                                 5\n\fnavigate the ballot choices.                Voters who desire assistance in\n\nmarking their ballots may be assisted by an individual of their\n\nchoosing or by an election judge (in the presence of an election\n\njudge of another political party).                 The voting machines are not\n\ncompatible with some common personal accessibility devices such\n\nas refreshable Braille displays.\n\n      Maryland also allows voters to vote in person for an eight-\n\nday   period      before    Election       Day   at    sixty-four     early   voting\n\npolling stations.          All of these early voting polling places are\n\nphysically accessible.\n\n      Finally, any Maryland voter may vote by absentee ballot.                     A\n\nvoter can obtain a ballot by mail, fax, or electronically by\n\ndownloading a ballot from a website.                  A voter who electronically\n\ndownloads    an    absentee       ballot    must      print   out   the   ballot   in\n\nhardcopy, mark their choices by hand, and then sign and return\n\nthe   hardcopy     ballot    to    their    local     board   of    elections.     An\n\nabsentee voter may designate an agent to pick up and deliver a\n\nballot.     Absentee voters may also have an individual of their\n\nchoice assist them in hand marking the ballot.\n\n\n\n                                           B.\n\n      Historically, as noted, an absentee voter who obtained an\n\nabsentee ballot electronically needed to print out the blank\n\nballot and mark their choices by hand on the printed hardcopy\n\n                                            6\n\fballot.       For several years, Maryland has been developing a piece\n\nof software referred to as an “online ballot marking tool.”                            The\n\ntool can be used by absentee voters who choose to obtain their\n\nabsentee ballots electronically; the tool enables voters to mark\n\ntheir       choices   electronically     and      then     print     out   a    completed\n\nballot. 1       When the ballot is printed, the voter’s selections\n\nappear on a number of pages followed by a separate signature\n\npage.       The voter must still sign the signature page and return\n\nthe    entire    hardcopy    ballot    to       the    local    board   of     elections.\n\nOnly printed and signed ballots received by a local board of\n\nelections are counted in determining the result of an election.\n\n       Maryland’s Board developed the online ballot marking tool\n\nover    a    number   of   years,   including          with    the   participation      of\n\nplaintiff       National    Federation      of    the     Blind.        The    Board   has\n\nsolicited feedback and implemented a number of usability and\n\naccessibility enhancements for disabled voters.                       The tool is not\n\ncompatible with all computer browsers or operating systems, but\n\ndoes function properly with a variety of reasonably up-to-date\n\nproducts.             Importantly      for            individuals       with     certain\n\n       1\n       The tool provides the voter an interface program on the\ncomputer they are using.    Voters mark their ballots using the\ncomputer program and are then presented with a review screen\nthat allows voters to verify that their selections are accurate.\nWhen a voter confirms the selections, the computer transmits the\ninformation to the state election board’s computer server. The\nserver generates a marked ballot in the form of a PDF file,\nwhich the voter can then print out.\n\n\n                                            7\n\fdisabilities, the ability to use the tool on their own computers\n\nmay enable them to use the personal assistive devices that they\n\nordinarily       use    to    interface     with     the       computer,     such     as    a\n\nrefreshable Braille display, to mark their ballot choices.\n\n\n\n                                            C.\n\n       An    early,     non-accessible       version          of   the    online    ballot\n\nmarking tool was available to absentee voters during Maryland’s\n\n2012    primary       elections.        Following    the       primary     elections,       a\n\nquestion arose as to whether the tool needed to be officially\n\ncertified pursuant to Maryland Election Law Section 9-102, which\n\nrequires certification of any “voting system” prior to use.                                The\n\nMaryland Attorney General provided an opinion that the tool did\n\nnot meet the statutory definition of a “voting system” and did\n\nnot require certification.               See Certification of Voting Systems\n\nDoes Not Apply to Absentee-Ballot-Marking Wizard, 97 Op. Md.\n\nAtt’y    Gen.    32    (2012).         However,    apparently       due    to   lingering\n\nconcerns over the status of the online ballot marking tool, the\n\nBoard    only    made     the    tool    available       to    certain     overseas     and\n\nmilitary absentee voters for the 2012 general election.                             Use of\n\nthe     tool    in     the    2012     primary     and     general        elections     was\n\napparently uneventful.\n\n       The     Maryland      General    Assembly    subsequently          clarified     the\n\nstatus of the tool.             In 2013, the General Assembly passed the\n\n                                            8\n\f“Improving Access to Voting Act,” 2013 Md. Laws Ch. 157, which,\n\namong other things, explicitly required the Board to certify any\n\nonline ballot marking tool prior to use by voters.                      See id.\n\n(codified at Elec. Law § 9-308.1).                 Certification requires a\n\nsupermajority:       at least four of the five members of the Board\n\nmust vote in favor of certification.             See Elec. Law § 2-102(c).\n\n     The Board continued to make improvements to the version of\n\nthe tool that had been used in the 2012 election cycle.                         In\n\nparticular, the Board implemented certain changes to make the\n\ntool more accessible to voters with disabilities.                 Additionally,\n\nin accordance with the 2013 Improving Access to Voting Act, the\n\nBoard hired an independent consultant, Unatek Inc. (“Unatek”),\n\nto perform security testing on the tool.                  Unatek produced a\n\nreport in December 2013 concluding that use of the tool was\n\nsecure.\n\n     In February 2014, the Board met and discussed the online\n\nballot    marking    tool.     The   Board    reviewed    the     December   2013\n\nUnatek report and interviewed the report’s author.                   Some Board\n\nmembers continued to express concerns about the security of the\n\ntool, and the Board did not hold a certification vote.\n\n     The     Board     subsequently        hired    a    second     independent\n\nconsultant,   Mainstay       Enterprises,    Inc.    (“Mainstay”),     to    audit\n\nthe Unatek security report.           The Mainstay audit concluded that\n\nUnatek’s    security     assessment        had     followed     industry     best\n\n                                       9\n\fpractices.    The Board also received and reviewed public comments\n\nand had Board staff obtain information on the use of similar\n\nballot marking tools in other states.\n\n     The certification issue was again discussed at the Board’s\n\nApril 2014 meeting.     At the meeting, Mainstay briefed the Board\n\non the results of its audit.      Some Board members continued to\n\nexpress concerns about certification and the Board did not take\n\na certification vote.\n\n\n\n                                 D.\n\n     On May 19, 2014, plaintiffs sued Linda Lamone, Maryland’s\n\nState Administrator of Elections, and the five Board members,\n\nall in their official capacities.     At the heart of plaintiffs’\n\nsuit are claims that Maryland’s absentee voting process violates\n\nthe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.      Plaintiffs sought both a\n\ndeclaratory judgment to that effect as well as an injunction\n\nrequiring state election officials to make the online ballot\n\nmarking tool available for use starting with the 2014 general\n\nelection. 2   The district court subsequently scheduled a bench\n\ntrial to begin on August 13, 2014.      The schedule would provide\n\n\n\n\n     2 Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction requiring\nelection officials to make the tool available for the June 24,\n2014 primary election.    The district court held a hearing on\nJune 11, 2014, and ultimately denied plaintiffs’ request.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fdefendants with sufficient time to implement the tool before the\n\n2014 general election in the event that plaintiffs prevailed.\n\n     While the suit was pending, the Board held a specially-\n\nscheduled    meeting     on    July   10,    2014,   with   one   Board    member\n\nabsent.     The four Board members in attendance voted 3 to 1 to\n\ncertify   the   online    ballot      marking   tool.       The   vote    did   not\n\nsatisfy the statutory supermajority requirement and the tool was\n\nnot certified.\n\n     The district court held a three-day bench trial beginning\n\non August 13, 2014. 3         The district court heard testimony on:            the\n\n\n\n\n     3 On August 1, 2014, less than two weeks before trial,\nseveral individuals and entities who were similarly situated to\nplaintiffs here filed a motion to intervene in the case.     The\nputative intervenors asserted similar ADA and Rehabilitation Act\nclaims, along with additional claims against Maryland state\nofficials    under   18 U.S.C. § 1983    for   various   alleged\nconstitutional violations. The putative intervenors argued that\ntheir rights had been violated in ways substantially similar to\nplaintiffs, but sought an almost diametrically opposed remedy—an\ninjunction barring certification of the online ballot marking\ntool.   Very broadly, the putative intervenors appeared to be\nconcerned that the tool plaintiffs sought to require Maryland to\nuse was not sufficiently accessible to disabled voters.\n     The district court held a conference with all parties and\nthe putative intervenors on August 8, 2014. With the agreement\nof the parties, the district court held the motion sub curia and\npermitted the putative intervenors to participate in the trial.\nIn its memorandum opinion in this case, the district court\nultimately granted the motion to the extent of the intervenors’\nparticipation up to and through trial, and considered the\nintervenors’ evidence and legal arguments in reaching its\ndecision; the district court denied the motion to the extent the\nintervenors sought to assert independent claims against the\ndefendants.   It does not appear that either the parties or the\n(Continued)\n                                        11\n\fdifficulties disabled voters have experienced while voting; the\n\nBoard’s development of the online ballot marking tool and the\n\nBoard’s   deliberation      over      certification;      the   accessibility     of\n\nthe tool for disabled voters; and the security risks posed by\n\nthe tool.\n\n     The district court found that “the evidence demonstrated\n\nspecific difficulties that some disabled voters have experienced\n\nwhile voting,” J.A. 1043, and that “under the current absentee\n\nballot    voting    program,    individuals       with    disabilities    such    as\n\nthose     of    the     Plaintiffs          cannot       vote      privately     and\n\nindependently.”        J.A. 1044.          The district court credited the\n\nresults    of   a   University        of   Baltimore     usability     study    that\n\nconcluded the tool was “highly accessible for disabled voters,”\n\nJ.A. 1047-48, though the district court acknowledged that two\n\nindividuals     testified      that    they     had   difficulty    accessing    and\n\nusing the tool during a public demonstration period.                    J.A. 1048.\n\nThe district court found the tool “compatible with reasonably\n\nup-to-date computer and screen access software,” “designed in\n\naccordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,” and\n\n“compatible     with   refreshable         Braille     displays.”       Id.      The\n\ndistrict court did find that there were still “challenges to\n\n\n\n\nintervenors have appealed any part of the district court’s\ndisposition on this issue, and we see no reason to disturb it.\n\n\n                                           12\n\fprivate and independent voting by absentee ballot for disabled\n\nvoters    even       when     using       the   tool,”        including      that       “disabled\n\nvoters    may    need        assistance         in    signing       their    ballots       before\n\nsubmission.”            Id.         “However,         the     testimony      at     trial       also\n\nindicated that, because the signature sheet prints on a separate\n\npage, the risk of disclosure of a disabled voter’s selections\n\nwas minimalized and, in any event, was significantly less than\n\nthat     afforded           under     the       current        paper        absentee        ballot\n\nsystem . . . .”            J.A. 1048-49.\n\n       With    respect        to    the    security         risks   posed     by    the     online\n\nballot    marking           tool,     the       district        court       credited       expert\n\ntestimony       that        the     tool    “exhibited          software          independence,\n\nmeaning a change to the voting software used for an election\n\ncannot    cause        an    undetectable            change    to    the     outcome       of    an\n\nelection” and that “there were no additional risks that did not\n\nexist in other methods already available to Maryland voters.”\n\nJ.A. 1049.           The district court found that the tool was “not\n\nwithout       some     security       risks”         including      that     “malware       could\n\nenable [a] third party to observe a voter’s selections” and that\n\n“a   voter’s         selections       could      be     captured       if    a     third    party\n\ninfiltrated          the    Board’s        server      during       the     time    a     voter’s\n\nselections and/or the printable ballot were being transmitted.”\n\nJ.A. 1049-50.          Additionally, “[t]here was no evidence at trial\n\nthat   the     online       ballot    marking         tool    had    been     tested       against\n\n                                                 13\n\fintentional        attempts   to     infiltrate         or   hack   into    the    Board’s\n\nserver or the tool.”          J.A. 1050.\n\n       The district court further found that “it is clear that\n\nmost voters may mark their absentee ballots without assistance”\n\nand that plaintiffs “should be afforded the same opportunity,\n\nbut the State’s current voting program does not allow for it.”\n\nJ.A. 1055.         Based on the facts found at trial, the district\n\ncourt concluded that plaintiffs had established that they had\n\nbeen denied meaningful access to absentee voting in Maryland in\n\nviolation     of     Title    II    of    the     ADA    and   Section     504     of    the\n\nRehabilitation Act.           The district court entered a declaratory\n\njudgment     for    plaintiffs       to   this     effect.      The    district      court\n\nfurther concluded that plaintiffs’ proposed remedy, access to\n\nthe online ballot marking tool, was a reasonable modification\n\nthat   did    not    fundamentally          alter   Maryland’s        voting      program.\n\nConsistent with these conclusions, the district court entered a\n\npermanent     injunction           prohibiting      defendants        from     violating\n\nplaintiffs’ rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and\n\nrequiring     defendants      to     make    the    online     ballot      marking      tool\n\navailable to plaintiffs for the 2014 general election.                                  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f                                         II.\n\n       We review judgments resulting from a bench trial under a\n\nmixed standard of review:          factual findings may be reversed only\n\nif clearly erroneous, while conclusions of law are examined de\n\nnovo.

Miller, 637 F.3d 291, 297 (4th Cir. 2011).\n\n       Defendants’    appeal    principally           focuses    on    the    district\n\ncourt’s three core legal conclusions:                  (1) that plaintiffs have\n\nbeen denied meaningful access to absentee voting in violation of\n\nthe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act; (2) that the online ballot\n\nmarking tool constitutes a reasonable remedial modification; and\n\n(3) that requiring defendants to allow use of the tool does not\n\nfundamentally alter Maryland’s voting program.                       We address each\n\nof these issues in turn.\n\n\n\n                                     III.\n\n       Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual\n\nwith    a   disability    shall,    by    reason       of    such     disability,      be\n\nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\n\nservices,     programs,   or   activities        of    a    public    entity,     or   be\n\nsubjected     to   discrimination    by       any   such     entity.”        42   U.S.C.\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f§ 12132. 4    To make out a violation of Title II, plaintiffs must\n\nshow:      (1)    they   have     a     disability;    (2)   they   are    otherwise\n\nqualified to receive the benefits of a public service, program,\n\nor   activity;    and    (3)     they    were    denied   the   benefits    of   such\n\nservice,     program,      or     activity,       or   otherwise     discriminated\n\nagainst,     on   the    basis    of     their   disability.        Constantine   v.\n\nRectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 498 (4th\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n      Only the third of these elements—whether plaintiffs were\n\ndenied the benefits of a public service, program, or activity on\n\nthe basis of their disability—is at issue here. 5                      Much of the\n\n\n      4Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act similarly provides\nthat “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in\nthe United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his\ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”   29 U.S.C.\n§ 794. “Claims under the ADA’s Title II and the Rehabilitation\nAct can be combined for analytical purposes because the analysis\nis ‘substantially the same.’”   Seremeth v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs\nFrederick Cty., 673 F.3d 333, 336 n.1 (4th Cir. 2012) (quoting\nDoe v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1265 n.9 (4th\nCir. 1995)). Because under the circumstances presented in this\ncase plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims rise and fall\ntogether,   for  simplicity  our   opinion  combines   them  and\nprincipally analyzes the ADA claim. Cf., e.g., A Helping Hand,\nLLC v. Baltimore Cty., Md., 515 F.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2008)\n(“Congress has directed courts to construe the ADA to grant at\nleast as much protection as the Rehabilitation Act and its\nimplementing regulations.”).\n     5  Title II allows plaintiffs to pursue three distinct\ngrounds for relief: (1) intentional discrimination or disparate\ntreatment; (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make\nreasonable accommodations.   A Helping Hand, LLC, 515 F.3d at\n(Continued)\n                                           16\n\fdispute revolves around the proper way to define the scope of\n\nthe relevant public service or program at issue.              Plaintiffs\n\nargue that the appropriate analytic scope is Maryland’s absentee\n\nvoting program.      Defendants urge analysis of Maryland’s voting\n\nprogram   in   its   entirety,   encompassing      the   various    voting\n\nalternatives—including    in-person    voting—available     to     Maryland\n\nvoters.   Defendants argue that even if absentee voting is not\n\nfully accessible, the full accessibility of Maryland’s in-person\n\npolling places provides disabled voters with meaningful access\n\nto voting.     As explained below, we conclude that defendants’\n\nproposed focus is overbroad and would undermine the purpose of\n\nthe ADA and its implementing regulations.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n     Defendants’     argument    for    holistic     consideration      of\n\nMaryland’s voting program is in some immediate tension with the\n\n\n\n\n362.   Defendants somewhat mischaracterize plaintiffs’ claims as\nadvancing a disparate impact theory of discrimination.       See,\ne.g., Br. of Appellants 38.    While some sort of disparity will\nnecessarily be present in cases of discrimination, that does not\nmean that all discrimination cases are legally evaluated as\n“disparate impact” cases; we do not interpret plaintiffs’\narguments as advancing a legal disparate impact theory (and the\ndistrict court did not evaluate them as such).      We understand\nplaintiffs to be pursuing their claims on the theory that\ndefendants have failed to make reasonable accommodations that\nwould   afford   disabled   individuals  meaningful   access   to\nMaryland’s absentee voting program.\n\n\n                                  17\n\ftext of the ADA.         Title II states that a disabled individual may\n\nnot be “excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\n\nof the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\n\nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”                              42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12132.        Defendants’ proposed focus on voting in its entirety\n\neffectively reads out much of this language, suggesting that\n\nTitle II prohibits only complete exclusion from participation in\n\nbroadly-defined          public    programs.             However,         Title    II     is\n\ndisjunctive.        By its own terms it is not limited only to public\n\n“programs”; it applies to “services, programs, or activities.”\n\nId.     (emphasis       added).        Title    II      does        not   only    prohibit\n\n“exclusion       from    participation”        in   a    public      program;     it    also\n\nseparately prohibits “den[ying] the benefits” of that program.\n\nId. 6       And in addition to those prohibitions, Title II separately\n\ngenerally       prohibits      “discrimination          by    any    [public]     entity.”\n\nId.          Although    the    bare    language         of    Title      II     does   not\n\ndefinitively resolve the question of appropriate scope, it does\n\n\n\n\n        6\n       The United States, as amicus, suggests that defendants\nwould still be in violation of Title II even were we to conclude\nthat Maryland’s entire voting program was “the” program subject\nto Title II’s requirements. We acknowledge that it is possible\nto view the ability to vote from the comfort of one’s home as\none of the “benefits” of Maryland’s overall voting program, the\ndenial of which benefit on the basis of disability might support\na Title II claim.   However, given our conclusion below that we\nmust evaluate Maryland’s absentee voting program directly, we\nneed not address the United States’s contention.\n\n\n                                          18\n\fsuggest     to    us     that      some     granularity        in     analytic      focus     is\n\nnecessary.\n\n      The Supreme Court has cautioned against defining the scope\n\nof a public benefit so as to avoid questions of discriminatory\n\neffects.       In Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985), a\n\nRehabilitation Act case, a unanimous Court counseled that in\n\nassessing whether a disabled individual had been provided with\n\nmeaningful       access       to    a     benefit,      “[t]he      benefit     itself,      of\n\ncourse,    cannot        be   defined       in    a    way   that     effectively     denies\n\notherwise        qualified         handicapped          individuals      the     meaningful\n\naccess    to     which    they      are    entitled.”          See    also    id.    at     n.21\n\n(citing        with      approval          the        government’s       statement          that\n\n“[a]ntidiscrimination              legislation         can   obviously    be     emptied     of\n\nmeaning if every discriminatory policy is ‘collapsed’ into one’s\n\ndefinition of what is the relevant benefit”).                                The logic of\n\nAlexander further suggests that we should proceed cautiously to\n\navoid defining a public program so generally that we overlook\n\nreal difficulties in accessing government services.\n\n      Also significant for our analysis of the proper scope of\n\nreview here is the fact that Maryland allows any voter to vote\n\nby   absentee      ballot.          Elec.     Law      §§    9-301,    9-304.        Absentee\n\nballots are not provided only to a limited set of voters with a\n\ndemonstrated need to vote absentee; they are instead provided to\n\nthe entire Maryland electorate at the option of each individual\n\n                                                 19\n\fvoter.     On the whole, then, we think it is far more natural to\n\nview absentee voting—rather than the entire voting program—as\n\nthe appropriate object of scrutiny for compliance with the ADA\n\nand the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n       Defendants’               remaining           arguments              against           this\n\nstraightforward conclusion are unpersuasive.                           Defendants cite an\n\nADA-implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a), which they\n\nassert    requires         a    reviewing    court       to    view    Maryland’s          voting\n\nprogram    “in       its       entirety.”        However,        the    cited        regulation\n\nexpressly pertains to “existing facilities.”                            See id.           On its\n\nface, this regulation simply provides that a public entity does\n\nnot have to make each of its facilities accessible as long as\n\nindividuals         with       disabilities      have     access       to    that        entity’s\n\noffered        public      services.             This     regulation           is        targeted\n\nprincipally at physical accessibility and allows a public entity\n\nto   provide        accessibility       alternatives           that    would       not    require\n\nlarge-scale architectural modifications of existing facilities.\n\nAccord     Constantine,           411   F.3d        at   489     (discussing          28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 35.150(a) and explaining that “structural changes in existing\n\nphysical        facilities”          are      “probably          the        most      expensive\n\nenterprise” in providing accessibility).\n\n       Other ADA-implementing regulations, however, are applicable\n\nhere     and    conflict         with   defendants’           proposed       focus       on   the\n\nentirety       of     Maryland’s        voting       program.          As      one       example,\n\n                                               20\n\f28 C.F.R.       §    35.130        (“General     prohibitions      against\n\ndiscrimination”)        directly    implements    the    general     anti-\n\ndiscrimination mandate of Title II.            Subsection (b)(7) of the\n\nregulation requires public entities to make certain reasonable\n\nmodifications in “policies, practices, or procedures when the\n\nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis\n\nof disability”; this regulation clearly contemplates a focus on\n\naccessibility at a more granular level than entire government\n\nprograms—the    level    of   “policies,   practices,   and   procedures.”\n\nId. 7\n\n        Defendants also cite to three district court decisions from\n\nother circuits that they argue stand for the proposition that\n\nall aspects of a state’s voting program must be viewed together\n\nwhen analyzing an ADA claim.          Br. of Appellants 55-56.      It is\n\n        7\n       As another example, 28 C.F.R. § 35.160 states that “[a]\npublic entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure that\ncommunications with [disabled persons] are as effective as\ncommunications with others” and “shall furnish appropriate\nauxiliary   aids  and   services   where   necessary  to   afford\nindividuals with disabilities . . . an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program or\nactivity of a public entity.”       Id. § (a)(1), (b)(1).     The\nrequirement to provide “auxiliary aids and services” again\nsuggests to us that accessibility cannot be adequately assessed\nat the highest level of program abstraction. The United States\nargues that this particular regulation alone is a sufficient\nbasis to affirm the decision here.     Br. for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 17-19.     We think that the ADA itself and the\ngeneral anti-discrimination regulation discussed above provide\nthe most direct resolution in this case. We therefore need not\nconsider whether there might be other independent bases that\nsupport an ADA or Rehabilitation Act claim on the facts here.\n\n\n                                     21\n\fnot clear to us that the cited cases in fact support defendants’\n\nproposition; in any event, we find them unpersuasive.                    Further,\n\nlater decisions in some of those districts (and decisions by the\n\ncourts of appeals sitting above them), flatly reject the very\n\nargument    defendants    advance   here.

See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(ii)-(iii).\n\n\n                                          24\n\fdefendants      have        provided      “an    aid,     benefit,          or    service       [to\n\ndisabled   individuals]            that    is    not     as    effective         in    affording\n\nequal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\n\nbenefit,   or     to    reach      the    same       level     of    achievement         as   that\n\nprovided to others.”               See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii).

Instead,       defendants           argue     that\n\nplaintiffs have not been denied meaningful access to absentee\n\nvoting because disabled individuals such as plaintiffs have no\n\nright to vote without assistance.                      See Br. of Appellants 59-60.\n\nThis   argument        simply      misapprehends         the    nature       of       plaintiffs’\n\nclaims.\n\n       This case does not turn on whether there is a standalone\n\nright to vote privately and independently without assistance.\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument is that defendants have provided such a\n\nbenefit to non-disabled voters while denying that same benefit\n\nto    plaintiffs       on    the    basis       of    their     disability.              This    is\n\nprecisely the sort of harm the ADA seeks to prevent.                                  Cf., e.g.,\n\nDisabled in Action, 752 F.3d at 199-200 (“Although [plaintiffs]\n\nwere   ultimately       able       to   cast     their    vote       with     the     fortuitous\n\nassistance of others, the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act is\n\n‘to     empower        individuals          with        disabilities             to     maximize\n\n                                                25\n\femployment,          economic         self-sufficiency,               independence,         and\n\ninclusion and integration into society’ . . . .

In enacting\n\nthe   ADA,      Congress      explicitly           found    that      “‘individuals        with\n\ndisabilities . . . have been . . . relegated to a position of\n\npolitical powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics\n\nthat are beyond the control of such individuals.’”                               Tennessee v.\n\nLane,     541     U.S.       509,        516      (2004)    (quoting        42     U.S.C.    §\n\n12101(a)(7)).         Ensuring that disabled individuals are afforded\n\nan opportunity to participate in voting that is equal to that\n\nafforded others, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130, helps ensure that those\n\nindividuals      are     never      relegated          to   a    position     of    political\n\npowerlessness.          We affirm the district court’s conclusion that\n\nby effectively requiring disabled individuals to rely on the\n\nassistance      of    others        to     vote    absentee,         defendants     have    not\n\n                                                  26\n\fprovided     plaintiffs     with    meaningful        access     to    Maryland’s\n\nabsentee voting program.\n\n\n\n                                      IV.\n\n      Determining    that    plaintiffs        have   been   denied    meaningful\n\naccess to absentee voting does not end our analysis.                     Not all\n\npublic      services,     programs,       or     activities      can    be    made\n\nmeaningfully accessible to all citizens, or at least they cannot\n\nbe made so without a prohibitive cost or unreasonable effort on\n\nthe part of the public entity.             For this reason, to prevail on\n\ntheir     ADA   claim,      plaintiffs         must   propose     a    reasonable\n\nmodification to the challenged public program that will allow\n\nthem the meaningful access they seek.                  See, e.g., Halpern v.\n\nWake Forest Univ.

Valley Cent.\n\nSch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1995))).                Determination of\n\nthe reasonableness of a proposed modification is generally fact-\n\nspecific.     Halpern, 669 F.3d at 464.\n\n       The   district   court   here   found    that    plaintiffs’     proposed\n\nmodification—the online ballot marking tool—was both reasonably\n\nsecure and reasonably accessible to disabled voters.                  Reviewing\n\nthe record as a whole, these findings do not appear clearly\n\nerroneous and we see no need to disturb them.                Further, although\n\nnot determinative by itself, the fact that a version of the tool\n\n       10\n        The regulations, however, do not require implementation\nof even reasonable modifications where the “public entity can\ndemonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally\nalter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).   We address defendants’ “fundamental\nalteration” defense below.\n\n\n                                       28\n\fwas voluntarily implemented by defendants in the 2012 elections—\n\n“without      any    apparent    incident,”     J.A.     1057—speaks         to   the\n\nreasonableness of using the tool.               Additionally, because the\n\ntool has already been developed, there does not appear to be any\n\nsubstantial cost or implementation burden that would need to be\n\nborne by Maryland to make the tool available for use.                        On the\n\nfacts before us, we conclude that plaintiffs’ proposed use of\n\nthe online ballot marking tool is a reasonable modification to\n\nMaryland’s absentee voting policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n                                       V.\n\n       Defendants      correctly     argue     that     even        a    reasonable\n\nmodification to Maryland’s absentee voting program need not be\n\nmade     if   that   modification     would    “fundamentally           alter”     the\n\nprogram.      See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); Halpern, 669 F.3d at\n\n464.     Defendants bear the burden of proving that the requested\n\nmodification would be a fundamental alteration to the program.\n\nSee 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).                After considering defendants’\n\narguments and reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that\n\nthey have not met this burden.\n\n       Defendants’     principal    argument    is     that    certification        of\n\nvoting    systems,    including     certification      of     the   online      ballot\n\nmarking tool under Election Law Section 9-308.1, is fundamental\n\nto     Maryland’s    voting     program.      They    argue     from     this     that\n\n                                       29\n\frequiring them to make the online ballot marking tool available\n\nfor plaintiffs’ use, where that tool has not yet received the\n\nstatutorily-required        supermajority     vote,   works    a   fundamental\n\nalteration to Maryland’s voting program.              Therefore, defendants\n\nargue, the district court abused its discretion in enjoining\n\nthem to make the tool available to plaintiffs.            We disagree. 11\n\n     As    an    initial    matter,    the   strong   form    of   defendants’\n\nargument—that the mere fact of a state statutory requirement\n\ninsulates       public   entities     from   making   otherwise     reasonable\n\nmodifications      to    prevent    disability   discrimination—cannot      be\n\ncorrect.    The Constitution’s Supremacy Clause establishes that\n\nvalid federal legislation can pre-empt state laws.                 Oneok, Inc.\n\nv. Learject, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1591, 1595 (2015) (citing U.S.\n\nConst. Art. VI, cl. 2).             The Supreme Court has held that the\n\nADA’s Title II, at least in certain circumstances, represents a\n\nvalid exercise of 14th Amendment powers, Lane, 541 U.S. at 533-\n\n34, and as such it trumps state regulations that conflict with\n\nits requirements.        As the Sixth Circuit has put it, “[r]equiring\n\npublic entities to make changes to rules, policies, practices,\n\nor services is exactly what the ADA does.”               Jones v. City of\n\n     11 Given our conclusion that use of the online ballot\nmarking tool does not fundamentally alter Maryland’s program, we\ndiscern no abuse of discretion in the district court’s decision\nto issue the injunction as the other factors to be considered\neasily weigh in favor of granting injunctive relief. Cf. Legend\nNight Club, 637 F.3d at 302-03.\n\n\n                                        30\n\fMonroe, MI, 341 F.3d 474, 487 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing Oconomowoc\n\nResidential Programs, Inc. v.

Certain requirements of state law could in\n\nfact be fundamental to a public program in a way that might\n\nresist    reasonable   modifications      otherwise    necessary   to    bring\n\nthat program into compliance with the ADA.            Defendants here urge\n\nthat Maryland’s statutory certification requirement is just such\n\nan example:      certification, they argue, goes to the very heart\n\nof the voting program by ensuring the integrity of the voting\n\nprocess    as   a    whole.      Public   confidence     in    elections     is\n\nundoubtedly     an   important   governmental    concern.       But   on    the\n\nrecord before us defendants simply have not established their\n\npremise, that is, that use of the online ballot marking tool\n\ndegrades the integrity of Maryland’s voting processes.\n\n                                     31\n\f      Put    another    way,     defendants     are   merging      Maryland’s\n\nprocedural certification requirement with substantive concerns\n\nabout whether the tool should be certified.            The mere fact that\n\na procedural requirement has not been met does not necessarily\n\nmean that the underlying substantive purpose of that requirement\n\nhas not been met.         The underlying question is fact-specific.\n\nSee, e.g., Halpern, 669 F.3d at 464-68; cf. Jones, 341 F.3d at\n\n480   (“In   cases     involving    waiver     of   applicable     rules   and\n\nregulations, the overall focus should be on whether waiver of\n\nthe rule in the particular case would be so at odds with the\n\npurposes behind the rule that it would be a fundamental and\n\nunreasonable    change.”       (quotation     omitted)).     The     relevant\n\ninquiry here is not whether certification qua certification is\n\nfundamental to Maryland’s voting program, but whether use of the\n\ntool without certification would be so at odds with the purpose\n\nof certification that such use would be unreasonable. 12\n\n      Here, the district court found, after a three-day bench\n\ntrial, that the tool is reasonably secure, safeguards disabled\n\nvoters’ privacy, and (in earlier versions at least) has been\n\n\n      12The problem with conflating procedure and substance here\ncan be illustrated by analogy to the archetypal physical\naccessibility modifications often associated with the ADA.    It\nwould   be   difficult  for  a   government   entity  to  resist\ninstallation of, for example, wheelchair ramps for a new\ncourthouse, solely by enacting a law requiring that ramps be\ncertified and then declining to certify any ramps.\n\n\n                                     32\n\fused in actual elections without apparent incident. 13                 We do not\n\nthink these findings are clearly erroneous and defendants have\n\nnot provided any substantial reasons that they should be called\n\ninto question.        Cf., e.g., Pepper, 663 F.3d at 215 (“[I]f the\n\ndistrict court's account of the evidence is plausible in light\n\nof the record in its entirety, we will not reverse the district\n\ncourt's finding simply because we have become convinced that we\n\nwould have decided the question of fact differently.” (quoting\n\nTFWS, Inc. v. Franchot, 572 F.3d 186, 196 (4th Cir. 2009))).                    On\n\nthe record as a whole, we do not conclude that use of the online\n\nballot      marking   tool   is    so   at    odds   with    the     purposes   of\n\ncertification that its use would be unreasonable.                  We agree with\n\nthe district court that defendants have not met their burden to\n\nshow that plaintiffs’ proposed modification—use of the online\n\nballot marking tool—would fundamentally alter Maryland’s voting\n\nprogram.\n\n\n\n                                        VI.\n\n       We recognize that some of the standard analytic language\n\nused     in   evaluating     ADA   claims—“failure      to    make     reasonable\n\naccommodations”; “denial of meaningful access”—carries with it\n\n\n       13\n        Nothing in the post-trial record indicates any problems\nwith the use of the tool by plaintiffs in the 2014 general\nelection subsequent to the district court’s decision.\n\n\n                                        33\n\fcertain   negative     connotations.         We   would   be    remiss     in    not\n\nhighlighting that the record is devoid of any evidence that the\n\ndefendants     acted   with   discriminatory        animus     in    implementing\n\nMaryland’s absentee voting program.               Indeed, we recognize that\n\nMaryland’s decision to provide “no excuse” absentee voting to\n\nall its citizens provides a benefit that is far from universal\n\nacross the United States.\n\n     However, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do more than\n\nsimply provide a remedy for intentional discrimination.                         They\n\nreflect broad legislative consensus that making the promises of\n\nthe Constitution a reality for individuals with disabilities may\n\nrequire even well-intentioned public entities to make certain\n\nreasonable accommodations.       Our conclusions here are not driven\n\nby   concern    that    defendants     are    manipulating          the   election\n\napparatus intentionally to discriminate against individuals with\n\ndisabilities; our conclusions simply flow from the basic promise\n\nof equality in public services that animates the ADA.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                                                          AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                     34\n\f",

A\n\nvoter may obtain a blank hardcopy absentee ballot by mail, fax,\n\nor by downloading and printing one from a website.                            The hardcopy\n\nballot must be marked by hand, signed, and returned via mail or\n\nhand-delivery to the voter’s local election board.\n\n     The         National        Federation    of     the    Blind      and     individual\n\ndisabled     Maryland          voters   sued   state       election   officials      under\n\nTitle   II       of    the    Americans     with    Disabilities      Act     (“ADA”)   and\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.                       Plaintiffs allege that\n\nmarking      a        hardcopy     ballot     by    hand    without      assistance      is\n\nimpossible for voters with various disabilities, and that they\n\nhave therefore been denied meaningful access to absentee voting.\n\nAfter a bench trial, the district court found that Maryland’s\n\nprogram,     as        then    structured,     did    not    comport     with     ADA   and\n\nRehabilitation           Act    requirements.        The     district    court     further\n\nfound that plaintiffs’ proposed remedy—the use of an “online\n\nballot marking tool” that would enable disabled voters to mark\n\ntheir ballots electronically—was a reasonable modification that\n\ndid not fundamentally alter Maryland’s absentee voting program.\n\nDefendant election officials now appeal all these aspects of the\n\ndistrict court’s decision.                For the reasons below, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                I.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Elections     in    the    State         of    Maryland    are    overseen       by   the\n\nState Board of Elections (“Board”).                         Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law\n\n§§ 2-101     to    102    (Westlaw        current          through      the    2015     Regular\n\nSession of the General Assembly) (“Elec. Law”).                                The Board is\n\ncomprised of five members.                  Elec. Law § 2-101(a).                   The Board\n\nappoints a State Administrator of Elections who is designated as\n\n“the     chief      State        election             official”       and     tasked         with\n\nadministering Maryland’s election apparatus.                          Id. § 2-103.\n\n       Maryland provides its voters with a number of different\n\nmeans to vote.            Maryland has nearly 2,000 polling places at\n\nwhich    a   voter       may     cast   a       ballot      on    Election      Day.         The\n\noverwhelming majority of these polling places are accessible to\n\nphysically disabled voters and are staffed with election judges\n\ntrained in serving voters with disabilities.                            The polling place\n\nvoting machines have a number of accessibility features designed\n\nto assist disabled voters in casting their ballots.                                 Maryland’s\n\nvoting machines allow voters to magnify the font of the ballot,\n\nto   alter   the     color     contrast,             and   to   position      the   interface\n\nscreen    such     that     voters      can          sit   down   while       casting    their\n\nballots.         The voting machines can also be programed for non-\n\nvisual access by means of an audio ballot; when using the audio\n\nfeatures     a    voter    receives         a    headset        and   numeric       keypad     to\n\n                                                 5\n\fnavigate the ballot choices.                Voters who desire assistance in\n\nmarking their ballots may be assisted by an individual of their\n\nchoosing or by an election judge (in the presence of an election\n\njudge of another political party).                 The voting machines are not\n\ncompatible with some common personal accessibility devices such\n\nas refreshable Braille displays.\n\n      Maryland also allows voters to vote in person for an eight-\n\nday   period      before    Election       Day   at    sixty-four     early   voting\n\npolling stations.          All of these early voting polling places are\n\nphysically accessible.\n\n      Finally, any Maryland voter may vote by absentee ballot.                     A\n\nvoter can obtain a ballot by mail, fax, or electronically by\n\ndownloading a ballot from a website.                  A voter who electronically\n\ndownloads    an    absentee       ballot    must      print   out   the   ballot   in\n\nhardcopy, mark their choices by hand, and then sign and return\n\nthe   hardcopy     ballot    to    their    local     board   of    elections.     An\n\nabsentee voter may designate an agent to pick up and deliver a\n\nballot.     Absentee voters may also have an individual of their\n\nchoice assist them in hand marking the ballot.\n\n\n\n                                           B.\n\n      Historically, as noted, an absentee voter who obtained an\n\nabsentee ballot electronically needed to print out the blank\n\nballot and mark their choices by hand on the printed hardcopy\n\n                                            6\n\fballot.       For several years, Maryland has been developing a piece\n\nof software referred to as an “online ballot marking tool.”                            The\n\ntool can be used by absentee voters who choose to obtain their\n\nabsentee ballots electronically; the tool enables voters to mark\n\ntheir       choices   electronically     and      then     print     out   a    completed\n\nballot. 1       When the ballot is printed, the voter’s selections\n\nappear on a number of pages followed by a separate signature\n\npage.       The voter must still sign the signature page and return\n\nthe    entire    hardcopy    ballot    to       the    local    board   of     elections.\n\nOnly printed and signed ballots received by a local board of\n\nelections are counted in determining the result of an election.\n\n       Maryland’s Board developed the online ballot marking tool\n\nover    a    number   of   years,   including          with    the   participation      of\n\nplaintiff       National    Federation      of    the     Blind.        The    Board   has\n\nsolicited feedback and implemented a number of usability and\n\naccessibility enhancements for disabled voters.                       The tool is not\n\ncompatible with all computer browsers or operating systems, but\n\ndoes function properly with a variety of reasonably up-to-date\n\nproducts.             Importantly      for            individuals       with     certain\n\n       1\n       The tool provides the voter an interface program on the\ncomputer they are using.    Voters mark their ballots using the\ncomputer program and are then presented with a review screen\nthat allows voters to verify that their selections are accurate.\nWhen a voter confirms the selections, the computer transmits the\ninformation to the state election board’s computer server. The\nserver generates a marked ballot in the form of a PDF file,\nwhich the voter can then print out.\n\n\n                                            7\n\fdisabilities, the ability to use the tool on their own computers\n\nmay enable them to use the personal assistive devices that they\n\nordinarily       use    to    interface     with     the       computer,     such     as    a\n\nrefreshable Braille display, to mark their ballot choices.\n\n\n\n                                            C.\n\n       An    early,     non-accessible       version          of   the    online    ballot\n\nmarking tool was available to absentee voters during Maryland’s\n\n2012    primary       elections.        Following    the       primary     elections,       a\n\nquestion arose as to whether the tool needed to be officially\n\ncertified pursuant to Maryland Election Law Section 9-102, which\n\nrequires certification of any “voting system” prior to use.                                The\n\nMaryland Attorney General provided an opinion that the tool did\n\nnot meet the statutory definition of a “voting system” and did\n\nnot require certification.               See Certification of Voting Systems\n\nDoes Not Apply to Absentee-Ballot-Marking Wizard, 97 Op. Md.\n\nAtt’y    Gen.    32    (2012).         However,    apparently       due    to   lingering\n\nconcerns over the status of the online ballot marking tool, the\n\nBoard    only    made     the    tool    available       to    certain     overseas     and\n\nmilitary absentee voters for the 2012 general election.                             Use of\n\nthe     tool    in     the    2012     primary     and     general        elections     was\n\napparently uneventful.\n\n       The     Maryland      General    Assembly    subsequently          clarified     the\n\nstatus of the tool.             In 2013, the General Assembly passed the\n\n                                            8\n\f“Improving Access to Voting Act,” 2013 Md. Laws Ch. 157, which,\n\namong other things, explicitly required the Board to certify any\n\nonline ballot marking tool prior to use by voters.                      See id.\n\n(codified at Elec. Law § 9-308.1).                 Certification requires a\n\nsupermajority:       at least four of the five members of the Board\n\nmust vote in favor of certification.             See Elec. Law § 2-102(c).\n\n     The Board continued to make improvements to the version of\n\nthe tool that had been used in the 2012 election cycle.                         In\n\nparticular, the Board implemented certain changes to make the\n\ntool more accessible to voters with disabilities.                 Additionally,\n\nin accordance with the 2013 Improving Access to Voting Act, the\n\nBoard hired an independent consultant, Unatek Inc. (“Unatek”),\n\nto perform security testing on the tool.                  Unatek produced a\n\nreport in December 2013 concluding that use of the tool was\n\nsecure.\n\n     In February 2014, the Board met and discussed the online\n\nballot    marking    tool.     The   Board    reviewed    the     December   2013\n\nUnatek report and interviewed the report’s author.                   Some Board\n\nmembers continued to express concerns about the security of the\n\ntool, and the Board did not hold a certification vote.\n\n     The     Board     subsequently        hired    a    second     independent\n\nconsultant,   Mainstay       Enterprises,    Inc.    (“Mainstay”),     to    audit\n\nthe Unatek security report.           The Mainstay audit concluded that\n\nUnatek’s    security     assessment        had     followed     industry     best\n\n                                       9\n\fpractices.    The Board also received and reviewed public comments\n\nand had Board staff obtain information on the use of similar\n\nballot marking tools in other states.\n\n     The certification issue was again discussed at the Board’s\n\nApril 2014 meeting.     At the meeting, Mainstay briefed the Board\n\non the results of its audit.      Some Board members continued to\n\nexpress concerns about certification and the Board did not take\n\na certification vote.\n\n\n\n                                 D.\n\n     On May 19, 2014, plaintiffs sued Linda Lamone, Maryland’s\n\nState Administrator of Elections, and the five Board members,\n\nall in their official capacities.     At the heart of plaintiffs’\n\nsuit are claims that Maryland’s absentee voting process violates\n\nthe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.      Plaintiffs sought both a\n\ndeclaratory judgment to that effect as well as an injunction\n\nrequiring state election officials to make the online ballot\n\nmarking tool available for use starting with the 2014 general\n\nelection. 2   The district court subsequently scheduled a bench\n\ntrial to begin on August 13, 2014.      The schedule would provide\n\n\n\n\n     2 Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction requiring\nelection officials to make the tool available for the June 24,\n2014 primary election.    The district court held a hearing on\nJune 11, 2014, and ultimately denied plaintiffs’ request.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fdefendants with sufficient time to implement the tool before the\n\n2014 general election in the event that plaintiffs prevailed.\n\n     While the suit was pending, the Board held a specially-\n\nscheduled    meeting     on    July   10,    2014,   with   one   Board    member\n\nabsent.     The four Board members in attendance voted 3 to 1 to\n\ncertify   the   online    ballot      marking   tool.       The   vote    did   not\n\nsatisfy the statutory supermajority requirement and the tool was\n\nnot certified.\n\n     The district court held a three-day bench trial beginning\n\non August 13, 2014. 3         The district court heard testimony on:            the\n\n\n\n\n     3 On August 1, 2014, less than two weeks before trial,\nseveral individuals and entities who were similarly situated to\nplaintiffs here filed a motion to intervene in the case.     The\nputative intervenors asserted similar ADA and Rehabilitation Act\nclaims, along with additional claims against Maryland state\nofficials    under   18 U.S.C. § 1983    for   various   alleged\nconstitutional violations. The putative intervenors argued that\ntheir rights had been violated in ways substantially similar to\nplaintiffs, but sought an almost diametrically opposed remedy—an\ninjunction barring certification of the online ballot marking\ntool.   Very broadly, the putative intervenors appeared to be\nconcerned that the tool plaintiffs sought to require Maryland to\nuse was not sufficiently accessible to disabled voters.\n     The district court held a conference with all parties and\nthe putative intervenors on August 8, 2014. With the agreement\nof the parties, the district court held the motion sub curia and\npermitted the putative intervenors to participate in the trial.\nIn its memorandum opinion in this case, the district court\nultimately granted the motion to the extent of the intervenors’\nparticipation up to and through trial, and considered the\nintervenors’ evidence and legal arguments in reaching its\ndecision; the district court denied the motion to the extent the\nintervenors sought to assert independent claims against the\ndefendants.   It does not appear that either the parties or the\n(Continued)\n                                        11\n\fdifficulties disabled voters have experienced while voting; the\n\nBoard’s development of the online ballot marking tool and the\n\nBoard’s   deliberation      over      certification;      the   accessibility     of\n\nthe tool for disabled voters; and the security risks posed by\n\nthe tool.\n\n     The district court found that “the evidence demonstrated\n\nspecific difficulties that some disabled voters have experienced\n\nwhile voting,” J.A. 1043, and that “under the current absentee\n\nballot    voting    program,    individuals       with    disabilities    such    as\n\nthose     of    the     Plaintiffs          cannot       vote      privately     and\n\nindependently.”        J.A. 1044.          The district court credited the\n\nresults    of   a   University        of   Baltimore     usability     study    that\n\nconcluded the tool was “highly accessible for disabled voters,”\n\nJ.A. 1047-48, though the district court acknowledged that two\n\nindividuals     testified      that    they     had   difficulty    accessing    and\n\nusing the tool during a public demonstration period.                    J.A. 1048.\n\nThe district court found the tool “compatible with reasonably\n\nup-to-date computer and screen access software,” “designed in\n\naccordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,” and\n\n“compatible     with   refreshable         Braille     displays.”       Id.

The district court found that the tool was “not\n\nwithout       some     security       risks”         including      that     “malware       could\n\nenable [a] third party to observe a voter’s selections” and that\n\n“a   voter’s         selections       could      be     captured       if    a     third    party\n\ninfiltrated          the    Board’s        server      during       the     time    a     voter’s\n\nselections and/or the printable ballot were being transmitted.”\n\nJ.A. 1049-50.          Additionally, “[t]here was no evidence at trial\n\nthat   the     online       ballot    marking         tool    had    been     tested       against\n\n                                                 13\n\fintentional        attempts   to     infiltrate         or   hack   into    the    Board’s\n\nserver or the tool.”          J.A. 1050.\n\n       The district court further found that “it is clear that\n\nmost voters may mark their absentee ballots without assistance”\n\nand that plaintiffs “should be afforded the same opportunity,\n\nbut the State’s current voting program does not allow for it.”\n\nJ.A. 1055.         Based on the facts found at trial, the district\n\ncourt concluded that plaintiffs had established that they had\n\nbeen denied meaningful access to absentee voting in Maryland in\n\nviolation     of     Title    II    of    the     ADA    and   Section     504     of    the\n\nRehabilitation Act.           The district court entered a declaratory\n\njudgment     for    plaintiffs       to   this     effect.      The    district      court\n\nfurther concluded that plaintiffs’ proposed remedy, access to\n\nthe online ballot marking tool, was a reasonable modification\n\nthat   did    not    fundamentally          alter   Maryland’s        voting      program.\n\nConsistent with these conclusions, the district court entered a\n\npermanent     injunction           prohibiting      defendants        from     violating\n\nplaintiffs’ rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and\n\nrequiring     defendants      to     make    the    online     ballot      marking      tool\n\navailable to plaintiffs for the 2014 general election.

Plaintiffs\n\nargue that the appropriate analytic scope is Maryland’s absentee\n\nvoting program.      Defendants urge analysis of Maryland’s voting\n\nprogram   in   its   entirety,   encompassing      the   various    voting\n\nalternatives—including    in-person    voting—available     to     Maryland\n\nvoters.   Defendants argue that even if absentee voting is not\n\nfully accessible, the full accessibility of Maryland’s in-person\n\npolling places provides disabled voters with meaningful access\n\nto voting.     As explained below, we conclude that defendants’\n\nproposed focus is overbroad and would undermine the purpose of\n\nthe ADA and its implementing regulations.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n     Defendants’     argument    for    holistic     consideration      of\n\nMaryland’s voting program is in some immediate tension with the\n\n\n\n\n362.   Defendants somewhat mischaracterize plaintiffs’ claims as\nadvancing a disparate impact theory of discrimination.       See,\ne.g., Br. of Appellants 38.    While some sort of disparity will\nnecessarily be present in cases of discrimination, that does not\nmean that all discrimination cases are legally evaluated as\n“disparate impact” cases; we do not interpret plaintiffs’\narguments as advancing a legal disparate impact theory (and the\ndistrict court did not evaluate them as such).      We understand\nplaintiffs to be pursuing their claims on the theory that\ndefendants have failed to make reasonable accommodations that\nwould   afford   disabled   individuals  meaningful   access   to\nMaryland’s absentee voting program.\n\n\n                                  17\n\ftext of the ADA.         Title II states that a disabled individual may\n\nnot be “excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\n\nof the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\n\nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”                              42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12132.        Defendants’ proposed focus on voting in its entirety\n\neffectively reads out much of this language, suggesting that\n\nTitle II prohibits only complete exclusion from participation in\n\nbroadly-defined          public    programs.             However,         Title    II     is\n\ndisjunctive.        By its own terms it is not limited only to public\n\n“programs”; it applies to “services, programs, or activities.”\n\nId.     (emphasis       added).        Title    II      does        not   only    prohibit\n\n“exclusion       from    participation”        in   a    public      program;     it    also\n\nseparately prohibits “den[ying] the benefits” of that program.\n\nId. 6       And in addition to those prohibitions, Title II separately\n\ngenerally       prohibits      “discrimination          by    any    [public]     entity.”\n\nId.          Although    the    bare    language         of    Title      II     does   not\n\ndefinitively resolve the question of appropriate scope, it does\n\n\n\n\n        6\n       The United States, as amicus, suggests that defendants\nwould still be in violation of Title II even were we to conclude\nthat Maryland’s entire voting program was “the” program subject\nto Title II’s requirements. We acknowledge that it is possible\nto view the ability to vote from the comfort of one’s home as\none of the “benefits” of Maryland’s overall voting program, the\ndenial of which benefit on the basis of disability might support\na Title II claim.   However, given our conclusion below that we\nmust evaluate Maryland’s absentee voting program directly, we\nneed not address the United States’s contention.\n\n\n                                          18\n\fsuggest     to    us     that      some     granularity        in     analytic      focus     is\n\nnecessary.\n\n      The Supreme Court has cautioned against defining the scope\n\nof a public benefit so as to avoid questions of discriminatory\n\neffects.

The logic of\n\nAlexander further suggests that we should proceed cautiously to\n\navoid defining a public program so generally that we overlook\n\nreal difficulties in accessing government services.\n\n      Also significant for our analysis of the proper scope of\n\nreview here is the fact that Maryland allows any voter to vote\n\nby   absentee      ballot.          Elec.     Law      §§    9-301,    9-304.

On the whole, then, we think it is far more natural to\n\nview absentee voting—rather than the entire voting program—as\n\nthe appropriate object of scrutiny for compliance with the ADA\n\nand the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n       Defendants’               remaining           arguments              against           this\n\nstraightforward conclusion are unpersuasive.                           Defendants cite an\n\nADA-implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a), which they\n\nassert    requires         a    reviewing    court       to    view    Maryland’s          voting\n\nprogram    “in       its       entirety.”        However,        the    cited        regulation\n\nexpressly pertains to “existing facilities.”                            See id.           On its\n\nface, this regulation simply provides that a public entity does\n\nnot have to make each of its facilities accessible as long as\n\nindividuals         with       disabilities      have     access       to    that        entity’s\n\noffered        public      services.             This     regulation           is        targeted\n\nprincipally at physical accessibility and allows a public entity\n\nto   provide        accessibility       alternatives           that    would       not    require\n\nlarge-scale architectural modifications of existing facilities.\n\nAccord     Constantine,           411   F.3d        at   489     (discussing          28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 35.150(a) and explaining that “structural changes in existing\n\nphysical        facilities”          are      “probably          the        most      expensive\n\nenterprise” in providing accessibility).\n\n       Other ADA-implementing regulations, however, are applicable\n\nhere     and    conflict         with   defendants’           proposed       focus       on   the\n\nentirety       of     Maryland’s        voting       program.

Subsection (b)(7) of the\n\nregulation requires public entities to make certain reasonable\n\nmodifications in “policies, practices, or procedures when the\n\nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis\n\nof disability”; this regulation clearly contemplates a focus on\n\naccessibility at a more granular level than entire government\n\nprograms—the    level    of   “policies,   practices,   and   procedures.”\n\nId. 7\n\n        Defendants also cite to three district court decisions from\n\nother circuits that they argue stand for the proposition that\n\nall aspects of a state’s voting program must be viewed together\n\nwhen analyzing an ADA claim.

It is\n\n        7\n       As another example, 28 C.F.R. § 35.160 states that “[a]\npublic entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure that\ncommunications with [disabled persons] are as effective as\ncommunications with others” and “shall furnish appropriate\nauxiliary   aids  and   services   where   necessary  to   afford\nindividuals with disabilities . . . an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program or\nactivity of a public entity.”       Id. § (a)(1), (b)(1).     The\nrequirement to provide “auxiliary aids and services” again\nsuggests to us that accessibility cannot be adequately assessed\nat the highest level of program abstraction. The United States\nargues that this particular regulation alone is a sufficient\nbasis to affirm the decision here.     Br. for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 17-19.     We think that the ADA itself and the\ngeneral anti-discrimination regulation discussed above provide\nthe most direct resolution in this case. We therefore need not\nconsider whether there might be other independent bases that\nsupport an ADA or Rehabilitation Act claim on the facts here.\n\n\n                                     21\n\fnot clear to us that the cited cases in fact support defendants’\n\nproposition; in any event, we find them unpersuasive.

After considering defendants’\n\narguments and reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that\n\nthey have not met this burden.\n\n       Defendants’     principal    argument    is     that    certification        of\n\nvoting    systems,    including     certification      of     the   online      ballot\n\nmarking tool under Election Law Section 9-308.1, is fundamental\n\nto     Maryland’s    voting     program.      They    argue     from     this     that\n\n                                       29\n\frequiring them to make the online ballot marking tool available\n\nfor plaintiffs’ use, where that tool has not yet received the\n\nstatutorily-required        supermajority     vote,   works    a   fundamental\n\nalteration to Maryland’s voting program.              Therefore, defendants\n\nargue, the district court abused its discretion in enjoining\n\nthem to make the tool available to plaintiffs.            We disagree. 11\n\n     As    an    initial    matter,    the   strong   form    of   defendants’\n\nargument—that the mere fact of a state statutory requirement\n\ninsulates       public   entities     from   making   otherwise     reasonable\n\nmodifications      to    prevent    disability   discrimination—cannot      be\n\ncorrect.

Certain requirements of state law could in\n\nfact be fundamental to a public program in a way that might\n\nresist    reasonable   modifications      otherwise    necessary   to    bring\n\nthat program into compliance with the ADA.            Defendants here urge\n\nthat Maryland’s statutory certification requirement is just such\n\nan example:      certification, they argue, goes to the very heart\n\nof the voting program by ensuring the integrity of the voting\n\nprocess    as   a    whole.      Public   confidence     in    elections     is\n\nundoubtedly     an   important   governmental    concern.       But   on    the\n\nrecord before us defendants simply have not established their\n\npremise, that is, that use of the online ballot marking tool\n\ndegrades the integrity of Maryland’s voting processes.\n\n                                     31\n\f      Put    another    way,     defendants     are   merging      Maryland’s\n\nprocedural certification requirement with substantive concerns\n\nabout whether the tool should be certified.            The mere fact that\n\na procedural requirement has not been met does not necessarily\n\nmean that the underlying substantive purpose of that requirement\n\nhas not been met.         The underlying question is fact-specific.\n\nSee, e.g., Halpern, 669 F.3d at 464-68; cf. Jones, 341 F.3d at\n\n480   (“In   cases     involving    waiver     of   applicable     rules   and\n\nregulations, the overall focus should be on whether waiver of\n\nthe rule in the particular case would be so at odds with the\n\npurposes behind the rule that it would be a fundamental and\n\nunreasonable    change.”       (quotation     omitted)).     The     relevant\n\ninquiry here is not whether certification qua certification is\n\nfundamental to Maryland’s voting program, but whether use of the\n\ntool without certification would be so at odds with the purpose\n\nof certification that such use would be unreasonable. 12\n\n      Here, the district court found, after a three-day bench\n\ntrial, that the tool is reasonably secure, safeguards disabled\n\nvoters’ privacy, and (in earlier versions at least) has been\n\n\n      12The problem with conflating procedure and substance here\ncan be illustrated by analogy to the archetypal physical\naccessibility modifications often associated with the ADA.    It\nwould   be   difficult  for  a   government   entity  to  resist\ninstallation of, for example, wheelchair ramps for a new\ncourthouse, solely by enacting a law requiring that ramps be\ncertified and then declining to certify any ramps.\n\n\n                                     32\n\fused in actual elections without apparent incident. 13                 We do not\n\nthink these findings are clearly erroneous and defendants have\n\nnot provided any substantial reasons that they should be called\n\ninto question.        Cf., e.g., Pepper, 663 F.3d at 215 (“[I]f the\n\ndistrict court's account of the evidence is plausible in light\n\nof the record in its entirety, we will not reverse the district\n\ncourt's finding simply because we have become convinced that we\n\nwould have decided the question of fact differently.” (quoting\n\nTFWS, Inc. v. Franchot, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1029461\"><a href=\"/opinion/1029461/tfws-inc-v-franchot/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (4th Cir. 2009))).                    On\n\nthe record as a whole, we do not conclude that use of the online\n\nballot      marking   tool   is    so   at    odds   with    the     purposes   of\n\ncertification that its use would be unreasonable.                  We agree with\n\nthe district court that defendants have not met their burden to\n\nshow that plaintiffs’ proposed modification—use of the online\n\nballot marking tool—would fundamentally alter Maryland’s voting\n\nprogram.\n\n\n\n                                        VI.\n\n       We recognize that some of the standard analytic language\n\nused     in   evaluating     ADA   claims—“failure      to    make     reasonable\n\naccommodations”; “denial of meaningful access”—carries with it\n\n\n       13\n        Nothing in the post-trial record indicates any problems\nwith the use of the tool by plaintiffs in the 2014 general\nelection subsequent to the district court’s decision.\n\n\n                                        33\n\fcertain   negative     connotations.         We   would   be    remiss     in    not\n\nhighlighting that the record is devoid of any evidence that the\n\ndefendants     acted   with   discriminatory        animus     in    implementing\n\nMaryland’s absentee voting program.               Indeed, we recognize that\n\nMaryland’s decision to provide “no excuse” absentee voting to\n\nall its citizens provides a benefit that is far from universal\n\nacross the United States.\n\n     However, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do more than\n\nsimply provide a remedy for intentional discrimination.                         They\n\nreflect broad legislative consensus that making the promises of\n\nthe Constitution a reality for individuals with disabilities may\n\nrequire even well-intentioned public entities to make certain\n\nreasonable accommodations.       Our conclusions here are not driven\n\nby   concern    that    defendants     are    manipulating          the   election\n\napparatus intentionally to discriminate against individuals with\n\ndisabilities; our conclusions simply flow from the basic promise\n\nof equality in public services that animates the ADA.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                                                          AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                     34\n\f</pre>",
