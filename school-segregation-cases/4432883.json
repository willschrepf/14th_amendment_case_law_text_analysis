The Solid Waste Disposal Act authorizes the Commission to issue\n     administrative orders under § 361.188 and § 361.272, but these orders are\n     not mutually exclusive and are subject to the same appellate provisions.\n\n2.   The Commission issued the Administrative Order for the Voda Site pursuant\n     to § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n\n3.   Judicial review of the Administrative Order for the Voda Site is\n     constitutional and appropriate under § 361.322 of the Solid Waste Disposal\n     Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - ix -\n\f           STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      A.     History of the Voda Site.\n\n      The Voda Petroleum State Superfund Site (the “Voda Site”) is comprised of\n\napproximately 6.12 acres located in Gregg County, Texas. (AR 2907.) The Voda\n\nSite was historically used by Voda Petroleum, Inc. as an oil blending and recycling\n\nfacility from approximately 1981 to 1991, when all operations ceased and the Voda\n\nSite was abandoned. (AR 3126.)\n\n      B.     EPA performs a removal action for the Voda Site.\n\n      In the mid-1990s, both the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and\n\nthe Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (“TNRCC”) investigated\n\nthe Voda Site to determine whether historic operations had resulted in the release\n\nof hazardous substances. (AR 3030, 3495.) Part of this investigation included a\n\nHazard Ranking System (“HRS”) evaluation of the Voda Site. (AR 3495.) The\n\nVoda Site scored a 23.6 on the HRS scale, which was too low to qualify the Voda\n\nSite for the federal Superfund program. (AR 3509.) Instead, the Voda Site was\n\nreferred in 1995 to EPA for an immediate removal action. (AR 3029.) EPA’s\n\nAction Memorandum seeking approval for the removal action indicated that\n\nfollowing the removal action “there is no potential for further state/local response.”\n\n(AR 3033.)\n\f      EPA conducted the removal action in 1996, removing drums and above-\n\nground tanks of grease and corrosive wastes, including associated soil exposed to\n\nthese materials, and backfilling with clean soil. (AR 943.) After the removal action\n\nwas complete, EPA’s contractor sampled both on-site soils and groundwater as\n\npart of a post-removal assessment. (AR 3127.) EPA issued a post-closure report\n\nconfirming the removal action had abated the imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment and that cleanup activities at the site had met EPA’s health based\n\ncleanup standards for industrial land usage. (AR 3128, 61877.) Following its\n\nremoval action, EPA sought recovery of its costs and entered into Administrative\n\nOrders of Consent (“AOCs”) with companies that EPA had named as potentially\n\nresponsible parties (“PRPs”) for the Voda Site. (AR 61852.)\n\n      C.    The TNRCC initiates the state listing process without\n            reevaluating the Voda Site following the EPA’s removal action.\n\n      More than four years after the EPA removal action, the TNRCC proposed\n\nthe Voda Site for listing on the Texas Superfund registry on November 17, 2000.\n\n(AR 46233.) Although the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (“SWDA”) requires\n\nthe agency to ensure that a site exceed 5.0 on the HRS score to proceed with\n\nlisting, the Commission did not re-score the Voda Site to account for the EPA’s\n\nwork. The Commission sent correspondence to certain entities it believed had\n\nhistorically shipped materials to the Voda Site. (AR 16708-16710.) The\n\nCommission asserted that each recipient was potentially responsible for\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fenvironmental investigation and eventual remediation at the Voda Site, informed\n\nthe recipients of the proposed listing, and included a Notice of Opportunity to\n\nMake Good Faith Offer to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study\n\n(“RI/FS”). (AR 08614-46109.) Several parties submitted written comments and\n\nobjections, noting that there was no empirical data to support an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment finding and no evidence to support listing the Voda Site\n\non the Texas Superfund registry. (AR 41577-41578.) Nevertheless, the State went\n\nforward with its plan to list the Voda Site.\n\n      D.     The TCEQ issues an administrative order for the Voda Site\n             pursuant to § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the SWDA.\n\n      A draft administrative order for the Voda Site was docketed for\n\nconsideration by the Commissioners at a public meeting of the Texas Commission\n\non Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”)1 on February 10, 2010. (AR 51125.) Agenda\n\nItem No. 7 pertaining to the Voda Site was described on the docket as\n\n“Consideration of a Final Administrative Order (Final Order) pursuant to Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code Sections 361.188 and 361.272 for the Voda Petroleum,\n\nInc. State Superfund Site….” (AR 51127.)\n\n      Charmaine Backens, counsel for the Executive Director of the TCEQ,\n\npresented the draft administrative order to the Commissioners. Following a brief\n\n1\n   The TNRCC was renamed the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality effective\nJanuary 1, 2004.\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdescription of the Voda Site and the remedial action plan, Backens testified that\n\n“the Executive Director respectfully requests…recommends [sic] issuing this\n\nAdministrative Order for remedial activities at the Voda Petroleum State\n\nSuperfund Site pursuant to Chapter 361, sections 188 and 272 of the Health and\n\nSafety Code.” (AR 50382.)\n\n      A handful of PRPs were granted approximately five minutes to address the\n\nCommissioners regarding the agenda item, in which they argued that the\n\nCommissioners should delay issuance of the administrative order and allow the\n\nparties to present evidence to the Commission. Id. Counsel for the Executive\n\nDirector responded that “the law governing this case does not provide for an\n\nadjudicatory hearing at this time” and noted that the Executive Director would not\n\ndirectly address these objections, suggesting instead that the appropriate remedy\n\nwas to appeal to the district court. Id.\n\n      The Commissioners followed the Executive Director’s recommendation and\n\non February 12, 2010, issued a unilateral administrative order for the Voda Site\n\npursuant to § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the SWDA (“the Order” or “AO”).\n\n(CR:29-108; App. A.) The AO named ExxonMobil and Shell—among\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fapproximately 350 other entities—as responsible parties and ordered them to pay\n\nthe TCEQ’s response costs for the Voda Site.2 Id.\n\n      E.     PRPs named in the AO seek a rehearing but are denied.\n\n      On March 12, 2010, Luminant, one of the parties named in the Order, filed a\n\nmotion for rehearing before the Commission. (AR 50870.) Luminant argued that\n\nthe SWDA requires the Commission to determine “the lowest cost alternative” to\n\nremediate the Voda Site and that another contractor was prepared to present a\n\nlower cost alternative remedy than had been adopted in the AO. (AR 50864.)\n\n      The TCEQ filed a written response to Luminant’s motion, first noting that\n\n“the Commission issued the Order pursuant to Tex. Health and Safety Code §§\n\n361.188 and 361.272 (West 2010).” (AR 49650; App B.) The TCEQ then argued\n\nthat Luminant was “not entitled to a rehearing because the law did not afford it a\n\nhearing in the first instance. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.274 (West\n\n2010) (stating that ‘[a]n administrative order under Section 361.272 does not\n\nrequire prior notice or an adjudicative hearing before the commission’.”) Id. To\n\ndrive the point home, the TCEQ concluded that “[b]ecause the Order was issued\n\nunder Sections 361.272 and 361.188 (Administrative Order 1), it did not require an\n\nadjudicative hearing before the Commission.” (AR 49650; App. B.) The\n\n2\n    Appellees ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Exxon Mobil Corporation, Pennzoil-Quaker State\nCompany, and Shell Oil Company are referred to collectively as “ExxonMobil and Shell”\nthroughout this brief.\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fCommission did not timely grant Luminant’s request, and the AO became final on\n\nApril 8, 2010. (AR 10.)\n\n       F.     ExxonMobil and Shell challenge the AO in Travis County District\n              Court.\n\n       On March 26, 2010, ExxonMobil and Shell filed their First Amended\n\nOriginal Petition appealing the AO in Travis County District Court. (CR:4-27;\n\nApp. C.)3 ExxonMobil and Shell challenged the AO and the Commission’s actions\n\nunder the SWDA as well as § 37.001 of the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct. Id.\n\n       On August 1, 2011, the TCEQ filed its Original Counter-Petition and Third-\n\nParty Petition, pleading as follows: “On February 12, 2010, the TCEQ issued an\n\nadministrative order (“the Order”) under §§ 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….”\n\n(CR:127-169; App. D.)4 The TCEQ brought claims for cost recovery against\n\nExxonMobil and Shell and other PRPs pursuant to § 361.197(d), an action to\n\nenforce the AO pursuant to § 361.321 and § 361.322(g), and injunctive relief\n\npursuant to § 361.273(2). Id.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Appellees filed their Original Petition on March 12, 2010. On May 18, 2010, the Amended\nPetition was consolidated, along with nine other lawsuits filed by a number of other entities\nnamed in the AO, into a new cause number. (CR:112-26.)\n4\n    The TCEQ has filed two “supplements” to its Original Petition. However, neither supplement\nrevised or amended the factual allegations discussed herein. (CR:450-54.)\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f       G.     The parties engage in broad discovery at the trial court.\n\n       Although the State now argues judicial review of the AO is limited to the\n\nTCEQ’s administrative record for the Voda Site, the State’s discovery at the trial\n\ncourt contained no such limitations. Consistent with their live pleadings5 and each\n\nsuccessive amended scheduling order, the State spent nearly four years pursuing\n\nunrestricted discovery on ExxonMobil and Shell. The Commission propounded\n\nextensive written discovery on ExxonMobil and Shell and deposed corporate\n\nrepresentatives for both entities on a wide variety of issues outside the\n\nadministrative record. (Supp. CR at ___ [TCEQ’s First Written Discovery to\n\nExxonMobil Corporation and Shell Oil Company (served on September 10, 2013)];\n\n(Supp. CR at ___ [TCEQ’s Notice of Oral Deposition (served on Sep. 20, 2012));\n\nTCEQ’s Notice of Oral Deposition (served on Oct. 4, 2012)]. The State also\n\nengaged in extensive expert discovery, designating eight state employee expert\n\nwitnesses, five non-state employee retained expert witnesses, and two non-retained\n\ntestifying expert witnesses which are presently identified to testify at trial, despite\n\nthe Commission’s current claim that the testimony of their own experts is actually\n\nirrelevant to the case. (Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on Environmental\n\nQuality’s Amended Designation of Experts (served on May 10, 2013)].\n\n5\n    Shortly before filing current Plea to the Jurisdiction, the Commission filed a Motion for\nLeave to Amend Pleadings and Discovery. However, the trial court denied this motion via\nwritten order on July 31, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f      H.    The State reverses course and argues that review is limited to an\n            administrative record.\n\n      On December 18, 2013—approximately four years after the case was filed—\n\nthe State filed a Motion for Revised Discovery Control Plan in the trial court.\n\n(Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Motion for\n\nRevised Discovery Control Plan (filed December 18, 2013)]. For the first time, the\n\nState advanced the argument that: (1) the AO was issued exclusively under §\n\n361.188 of the SWDA; and (2) judicial review of the AO was therefore limited to\n\nan administrative record the TCEQ was in the process of compiling. Id. The trial\n\ncourt rejected the State’s arguments and denied the motion via a written order\n\nsigned on March 4, 2014. The Commission did not seek an interlocutory appeal of\n\nthis order. (Supp. CR at ___ [Order Denying Motion for Revised Discovery\n\nControl Plan (filed March 4, 2014)].\n\n      On July 15, the TCEQ recycled precisely these same arguments in a new\n\nmotion restyled as a “Plea to the Jurisdiction.” (CR:729-859.) Although the State’s\n\nnewly-filed plea did not contain any reference to sovereign immunity—in fact, the\n\nwords “sovereign immunity” did not even appear in the motion—the State argued\n\nin a reply brief and at a subsequent hearing that because the AO was a strictly “188\n\nOrder” judicial review under any standard other than § 361.321 violated the state’s\n\nimmunity from suit. Following a hearing on this motion, the trial court rejected the\n\nmotion via written order on October 1, 2014. (CR:1151.)\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n      The TCEQ issued a unilateral administrative order pursuant to two\n\nprovisions of the SWDA—§ 361.188 and § 361.272—ordering ExxonMobil and\n\nShell to pay millions of dollars to reimburse the State’s remediation of the Voda\n\nSite. ExxonMobil and Shell were denied an adjudicatory hearing prior to issuance\n\nand had no opportunity to present experts or cross-examine the State’s witnesses\n\nregarding liability. Instead, the TCEQ invoked its broadest powers under the\n\nSWDA to block any hearing and attempted to hold persons named in the order\n\njointly and severally liable for response costs. For nearly four years, these were\n\nuncontested procedural facts while the parties litigated the case at the district court.\n\n      Following the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco, the TCEQ\n\nmade a strategic decision to expand the boundaries of that holding in this case.\n\nAlthough the AO was subject to judicial review based on a preponderance of the\n\nevidence at the district court, the State attempts to whitewash the AO’s history and\n\nthe Commission’s own pleadings by claiming that it actually issued the Order\n\nsolely under § 361.188, which the State believes now entitles it to pure substantial\n\nevidence review. But regardless of whether the Commission issued the Order\n\npursuant to § 361.188, § 361.272, or both, the SWDA presents the same appellate\n\nremedy for both orders, and nothing from the statutory history or current text\n\nindicates that these orders are mutually exclusive. Even if the SWDA did intend to\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fsplit appellate remedies between different SWDA administrative orders, there is no\n\ndoubt the TCEQ issued the AO for the Voda Site under § 361.272, and therefore\n\n§ 361.322 is the appropriate appellate provision.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco does nothing to change\n\nthis analysis. The City of Waco holding is limited to a threshold determination of\n\nwhether a third-party seeking to intervene in a permitting case is an “affected\n\nperson” sufficient to trigger a contested-case hearing. That case has no application\n\nto an appeal by parties named responsible in a unilateral administrative order,\n\nparticularly when the relevant statute already provides an appropriate standard of\n\nreview.\n\n      After spending an enormous amount of time and money prosecuting this\n\ncase as both a § 361.188 and § 361.272 Order, the State is now erroneously\n\nemboldened by City of Waco to believe it can simply issue Superfund enforcement\n\norders demanding millions of dollars in response costs without an agency hearing\n\nor de novo review at the district court. Instead, the State suggests that pure\n\nsubstantial evidence review of its own record is sufficient. But City of Waco deals\n\nsolely with a permitting issue rather than the more onerous cost recovery\n\nenforcement. Moreover, the plain language of the SWDA unequivocally waives\n\nsovereign immunity to judicial review of the Order and provides for de novo\n\nreview based on a preponderance of the evidence. In this type of action, City of\n\n\n\n                                       - 10 -\n\fWaco does nothing to relieve the State of its ultimate burden to prove liability.\n\nPotentially responsible parties are entitled to their day in court, and the trial court\n\nhas the power to hear their claims under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n\n                       STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n      ExxonMobil and Shell believe the Court is without jurisdiction to hear this\n\nappeal. A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the trial court’s power to adjudicate\n\nthe subject matter of the controversy. Heckman v. Williamson Cty., 369 S.W.3d\n\n137, 149 (Tex. 2012); Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex.\n\n2000). Black’s Law Dictionary defines “subject-matter jurisdiction” as\n\n“[j]urisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought; the extent to\n\nwhich a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things.” BLACK’S\n\nLAW DICTIONARY at 857 (7th ed. 1999). In the context of judicial review of an\n\nadministrative order, the issue of sovereign immunity requires an examination of\n\nwhether a statute provides a right to judicial review of agency action. Houston\n\nMun. Emps. Pension Sys. v. Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d 151, 158 (Tex. 2007).\n\n      There is no question that the SWDA authorizes judicial review of the AO in\n\nthis case and that the State has waived immunity from suit. The trial court has the\n\npower to either uphold or set aside the Order and to award attorneys’ fees to the\n\nprevailing party. What the parties actually dispute is precisely what evidence the\n\ntrial court may consider in reviewing the Order. The State asserts the trial court is\n\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\flimited to the Commission’s administrative record, while ExxonMobil and Shell\n\nargue that the trial court can consider new evidence through a trial de novo. The\n\nState’s plea is not a challenge to the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction, but\n\ninstead a maneuver to set the procedures the trial court will use to enter an order\n\nthat it unquestionably has the power to enter.\n\n      Assuming this evidentiary question did implicate the court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction, the State cannot maintain a plea to the jurisdiction in this case because\n\nits own pleadings defeat its claim. In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, the court\n\nmust not weigh the claims’ merits but should look to the pleadings and determine\n\nif they allege facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court’s jurisdiction to hear\n\nthe case. City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 378 (Tex. 2009); County of\n\nCameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555 (Tex. 2002). The State’s live pleadings\n\nindicate that “[t]he Texas Legislature has defined the sole method for appealing the\n\nOrder at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 361.322.” (CR:675-87: App. E.)\n\nExxonMobil and Shell agree, as their Amended Petition invokes § 361.322 and\n\nchallenges the TCEQ to prove—by a preponderance of the evidence—that\n\nAppellees are liable for the elimination of any release at the Voda Site. Therefore,\n\nthe court need not look past the parties’ own pleadings to determine that they have\n\nalleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate both that the Court has jurisdiction to\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fhear this case and that the appropriate standard of review and burden of proof can\n\nbe found in § 361.322 of the SWDA.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\nI.    Appellees’ Response to Appellant’s Issue One.\n\n      The Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (“SWDA” or “Act”) does not create\n\nmutually exclusive Superfund orders with separate waivers of sovereign immunity.\n\nAlthough the Act empowers the Commission to issue an administrative order\n\nbefore a remedial investigation/feasibility study has been conducted or at the\n\nconclusion of the state Superfund listing process, either type of administrative\n\norder is subject to the same appellate provisions.\n\n      A.     The TCEQ can issue administrative orders under § 361.188 and\n             § 361.272, and both share common attributes relevant to this\n             appeal.\n\n      The SWDA permits the Commission to issue an administrative order under\n\nSubchapter F regarding a site “that may constitute an imminent or substantial\n\nendangerment to public health and safety or the environment due to a release or\n\nthreatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.” Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.181 (West 2010). Pursuant to the Act, an Order issued\n\nunder § 361.188 comes at the conclusion of the listing process, which would\n\ninclude investigating the site proposed for listing and recommending a remedial\n\naction to cleanup any hazardous substances identified. Id. Such an order lists the\n\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fidentified site on the state registry and provides the necessary details regarding the\n\nproposed remedy for the hazardous substances found during the investigation. Id.\n\n      The Act also permits the Commission to issue an administrative order under\n\nSubchapter K “to a person responsible for solid waste if it appears that there is an\n\nactual or threatened release of solid waste that presents an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment.” Id. at\n\n§ 361.272. This administrative order need not necessarily come at the conclusion\n\nof the Commission’s investigation of a site believed to harbor hazardous\n\nsubstances. Instead, the order issued under § 361.272 must only identify a party\n\nallegedly responsible for “solid waste”—not hazardous substances—and order the\n\nparty “to take any action necessary to provide and implement a cost effective and\n\nenvironmentally sound remedial action plan designed to eliminate the release or\n\nthreatened release.” Id. at § 361.272(b)(2).\n\n      Although the power to issue administrative orders is found in two separate\n\nsections of the SWDA, the two provisions are not mutually exclusive. Nothing in\n\nthe statute forbids the Commission from issuing an administrative order listing a\n\nsite alleged to contain “hazardous substances” and to issue that same order to a\n\nperson responsible for “solid waste” that presents an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment. Moreover, both types of orders share elements outlined in\n\nSubchapters I, K, and L of the Act, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\f    The four-part definition of a “person responsible for solid waste.” Tex.\n     Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.271 (West 2010);\n\n    Statutory defenses to liability. Id. at § 361.275;\n\n    Apportionment of liability among potentially responsible parties. Id. at\n     § 361.276; and\n\n    An appellate provision. Id. at § 361.322.\n\n      Although the power to issue administrative orders can be found in two parts\n\nof the SWDA—and orders under each subsection can arise at different times in\n\nresponse to different threats to human health or the environment—the essential\n\nfeatures relevant to this appeal remain the same, and nothing within the SWDA\n\nmakes § 361.188 and § 361.272 orders mutually exclusive.\n\n      B.    The statutory history of the SWDA shows that administrative\n            orders have always been subject to the same appellate standards.\n\n            1.     The original SWDA established a permitting program to\n                   regulate solid waste.\n\n      The SWDA was enacted in 1969 to control “the collection, handling,\n\nstorage, and disposal” of solid waste. Act approved June 2, 1969, 61st Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 405, 1969 Tex. Gen. Laws 1320, 1320 (repealed 1989) recodified by Act\n\napproved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 678, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230 (App.\n\nF.) In its original form, the SWDA divided powers between two state agencies—\n\nthe Texas State Department of Health was tasked with regulating municipal solid\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\fwaste while the Texas Water Quality Board was assigned industrial solid waste. Id.\n\nat 1321 (App. F.) The original statute gave broad power to these agencies to:\n\n         “require and issue permits authorizing and governing the\n          operation and maintenance of sites used for the disposal of solid\n          waste,” including the power to “revoke or amend any permit\n          issues.” Id. at 1322. (App. F.); and\n\n         “establish minimum standards of operation for all aspects of\n          the management and control” of solid waste, including the\n          “collection, handling, storage, and disposal by incineration,\n          sanitary landfill, composting, or other method.” Id. at 1323. (App.\n          F.)\n\n      To effectuate enforcement, the Act imposed civil penalties for entities that\n\nengaged in the “collection, storage, handling, or disposal of solid waste, or the use\n\nor operation of a site for the disposal of solid waste, in violation of the Act.” Id. at\n\n1326-27. (App. F.) Any “person affected by any ruling, order, decision, or other act\n\nof the department or the board” enjoyed the right to “appeal by filing a petition in\n\nthe district court of Travis County.” Id. at 1328. (App. F.) The original SWDA\n\ncontained no definition for the term “person affected,” opening the door for a\n\nbroad judicial interpretation of standing to appeal permitting decisions. However,\n\nthe Legislature addressed this shortcoming in the following session, adding a\n\ndefinition for “person affected” as:\n\n      “any person who is a resident of a county in which a site, facility, or\n      plant is to be located including any person who is doing business or\n      owns land in the county or adjacent or contiguous county and any\n      local government. Such person affected shall also demonstrate that he\n      has suffered or will suffer actual injury economic damage.”\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\fAct approved June 15, 1973, 63rd Leg., R.S., ch. 576, 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1595\n\n(current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.003(24) (West 2010))\n\n(App. G.)\n\n      Missing from the original statute was the power to issue administrative\n\norders like the Order at issue in this case. As enacted, the SWDA did not empower\n\nthe state to clean up sites contaminated with solid waste or hazardous substances\n\nand to order persons the state believed responsible for solid waste to execute and/or\n\nfund such a cleanup. Instead, the statute regulated solid waste through the\n\npermitting program. Although a person affected by a permitting decision could\n\nseek judicial review under 8(g), this clause was not applicable to an administrative\n\norder to clean up a contaminated site simply because the SWDA did not grant the\n\npower to issue any such order under the terms of the original act.\n\n             2.    Following the Congressional passage of CERCLA, the\n                   Texas legislature amended the SWDA to create a Texas\n                   state Superfund program.\n\n      The United States Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) in 1980, giving the\n\nfederal government the power to identify parties responsible for the release of\n\nhazardous substances and compel those parties to clean up the sites via\n\nadministrative orders or civil actions. 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 9601–9628. CERCLA also\n\npermitted the government to clean up contaminated sites using the Superfund—a\n\n\n\n                                       - 17 -\n\ftrust fund—and then recover costs from responsible parties through civil litigation.\n\nId. CERCLA was triggered by the presence of abandoned hazardous waste dump\n\nsites like the infamous Love Canal site in New York. A critical feature of\n\nCERCLA was the creation of a broad liability scheme under which parties who\n\narranged for disposal of waste (i.e, a dump site’s customers) and transporters of the\n\nwaste could be found jointly and severally liable for all remediation costs. No\n\nlonger was liability limited to the site’s permit holder or operator. United States v.\n\nBestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 55-56 (1998).\n\n      Five years after the passage of CERLCA, the Texas Legislature created the\n\nstate’s own Superfund program through a 1985 amendment to the SWDA. Act\n\napproved June 12, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 566, 1985 Tex. Gen. Laws 2166\n\n(repealed 1989) recodified by Act approved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch.\n\n678, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230 (App. H.). Like CERCLA, the new provisions of\n\nthe SWDA created a broad liability scheme under which those who arrange for\n\ndisposal of waste or transport of waste can be held liable for remediation costs at\n\nsites they do not own or operate. See, e.g., R.R. Street & Co. v. Pilgrim Enters.,\n\n166 S.W.3d 232, 238 (Tex. 2005) (“SWDA, like CERCLA, provides mechanisms\n\nfor the clean-up of solid waste and for both governmental entities and private\n\nparties to recover clean-up costs from those responsible for the waste.”). However,\n\ninstead of having the new liability scheme stand separately from the existing solid\n\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\fwaste permitting statute as Congress had done, the Texas Legislature embedded\n\nthese new provisions into the SWDA.\n\n         The 1985 amendments expanded the SWDA beyond permitting and\n\nempowered the state to issue administrative orders to persons responsible for solid\n\nwaste,\n\n         “restraining such person or persons from allowing or continuing the\n         threatened release and requiring those persons to take actions\n         necessary to provide and implement a cost effective and\n         environmentally sound remedial action plan to designed to eliminate\n         the release or threatened release.”\n\nAct approved June 12, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 566, 1985 Tex. Gen. Laws 2166,\n\n2176 (repealed 1989) recodified by Act approved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 678, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230 (App. H.)\n\n         The 1985 amendments further empowered the state to survey and list “every\n\nhazardous waste facility which may constitute an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment to public health and safety or the environment” and provided\n\nguidelines for the “cleanup of a facility identified.” Id. at 2178, 2180 (App. H.)\n\nWithin those guidelines, the state was empowered as follows:\n\n         “whenever the department of water resources finds that there exists an\n         actual or threatened release of hazardous wastes at a hazardous facility\n         listed on the registry that presents an imminent and substantial\n         endangerment to the public health and safety of the environment, it\n         may order the owner and/or operator of such facility and/or any other\n         person responsible for the release or threatened release at such facility\n         (A) to develop a remedial action program, subject to the approval of\n         the department of water resources, at such facility; and (B) to\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\f      implement such program within reasonable time limits specified in the\n      order.”\n\nId. at 2180 (App. H.) To ensure the same basic elements for all administrative\n\norders issued under the new amendments, the statute made clear that “[t]he\n\nprovisions in Sections 8(g), 9, 10, and 11 of this Act relating to administrative\n\norders shall apply to orders issued pursuant to this paragraph.” Id. (App. H.)\n\n      The 1985 amendments also added a new appellate provision to the SWDA to\n\nexclusively cover administrative orders issued pursuant to the new Superfund\n\nprogram. While leaving the earlier appellate provision for the permitting program\n\nunchanged, the new Section 9 placed the burden of proof on appeal of an\n\nadministrative order squarely on the state, providing that:\n\n      “The district court shall uphold an administrative order issued\n      pursuant to Section 8(g) if the department or the department of water\n      resources, by a preponderance of the evidence, proves: (1) that there is\n      an actual or threatened release of solid waste that is an imminent and\n      substantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the\n      environment; and (2) that the person made subject to the\n      administrative order is liable for the elimination of the release or\n      threatened release, in whole or in part.”\n\nId. at 2177 (App. H.)\n\n      In short, the 1985 amendments established the modern state Superfund\n\nprogram, empowering the state to issue administrative orders and seek to recover\n\nits costs under a handful of different circumstances, but made both types of orders\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 20 -\n\fsubject to certain procedural baselines, found in sections 8(g), 9, 10, and 11 of the\n\nrevised statute, including:\n\n    A standard definition for persons responsible for solid waste. Id. at 2176\n     (App. H.);\n\n    Allowing persons responsible for solid waste to prove a statutory defense by\n     a preponderance of the evidence. Id. (App. H.);\n\n    Allowing persons responsible for solid waste to prove that the release is\n     divisible, therefore avoiding the consequences of joint and several liability.\n     Id. at 2176-77 (App. H.); and\n\n    Granting the right to appeal an administrative order and placing the burden\n     on the state based on a preponderance of the evidence for the appeal. Id. at\n     2177 (App. H.)\n\n      Nothing in the 1985 amendments gave the State the power to issue\n\nadministrative orders under the new Superfund program without these provisions.\n\n      Subsequent amendments to the SWDA further clarified both the burden of\n\nproof for an appeal of an administrative order and the class of persons who could\n\nfile such an appeal. The Legislature narrowed the standing for appeal of an\n\nadministrative order in 1989 to “any person subject to an administrative order\n\nunder 8(g),” replacing earlier language that effectively allowed any person to file a\n\npetition appealing an administrative order issued under that provision. Act\n\napproved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 703, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 3212, 3217\n\n(current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322 (West 2010)) (App.\n\nI.) The same bill clarified the standard of review for challenging the remedy\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fselection, adding a subsection “(h) If the appropriateness of the selected remedial\n\naction is contested in the appeal of the administrative order, the remedial action\n\nshall be upheld unless the court determines that the remedy is arbitrary or\n\nunreasonable.” Id. at 3217 (App. I.) The bill also revised subsection (e), clarifying\n\nthat an appeal “does not prevent the state agency issuing the administrative order\n\nfrom proceeding with the remedial action program under Subchapter F unless the\n\ncourt enjoins the remedial action under its general equity jurisdiction.” Id. (App. I.)\n\n             3.     The codified SWDA makes all administrative orders subject\n                    to these same provisions.\n\n      Following codification, the SWDA retained the same procedural framework\n\noutlined above. The procedure to list a site on the state Superfund list was\n\nreorganized under “Subchapter F: Registry and Cleanup of Certain Hazardous\n\nWaste Facilities.” The procedural building blocks of an administrative order\n\ndiscussed above were reorganized into “Subchapter I: Enforcement, Administrative\n\nOrders Concerning Imminent and Substantial Endangerment.” The appellate\n\nprovision was reorganized under “Subchapter K. Appeals; Joinder of Parties.” The\n\nCommission retained the power to issue an administrative order either before or\n\nafter the listing process, but all administrative orders retained these elements.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\f      C.     The current statute does not create mutually exclusive orders with\n             separate waivers of sovereign immunity.\n\n      The State’s brief traces largely the same statutory history, but erroneously\n\nconcludes that the Legislature intended to create “two types of Superfund order”\n\nthat the State argues are “separate and distinct.” (Appellant’s Brief at 9.) The State\n\nargues that the two types of orders are mutually exclusive for three reasons:\n\n(1) they are contained in different sections; (2) they are expressed in different\n\nlanguage; and (3) they are subject to different appellate provisions that present an\n\nirreconcilable conflict. Id. But as discussed below, none of these factors support\n\nthe conclusion that the Legislature intended to create mutually exclusive Superfund\n\norders with separate appellate provisions, and the statutory history combined with\n\nthe current structure of the Act lead to precisely the opposite conclusion.\n\n             1.    Appearing in different sections using different language\n                   does not make the orders mutually exclusive.\n\n      Although the Act empowers the TCEQ to issue orders in more than one part\n\nof the statute, the text is clear that parties named in both § 361.188 and § 361.272\n\norders are subject to certain procedural protections which the TCEQ cannot\n\nrevoke. This was true when the 1985 amendments creating the Superfund program\n\nwere passed and remains true through the modern codification of the statute.\n\nPursuant to § 361.188(b), “the provisions in Subchapters I, K, and L relating to\n\nadministrative orders apply to orders issued under this section.” Tex. Health &\n\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fSafety Code Ann. § 361.188(b) (West 2010). This is the same cross-reference that\n\nwas in the statute when it was enacted in 1985. This incorporation of Subchapters\n\nI, K, and L into “orders issued under this section” is not limited to what the State\n\nself-servingly identifies as “relevant provisions.” (Appellant’s Brief at 16.) Instead\n\nit is open ended and inclusive, and demonstrates that the Legislature intended all\n\n“administrative orders” of the SWDA to share common procedural attributes,\n\nincluding the same appellate provisions. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 361.188(b) (West 2010).\n\n      The structural link between orders issued under § 361.188 and § 361.272 is\n\nnot limited to this provision. Just as section § 361.188 of Subchapter F directly\n\nincorporates Subchapters I, K, and L, a similar link between the two types of\n\norders is found within Subchapter K at § 361.322. That appellate provision—\n\nlimited to administrative orders issued under the Superfund program—states that\n\n“[t]he filing of the petition does not prevent the commission from proceeding with\n\nthe remedial action program under Subchapter F unless the court enjoins the\n\nremedial action under its general equity jurisdiction.” Tex. Health & Safety Code\n\nAnn. § 361.322(e) (West 2010). Therefore, if the Commission issues an\n\nadministrative order before it has commenced with the remedial action program\n\nunder § 361.272, that cleanup program can continue just as it would have if the\n\norder was issued under § 361.188 during the pendency of the appeal.\n\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\f      Although they appear in different sections of the Act and are expressed in\n\ndifferent language, § 361.188 and § 361.272 do not create mutually exclusive\n\norders. Instead, regardless of whether a Superfund order comes at the conclusion of\n\nthe listing and remedy selection process through § 361.188 or instead prior to the\n\nremedial action program through § 361.272, the SWDA guarantees certain\n\nprotections to persons the state believes are responsible for solid waste.\n\n             2.     The SWDA appellate provisions distinguish between\n                    appeals of Superfund orders and appeals of permitting\n                    decisions, not separate kinds of Superfund orders.\n\n      The State contends that because there are two separate appellate provisions\n\ncontained within the SWDA, the Legislature must have intended that a different\n\nappellate provision would apply to each type of Superfund order, and thus the\n\norders are mutually exclusive. However, the State’s argument misunderstands the\n\nstructure of the SWDA and the role both provisions play in the context of the entire\n\nAct. The two appellate provisions are principally aimed at different types of orders\n\nor actions of the Commission. Therefore, they grant appellate remedies to different\n\ncategories of parties, establish different timetables to perfect an appeal, and feature\n\ndifferent burdens of proof and standards of review.\n\n      Section 361.321 of Subchapter K tracks the language of the 1969 Act and\n\nstates that “a person affected by a ruling, order, decision, or other act of the\n\ncommission may appeal the action by filing a petition in a district court of Travis\n\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fCounty.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.321(a) (West 2010). The appeal\n\nmust be perfected within 30 days of the date that the offending act of the\n\nCommission occurs. Id. at § 361.321(b). The provision grants an appellate remedy\n\nnot limited to formal commission orders, but to virtually any action by the\n\nCommission. An appellant under § 361.321 is not a named party subject to an\n\nadministrative order, but instead is “a person affected” by the actions of the\n\nCommission. Id. at § 361.321(b). The SWDA defines a “person affected” as one\n\nwho “has suffered or will suffer actual injury or economic damage and, if the\n\nperson is not a local government: (A) is a resident of a county, or a county adjacent\n\nor contiguous to the county, in which a solid waste facility is to be located; or\n\n(B) is doing business or owns land in the county or adjacent or contiguous county.”\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.003(24) (West 2010).\n\n      The modern § 361.321 does not state that it is limited to—or even applicable\n\nto—administrative orders for Superfund cases. Id. at § 361.321(b). This is entirely\n\nconsistent with its statutory history, as the provision was adopted with the original\n\nversion of the SWDA in 1969, which did not empower the state to identify parties\n\nresponsible for the release of solid waste and to compel those parties to clean up\n\nwaste sites. As discussed above, the codified SWDA retains a solid waste\n\npermitting program distinct from the Superfund program that allows the\n\nCommission to issue permits for the construction, operation, and maintenance of\n\n\n\n                                       - 26 -\n\fsolid waste disposal facilities. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.061\n\n(West 2010). Hence, § 361.321 is directed at parties aggrieved by this permitting\n\nprocess who can show that they meet the economic injury test under the statute—it\n\nis not directed at parties named liable in Superfund orders. Both its statutory\n\nhistory and its current role in the SWDA demonstrate clear legislative intent that\n\n§ 361.321 is the appellate provision for the permitting program, not the Superfund\n\nprogram. See, e.g., Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. Sierra Club, 70\n\nS.W.3d 809, 811 (Tex. 2002) (appeal of solid waste permitting decision under\n\n§ 361.321 following contested-case hearing at the agency); TJFA, L.P. v. Tex.\n\nComm’n on Envtl. Quality, No. 03-10-00016-CV, 2014 WL 3562735, at *1 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin July 16, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.) (same).\n\n      In contrast, § 361.322 applies to “an administrative order issued under\n\n361.272” of the SWDA. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322(a) (West\n\n2010). Instead of 30 days under § 361.321(b), the appeal must be perfected within\n\n45 days of receipt of the order. Id. The section does not authorize appeals of solid\n\nwaste permits or other Commission actions, but is limited to administrative orders\n\nissued under the Superfund program. Id.; see also Sierra Club, 70 S.W.3d at 812\n\n(noting that § 361.322 was “not applicable” to appeal of permit decision). Instead\n\nof restricting appeals to a “person affected” by a Commission action as defined in\n\nthe statute, § 361.322 is limited to a person “subject to” the administrative order on\n\n\n\n                                        - 27 -\n\fappeal. Id. This too is consistent with the statutory history of the SWDA, as the\n\nLegislature created both the power to issue administrative Superfund orders and\n\nthe right to appeal those orders within the 1985 amendments, granting the same\n\nappellate remedy for all Superfund orders. The State has never enjoyed the power\n\nto issue these administrative orders without the appellate provisions of the modern\n\n§ 361.322.\n\n             3.    Forcing all appeals of Superfund orders into § 361.321\n                   creates an absurd result.\n\n      Ignoring the plain language of § 361.188(b)—which incorporates “all\n\nprovisions relating to administrative orders” into § 361.188 orders—the State\n\nsuggests that “[t]he proper reading of this section is that the relevant provisions of\n\nthe other subchapters apply to Section 361.188 orders, to the extent they do not\n\ncreate contradictions or absurd results.” (Appellant’s Brief at 16.) Yet at the same\n\ntime, the State asks the Court to force Superfund appeals into an appellate\n\nprovision explicitly limited to entities surrounding the geographic area in which “a\n\nsolid waste facility is to be located.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 361.003(24) (West 2010). But the statutory history of both appellate provisions\n\nshows that the Legislature never intended to force appeals of Superfund orders into\n\nthe preexisting regime for permitting decisions. The separate appellate provisions\n\nof Subchapter K were adopted alongside their respective programs—the permitting\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fprogram and the Superfund program—to provide appellate remedies to parties\n\naggrieved by either type of agency action.\n\n      Taking the State’s argument to its logical conclusion, a party’s standing to\n\nappeal a Superfund order under the SWDA would not depend on whether or not\n\nthe entity was named in the administrative order per § 361.322, but instead would\n\nturn on the entity’s geographic nexus to the site at issue pursuant to § 361.321.\n\nAssuming the site in question even qualified as a “solid waste facility” under the\n\nAct, parties who owned land or did business within the defined geographic zone\n\nwould have a right to appeal, while parties missing this geographic link would\n\nhave no clear appellate remedy. At the same time, the Commission is free to\n\nidentify and name in an administrative order persons it believes responsible for\n\nsolid waste without regard to their geography, and order them to remediate the site\n\nor pay the State’s response costs. No such concept exists in the CERLCA\n\njurisprudence, and the Legislature never intended to create such an anomalous\n\nappellate scheme for the Texas program.\n\nII.   Appellees’ Response to Appellant’s Issue Two.\n\n      The Administrative Order for the Voda Site was issued under both § 361.188\n\nand § 361.272 of the SWDA. The AO is directed at both solid wastes and\n\nhazardous substances, and plainly invokes the TCEQ’s powers under § 361.188\n\nand § 361.272. Immediately before and after the AO was issued, the Commission\n\n\n\n                                       - 29 -\n\funambiguously declared that it issued the Order pursuant to both sections of the\n\nAct, and the TCEQ has unequivocally pled the same procedural facts throughout\n\nthis litigation. In fact, the Commission’s live pleadings state that the Order was\n\nissued under both § 361.188 and § 361.272 and that the sole method for appealing\n\nthe Order resides at § 361.322. Therefore, even if the State were correct that\n\n§ 361.188 and § 361.272 orders are subject to different appellate provisions, the\n\nAO for the Voda Site was issued under § 361.272, making application of § 361.322\n\nappropriate for this Order.\n\n      A.     The language of the AO demonstrates the Order was issued under\n             § 361.188 and § 361.272.\n\n      The language used by the TCEQ in the AO demonstrates the Commission’s\n\nintent and action to issue the Order under both § 361.188 and § 361.272. The very\n\nfirst paragraph of the AO invokes the Commission’s power to issue the Order “as\n\nauthorized by Sections 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act.” (CR:29; App. A.) In\n\ndetailing the Chemicals of Concern at the Voda Site, the AO specifically invokes\n\n“Sections 361.271 through 361.277 and 361.343 through 361.345” of the SWDA.\n\n(CR:48; App. A.) The Order also names ExxonMobil and Shell as “responsible\n\nparties (‘RPs’) pursuant to Section 361.271 of the Act” (CR:29; App. A.) and\n\nannounces the TCEQ’s conclusion that the “release or threatened release… has not\n\nbeen proven to be divisible pursuant to Section 361.276 of the Act.” (CR:50; App.\n\nA.) In the event there are disagreements between the Agreeing Respondents and\n\n\n                                      - 30 -\n\fthe Executive Director, the AO states such disagreements will be handled pursuant\n\nto “Sections 361.321 and/or Sections 361.322 of the Act.” (CR:86; App. A.) And\n\nthe AO orders Respondents to preserve records “relating to each Respondent’s\n\npotential liability or to any other person’s potential liability for the Site under\n\nSection 361.271 of the Act.” (CR:78; App. A.) All of these provisions flatly\n\ncontradict the State’s position that the AO was issued solely under § 361.188.\n\n      The dual nature of the AO is even more apparent when looking at the\n\nmaterials the Commission alleges are present at the Voda Site. Subchapter F of the\n\nSWDA authorizes the TCEQ to identify and list sites where the release of\n\n“hazardous substances” has allegedly endangered public health. Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.181(a) (West 2010). The term “solid waste” does not\n\nappear within §§ 361.181-361.188 of the SWDA, which instead is focused\n\nexclusively on the listing, cleanup, and remediation of sites containing “hazardous\n\nsubstances.” Id. In contrast, Subchapter K authorizes the Commission to issue an\n\norder to a person responsible for “solid waste” if a release of “solid\n\nwaste…presents an imminent and substantial endangerment.” Id. at § 361.272.\n\nThis provision makes no mention of hazardous substances.\n\n      The AO for the Voda Site is not limited to “hazardous substances” as would\n\nbe expected for an order limited solely to § 361.188, but instead declares parties\n\nresponsible for “the solid waste and/or hazardous substances at the Site.” (CR:29;\n\n\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fApp. A.) The AO declares that certain substances “which are found at the Site, are\n\nsolid wastes as defined in Section 361.003(34) of the Act” and further alleges that\n\nthe PRPs are responsible for “solid wastes [that] were stored, processed, disposed\n\nof, or discarded at the Site.” (CR:50; App. A.)\n\n      B.     Counsel for the Executive Director asked the Commissioners to\n             issue the Order under both § 361.188 and § 361.272.\n\n      The State argues that “the TCEQ intended to issue a Section 361.188 order.”\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 23.) Yet the words of the counsel for the Executive Director\n\nof the TCEQ—immediately before, during, and immediately after the AO was\n\nissued—demonstrate the Commission’s intent to issue the AO pursuant to both\n\n§ 361.188 and § 361.272, and a clear understanding that the TCEQ had done just\n\nthat. The Commission’s agenda item for the Voda Site was docketed as\n\n“Consideration of a Final Administrative Order (Final Order) pursuant to Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code Sections 361.188 and 361.272 for the Voda Petroleum,\n\nInc. State Superfund Site….” (AR 51127: App. J (emphasis added).) When counsel\n\nfor the Executive Director presented the administrative order to the Commission,\n\nshe asked the Commissioners to issue the order “pursuant to Chapter 361, sections\n\n188 and 272 of the Health and Safety Code.” (AR 50382 (emphasis added).) And\n\nwhen the TCEQ opposed Luminant’s rehearing request, it argued that “[b]ecause\n\nthe Order was issued under Sections 361.272 and 361.188 (Administrative Order\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 32 -\n\f1), it did not require an adjudicative hearing before the Commission.” (AR 49650;\n\nApp. B (emphasis added).)\n\n      C.     Understanding that the AO invokes both § 361.188 and § 361.272,\n             the State described the Order as having been issued under both\n             sections for years.\n\n      Since this case was filed in 2010, the State has understood the true nature of\n\nthe Order by repeatedly and unequivocally pleading that the AO was issued under\n\nboth § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the SWDA. These statements appeared in the\n\nTCEQ’s Original Counter-Petition and Third-Party Petition, Response to Plea in\n\nAbatement, Motions for Entry of Default, and their Motions for Entry of Agreed\n\nFinal Judgment. (CR:127-69; Tab D.) Following denial of the TCEQ’s Motion for\n\nLeave to Amend, they remain the Commission’s live pleading in the case. The\n\nState’s claim that the Commission intended to issue a purely § 361.188 Order is\n\nflatly contradicted multiple times by the text of the Order and by the Commission’s\n\nown justification for its actions.\n\n             1.     The TCEQ repeatedly and unequivocally described the AO\n                    as being issued under § 361.188 and § 361.272.\n\n      In its Original Counter-Petition and Third-Party Petition, the State pled that:\n\n“On February 12, 2010, the TCEQ issued an administrative order (“the Order”)\n\nunder §§ 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….” (CR:158; App. D.) The State further\n\npled that ExxonMobil and Shell “were ‘liable for the elimination of the release or\n\nthreatened release, in whole or in part,’ within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\n\n                                       - 33 -\n\fSAFETY CODE § 361.322(g)” and that “the Order should be upheld pursuant to\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.321 and 361.322(g).” (CR:164; App.\n\nD.)\n\n         The State unequivocally repeated the same description of the AO—as an\n\norder issued under § 361.188 and § 361.272—in myriad other filings at the trial\n\ncourt:\n\n            On October 20, 2011 Third-Party Defendant Howard Frelich filed a\n             Plea in Abatement along with his Original Answer. In its Response to\n             this Plea in Abatement, the TCEQ stated that “The Order was issued\n             pursuant to two sections of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act:\n             Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 361.188 & 361.277 (sic).” As proof\n             that the AO relied on both sections, the State cited to the very first\n             paragraph of the AO—“Order sec. I at 1.” (Supp. CR at ___\n             [TCEQ’s Response to Plea in Abatement by Third-Party Defendant\n             Howard Freilich and Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 9-10\n             (filed November 14, 2011) (emphasis added) (attachments omitted)].\n\n            On July 30, 2012, the State moved for entry of an agreed final\n             judgment between the TCEQ and a group of approximately 154\n             potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”). In the agreed final judgment,\n             the State pled that “the TCEQ issued the Order under Sections\n             361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….” (Supp. CR at ___ [Agreed Final\n             Judgment, Cause No. D-1-GN-12-002297, Young Chevrolet, Inc., et\n             al. v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, in the 345th\n             Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas at ¶ III. B. (filed July\n             30, 2012) (emphasis added) (attachments omitted)].\n\n            On May 3, 2013, the State moved for entry of another agreed final\n             judgment between the TCEQ and a single PRP, Ark-La-Tex Waste\n             Oil Company, Inc. Once again, the State pled that “the TCEQ issued\n             the Order under Sections 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….” (Supp.\n             CR at ___ [Agreed Final Judgment, Cause No. D-1-GN-13-003373,\n             Young Chevrolet, Inc., et al. v. Texas Commission on Environmental\n             Quality, in the 345th Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\f            at ¶ III. B. (filed September 26, 2013) (emphasis added) (attachments\n            omitted)].\n\n          On February 4, 2014, the State moved for entry of default against\n           PRPs Billy D. Cox Truck Leasing, Inc. and SBC Holdings, Inc. f/k/a/\n           the Stroh Brewery Company. In ¶ 3 of those motions, the State noted\n           that “The TCEQ issued a Superfund Order on February 12, 2010,\n           (“the Order”) under Tex. Health and Safety Code §§ 361.188 and\n           361.272….” (Supp. CR at ___ [Motion for Partial Default Judgment\n           Against Billy D. Cox Truck Leasing, Inc. at ¶ 3 (filed February 4,\n           2014) (emphasis added); Motion for Partial Default Judgment Against\n           SBC Holdings, Inc., f/k/a The Stroh Brewery Company at ¶ 3 (filed\n           February 3, 2014) (emphasis added).].\n\n      Though the State has filed a handful of supplements to its pleadings at the\n\ntrial court, the Commission’s live pleadings directly contradict their core\n\narguments on appeal. The State’s Third Amended Answer acknowledged that\n\n“[t]he Texas Legislature has defined the sole method for appealing the Order at\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code § 361.322.” (CR:678; App. E (emphasis added).) The\n\nTCEQ concluded this Answer by pleading that “the standard of review in the\n\nappeal of this Order is…whether: (a) TCEQ can prove, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, the two factors listed in § 361.322(g)(1) and (2); (b) Plaintiffs can show\n\nthat the selection of the remedy by TCEQ was arbitrary or unreasonable; or\n\n(c) Plaintiffs can show that the Order as a whole is ‘frivolous, unreasonable, or\n\nwithout foundation with respect to a party named by the order.’ Id. at § 361.342.”\n\n(CR:683; App. E (emphasis added).)\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 35 -\n\f             2.    The State disclosed that it issued the AO under both\n                   sections to obtain advantages of a § 361.272 order.\n\n      The State’s discovery disclosures make clear why the Commission chose to\n\nissue the AO under § 361.272 as well § 361.188. Pursuant to § 361.274, “[a]n\n\nadministrative order under Section 361.272 does not require prior notice or an\n\nadjudicative hearing before the commission.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 361.274 (West 2010). In stating why ExxonMobil and Shell were not entitled to\n\nan agency hearing prior to issuing the AO, the State disclosed that “a party does\n\nnot have a right to an adjudicative hearing prior to a § 361.272 Order, pursuant to\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code § 361.274.” (Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on\n\nEnvironmental Quality’s Response to Request for Disclosure at 3-4 (served\n\nSeptember 6, 2012) (attachments omitted)].\n\n      Moreover, the State has steadfastly argued that ExxonMobil and Shell, as the\n\nwell as other PRPs, are jointly and severally liable for contamination at the Voda\n\nSite. The statutory basis for joint and several liability under the SWDA is found in\n\n§ 361.276, which states that “[i]f the release or threatened release is not proved to\n\nbe divisible, persons liable under Section § 361.272 or § 361.273 are jointly and\n\nseverally liable for eliminating the release or threatened release.” Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.276 (West 2010) (emphasis added). Nothing in\n\nSubchapter F for a § 361.188 order establishes joint and several liability for\n\nresponsible parties, and § 361.276 does not state that persons declared by TCEQ to\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\fbe a responsible party under a § 361.188 order are jointly and severally liable. At\n\nthe trial court, the State disclosed that: “[t]he TCEQ is not required to prove\n\nallocation of liability, because the responsible parties are jointly and severally\n\nliable unless they can prove ‘divisibility’ by a preponderance of the evidence.”\n\n(Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Response to\n\nRequest for Disclosure at 3-4 (served September 6, 2012) (attachments omitted)].\n\nIn other words, the Commission invoked § 361.272 in an attempt to hold the PRPs\n\nfor the Voda Site jointly and severally liable under the SWDA.\n\n      D.    Following the listing procedures of Subchapter F does not insulate\n            the AO from review under Subchapter K.\n\n      Despite explicitly referencing numerous provisions of Subchapter K\n\nthroughout the AO, the State argues that the AO arose exclusively under § 361.188\n\nbecause the agency followed the listing requirements of Subchapter F of the\n\nSWDA. Therefore, the State argues, the AO can only be reviewable under the pure\n\nsubstantial evidence rule. But as discussed above, the issuance of an order under\n\n§ 361.272 does not preclude the Commission from the listing process of § 361.181-\n\n188. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322(e) (West 2010). Thus, § 361.322\n\nauthorizes the Commission to proceed with investigation and remedy selection\n\nduring the appeal of the administrative order under § 361.322, and nothing in\n\n§ 361.322 indicates that once the TCEQ proceeds with the remedial action program\n\nof Subchapter F, the appellate remedies of § 361.322 are mooted.\n\n\n                                      - 37 -\n\f      E.     Reviewing an administrative order under § 361.322 does not make\n             Subchapter F redundant.\n\n      The State suggests that if an administrative order issued under § 361.188\n\nwere subject to review based on a preponderance of the evidence, it would make\n\nthe listing procedures of Subchapter F effectively redundant. This suggestion\n\nmisapprehends what occurs prior to issuance of an administrative order compared\n\nto what occurs at the district court upon judicial review.\n\n      The TCEQ purposefully invoked § 361.272 and § 361.274 such that\n\nExxonMobil and Shell were not afforded a contested-case hearing prior to issuance\n\nof the AO for the Voda Site. The Commission did not prove—by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence to a neutral third party—that ExxonMobil and Shell were persons\n\nresponsible for solid waste at the Voda Site. Had ExxonMobil and Shell been\n\ngranted an adjudicative hearing, some procedures would be duplicated through\n\njudicial review. However, the AO was issued without any such hearing, and the\n\ndistrict court will present the first opportunity for ExxonMobil and Shell to\n\nchallenge the AO and the first time the Commission will be required to carry its\n\nstatutory burden to prove ExxonMobil and Shell are responsible for solid waste.\n\n      The State further suggests that the extensive procedure to list a site on the\n\nSuperfund registry should entitle the Commission to substantial evidence deference\n\nbecause the agency spent significant time and effort investigating the Site and\n\nchoosing an appropriate remedy. Yet from the perspective of a party subject to an\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fadministrative order, virtually none of the Commission’s purported expertise is\n\nbrought to bear on issues most relevant to the responsible party—namely, whether\n\nthey are in fact a person responsible for solid waste or hazardous substances. In\n\npractice, the agency’s identification of persons responsible for solid waste consists\n\nof little more than collecting invoices or manifests, many of which are decades old,\n\nand making a list of every entity mentioned in the paperwork. The SWDA does not\n\nmandate any standard for how this identification must take place nor what\n\nevidentiary threshold must be crossed before a party is named in an order.\n\n      Although the Commission can issue administrative orders without\n\nadjudicatory hearings, the potentially responsible party’s opportunity to establish\n\nits innocence is delayed—not abrogated—by the SWDA. The appellate structure of\n\nthe SWDA allows those parties to challenge their status as PRPs and places the\n\nburden on the Commission to ultimately prove them responsible at the district\n\ncourt. When liability for such Sites routinely reaches into the millions of dollars,\n\nthe Legislature never intended the Commission’s unilateral order to be the final\n\nword on liability.\n\n      In contrast, the Commission does expend technical resources in developing a\n\nremedy it believes suitable for a proposed site. This can occur either before the\n\nissuance of the administrative order under § 361.188 or after the issuance of the\n\nadministrative order under § 361.272. In either event, the SWDA makes review of\n\n\n\n                                       - 39 -\n\fthat remedy selection subject to greater deference than whether a party is\n\nresponsible for solid waste or whether the waste is divisible pursuant to the Act.\n\nWhen a person subject to the order challenges the selected remedy, the\n\nCommission is not required to prove it chose the best remedy by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, but instead the selected remedy is upheld “unless the court\n\ndetermines that the remedy is arbitrary or unreasonable.” Tex. Health & Safety\n\nCode Ann. § 361.322(h) (West 2010). In short, the Commission already receives\n\ngreater deference for issues where technical expertise was brought to bear, but the\n\nCommission is not entitled to greater deference when simply naming parties it\n\nbelieves responsible for the release of solid waste or hazardous substances.\n\n      F.     If the Commission is correct that it exceeded its powers under the\n             SWDA then the AO must be set aside.\n\n      If the State is correct that “[a] single order cannot arise under both Sections\n\n361.188 and 361.272” (Appellant’s Brief at 18.) the proper course of action is not\n\nto grant the plea to the jurisdiction but to overturn the Order as a violation of law.\n\nAdministrative agencies “may exercise only those powers the law, in clear and\n\nexpress statutory language, confers upon them.” Subaru of Am., Inc. v. David\n\nMcDavid Nissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212, 220 (Tex. 2002). Agencies cannot “create\n\nfor themselves any excess powers” and courts avoid implying any additional\n\nauthority to them. Id. (citing Key Western Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Ins., 350\n\nS.W.2d 839, 848 (Tex. 1961)). When an agency exceeds the authority granted it by\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\fstatute, the court should set aside the agency action. Pub. Util. Comm’n of Tex. v.\n\nCity Pub. Serv. Bd. of San Antonio, 53 S.W.3d 310, 315 (Tex. 2001); Heat Energy\n\nAdvanced Tech., Inc. v. W. Dallas Coal. for Envtl. Justice, 962 S.W.2d 288, 290\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1998, pet. denied).\n\n       The Commission intended to and did issue an administrative order under\n\nboth § 361.188 and § 361.272. Now, the State argues that the Commission has no\n\nsuch power under the statute. If this Court agrees that the Commission is without\n\npower to issue the AO under both § 361.188 and § 361.272, then the Court should\n\nset aside the Order as exceeding the Commission’s power under the statute.\n\nIII.   Appellees’ Response to Appellant’s Issue Three.\n\n       Review of the AO pursuant to § 361.322 of the SWDA is proper under the\n\nAct and the Texas Constitution. The SWDA contains the applicable standard of\n\nreview, placing the burden on the Commission to prove, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that ExxonMobil and Shell are responsible for solid waste. The pure\n\nsubstantial evidence review procedures found in the APA are not applicable to this\n\nappeal, and the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco regarding certain\n\nthreshold questions of standing for affected persons under the Texas Water Code is\n\nnot relevant to this Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 41 -\n\f      A.     Texas courts are not constitutionally limited to review of\n             administrative orders only as to matters of law.\n\n      The State argues that courts are empowered to review administrative orders\n\nonly “as to matters of law” and that to do otherwise would offend the separation of\n\npowers doctrine of the Texas Constitution. (Appellant’s Brief at 35.) Yet the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine only prohibits the Legislature from authorizing de\n\nnovo judicial review of quasi-legislative acts that address broad questions of public\n\npolicy or promulgate rules for future application. The AO is not a quasi-legislative\n\nact, and thus judicial review under § 361.322 does not violate the separation of\n\npowers doctrine.\n\n      The Texas Constitution divides the state’s government into three coequal\n\nbranches, and forbids any branch from exercising a power properly vested in a\n\ncoordinate branch. Gen. Servs. Comm’n v. Little-Tex Insulation Co., 39 S.W.3d\n\n591, 600 (Tex. 2001). Article II, Section 1 of the Texas Constitution provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n      The powers of the Government of the State of Texas shall be divided\n      into three distinct departments, each of which shall be confided to a\n      separate body of magistracy, to wit: Those which are Legislative to\n      one; those which are Executive to another, and those which are\n      Judicial to another; and no person, or collection of persons, being of\n      one of these departments, shall exercise any power properly attached\n      to either of the others, except in the instances herein expressly\n      permitted.\n\nTEX. CONST. art. II, § 1.\n\n\n\n                                       - 42 -\n\f      Under Texas law, “a person may obtain judicial review of an administrative\n\naction only if a statute provides a right to judicial review, or the action adversely\n\naffects a vested property right or otherwise violates a constitutional right.” Tex.\n\nDep’t of Protective & Regulatory Servs. v. Mega Child Care, Inc., 145 S.W.3d\n\n170, 172 (Tex. 2004). The separation of powers doctrine generally prohibits a court\n\nfrom reviewing the actions of an administrative agency absent statutory\n\nauthorization. Tex. Comm’n of Licensing & Regulation v. Model Search Am., Inc.,\n\n953 S.W.2d 289, 291 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, no writ).\n\n      This Court explained the test for determining whether judicial review of an\n\nagency’s order violates the separation of powers doctrine in Commercial Life\n\nInsurance Company v. Texas State Board of Insurance, 808 S.W.2d 552, 554-55\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1991, writ denied). The plaintiff in Commercial Life sought\n\njudicial review of a final order issued by the Texas State Board of Insurance. Id. at\n\n553. The insurance code provided that “such causes of action ‘shall be tried and\n\ndetermined upon a trial de novo’ and, moreover, ‘the substantial evidence rule shall\n\nnot apply.’” Id. at 553-54. The Insurance Board argued that the statute violated the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine and the Insurance Board’s decision was subject only\n\nto substantial evidence review. Id. at 555. The trial court in Commercial Life\n\naccepted the Insurance Board’s argument, refusing to hold a trial de novo as\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 43 -\n\frequired by the statute, and, based on the record, sustained the Insurance Board’s\n\norder on the ground that it was supported by substantial evidence. Id. at 554.\n\n         This Court reversed. This Court first identified the proper test for\n\nconstitutionality as “whether the reviewing court is required to exercise a function\n\nthat is deemed nonjudicial.” Id. at 556. Explaining this dichotomy, the Court\n\nwrote:\n\n         An inquiry by a court is nonjudicial and unconstitutional if it looks to\n         the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule\n         which is to be applied thereafter. However, a court engages in a\n         judicial inquiry if it investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as\n         they stand on present or past facts and under laws already in\n         existence. Thus, the court’s action is adjudicatory in nature if its\n         action is particular and immediate rather than general and future.\n\n         Id.\nThe Court held that the Insurance Board’s decision was “quasi-judicial and not\n\nlegislative in nature” such that trial de novo at the district court was permissible\n\nunder the separation of powers doctrine. Id.\n\n         This Court reiterated the appropriate test for determining whether review of\n\nan administrative order violates the separation of powers doctrine eight years later\n\nin Macias v. Rylander, 995 S.W.2d 829, 832-33 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, no\n\npet.). In that case, the Texas Comptroller issued an order temporarily suspending\n\nMacias’s broker’s license. Id. at 831. Macias sought judicial review of the\n\nComptroller’s order. Id. Although the statute called for judicial review via trial de\n\n\n\n                                           - 44 -\n\fnovo, the Comptroller convinced the district court to review the Comptroller’s\n\norder pursuant to the substantial evidence rule, arguing that pure de novo review\n\nviolates the Texas Constitution. Id. at 832. The district court upheld the suspension\n\nbased on substantial evidence review and Macias appealed. Id.\n\n      Writing for the Court, Justice Yeakel framed the issue on appeal as “whether\n\na trial de novo of the Comptroller’s charges against Macias violates the\n\nconstitution, allowing only substantial-evidence review confined to the agency\n\nrecord.” Id. at 832. Justice Yeakel first identified the relevant separation of powers\n\ndoctrine, noting that “[i]f the function of the agency is legislative, judicial review is\n\nconstrained by the substantial-evidence rule because the court may not substitute\n\nits judgment for that which is considered to be a legislative function.” Id. at 832. In\n\ncontrast, “when an agency has acted in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, a court\n\nmay conduct a trial de novo without violating separation-of-powers principles.” Id.\n\nat 833.\n\n      Drawing the distinction between the legislative and judicial, Justice Yeakel\n\nexplained that “an administrative agency acts in a legislative capacity when it\n\naddresses broad questions of public policy and promulgates rules for future\n\napplication ‘to all or some part of those subject to its power.’” Id. But a “judicial\n\ninquiry…typically involves an investigation of present or past facts and a\n\ndetermination of liability based on laws already in existence.” Id. Applying this\n\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\fframework to the facts of Macias, Justice Yeakel held that the Comptroller’s\n\nactions were judicial in nature because instead of “promulgating rules that would\n\nbroadly affect customs brokers as a whole,” the Comptroller had only “engaged in\n\na factual inquiry into the conduct of a particular individual.” Id. Finding that “the\n\ndistrict court erred in conducting a substantial-evidence review of the\n\nComptroller’s order” the Court decided to “remand this case to the district court for\n\nconsideration by trial de novo.” Id.\n\n      The State advances the same argument presented by the Insurance Board in\n\nCommercial Life and the Comptroller in Macias, suggesting that the separation of\n\npowers doctrine requires that the trial court may only review the AO under the\n\nsubstantial evidence test as to matters of law. Yet the State makes no effort to\n\nexplain how issuance of the AO was a quasi-legislative, as opposed to a quasi-\n\njudicial, act. Unlike a quasi-legislative action, the AO does not address “broad\n\nquestions of public policy” nor promulgate “rules for future application.” Macias,\n\n995 S.W.2d at 833. Instead, it fits squarely within the quasi-judicial framework\n\nbecause it “investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or\n\npast facts and under laws already in existence.” Commercial Life Ins. Co., 808\n\nS.W.2d at 556. The AO purports to make specific factual findings about materials\n\nExxonMobil and Shell shipped to the Voda Site, the alleged release of those\n\nmaterials, and the harm allegedly caused—all predicates to alleged liability under\n\n\n\n                                        - 46 -\n\fthe SWDA. Therefore, review of the AO under the statutory provisions of the\n\nSWDA does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. See also Key W. Life\n\nIns. Co. v. State Bd. of Ins., 350 S.W.2d 839, 847 (Tex. 1961); Dep’t of Pub. Safety\n\nv. Petty, 482 S.W.2d 949, 952 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1972, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      The State relies upon Texas State Board of Examiners in Optometry v. Carp,\n\n388 S.W.2d 409, 415-16 (Tex. 1965) to argue that review of the AO under\n\n§ 361.322 would violate the separation of powers doctrine. Yet the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt explicitly identified the activity at issue in Carp—adopting a code of\n\nprofessional responsibility applicable to all Optometrists in the state—as “quasi-\n\nlegislative in nature.” Id. at 414. The facts presented by Carp have no application\n\nto the AO, and the holding only highlights the distinction between quasi-legislative\n\nacts that set rules applicable to all parties and quasi-judicial acts that determine the\n\nrights of responsibilities of the parties subject to the particular order.\n\n      The State also relies on the 1967 decision in Gerst for the sweeping\n\nsuggestion that all judicial review of agency decisions is limited to questions of\n\nlaw. Gerst v. Nixon, 411 S.W.2d 350, 352 (Tex. 1967). That case dealt with an\n\napplication to the Savings and Loan Commission for a charter to open a new\n\nsavings and loan association. The Court in Gerst defined certain acts—including\n\nthe issuance of permits to do business under the Savings and Loan Act—as\n\nadministrative functions that were not subject to judicial review de novo. Id. at\n\n\n\n                                          - 47 -\n\f354. (“The granting or withholding of a permit, certificate or authority to do\n\nbusiness in a statutorily regulated commercial endeavor is an administrative\n\nfunction.”). Following the opportunity for a formal hearing at the agency level, the\n\ncourt in Gerst held that de novo review of this type of administrative function was\n\nimpermissible, and determined that the trial court should review the decision on the\n\napplication under the substantial evidence rule. Id. In short, Gerst was directed at a\n\npermitting decision that was reached following the opportunity for a hearing at the\n\nagency level, and has no application to the facts of this AO.\n\n      B.     The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco is not\n             controlling in this SWDA appeal.\n\n      The State relies on the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Texas\n\nCommission on Environmental Quality v. City of Waco, 413 S.W.3d 409 (Tex.\n\n2013) (App. K) to argue that judicial review of the AO is limited to the\n\n“administrative record” provided by the TCEQ. Yet the State misapprehends the\n\nsignificance of that decision at both the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court\n\nlevels.\n\n      The central issue in City of Waco was a threshold determination on whether\n\na third-party could intervene and force a contested-case hearing for an existing\n\npermit modification. Under the Texas Water Code, interested third-parties may\n\nobject to requested permit modifications during a comment period and may attempt\n\nto intervene and force the applicant into a contested-case hearing. However, only\n\n\n                                        - 48 -\n\fan “affected person” has standing to receive a contested-case hearing. Therefore, a\n\nthreshold determination must be made as to whether the objecting party is an\n\n“affected person” with standing to request a contested-case hearing.\n\n      In City of Waco, a concentrated animal feeding operation sought to modify\n\nits existing water-quality permit from the TCEQ. The City objected to the proposed\n\npermit modification and sought to initiate a contested-case hearing. The\n\nCommission determined that the City was not an “affected person” entitled to force\n\na contested-case hearing, and the Executive Director issued the amended permit.\n\nThe City appealed to the district court, which affirmed the Commission’s decision.\n\nThis Court reversed, holding that the Commission acted arbitrarily as a matter of\n\nlaw. City of Waco v. Tex. Comm’n on Envtl. Quality, 346 S.W.3d 781, 827 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2011, pet. granted). This Court also summarized and restated a prior\n\nline of cases which held that pure substantial evidence review was not possible\n\nabsent the opportunity to develop a record through a contested-case or adjudicative\n\nhearing. Id. at 818. However, this Court based its holding on its conclusion that the\n\nagency had “acted arbitrarily by relying on a factor that is irrelevant to the City’s\n\nstanding to obtain a hearing.” Id. at 823. Therefore, the Commission’s decision\n\ncould be overturned as arbitrary “independently and apart from whether substantial\n\nevidence could be found to support those findings.” Id. at 819.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 49 -\n\f      The Texas Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the Commission’s\n\ndecision to deny the City’s request. City of Waco, 413 S.W.3d at 425. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court found that the Commission’s actions were not arbitrary and that\n\nthere was evidence in the record to support the Commission’s conclusion that the\n\nCity was not entitled to force a contested-case hearing. Id. In finding that the\n\nCommission’s action was not arbitrary, the Texas Supreme Court did not articulate\n\nwhat standard of review it used to uphold the TCEQ’s threshold determination on\n\nwhether the City was an affected person entitled to force a contested-case hearing.\n\nNor did the Texas Supreme Court address this Court’s extensive analysis regarding\n\nthe inapplicability of pure substantial evidence review in the absence of a factual\n\nrecord developed in a contested-case proceeding. In fact, the words “substantial\n\nevidence” are absent from the Texas Supreme Court’s analysis of the agency’s\n\nactions. Instead, the Texas Supreme Court gave deference to the agency’s answer\n\nto the threshold statutory question of whether the permit was exempt from the\n\nhearing requirement under the statute.\n\n      The State suggests that City of Waco should be interpreted to mean that all\n\nthe Commission’s actions are subject to review only under the substantial evidence\n\nstandard, regardless of the statute involved or the procedures afforded the\n\naggrieved party at the agency level. But this over-reads the limited issue at stake in\n\nCity of Waco. The issue on appeal was not the agency’s ultimate decision on the\n\n\n\n                                         - 50 -\n\fmerits of the permit, but what the Texas Supreme Court characterized as a\n\n“threshold determination of whether the party is an ‘affected person’” sufficient to\n\nintervene in the application process of a third party. Id. at 410. While both cases\n\ninvolve activities by the TCEQ, their similarities largely end there, as the present\n\ncase has no connection to the Texas Water Code, permitting, or the standing of\n\nthird parties—rather it involves the appeal of an agency order under liability-\n\ndeclaring provisions of the SWDA. The TCEQ’s determination on right-to-hearing\n\ndecisions for third parties is not analogous to enforcement of a unilateral\n\nadministrative order against an entity that the agency alone has determined to be\n\nresponsible for environmental contamination.\n\n      More importantly, the decision in City of Waco came in the context of an\n\nappeal under § 5.351 of the Texas Water Code, which itself does not supply any\n\nstandard of review. Tex. Water Code Ann. § 5.351 (West 2008). Through case law,\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court has held that such decisions are subject to “substantial\n\nevidence review.” Texas Water Comm’n v. Dellana, 849 S.W.2d 808, 809-10 (Tex.\n\n1993). In contrast, this case is brought under the appellate provisions of the\n\nSWDA, which places an affirmative burden of proof on the agency to prove certain\n\nfacts by a preponderance of the evidence to the satisfaction of the district court.\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322 (West 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 51 -\n\f      The State further argues that a post-City of Waco decision from this Court,\n\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality v. Sierra Club, No. 03-12-00335-\n\nCV, 2014 WL 7464085 (Tex. App.—Austin Dec. 30, 2014, no pet. h.), “reinforced\n\n[the State’s] interpretation.” (Appellant’s Brief at 39.)6 In that case, a waste control\n\ncompany applied to the TCEQ for a permit to construct and operate two facilities\n\nfor the disposal of low-level radioactive waste under the Texas Radiation Control\n\nAct (“TRCA”). Similar to the Water Code provisions at issue in City of Waco, the\n\nTRCA requires the TCEQ to hold a contested-case hearing on the merits of an\n\napplication if a “person affected” requests one. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §\n\n401.229(a) (West 2010). Two members of the Sierra Club sought to intervene and\n\nforce the applicant to defend its permit application through the contested-case\n\nprocess. Id. at *2. This Court identified “the critical, or threshold, inquiry in\n\ncontested-case hearing requests—and importantly the focus of the parties to this\n\nappeal—is whether the person requesting the hearing is an ‘affected person.’” Id.\n\nat *4. Applying the holding from City of Waco, the Court held it must review “a\n\nTCEQ determination regarding affected-person status for an abuse of discretion.”\n\nId. Upon review, this Court found a reasonable basis for the agency’s decision to\n\ndeny the hearing request. Id. at *9. And consistent with City of Waco, this Court\n\n\n6\n   The opinion cited by Appellant was withdrawn by the Court on December 30, 2104, and\nsubstituted with the opinion discussed herein.\n\n\n\n                                         - 52 -\n\fdetermined that the Commission was not required to hold a contested-case hearing\n\nsimply to determine whether or not it was required to hold a contested-case\n\nhearing. Id. at 10.\n\n      No court interpreting or applying City of Waco has adopted the State’s\n\nposition that all TCEQ decisions—including those with specific statutory appellate\n\nprovisions to the contrary—are subject to review only through pure substantial\n\nevidence. The cases citing City of Waco only reiterate its application to the limited,\n\nthreshold inquiry of whether a party is an affected person sufficient to trigger a\n\ncontested-case hearing. Consequently, the issues before the Court are neither\n\ncontrolled nor informed by City of Waco or its limited progeny.\n\n      C.     The APA provisions authorizing pure substantial evidence review\n             on a contested-case record are not applicable to this appeal.\n\n      Ignoring the statutory language for judicial review of the AO, the State tries\n\nto shoehorn judicial review of the case into pure substantial evidence review under\n\nTexas Government Code § 2001.174 with the claim that the Court should “look to\n\nthe APA” to “interpret the existing law of administrative review.” (Appellant’s\n\nBrief at 36.) Yet by its express terms, Texas Government Code § 2001.174 does\n\nnot apply because there was no contested-case hearing at the TCEQ and because\n\nthe SWDA already provides the appropriate standard of review. If the Court does\n\nchoose to look to the APA, the lessons drawn should only reinforce the trial court’s\n\ndecision denying the State’s plea.\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\f             1.    The APA does not apply, and the available guidance leads\n                   to different conclusions than advocated by the State.\n\n      The statutory basis for pure substantial evidence review advanced by the\n\nState is found in the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), Texas Government\n\nCode Chapter 2001. Texas Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2001.171-178 (West 2008). By its\n\nexpress terms, this APA provision is limited to the appeal of a contested-case\n\nhearing. Id. at § 2001.171. When an aggrieved party appeals an administrative\n\norder issued after a contested-case hearing, the APA provides that the scope of\n\njudicial review “is as provided by the law under which review is sought.” Id. at\n\n§ 2001.172. If the law under which review is sought grants a right to trial de novo\n\nof the administrative order, the APA provides the relevant procedures for this de\n\nnovo review under § 2001.173. If the law under which review is sought instead\n\nallows only substantial evidence review of the contested-case order—or if it does\n\nnot define a scope of review—the APA outlines the procedures for that review in\n\n§ 2001.174. None of these three situations are applicable to the AO in this case.\n\n      Absent express application, to the extent the APA offers any guidance for\n\nhow the Court should determine the proper procedure for the appeal of the AO, the\n\nState draws precisely the wrong conclusions. First, the Commission suggests the\n\nCourt should ignore the statutory appellate provisions of the SWDA and simply\n\nsubstitute substantial evidence review under § 2001.174. But even when the APA\n\napplies, it does not supplant the statutory provisions of the law under which review\n\n\n                                       - 54 -\n\fis sought as reflected in § 2001.172, but is expressly subject to the specific statute\n\nunder which the administrative order is being reviewed. Second, the State has\n\nargued that administrative orders can only be reviewed as to questions of law based\n\non the separation of powers doctrine. Yet Subchapter K of the APA establishes that\n\nadministrative orders can be reviewed via trial de novo at the district court, even if\n\nthey are issued following a contested-case hearing at the agency.\n\n             2.    Outside of threshold standing questions, pure substantial\n                   evidence requires a true contested-case record under the\n                   APA.\n\n      The APA standard of “substantial evidence” permits the reviewing court to\n\nreverse if the decision is “not reasonably supported by substantial evidence\n\nconsidering the reliable and probative evidence in the record as a whole.” Texas\n\nGov’t Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E) (West 2008) (emphasis added). The “record as\n\na whole” within which the court looks for substantial evidence is the contested-\n\ncase record, not any type of informal record developed in a non-contested-case\n\nproceeding. In fact, the items identified as part of such a record in the APA—\n\npleadings, evidence received, offers of proof, etc.—demonstrates that the “record\n\nas a whole” is an adjudicative record. Id. at § 2001.060. Therefore, pure substantial\n\nevidence review under the APA presupposes an open, adjudicative hearing where\n\nboth sides may present evidence and cross-examine testifying witnesses. See, e.g.,\n\nRamirez v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 927 S.W.2d 770, 773 (Tex. App.—\n\n\n\n                                        - 55 -\n\fAustin 1996, no writ) (rejecting argument that Legislature created right of judicial\n\nreview under substantial-evidence rule while depriving parties of opportunity for\n\ncontested-case hearing); G.E. Am. Commc’n v. Galveston Cent. Appraisal Dist.,\n\n979 S.W.2d 761, 767 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.)\n\n(“Substantial evidence review cannot have been the proper standard because there\n\nis no record from the appraisal review board hearing.”).\n\n      The City of Waco case recognized a limited exception to the link between\n\npure substantial evidence review and a contested-case hearing, i.e., the “threshold\n\ndetermination of whether the person seeking the [contested-case] hearing is an\n\naffected person” sufficient to challenge a permitting decision. Sierra Club, 2014\n\nWL 7463875, at *5. Those decisions can be reviewed by the trial court for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. None of the features applicable to this limited exception are present in\n\nthis case. This is a Superfund case in which the TCEQ has declared ExxonMobil\n\nand Shell liable, not a permitting case brought by a third-party. ExxonMobil and\n\nShell challenged a unilateral administrative order, not a denial of their contested-\n\ncase hearing request. Perhaps most importantly, the relevant statute contains a\n\nstandard of review, and there is no basis for substituting a standard of review other\n\nthan the one called for in the statute.\n\n      The State ignores these prerequisites for pure substantial evidence review\n\nand points to a handful of cases to argue that the Court should apply pure\n\n\n\n                                          - 56 -\n\fsubstantial evidence review to this appeal of a state Superfund order. Those cases\n\nare readily distinguished. The aggrieved party in Smith v. Houston Chemical\n\nServices, Inc., 872 S.W.2d 252 (Tex. App.—Austin 1994, writ denied) was\n\nappealing a permitting decision under § 361.321 following a contested-case\n\nhearing on its application for a solid waste disposal permit. Likewise in Texas\n\nCommission on Environmental Quality v. Kelsoe, 286 S.W.3d 91 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2009, pet. denied), the aggrieved party challenged a decision of the\n\nexecutive director about the administrative completeness of his application for a\n\nsolid waste permit. However, the case was not decided on substantive grounds\n\nbecause the party failed to timely appeal the executive director’s decision. Id. at\n\n97.7\n\n       The State also relies upon United Copper to claim that the AO should only\n\nbe reviewed under the pure substantial evidence rule. United Copper Indus., Inc. v.\n\nGrissom, 17 S.W.3d 797 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. dism’d). But like City of\n\nWaco, United Copper was focused on whether a third-party was an affected person\n\nsufficient to intervene in a permitting matter, and more specifically, what formal\n\nprocedures the agency must adopt to make that threshold determination. United\n\nCopper applied to the Commission for an air quality permit to construct and\n\n7\n   The Court’s observation in Kelsoe about whether a contested-case hearing was required\nbefore the executive director could determine if a permit application was administratively\ncomplete—even if it were somehow relevant to this Superfund case—was dicta.\n\n\n\n                                          - 57 -\n\foperate two copper melting furnaces. Id. at 799. Shortly after receiving notice of\n\nthe application, Grissom, an adjacent landowner, sought a hearing on United\n\nCopper’s permit. Id. at 800. The Commission denied his request, and Grissom\n\nappealed to the district court. Id. at 800-01. The district court found that the\n\nCommission erred by denying Grissom’s request without first providing him an\n\nopportunity to present his evidence at a preliminary adjudicative hearing, and\n\nremanded the case to the Commission for such a hearing. Id. at 801. This Court\n\naffirmed, determining that Grissom was an affected person under the rule and that\n\nthe agency had erred by denying Grissom a meaningful opportunity to present\n\nevidence in support of his hearing request. Id. at 806.\n\n      United Copper was curtailed by Collins two years later (which the State also\n\nrelies upon) which itself was distinguished by the Texas Supreme Court in City of\n\nWaco. Whereas the landowner in United Copper was given a hearing to prove he\n\nwas an affected person sufficient to intervene in the permitting process, the\n\nlandowner in Collins (who received no such hearing) was unable to show that he\n\nwas an affected person under the statute, and this Court upheld the agency’s\n\ndecision to deny his request for a contested-case hearing on the permit. Collins v.\n\nTex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n, 94 S.W.3d 876, 885 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2002, no pet.). In either event, the relative rights of third-parties to intervene in a\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 58 -\n\fpermit dispute has no application to an administrative order naming parties liable\n\nunder the Superfund program.\n\n      This case is not an appeal of a permit decision under § 361.321 following a\n\ncontested-case hearing, but instead challenges a unilateral state Superfund order\n\nunder § 361.322. Because parties subject to the order have not been afforded any\n\nhearing prior to issuance of the AO, the trial court may only uphold the order if the\n\nCommission “proves by a “preponderance of the evidence” the factors in\n\n§ 361.322(g). The “use of the term prove” suggests that the Legislature intended\n\nevidence to be presented—and that the agency could not rely on its own non-\n\nadjudicative agency record to justify its actions. See Ramirez v. Tex. State Bd. of\n\nMed. Exam’rs, 927 S.W.2d 770, 773 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996, no writ); Tex.\n\nDep’t of Ins. v. State Farm Lloyds, 260 S.W.3d 233, 245 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008,\n\nno pet.) (“Absent an administrative record, no substantial evidence review is\n\nrequired or even possible.”).\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      For each of the reasons discussed above, Appellees request that this Court\n\naffirm the trial court’s order denying Appellant’s Plea to the Jurisdiction, or in the\n\nalternative, overturn the Order as a violation of the Commission’s power under the\n\nSWDA.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 59 -\n\fDated: January 29, 2015.\n\n                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                           /s/ John Eldridge\n                           John R.

The ED will consider differences in the quantity or extent of contaminants as the\n     basis for a determination of a significant difference only when such differences are\n     so significant as to cause the Remedy not to be the lowest cost alternative that is\n     technologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes\n     damage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the\n     environment.\n\nG.   After receipt of the Failure Evaluation Report, the ED will notify the Site\n     Coordinator of his approval or disapproval of the report with comments. If the ED\n     determines that the basis of the Performing Parties' assertion of a failure to attain\n     Remediation Goals or of a significant difference is valid, no applicable stipulated\n     penalties will be imposed for missed deadlines subsequent to the Performing Parties'\n     notification made in accordance with Paragraph B above, except for failure to submit\n     documents pursuant to this Section. If the ED determines that the basis of a failure\n     to attain Remediation Goals or of an assertion of a significant difference is not valid,\n     the ED will direct that Remedial Activities continue and that the Performing Parties\n     pay any applicable stipulated penalties for any missed deadlines.\n\nH.   Unless the ED approves the Failure Evaluation Report and/or directs continuation of\n     Remedial Activities, within thirty (30) Days after the ED provides written comments\n     to the Site Coordinator, the Performing Parties shall resubmit the Failure Evaluation\n     Report, in both clean and redline, strikeout format, with a summary note which\n     clearly and explicitly indicates how each of the ED' s comments on the previous draft\n     ofthe Failure Evaluation Report has been satisfactorily addressed and which will also\n     identify all other revisions or changes from the previous version of the Failure\n     Evaluation Report.\n\n\n\n                       Page 43 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                71\n\f        I.     The ED will notify the Site Coordinator of his approval or disapproval, with\n               comments, of each resubmittal of the Failure Evaluation Report. Each resubmittal\n               will be submitted in accordance with Paragraph H above. Disapproval of the first\n               resubmittal and each subsequent resubmittal is subject to assessment of stipulated\n               penalties in accordance with Section XXI (Stipulated Penalties).\n\n        J.     Not later than ninety (90) Days after a determination by the ED that the Remedy will\n               not attain the Remediation Goals or a significant difference exists, the Respondents\n               shall submit to the ED for approval a written report evaluating alternatives to the\n               Remedial Activities and may submit a proposal for such alternative Remedial\n               Activities as may be necessary to achieve the Remediation Goals. Any proposed\n               alternatives must comply with the remedy selection criteria contained in 30 TEX.\n               ADMIN CODE Chapter 335, Subchapter Kand 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE Chapter 350.\n               The Remedy may be modified, as stated in Section V (Order) Paragraph J, only as\n               specified in 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE Section 335.349.\n\n        K.     In the event TCEQ determines that alternate or additional remedial actions are\n               necessary because of the Remedy's failure, TCEQ may terminate this AO.\n\nVTII.   Project Manager/Site Coordinator\n\n        A.     Not later than the Effective Date, the ED will designate a Project Manager to oversee\n               implementation of the Work and to coordinate communication between the ED and\n               the Agreeing Respondents or, ifthere are no Agreeing Respondents to this AO, the\n               Performing Parties.\n\n        B.     Respondents shall direct all communications regarding the Remedial Activities,\n               whether written or oral, at a minimum, to the Project Manager or, ifnot available, the\n               alternate Project Manager.\n\n        C.    In addition to fulfilling the requirements of Section V (Order) Paragraph I, within ten\n              (10) Days after the Effective Date, the Agreeing Respondents or, if there are no\n              Agreeing Respondents to this AO, the Performing Parties shall submit a written\n              notice to the Project Manager containing the Site Coordinator's address, phone\n              number and/or pager number at which he/she may be contacted at any time in case\n              of emergency. The Site Coordinator shall notify the ED in writing at least seven (7)\n              Days prior to the start date of any field activities associated with the Remedial\n              Activities. All Performing Parties must coordinate with and cooperate with any\n              Agreeing Respondents in the performance of any and all of the Work.\n\n        D.    The Project Manager has the authority to require that the Remedial Activities are\n              performed in accordance with all applicable statutes and regulations and with this AO\n              and to require a cessation of the performance of any part or all of the Remedial\n              Activities that:\n\n                                 Page 44 • Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        72\n\f     1.      In the Project Manager's opinion, may present or contribute to an imminent\n             and substantial endangerment to public health, welfare, or the environment\n             because of an actual or threatened release of solid wastes or hazardous\n             substances from the Site; or\n\n     2.      In the Project Manager's opinion, is not in conformance with any work plan\n             developed in accord~ce with this AO; or\n\n     3.      In the Project Manager's opinion, is a violation of any work plan developed\n             in accordance with this AO, HASP, or RA Quality Assurance Project Plan.\n\nE.   Within 24 hours after the Project Manager issues an oral order to halt any or all of the\n     Remedial Activities, if time permits, the Project Manager will provide a brief\n     explanation of the basis for the order. As soon as possible, but in any event no more\n     than fourteen (14) Days after the initial order to halt any or all of the Remedial\n     Activities, the Project Manager will provide a written explanation of the basis for the\n     order to halt any or all of the Remedial Activities to the Site Coordinator. The\n     Remedial Activities may be resumed only after the basis for the order to halt any or\n     all of the Remedial Activities has been corrected and instructions to proceed have\n     been provided to the Agreeing Respondents or, if there are no Agreeing Respondents\n     to this AO, the Performing Parties by the Project Manager. All additional costs\n     associated with the cessation of any or all of the Remedial Activities will be borne\n     by Respondents.\n\nF.   During the RD and RA, the Project Manager and Site Coordinator shall hold\n     meetings at least once per month to review the progress and details of the Remedial\n     Activities and to review and resolve any discrepancies in data. At the ED's\n     discretion, these meetings may be held by telephone.

The Project Manager will notify the Site\n     Coordinator orally or in writing of such delegation.\n\n\n\n                       Page 45 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                73\n\fIX.   Endangerment and Immediate Threat\n\n      A.     In the event of any action or occurrence during the performance of the Remedial\n             Activities which causes or threatens a release of a solid waste or hazardous substance\n             or which may present an immediate threat to public health or welfare or the\n             environment, Respondents shall immediately take all appropriate action to prevent,\n             abate, or minimize such release or threat and shall immediately notify the Project\n             Manager and Site Representative or, if the Project Manager cannot be contacted, the\n             alternate Project Manager and Site Representative.

Any revision to the deadlines specified in this AO necessitated by\n               Respondents' inability to obtain such access may be considered a reasonable ground\n               for extending any affected deadline pursuant to Section XVIII (Extension of\n               Deadlines).\n\n       C.      Subject to the Agreeing Respondents' reasonable safety and internal security\n               requirements, the ED will have the authority to enter, freely move about, and exit the\n               Site, any off-site area that is to be used for access to the Site, property subject to or\n               affected by the Remedial Activities, or other property where documents generated in\n               accordance with this AO are located or come to be located, for the purposes of:\n               inspecting conditions at the Site, the Remedial Activities and all information,\n               documents, data, records, operating logs, and contracts related to the Site; reviewing\n               the Performing Parties' progress in performing the Remedial Activities; conducting\n               such tests as the ED deems necessary; using a camera, sound recording device, or\n               other documentary type equipment; verifying the data submitted to the ED by the\n               Performing Parties; and performing any Remedial Activities not being performed or\n               not being satisfactorily performed by the Performing Parties.

All persons with access to the Site shall comply with the\n               HASP.\n\nXVII.

Defaulting Performing Parties and the\n       RPs may be assessed the ED's full costs for oversight of the Work. If actions required by\n       this AO are delayed or are not timely completed because of acts or omissions of one or more\n       Defaulting Performing Parties, the Agreeing Respondents, or if there are no Agreeing\n       Respondents to this AO, the Performing Parties may request a time extension. Upon such\n       request, the ED will approve the time extension, disapprove it, or approve such alternative\n       time extension as the ED in his sole discretion deems appropriate. Thereafter, Respondents\n       shall adhere to all remaining deadlines in this AO and in any documents developed in\n       accordance with this AO and approved by the ED.\n\n       The Agreeing Respondents may seek and the ED may grant an extension of any deadline\n       contained in this AO or in any document submitted pursuant to this AO. Agreeing\n       Respondents shall submit the request for a deadline extension no later than seven (7) Days\n       prior to the deadline date and shall substantiate good cause for extension of the deadline.\n       The determination of what constitutes good cause and the length of any deadline extension\n       will be at the ED's sole discretion.\n\nXIX.

The burden of establishing that an event is beyond their\n            reasonable control lies with the Agreeing Respondents. The Agreeing Respondents\n            shall notify the ED in writing within seven (7) Days of the start oftheForceMajeure\n            event and within seven (7) Days of the end of the Force Majeure event. Agreeing\n            Respondents shall submit the notification as specified in this Section. Failure to so\n            notify the ED will constitute a waiver of the claim of Force Majeure.\n\n            Such notice will describe in detail the cause of the delay; the anticipated duration of\n            the delay; the measures taken and to be taken by the Agreeing Respondents, their\n            contractors or consultants, to prevent or minimize the delay; and the timetable by\n            which these measures have been, are being, and will be implemented.

Neither the ED's approval of the timetable of\n               measures to be taken to prevent or minimize delays or of the revised schedule of\n               Remedial Activities will be construed as excusing the delay or as a waiver of\n               TCEQ's rights to enforce this AO.\n\n        B.     Force Majeure events will not include increased costs or expenses of any part or all\n               of the Work or the financial inability of any Agreeing Re.spondent to perform any part\n               or all of the Work.\n\n        C.     Ifthe ED and the Agreeing Respondents cannot agree that the cause for the delay was\n               a Force Majeure event or cannot agree upon the schedule for subsequent Remedial\n               Activities, then the disagreement will be resolved according to Section XX:ill\n               (Resolution of Disagreements). The Agreeing Respond~mts shall have the burden of\n               demonstrating that Force Majeure is warranted.\n\n:xxm.   Resolution of Disagreements\n\n        A.    The Agreeing Respondents and the ED shall attempt to resolve on an informal basis\n              any issues arising under Sections V (Order) through XXXIlI (Termination of the\n              Administrative Order) on which there is disagreement. The Agreeing Respondents\n              shall commence informal negotiations by notifying the Project Manager in writing\n              that there is a disagreement and that this Section is being invoked. Except as\n              provided below in Paragraph D, informal negotiations will not extend beyond thirty\n              (30) Days from the date the Project Manager receives such notification, unless the\n              Agreeing Respondents and the ED agree otherwise in writing.\n\n        B.    The Agreeing Respondents shall notify the Project Manager within thirty (30) Days\n              after the Day the Agreeing Respondents knew or should have known of the events\n              giving rise to the disagreement. Should the Agreeing Respondents fail to give such\n              notice, the ED's decision on any disagreement will be binding.\n\n        C.    Notification of the Project Manager in accordance with Paragraph A above will not\n              by itself postpone the deadlines established in accordance with this AO or stay the\n              accrual of any applicable stipulated penalties for the matter at issue. However, the\n              obligation to pay any applicable stipulated penalties to the TCEQ will be stayed\n              pending resolution of the disagreement in accordance with thiS Section.\n\n        D.    If the ED makes a determination to perform a portion or all of the Remedial\n              Activities, the Agreeing Respondents shall have five (5) Days after notification to the\n              Site Coordinator to commence informal negotiations by notifying the Project\n              Manager in accordance with Paragraph A above. Informal negotiations will not\n              extend beyond fifteen (15) Days from the date the ED receives notification, unless\n              the Agreeing Respondents and the ED agree otherwise in writing.\n\n                                 Page 57 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., Stale Superfund Sile\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        85\n\f       E.     The procedure for any resolution of disagreements subsequent to informal\n              negotiations will be found in Sections 361.321 and/or 361.322 of the Act.\n\n       F.     Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, the fact that resolution of\n              disagreements is not specifically set forth in individual Sections is not intended to\n              and will not bar the Agreeing Respondents from invoking this Section as to any\n              disagreement arising under Sections V (Order) through XXXIII (Termination of the\n              Administrative Order), including any disagreement concerning the ED's exercise of\n              discretion under the terms of this AO.\n\nXXIV. Indemnification\n\n       Respondents agree to indemnify and hold harmless TCEQ and its officers, employees,\n       agents, principals and assigns from and against all fines, penalties, claims, damages, losses,\n       demands, judgments, settlements, costs of suit, and attorneys fees that arise out of or result\n       from:\n\n              1.      Respondents' performance of an inherently dangerous activity or handling of\n                      a solid waste or hazardous substance at or from the Site;\n\n              2.      Respondents' negligent, reckless, or intentional acts or omissions or such acts\n                      or omissions of any of its agents or employees; and\n\n              3.      the negligent, reckless, or intentional acts or omissions of any of\n                      Respondents' contractors or suppliers or their agents or employees.\n\nXXV. Liability\n\n      The State of Texas, by issuing this AO, assumes no liability for any injuries or damages to\n      persons or property resulting from acts or omissions of Respondents, or their directors,\n      officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors, assigns, contractors, or consultants\n      in carrying out any of the Work. Neither TCEQ nor the State of Texas will be deemed a\n      party to any contract entered into by any Respondent or its directors, officers, employees,\n      agents, successors, assigns, contractors, or consultants to perform any or all of the Work or\n      any other activity at the Site.\n\nXXVI. Severability\n\n      The provisions of this AO are intended to be severable and are deemed severable. Should\n      any provision of this AO be rendered unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or\n      other appropriate authority the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n                                Page 58 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        86\n\fXXVII. TCEQ's General Reservation of Rights and Retention of Claims\n\n       Except as specified herein, nothing in this AO will constitute or be construed as a covenant\n       not to sue by TCEQ or the State of Texas or a release from any claim, cause of action, or\n       demand in law or equity against any person, firm, partnership, or corporation. Except as\n       specified herein, the ED reserves and this AO is without prejudice to all rights against\n       Respondents with respect to all matters including:\n\n              1.      Claims based on Respondents' failure to fulfill the requirements of this AO;\n\n              2.      Liability arising from the past, present, or future disposal, release, or threat\n                      of release of solid wastes or hazardous substances outside of or not related to\n                      the Site;\n\n              3.      Liability for future disposal of solid wastes or hazardous substances at the\n                      Site, other than as provided in the RSD or in any work plan required to be\n                      developed in accordance with this AO;\n\n              4.      Liability for violations of federal or state law which occur during or after\n                      implementation of the Remedial Activities;\n\n              5.      Claims based on criminal liability; and\n\n              6.

INTRODUCTION\n\nVoda Petroleum, Inc., (aka Ultra Oil) (Voda Site) occupies 6.12 acres at 211 Duncan Road,\napproximately 1.25 miles west of the intersection of FM 2275 (George Richey Road) and FM\n3272 (North White Oak Road), 2.6 miles north-northeast of Clarksville City in Gregg County.\nThe Voda Site was operated as a waste oil recycling facility from about 1981 until it was\nabandoned in November 1991.      ·\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is an agency in the State of Texas\nthat implements many of the state laws relating to the conservation of natural resources and the\nprotection of public health and safety and the environment. The TCEQ addresses certain sites\nthat may constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\nenvironment through the state Superfund program.\n\nII.    PURPOSE\n\nThis Remedy Selection Document (RSD) presents the Remedial Action (also known as \"the\nremedy\") for the Voda Site, which is designed to address the contamination and provide\nprotection of public health and safety and the environment.\n\nWords appearing in italics in this document are defined in Section VIII, \"Glossary,\" of this RSD.\n\nIII.   LEGAL AUTHORITY\n\nThe investigation of the nature and extent of contamination at the Voda Site and the selection of\nthe Remedial Action is in accordance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act, Tex. Health & Safety\nCode §§ 361.001-966 (West 2008); Subchapter K: Hazardous Substance Facilities Assessment\nand Remediation (Subchapter K) rules found in 30 Tex. Admin. Code (TAC) §§ 335.341-351\n(2009); and the Texas Risk Reduction Program (TRRP) rules found in 30 TAC §§ 350.1-135\n(2009).\n\nWhile the Subchapter K rules are specific to the Superfund process, the TRRP rules are a\ncomprehensive program for addressing environmental contamination and apply to many different\ntypes of corrective action administered by the TCEQ. The TRRP mles establish procedures for\ndetermining the concentration of contaminants to which a person or other environmental receptor\ncan be exposed without unacceptable risk of harm. These acceptable concentration levels are\ncalled Protective Concentration Levels (PCLs ).\n\nA three-tiered approach may be used under the TRRP mies to calculate the PCLs for a site. The\ntiers represent increasing levels of evaluation where site-specific infmmation is factored into the\nprocess. For example, Tier 1 uses conservative, generic models that do not account for site-\nspecific factors, Tier 2 allows for the use of site-specific information but must use PCL equations\n\n\n\n                                                1\n                                                                                                      94\n\fprovided by the TCEQ, and Tier 3 allows for more detailed and complex evaluations so that\nPCLs are appropriate for specific site conditions. The PCLs for the Voda Site were developed\nunder Tier 1.\n\nCritical to the analysis under all three of the tiers is the land use classification for the site. Under\nthe TRRP rules, the land can be classified as either residential or commercial/industrial.\nRemediation to residential standards assumes that the site may be occupied by children and\ntherefore is applicable not only to strictly residential land but also to playgrounds, schools,\ndaycare centers and similar land uses. Remediation to commercial/industrial standards assumes\nthat the site will not be regularly occupied by children and is protective of persons who may\noccupy the site as workers. Sites remediated to commercial/industrial standards cannot be used\nfor residential-type activities unless further controls are implemented to make the site safe for\nthat use. The TCEQ determined that a commercial/industrial use was appropriate for the Voda\nSite.\n\nThe TRRP rules allow risks posed by the presence of contamination above a PCL to be managed\nby any combination of the following: 1) removal or decontamination of contaminated media; 2)\nphysical controls, such as landfills and caps, which limit exposure to the contaminated media; or\n3) institutional controls, such as deed restrictions on the future use of the property, which are\nalso intended to limit exposure to the contaminated media. These remedies under the TRRP\nrules are divided into two main categories: Remedy Standard A and Remedy Standard B. To\nmeet Remedy Standard A requirements, the contaminated media must be removed and/or\ndecontaminated such that physical controls and, in most cases, institutional controls are not\nnecessary to protect human and ecological receptors from unprotective levels of contamination\nbased on the designated land use. To meet the requirements of Remedy Standard B, however,\nphysical controls and institutional controls may be relied on to limit exposure to unprotective\nlevels of contamination. These standards are described in detail in 30 TAC § 350.32 and §\n350.33. The proposed remedy at the Voda Site meets the criteria established for Remedy\nStandard A..\n\nIV.    SITE HISTORY\n\nThe Voda Site was operated as a waste oil recycling facility from about 1981 until it was\nabandoned in November 1991. The Voda Site is located in a rural residential neighborhood with\noccupied residences directly on the east and west sides of the facility. A review of the facility\nwaste management activity records revealed that Voda Petroleum, Inc., had received, stored and\nprocessed waste gas.olines; oily wastes; used oil mixed with methyl ethyl ketone, varsol,\ntrichloroethane, toluene, and hexane; crude oil; greases; and waxes. In 1996, the EPA conducted\nan emergency removal of 462 fifty-five-gallon drums of grease or oily wastes, 14 fifty-five-\ngallon drums of corrosive wastes, 16 above-ground tanks, and associated contaminated soil. The\nsite was then backfilled to approximate the undisturbed topography to facilitate site drainage.\nThe EPA response action removed the immediate threat to human health and the environment\nbut was not intended to be and did not constitute a final remediation solution. Post removal\nanalysis of soil and groundwater samples indicated that soil and groundwater continued to be\ncontaminated above appropriate cleanup levels.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n                                                                                                           95\n\fV.   SUMMARY OF REPORTS\n\n     A.     HAZARD RANKING SYSTEM REPORT\n\n     The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is a numerically-based screening system that uses\n     information from initial, limited investigations to assess whether a site qualifies for the\n     state or federal Superfund program. Sites scoring 28.5 or greater may qualify for the\n     federal Superfund program, while sites scoring 5 or greater may qualify for the state\n     Superfund program. The HRS scoring for the Voda Site was prepared by the TCEQ in\n     August 1995 and is presented in the report titled \"Hazard Ranking System (HRS)\n     Documentation Record, Yoda Petroleum Site, Gregg County, Texas.\" The Voda Site\n     earned a score of 23.63. The TCEQ proposed to list the Yoda Site on the State Registry\n     of Superfund Sites and published notice of its intent in the Texas Register on November\n     17, 2000. 25 Tex. Reg. 11594-95 (Nov. 17, 2000).\n\n     B.     REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\n\n     The Remedial Investigation (RI) includes field work, laboratory analysis and\n     interpretation of collected data for the purpose of detennining the nature and extent of\n     contamination associated with the Vada Site. The Phase I RI Rep01i, dated August 2002,\n     included a summary of the RI activities conducted at the site in May 2002. Based on the\n     Phase I results, a second phase was conducted in April 2004, focusing on the area known\n     as the \"East Tank Farm.\" The Phase II RI Technical Memorandum (TM), dated July\n     2004, concluded that the investigation of the extent of soil contamination above cleanup\n     standards was complete; however, additional groundwater monitor wells were needed to\n     complete the groundwater investigation. Additional groundwater monitor wells were\n     installed from April 2005 through May 2007. The final round of monitor well\n     installations was found to fully define the extent of the groundwater contamination.\n\n     The following summarizes the findings of the RI:\n\n     Groundwater - The Queen City Aquifer beneath the Voda Site is impacted by various\n     volatile organic constituents (VOCs) exceeding the PCLs applicable to a Class 1\n     groundwater resource.\n\n     Onsite Soil - Soil containing contaminants above cleanup standards at the Voda Site is\n     generally limited to the East Tank Farm area, encompassing an area of approximately 60\n     feet by 120 feet and 12 feet deep. Contaminants exceeding cleanup standards include\n     VOCs and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH).\n\n     Offsite Soil/Sediment - No offsite soil or sediment contamination was detected.\n\n     Ecological Risks - The Tier 1 Exclusion Criteria Checklist determined that conditions at\n     the Voda Site precluded the need for a formal ecological risk assessment (ERA) because\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n                                                                                                   96\n\f       the site meets the conditions for \"de minimis land area,\" meaning there are insignificant\n       ecological exposure pathways at the site.\n\n       C.      FEASIBILITY STUDY PHASE REPORT\n\n       The Feasibility Study (FS) for the Yoda Site, dated January 2008, presented an evaluation\n       of the potential remedial alternatives to address the chemicals of concern (COCs) in\n       onsite soil and onsite and offsite groundwater found exceeding the applicable PCLs.\n\n       D.      REMEDY SELECTION PHASE REPORTS AND MEETING\n\n       The Proposed Remedial Action Document (PRAD), dated June 2008, presented a brief\n       discussion of remedial actions evaluated and the specific remedy proposed by the TCEQ\n       to address the contaminants exceeding the PCLs at the Yoda Site.\n\n       On October 23, 2008, a public meeting was held at the Broadway Elementary School\n       Cafeteria in Gladewater, Texas, for the purpose of presenting the PRAD and soliciting\n       public comment about the proposed remedy. Upon consideration of the comments\n       received during the public comment period, the TCEQ selected the remedy described in\n       this RSD.\n\n       E.     PLUME MANAGEMENT ZONE (PMZ) DEMONSTRATION TECHNICAL\n              MEMORANDUM (TM)\n\n       In May 2009, TCEQ technical staff reevaluated information that could be read to support\n       the finding of two possible classifications for the groundwater at the Yoda Site. As a\n       result, pursuant to 30 TAC § 350.33(f)(4), the TCEQ conducted a PMZ demonstration in\n       accordance with TCEQ publication RG-366/TRRP-29, Soil and Groundwater Response\n       Objectives in July 2009. The PMZ demonstration, detailed in the PMZ Demonstration\n       TM dated August 3, 2009, showed that the COC concentrations will exceed cleanup\n       levels at the nearest point of exposure, an intermittent creek located on the offsite\n       affected property. Therefore, it was confirmed that a PMZ would not meet the remedial\n       action goals and would not be an appropriate remedy for the groundwater at the Yoda\n       Site, and the currently selected remedial action continues to best fit the statutory criteria\n       for remedial selection.\n\nVI.    ACTION LEVELS\n\nRemedial Action Objectives are the stated goal of the remedy that must be achieved to make the\nsite protective of human health and the environment. Action levels are the maximum numeric\nconcentrations of the COCs which must not exceed the Tier 1 PCLs for the appropriate land use\nand groundwater resource classification. For the onsite and offsite groundwater, the Tier 1 PCLs\nare those developed for Class I groundwater resources established in TRRP. For the onsite soil,\nthe Tier 1 PCLs are those developed for Commercial/Industrial Soil with a greater than 0.5 acre\nsource area for groundwater protection, with the exception of TPH which was developed based\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n                                                                                                       97\n\fon site-specific exposure criteria. Those objectives and action levels are presented in the\nfollowing table for the specific COCs found at the Voda Site:\n\n                                 ACTION\n   GROUNDWATER\n                                  LEVEL              REMEDIAL ACTION OBJECTIVES\n CONTAMIN ANT NAME\n                               (Critical PCL)\n Benzene                                 5 µg/L Reduce COCs concentrations to levels below\n Dichloroethylene, 1, 1-                 7 µg/L the action level (TRRP Tier 1 PCL for\n Dichloroethane, 1,2-                    5 µg/L groundwater ingestion: TRRP Tier 1 owGW1ng)·\n Vinyl chloride                          2 µg/L\n\n\n\n  SOIL CONTAMIN ANT              ACTION\n        NAME                      LEVEL               REMEDIAL ACTION OBJECTIVES\n                               (Critical PCL)\n Benzene                          0.013 mg/kg    Reduce COCs concentrations to levels below\n Dichloroethylene, cis-1,2-        0.12 mg/kg    the action level (TRRP Tier 1\n Ethyl benzene                       3.8 mg/kg   Commercial/Industrial Land Use PCL for\n                                                 surface and subsurface soil to groundwater:\n Propylbenzene,n-                     67 mg/kg\n                                                 TRRP Tier 1 C/I aw Soiling).\n MTBE                              0.93 mg/kg\n Tetrachloroethylene              0.025 mg/kg\n Toluene                             4.1 mg/kg\n Trichloroethane, 1, 1, 1-         0.81 mg/kg\n Trichloroethylene                0.017 mg/kg\n Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-             72 mg/kg\n Trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-             79 mg/kg\n Vinyl chloride                   0.011 mg/kg\n Xylene, m                            53 mg/kg\n Xylene, o                            35 mg/kg\n Xylene, p                            75 mg/kg\n\nVII.   THE SELECTED REMEDIAL ACTION\n\nIn accordance with 30 TAC§ 335.348(1) and the requirements of section 361.193 of the Solid\nWaste Disposal Act, the TCEQ selects the Remedial Action for a site by determining which\nremedial alternative is \"the lowest cost alternative which is technologically feasible and reliable,\neffectively mitigates and minimizes damage to the environment, and provides adequate\nprotection of the public health and safety and the environment.\" 30 TAC § 335.348(1). The\nTCEQ has selected excavation with offsite disposal for the onsite soil, and the installation of\nreactive biobaiTier wells with institutional controls for the onsite and offsite shallow\ngroundwater.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n                                                                                                       98\n\fAlso in accordance with TRRP, the Performing Parties (or the TCEQ if no parties agree to fund\nor perfmm the remedial action) shall record an institutfonal control in the real property records\nof Gregg County. The institutional control shall be placed on each property which overlies\ngroundwater contaminated above the PCLs and shall describe the specific area of the\ngroundwater plume on each affected property. The institutional control shall remain in place\nuntil such time as the TCEQ has determined that the Remedial Action Objectives have been\npe1manently achieved. If the Remedial Action is implemented by the TCEQ, the TCEQ will\nrequest that the owner of each affected property voluntarily agree to record a restrictive covenant\nto serve as the institutional control. If the property owner does not agree to the restrictive\ncovenant, the TCEQ shall record a deed notice to serve as the institutional control. If the\nRemedial Action is implemented by Performing Parties, the Pe1forming Parties shall be\nresponsible for securing the institutional control in the form of a restrictive covenant from the\nowner of the affected property. All of the elements of the Remedial Action described above shall\nbe in accordance with detailed requirements established in TRRP.\n\nMonitor wells installed at the Voda Site shall be sampled for the COCs identified in Section VI,\nAction Levels, and the hydraulic gradient shall be measured quarterly during the first two years\nand semi-annually for the following two years of the Remedial Action. Monitoring results shall\nbe evaluated no less frequently than annually to verify that the plume has been reduced in both\nareal extent and concentration of COCs. Once the TCEQ determines that the Action Levels have\nbeen permanently achieved, the TCEQ will discontinue sampling and/or monitoring activities.\n\nVIII.

Plaintiffs seek to conduct discovery under a Level 3 Discovery Control Plan.\n\n                                               III.\n                                     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n        7.       This is a direct appeal of a unilateral Administrative Order issued by the TCEQ on\n\nFebruary 12, 2010. A copy of the Order is attached hereto.\n\n        8.       This action is brought pursuant to§§ 361.188(b), 361.321, and 361.322 of the\n\nTexas Health and Safety Code and § 37.001, et. seq. of the Texas Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (\"TUDJA\").             Section 361.321 allows a person affected by a ruling, order,\n\ndecision or other act of the TCEQ to appeal said ruling, order, decision, or other act by filing a\n\npetition in a district court of Travis County. Plaintiffs are all named by the TCEQ in the Order as\n\nparties responsible for reimbursing the TCEQ's expenses related to certain investigations into\n\npotential environmental contamination at a state superfund site, as well as ordered to undertake\n\nremedial action; as such, Plaintiffs are affected by the Order. Section 361.322 allows any person\n\nsubject to an administrative order issued pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.272 to\n\nappeal said order in district court. Because the Order at issue was issued pursuant to § 361.271\n\nand§ 361.272, and the Plaintiffs are all persons subject to the Order, § 361.188(b) makes the\n\nOrder subject to appeal under§§ 361.321 and 361.322. Finally, the Texas Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act, Texas Civil Practices and Remedy Code § 37.004 allows this district court to\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                Page 3\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                           6\n\fdeclare that the Order       IS   invalid, or   IS   an ultra vires action by the TCEQ and/or the\n\nCommissioners.\n\n        9.       This action is timely filed under the provis10ns of §§ 361.321 and 361.322.\n\nSection 361.321 provides that an appeal must be brought not later than the 301h day after the\n\nruling, order, decision, or other act of the governmental entity (here, the TCEQ) whose action is\n\nappealed. The TCEQ issued the unilateral order effective as of February 12, 2010, but served the\n\nOrder on PRPs subsequent to that date. Accordingly, this petition, which is filed within 30 days\n\nof that date, is timely. Section 361.322 provides that an appeal brought pursuant to that section\n\nmust be filed before the 461h day after the date of receipt, hand delivery, or publication service of\n\nthe order that is being appealed. Accordingly, this petition, which is filed within 46 days of the\n\ndate of publication and receipt, is timely.\n\n        10.      Venue is proper in Travis County District Court pursuant to § 361.32l(a) of the\n\nTexas Health and Safety Code. As stated above, Section 361.321 allows a person affected by a\n\nruling, order, decision or other act of the TCEQ to appeal said ruling, order, decision, or other act\n\nby filing a petition in a district court of Travis County. Plaintiffs are \"persons affected\" by the\n\nOrder and \"persons subject to\" the Order because each is named as a \"responsible party\" who\n\nhas been ordered to conduct remedial activities and reimburse the TCEQ's Hazardous and Solid\n\nWaste Remediation Fee Account for costs the TCEQ allegedly incurred.\n\n                                                      IV.\n                                     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n        11.      The tract of land designated by the TCEQ as the \"Yoda Petroleum State\n\nSuperfund Site\" (the \"Site\") is comprised of approximately 6.12 acres located in Gregg County,\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                               Page 4\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          7\n\fTexas. According to TCEQ 1 records, the Site was historically used as an oil recycling facility\n\nfrom approximately 1981 to 1991, when all operations ceased and the Site was essentially\n\nabandoned by the owners and operators.\n\n        12.      In 1995, the TCEQ conducted an investigation of the Site to determine if the\n\nhistoric operations had resulted in environmental contaminants entering the groundwater and/or\n\nsoils at the Site.     Part of this investigation included a Hazard Ranking System (\"HRS\")\n\nevaluation of the Site. The HRS is a scoring system used to evaluate potential, relative risk(s) to\n\npublic health and the environment from releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances.\n\nThe HRS score assigned to a site as the result of the evaluation is the primary factor in deciding\n\nif that site is eligible to be placed on the federal National Priorities List. The HRS score assigned\n\nto the Site was not sufficient to qualify the Site as a federal Superfund Site. Instead, the Site was\n\nreferred in 1995 to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") for an\n\nimmediate removal action to address the TCEQ' s belief that the Site presented an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\n        13.      An EPA Action Memorandum, dated March 27, 1996, documented that, in\n\naddition to the presence of hazardous substances, the Site received crude oil. The Action\n\nMemorandum also noted the presence of large quantities of oil that were subject to the Clean\n\nWater Act and the Oil Pollution Act.\n\n        14.      In 1996, the EPA removed drums of grease or oily wastes, drums of corrosive\n\nwastes, aboveground storage tanks, and contaminated soils. Fencing was also installed around\n\nthe Site at this time to restrict public access to the Site to insure public health and safety.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  During some of the events outlined in the Factual Background, the TCEQ was known as the Texas Natural\nResource Conservation Commission. For convenience, the agency is referred to throughout this document by its\ncurrent name, the TCEQ.\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                     Page 5\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                                 8\n\f        15.      In December 1997, after the removal action was complete, EPA's contractor\n\nsampled both on-site soils and groundwater as part of a post-removal action assessment. EPA' s\n\nassessment found that the removal action had removed minimized the threat of direct human\n\ncontact and inhalation threats that may have been present pre-removal.\n\n        16.      The EPA then sought recovery of the costs it incurred in undertaking this removal\n\naction, and in 1999 and 2000, the EPA settled with a number of companies that the EPA had\n\nnamed as potentially responsible parties for the Site, including Shell Oil Company and Industrial\n\nLubricants Co., which settled as de minimis parties, and Mobil Oil Corporation, which made a\n\nsignificant settlement payment to EPA\n\n        17.      EPA was informed that Westland Oil, a subsidiary of Specialty Oil Company,\n\nperiodically sent unused (virgin) lube oil mixed with water to Yoda to be dehydrated. The oil\n\nwas then returned to Westland and sold by Westland.        Some of the virgin oil obtained from\n\nWestland may also have been sold by Yoda to third parties, and Westland may have purchased\n\noil that had been obtained by Yoda from other facilities. The evidence regarding the Westland\n\nfacts and the status of the Westland lube oils includes the Yoda Petroleum documentation and\n\nsworn statements by Mr. Ron Yoda, the operator of Yoda Petroleum, and others.                 EPA\n\ndetermined that the Westland lube oil qualified for the CERCLA petroleum exclusion and that\n\nthe transactions between Westland/Specialty and Yoda did not constitute the arrangement for\n\ntreatment or disposal of a hazardous substance. The factual record also demonstrates why this\n\nWestland Oil was not \"waste\" (it was never discarded) and thus was not \"solid waste\" under\n\nSection 361.003 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.          EPA did not demand a settlement\n\npayment or pursue a claim for the Westland materials shipped to Yoda.\n\n        18.      According to the sworn statements of Mr. Yoda, and upon the Plaintiffs'\n\ninformation and belief, different sections of the property were operated by two separate entities -\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 6\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                        9\n\fYoda Petroleum and Ultra Oil. Ultra Oil conducted operations on approximately one acre of the\n\nproperty (also known as the \"Southwest Tank Farm\"). While the Southwest Tank Farm was\n\neventually purchased by Mr. Yoda, there were no Yoda Petroleum operations on the Southwest\n\nTank Farm at any time. The EPA stated that the PRPs who sent materials to the Site would not\n\nbe liable for the EPA' s costs associated with the Ultra Oil operations at the Site.\n\n           19.   TCEQ had knowledge of the EPA's removal action, post-removal sampling and\n\nassessment results, and of the EPA settlement.             Plaintiffs are unaware of any TCEQ\n\ncorrespondence commenting on or disputing the sufficiency of the EPA removal action at the\n\ntime of the removal action itself or immediately following the removal action.\n\n           20.   On information and belief, Yoda Petroleum's operation segregated paraffin\n\nmaterials into specific geographic areas of the Yoda site, specifically the \"West Tank Farm.\"\n\nEPA' s removal action addressed the contamination in the areas where paraffin was stored or\n\nspilled.\n\n           21.   Three years after the EPA removal action, and without re-scoring the Site under\n\nthe HRS, the TCEQ proposed the Site for listing on the State Superfund Registry on November\n\n17, 2000 and published a Notice of that proposal in the Texas Register ( 25 Tex. Reg. 11594).\n\n           22.   In November, 2000 the TCEQ also sent correspondence to certain entities it\n\nbelieved had historically shipped materials to the Site. That correspondence asserted that the\n\nrecipient was considered by the TCEQ to be a PRP at the Site as defined in § 361.271 of the\n\nTexas Health & Safety Code (the Texas Superfund Statute), and therefore potentially responsible\n\nfor environmental investigation and eventual remediation at the Site.           The correspondence\n\ninformed the recipients of the Site's proposed listing on the State Registry and the date for\n\nsubmitting comments on the proposed listing.           The correspondence included a Notice of\n\nOpportunity to Make Good Faith Offer to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 7\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                        10\n\f(\"RI/FS\") at the Site. Several PRPs submitted written comments and objections, particularly\n\ncomplaining that there was no empirical data to support an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment finding and no evidence to support listing the Site on the State Superfund\n\nRegistry.\n\n        23.      Upon information and belief, the statutory requirement to notify all persons\n\npotentially responsible for the Site's contamination, the November, 2000 Notice of an\n\nopportunity to conduct the RI/FS, was not provided to numerous entities, for which the TCEQ\n\nhad records in its possession allegedly identifying these companies as entities that had allegedly\n\nshipped hazardous materials to the Site (herein after the \"No-Notice PRPs\"). Accordingly, the\n\nNo-Notice PRPs had no knowledge of, or opportunity to participate in, the TCEQ's proposed\n\nRI/FS or to provide comments on the Site's proposed listing on the State Registry, despite\n\nTCEQ's knowledge of their alleged shipments to the Site.\n\n        24.      On or about March 6, 2001, the TCEQ sent correspondence to several of the\n\nentities who had allegedly shipped significant quantities of material to the Site and who had\n\nreceived the TCEQ RI/FS Notice as PRPs. That correspondence informed each of those entities\n\nthat they had been removed from the TCEQ's PRP list, purportedly releasing these entities from\n\nliability related to the Site. In several of the letters, TCEQ cited as the reason for removing the\n\nPRP, the so-called CERCLA \"petroleum exclusion\", which exclusion TCEQ staff currently deny\n\nexists under the Texas Health and Safety Code.       The entities receiving these letters are not\n\nnamed as parties to the Order. The documentation those entities submitted and on which the\n\nTCEQ relied at least in part to remove them from the TCEQ PRP list, on the basis that the\n\npetroleum exclusion had been met, included EPA' s conclusion that \"the bulk of the material on\n\nthe list\" attributed to Specialty Oil/Westland Oil Co., \"did not support attribution of CERCLA\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 8\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                        11\n\fliability because it appeared that the Voda facility de-watered those materials and then returned\n\nthem to Specialty.\"\n\n        25.      According to its records, the TCEQ undertook remedial investigations and a\n\nfeasibility study at the Site from 2001 through 2008.\n\n        26.      In June, 2008, the TCEQ issued a Remedy Selection Document. This document\n\nprovides a discussion of, and the TCEQ's conclusions regarding, a proposed remedy for the Site.\n\nThe remedy proposed by TCEQ consists of soil removal and off-site disposal, together with the\n\ninstallation of a bio-reactive barrier in the groundwater. TCEQ estimates that this remedy will\n\ncost $1.2 Million dollars.\n\n        27.      On February 12, 2010, the Commission issued its unilateral Administrative Order\n\nwith respect to the Site to 350 parties, including the Plaintiffs. There was no evidentiary hearing\n\nheld before the Order was issued, nor was there an opportunity for such an evidentiary hearing.\n\n        28.      The Order makes various Findings of Fact, including listing persons identified by\n\nthe Commission as PRPs for the solid waste and/or hazardous substances at the Site. The Order\n\nfurther includes a Conclusion of Law that the PRPs are responsible parties (\"RPs\"). Among\n\nthose listed as RPs are the Plaintiffs.\n\n        29.      The Order purports to establish, among other things, (1) the RPs for the Site, (2)\n\nthe existence of a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or solid waste, and (3)\n\nthat there is an imminent and substantial endangerment. It then orders the RPs to reimburse the\n\nTCEQ for all costs related to the RI/FS, to reimburse the TCEQ's past and future costs in some\n\nunspecified amount, to undertake remedial activities based on the Remedy Selection Document,\n\nand to provide post-construction financial assurance, among other responsibilities. The Order\n\nalso asserts that stipulated penalties accrue for failure to comply with the Order or its deadlines.\n\nThe Order does not specify the amount of the TCEQ costs, or explain why they are reasonable or\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 9\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                         12\n\fappropriate or why the TCEQ's actions were necessary or appropriate. Rather, the Order states\n\nthat the RPs will receive at some time in the future a demand letter from the TCEQ stating the\n\namount owed. As authority for the Order, the Commission cites to the Texas Health and Safety\n\nCode, Chapter 361, §§ 361.188 (Final Administrative Order) and 361.272 (Administrative\n\nOrders Concerning Imminent and Substantial Endangerment).\n\n        30.        Westland operated a lubricating oil blending and packaging facility in Shreveport,\n\nLouisiana.       This was not a manufacturing plant per se, and did not operate processes that\n\ngenerated waste streams of used or waste oils. Westland, at times referenced by the name of its\n\nparent Specialty, sent unused lubricating oil to Yoda Petroleum in order to have it dewatered.\n\nThe oil was then returned to Westland and sold to others. Some of the oil may have been sold by\n\nYoda to others after dewatering. The Westland lubricating oil is excluded from the definition of\n\nhazardous substance under CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9601(14) and the Texas SWDA (Chapter 361\n\nof the Health and Safety Code), Tex. Health & Safety Code § 361.003(11). This material does\n\nnot constitute a solid waste under §361.003(34) of the Health and Safety Code as it was never\n\ndiscarded. Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, it could be considered a \"waste,\" the valuable\n\nmaterial sent from the Westland/Specialty facility to Yoda qualifies for exclusions under federal\n\nand state law from the definition of \"solid waste\" including, e.g., the exclusion for commercial\n\nchemical products at 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 335.1(133) (D) (iii) and 40 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) (3).\n\nFor these reasons, EPA did not seek a settlement from or pursue a claim against Westland Oil or\n\nits parent Specialty Oil. TCEQ has recognized both the referenced petroleum exclusion and the\n\nexemptions from the solid waste definitions in many regulatory contexts and similar factual\n\nsituations.      Shell Oil Company sent no materials to Yoda.       A Shell branded service station\n\noperated by an independent dealer reportedly sent a single shipment of material to Yoda.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 10\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          13\n\f        31.      Mobil Oil Corporation reportedly sold and sent paraffin or wax material to Yoda\n\nPetroleum. The material was food grade quality for use in food packaging. It was sent to Yoda\n\nbecause it was off specification, but it was not contaminated. This material had commercial\n\nvalue and was petroleum based.       Neither Exxon Mobil nor Mobil Oil sent materials to Yoda\n\nfrom gasoline service stations. Service stations branded Exxon or Mobil, on information and\n\nbelief operated by independent dealers, reportedly sent material to Yoda.\n\n        32.      Warren Petroleum reportedly sold and sent used lubricating oil to Yoda for\n\nreclaiming. Texaco Chemical Company reportedly sold and sent to Yoda certain materials from\n\na facility in Texas. Chevron USA Inc., Texaco Inc., Texaco Chemical, and Warren Petroleum did\n\nnot send materials to Yoda from gasoline service stations. Two Texaco branded stations, on\n\ninformation and belief operated by independent dealers, reportedly sent material to Yoda.\n\n                                                 v.\n                                             DENIAL\n\n        33.      Plaintiffs demand TCEQ meet its burden of proof that the Site constitutes an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment and that Plaintiffs are liable for Site-related\n\nenvironmental remediation and/or associated costs as required in § 361.322(g) of the Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code.\n\n        34.      Plaintiffs deny that they have caused or contributed to the alleged release or\n\nthreatened release of any solid waste or hazardous substances from or at the Site that are causing\n\nor contributing to alleged environmental contamination at the Site.\n\n        35.      Plaintiffs deny that they have committed acts or omissions which have resulted in\n\nany release or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous substances from or at the Site.\n\n        36.      Plaintiffs deny that they are a PRP or a RP as defined in the Order.

Further, Plaintiffs were given no\n\nopportunity to challenge or rebut this \"evidence\" in violation of their due process and other legal\n\nrights.\n\n          37.    Plaintiffs deny that they sent hazardous substances or solid wastes to the Site as\n\ndefined by relevant law.\n\n          38.    Plaintiffs deny that the contamination at the Site constitutes an \"actual or\n\nthreatened release of solid waste that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the\n\npublic health and safety or the environment\" as required to support Order issuance by Texas\n\nHealth & Safety Code § 361.272(a) and § 361.188(a) (1).           The definition of imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment as defined in the TCEQ's rules at 30 Texas Administrative Code §\n\n335.342 is as follows: \"[a] danger is imminent if, given the entire circumstances surrounding\n\neach case, exposure of persons or the environment to hazardous substances is more likely than\n\nnot to occur in the absence of preventive action. A danger is substantial if, given the current state\n\nof scientific knowledge, the harm to public health and safety or the environment which would\n\nresult from exposure could cause adverse environmental or health effects.\" Plaintiffs deny that\n\nthis Site met this standard at the time the Order was issued because, among other things:\n\n          a.     Exposure of persons or the environment to hazardous substances was not \"more\n\n                 likely than not\" because EPA' s contractor's assessment found that the 1997 EPA\n\n                 removal action had minimized the threat of direct human contact and inhalation\n\n                 threats that may have been present pre-removal, residual contamination was\n\n                 covered with clean soil and grass; and the Site was fenced to preclude public\n\n                 access;\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 12\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          15\n\f        b.       TCEQ's 2009 Remedy Selection Document at p. 3-4, states that the Site is not a\n\n                 threat to ecological resources because there are insignificant ecological exposure\n\n                 pathways at the Site;\n\n        c.       Exposure from contaminated groundwater is not likely, due to gradient direction\n\n                 and plume stability data provided to TCEQ documenting that constituents of\n\n                 concern have not continued to migrate and in fact may be attenuating\n\n                 significantly;\n\n        d.       TCEQ's 2009 Remedy Selection Document at p. 2 acknowledges that the EPA\n\n                 response action \"removed the immediate threat to human health and the\n\n                 environment\";\n\n        e.       Upon information and belief, although TCEQ has studied the Site, the TCEQ has\n\n                 not taken any remedial actions to protect humans or the environment from\n\n                 potential exposure pathways from 1997 until the present, including a three year\n\n                 period between the EPA removal action and the TCEQ proposed listing on the\n\n                 State Superfund Registry and an eight year RI/FS period.\n\n        39.      Plaintiffs deny that proper statutory notice of the RI/FS was given to many of the\n\nPRPs, and thus deny that the Order is reasonable.\n\n        40.      Plaintiffs deny that the Order is supported by the preponderance of the evidence\n\nas to the TCEQ's claims of necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of past and future\n\ninvestigations and remedial and removal costs incurred by the TCEQ. This includes the TCEQ\n\ndeterminations related to imminent and substantial endangerment.\n\n        41.      Plaintiffs deny that materials they are alleged to have sent to the Site have caused\n\nor contributed to the remedial activities ordered to be conducted by the TCEQ in the Order.\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 13\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          16\n\f        42.      Plaintiffs deny that they are liable for remedial actions or costs associated with\n\nthe Southwest Tank Farm, also known as Ultra Oil.\n\n        43.      Plaintiffs deny they are \"arrangers\" for purposes of liability under the Texas Solid\n\nWaste Disposal Act, based on the Supreme Court ruling in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe\n\nRailway Co., et al. v. United States (\"BNSF\") as the requisite intent was not present.\n\n        44.      Plaintiffs deny that they can be liable for the actions of an independent service\n\nstation dealer, even assuming arguendo that the dealer sent materials to the Yoda site.\n\n        45.      In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that they are no more than de minimis\n\ncontributors to any contamination at the Site.\n\n        46.      Plaintiffs contend that any contribution from them to the site is divisible, and they\n\nare not subject to joint and several liability.\n\n        47.      For all the reasons stated in this Petition, the Plaintiffs deny that the Order is\n\nreasonable and therefore it must be overturned pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code §\n\n361.32l(e).\n\n                                              VI.\n                                        ORDER IS INVALID\n\n        48.      The Order lacks finality because it requires additional, discretionary actions by\n\nthe TCEQ. Specifically, the Order requires the TCEQ to make discretionary decisions in the\n\nfuture about the eligibility, necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of past and future\n\nTCEQ costs to be paid by Plaintiffs as RPs, and even the amount of those costs. Accordingly,\n\nthe Order is neither effective nor enforceable against any Plaintiff, and is of no legal effect.\n\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment recognizing that the Order is of no legal effect.\n\n        49.      At no time prior to the issuance of the Order did the TCEQ afford Plaintiffs an\n\nopportunity for an adjudicative hearing as to their status as a PRP. As a result, Plaintiffs have\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                               Page 14\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                           17\n\fhad no opportunity to protect their interests before being adversely affected by the actions taken\n\nby the authority of the Order.         The Order violates due process rights afforded by the U. S\n\nConstitution (u.s.   CONST.   art. XIV) and Texas Constitution (TEX. CONST. art. I, § 19).\n\n        50.      The Order further violates Plaintiffs' United States and Texas due process rights\n\nbecause it does not afford Plaintiffs' the opportunity for an adjudicative hearing as to the\n\nnecessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of past and future investigation and remedial\n\ncosts incurred by the TCEQ for which it seeks a reimbursement. As a result, Plaintiffs have had\n\nno opportunity to protect their interests before being adversely affected by the actions taken by\n\nthe authority of the Order. At no time prior to the issuance of the Order were the Plaintiffs\n\nafforded an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or\n\nthreatened release is divisible pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.276. As a result,\n\nPlaintiffs have had no opportunity to protect their interests before being adversely affected by the\n\nactions taken by the authority of the Order.\n\n        51.      The Order imposes liability on certain Plaintiffs who are in the same position as\n\nother entities who were released by the TCEQ from liability under the so-called \"petroleum\n\nexclusion\" exception of CERCLA. This is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and violates\n\nthe equal protection clauses of both the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n\n        52.      The Order constitutes an ultra vires act by the TCEQ and/or the Commissioners\n\non several grounds, including the following:\n\n              a. The Order is not properly limited m scope as contemplated by the vanous\n\n                 applicable statutory provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code, such as\n\n                 §§ 361.19l(d) and 361.192, both of which limit the TCEQ's recovery to\n\n                 \"reasonable\" costs.\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 15\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                         18\n\f            b. The Order names many Plaintiffs who did not receive the required statutory notice\n\n                 (referred to previously as the No-Notice PRPs) that was provided to some of the\n\n                 named RPs via the November 6, 2000, Notice of Opportunity to Make a Good\n\n                 Faith Offer for the RI/FS. Texas Health & Safety Code§§ 361.184(b) and .185\n\n                 require the TCEQ to make \"all reasonable efforts\" to identify PRPs and to provide\n\n                 identified PRPs with written notice of an opportunity to make a Good Faith Offer\n\n                 to fund or perform the RI/FS. While the TCEQ did send correspondence to some\n\n                 of the PRPs seeking a good faith offer to fund or perform the RI/FS, on\n\n                 information and belief, approximately 150 companies (or close to 50% of the\n\n                 PRPs), including the No Notice Plaintiffs, did not receive an opportunity to make\n\n                 a good faith offer, even though the TCEQ has acknowledged that it had in its\n\n                 actual possession records containing the names of those companies as allegedly\n\n                 shipping materials to the Site. The TCEQ did not undertake the minimal effort of\n\n                 reviewing the documents in its possession to make a list of those companies and\n\n                 include them as recipients of the November 6, 2000 Notice and thus allow them\n\n                 an opportunity to participate in the RI/FS process.       This defect impacts the\n\n                 Plaintiffs in two significant ways. First, the TCEQ unilaterally performed the\n\n                 RI/FS over a period of almost eight years, incurred costs, and is now seeking\n\n                 reimbursement of those costs from those it failed to properly notify. Second, the\n\n                 RI/FS process is so fundamental to the remedy selection process that a flaw in the\n\n                 RI/FS process unavoidably and profoundly taints the remedy process. The Texas\n\n                 Health & Safety Code creates a statutory scheme in which the culmination of the\n\n                 RI/FS process -- the proposed remedy -- is what serves as the basis for the\n\n                 Remedy Order. The TCEQ's RI/FS Notice defect means that approximately 50%\n\n                 of the identifiable PRPs at this Site had no opportunity to participate in the RI/FS\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 16\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          19\n\f                 process through public comments or otherwise.           Had all of the PRPs been\n\n                 properly notified and allowed to participate in the development and evaluation of\n\n                 the alternative remedies, a remedy significantly different from the one chosen by\n\n                 the TCEQ could have been studied, selected and implemented in an agreed\n\n                 manner by the parties. The failure to comply with the fundamental statutory\n\n                 notice requirements related to the RI/FS Notice thus renders the Order invalid,\n\n                 arbitrary, and unreasonable, and outside the scope of the TCEQ's statutory\n\n                 authority.\n\n            c. The Order is invalid because the remedy selected does not comply with the\n\n                 standards found in Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.193 and .322(h). Section\n\n                 361.193 states that the TCEQ is required to select the \"lowest cost alternative that\n\n                 is technologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and\n\n                 minimizes damage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and\n\n                 safety or the environment.\"   TEX. HEAL TH   & SAFETY CODE § 361.193.\n\n\n                     1.   The TCEQ has classified the groundwater at the Site to be Class I\n\n                          groundwater, when in fact it should be Class II. If the proper classification\n\n                          had been used by the TCEQ, the appropriate remedy for this Site would\n\n                          very likely have been the lowest cost alternative that is technologically\n\n                          feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes damage\n\n                          to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the\n\n                          environment. The most recent data acquired from the Site indicates that\n\n                          an alternative remedy would be appropriate because the groundwater\n\n                          plume boundary has not grown and the concentrations of the constituents\n\n                          of concern identified by the TCEQ have actually decreased over time.\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                Page 17\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                            20\n\f                    11.   Effective on May 25, 2007, the Municipal Settings Designation (\"MSD\")\n\n                          statute was amended to allow small municipalities to have the benefit of\n\n                          the MSD certification. The MSD statute allows municipalities to enforce\n\n                          specific deed restrictions on properties within their city limits restricting\n\n                          the use of the groundwater beneath the property so that it cannot be used\n\n                          as drinking water. The deed restriction acts as an institutional control to\n\n                          protect human health, but at a fraction of the costs of a groundwater\n\n                          remediation plan. The Site is within the City of Clarksville and thus is\n\n                          potentially eligible for an MSD. The MSD is recognized by statute to be\n\n                          protective of human health and the environment. No statute or regulation\n\n                          prohibits the application of an MSD at a state Superfund Site.           The\n\n                          Feasibility Study was issued in January of 2008 and the Remedy Selection\n\n                          Document was issued in June 2008. Neither document even evaluated the\n\n                          MSD option, which at that point in time was certainly available for\n\n                          consideration and which could very well be the lowest cost remedy for\n\n                          groundwater at the Site.    Thus, the TCEQ's Order is invalid in that it\n\n                          selects a remedy that is arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore cannot be\n\n                          upheld pursuant to Texas Health and Safety Code§ 361.323(h).\n\n            d. Plaintiffs have asserted previously in this Petition that the Order violates certain\n\n                 of the Plaintiffs' constitutional equal protection rights because the TCEQ relieved\n\n                 certain PRPs, but not others similarly situated, from liability based on the\n\n                 \"petroleum exclusion.\" Without waiving that argument, Plaintiffs alternatively\n\n                 assert that, if the released PRPs are not entitled to the petroleum exclusion, those\n\n                 PRPs must be named in the Order as an RP and that TCEQ's failure to do so is\n\n                 arbitrary and capricious to the severe detriment of Plaintiffs. Section 361.188\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                Page 18\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                            21\n\f                 (a)(4) and (6) of the Texas Health & Safety Code states that that final\n\n                 administrative order must list the Responsible Parties and order the Responsible\n\n                 Parties to remediate the facility and reimburse the TCEQ's RI/FS costs. Nothing\n\n                 in that statutory provision allows the TCEQ to ignore certain otherwise\n\n                 Responsible Parties.     In fact, § 361.1875 states exactly when the TCEQ can\n\n                 exclude certain PRPs from liability associated with a Site, and none of the\n\n                 particular exclusions apply here. The Order is invalid for failure to name all RPs.\n\n              e. The TCEQ's unilateral order of the payment of stipulated penalties is beyond the\n\n                 authority of the TCEQ.\n\n        53.      The Order is invalid under § 361.188(a)(l) because it does not present an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment as needed to support listing on the State Superfund\n\nRegistry. There is no evidence of imminent and substantial endangerment. Any imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment was abated by the 1996 EPA' s removal action.\n\n        54.      The Order should be deemed invalid as to Plaintiffs because the TCEQ did not\n\notherwise properly carry out its statutory and regulatory duties to fully investigate and identify\n\nPRPs, RPs, and de minimis parties prior to naming Plaintiffs as RPs.\n\n        55.      For all of the reasons previously stated in this Petition, the Order is invalid,\n\narbitrary, and unreasonable pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code§ 361.32l(e).\n\n                                             VII.\n                                     AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n        56.      Certain Plaintiffs contributed materials to the Site that are the same as those\n\nmaterials contributed by entities that have been released by the TCEQ pursuant to the \"Petroleum\n\nExclusion\" and thus are also entitled to such a release.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 19\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          22\n\f        57.      Even if Plaintiffs had contributed any materials to the Site, those materials were\n\nsold as a useful product, and did not constitute an arrangement for the processing, storing, or\n\ndisposal of a solid waste, and did not contribute to the release or threatened release to the\n\nenvironment.\n\n        58.      Westland Oil's unused lube oil was a petroleum material and a valuable\n\ncommercial product intended to be dehydrated by Yoda and sold, and/or returned to Westland\n\nfor sale to its customers, and thus the oil was neither a \"solid waste\" nor a \"hazardous\n\nsubstance.\"\n\n        59.      ExxonMobil discharged all or part of any Yoda site responsibility through its\n\nsettlement with and payments to EPA Further, the Mobil paraffin was handled at a specific\n\narea of the Yoda site and was addressed by the EPA removal action. Any harm or liability\n\nattributable to Exxon Mobil or Mobil is therefore capable of being apportioned.\n\n        60.      Plaintiffs' materials, to the extent any were sent to Yoda, are distinct from those\n\nchemicals causing the harm that is being addressed under TCEQ's AO. Therefore, any liability\n\nof Plaintiffs' must be apportioned and limited to the harm attributable to their materials at the\n\nYoda site.\n\n        61.      Plaintiffs did not intend for waste or hazardous substances to be disposed of at the\n\nSite.\n\n        62.      Plaintiffs assert that they are not RPs, but in the alternative assert they are no\n\nmore than a de minimis contributor to any contamination at the Site.\n\n        63.      Plaintiffs are not liable for remedial actions or costs associated with the Southwest\n\nTank Farm, also known as Ultra Oil.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                               Page 20\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                           23\n\f        64.      The evidence demonstrates that the Site does not pose an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment.\n\n        65.      The TCEQ failed to provide the required notices necessary to support recovery of\n\ninvestigation costs from the PRPs.\n\n        66.      The facts do not support listing the Site on the State Superfund registry or the use\n\nof the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act to impose liability upon Plaintiffs.\n\n        67.      In the alternative, even if Plaintiffs contributed solid waste or hazardous\n\nsubstances to the Site, the costs are subject to apportionment under the Texas Health and Safety\n\nCode§ 361.276.\n\n                                                VIII.\n                                     COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES\n\n        68.      Plaintiffs have had to employ legal counsel to contest the Order. TCEQ is liable\n\nfor Plaintiffs' reasonable attorney's fees and reasonable costs pursuant to the TUDJA and Texas\n\nHealth & Safety Code§ 361.342.\n\n                                                    IX.\n                                            JURY DEMAND\n\n        69.

Venue is proper in Travis County, Texas, by virtue of § 2001.202 of the APA.\n\n                                     4.   BACKGROUND\n\n     4.1.     On February 12, 2010, the TCEQ issued an administrative order (\"the\n\nOrder\") under§§ 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act, concerning a 6.12 acre tract of land at\n\n211 Duncan Road, approximately 1.25 mile west of the intersection of FM 2275 (George\n\nRichey Road) and FM 3272 (North White Oak Road), 2.6 miles north-northeast of\n\nClarksville City, Gregg County, Texas, known as the Voda Petroleum, Inc., State Super-\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\n\n\n                                                                                             158\n\ffund Site (\"the Site\"). 1 A copy of the Order is attached. (See Attach. 1). The Order found\n\nthat the Site was contaminated with various solid wastes, as defined in§ 361.003(34) of\n\nthe Act, in the soil and sediment. These solid wastes included the following hazardous\n\nsubstances, as defined in§ 361.003(11) of the Act: cis-1,2-dichloroethylene; benzene; n-\n\npropylbenzene; MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether); tetrachloroethylene; toluene;\n\n1,1,1-trichloroethane; trichloroethylene; 1,2,4- & 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene; vinyl chloride;\n\nm-, o- & p-xylene; 1,1-dichloroethylene; and 1,2-dichloroethane. (See Ex. B to Attach. 1).\n\n     4.2.    The Site has been proposed for listing on the State Registry of Superfund\n\nSites. 25 Tex. Reg. 11594 (Nov. 17, 2000). When ranked, the Site had a hazard ranking\n\nscore of 23.6, as specified in 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE§ 335.343. The Order required certain\n\npotentially responsible parties to reimburse the Hazardous and Solid Waste Remedia-\n\ntion Fee Account for all costs incurred by the TCEQ for the remedial investigation\n\n(\"RI\"), feasibility study (\"FS\"), and oversight of these activities. In addition, the Order\n\nrequired certain parties to reimburse the Hazardous and Solid Waste Fee Account for\n\nall uncompensated Pre-Remedial Investigation costs, including oversight and other\n\ncosts.\n\n     4.3.    The State adopts the allegations, findings and conclusions of the Order herein\n\nby reference.\n\n\n     1\n         For further description and current status, see:\nhttp://www. tceg .state. tx. us/remediation/superfund/state/voda.html.\n\n                                                 33\n\n\n\n                                                                                              159\n\f     4.4.     The Counter-Defendants listed in subsec. 2.B, above, or their predecessors,\n\nwere named as responsible parties in the Order and appealed the Order.\n\n     4.5.     The Third-Party Defendants listed in subsec. 2.C, above, or their predeces-\n\nsors, were named as responsible parties in the Order. These parties received copies of\n\nthe Order with a certified forwarding letter, as shown on Attach. 2, but failed to appeal\n\nwithin the time specified by law. Accordingly, the Order is now final and unappealable\n\nas to them.\n\n     4.6.     The Third-Party Defendants listed in subsec. 2.D, above, were not named in\n\nthe Order. Their liability arises as a matter of law and they are joined herein pursuant to\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.323 (\"the attorney general shall, and a party may,\n\njoin as a party a person reasonably believed to be liable .... \").\n\n     4.7.     To date the TCEQ has spent more than $1,750,000 on pre-remedial and\n\nremoval actions, the RI/FS, and remedial action. The TCEQ anticipates that total\n\nresponse costs will exceed $2,100,000.\n\n     4.8.     Now the State seeks to recover the costs of its remedial investigation,\n\nfeasibility study, removal action, remedial design and remedial action at the Site, plus\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees. The State specifically reserves all claims for natural resource\n\ndamages.\n\n\n\n\n                                               34\n\n\n\n                                                                                              160\n\f                   5.   CAUSE OF ACTION FOR COST RECOVERY\n\n     5.1.   The chemicals of concern found in the soil and sediment at the Site (see\n\nAttach. 1, Ex. B) were \"hazardous substances,\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§ 361.003(11) or \"solid wastes\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE §§ 361.003(34)(B) and 361.271.\n\n     5.2.   Each hazardous substance, waste or contaminant found at the Site was a\n\n\"discarded material\" and thus a \"solid waste\" within the meaning of TEX. HEAL TH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§§ 361.003(34) and 361.271.\n\n     5.3.   The release of hazardous substances, waste and contaminants at the Site was\n\na discharging, depositing, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of solid waste into or\n\non land or water, so that the solid waste or a constituent thereof might be emitted into\n\nthe air, discharged into surface water or groundwater, or introduced into the environ-\n\nment in another manner, and was thus a \"disposal\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH\n\n& SAFETY CODE§ 361.003(7) and 361.133.\n\n     5.4.   The Site was a site \"at which solid waste or hazardous substances have been\n\ndisposed\" of, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.133(c).\n\n     5.5.   The Site was a tract of land on which solid waste was disposed of, and thus\n\nwas a \"solid waste facility\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n\n§§ 361.003(36) and 361.271.\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\n\n\n                                                                                           161\n\f     5.6.     Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant is a \"person\" within the\n\nmeaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§§ 361.003(23) and 361.271.\n\n     5.7.     Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant owned or operated a\n\nsolid waste facility at the Site at the time of processing, storage or disposal of solid\n\nwaste; or arranged to process, store, or dispose of solid waste at the facility; or accepted\n\nsolid waste for transport to a facility; and is thus a \"person responsible for solid waste\"\n\nwithin the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.271(a), and a \"responsible\n\nparty\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.197.\n\n     5.8.     The Counter-Defendants and Third-Party Defendants are responsible parties\n\nwho have not complied with the terms of the Order, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH\n\n& SAFETY CODE§ 361.197(a).\n\n     5.9.     The Counter-Defendants and Third-Party Defendants are therefore \"non-\n\ncompliant parties\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.197(b).\n\n     5.10.     The TCEQ's response action at the Site was a \"remedial action\" or \"re-\n\nmoval\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§§ 361.003(29-30) and\n\n361.133(c).\n\n     5.11.     The funds used by the TCEQ for the response actions were taken from the\n\nHazardous and Solid Waste Remediation Fee Account, established at TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§ 361.133(a).\n\n\n\n                                              36\n\n\n\n                                                                                               162\n\f     5.12.    The funds expended by the TCEQ were for necessary and appropriate\n\nremoval and remedial action at a site where solid waste or hazardous substances had\n\nbeen disposed of, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.133(c)(l).\n\n     5.13.    Funds from a liable person or independent third person were not sufficient\n\nfor the removal or remedial action, within the meaning of TEX. HEAL TH & SAFETY CODE\n\n§ 361.133(c)(l).\n\n     5.14.    Funds from the federal government were not sufficient for the removal or\n\nremedial action, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.133(c)(l).\n\n     5.15.    Thus, the funds expended by the TCEQ were \"costs of an action taken\n\nunder Section 361.133(c)(l), (2), (3), (5) or (6),\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§ 361.197(d).\n\n     5.16.    Accordingly, the TCEQ should have judgment against the Counter-Defen-\n\ndants and Third-Party Defendants for all of its response costs at the Site, as allowed by\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.197(d).\n\n                6.   ACTION TO ENFORCE ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER\n\n     6.1.    Each Third-Party Defendant named in subsec. 2.C, above, failed to appeal the\n\nOrder within 30 days of issuance as required by TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n\n§ 361.321(c), or within 45 days of the date of receipt, hand delivery, or publication\n\nservice as required by TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(a). Thus, the Order is final\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\n\n\n                                                                                            163\n\fand unappealable as to those Third-Party Defendants.\n\n     6.2.   The Order is not \"invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable\" within the meaning of\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.321(e), based upon the substantial evidence rule. See\n\nGerst v. Nixon, 411S.W.2d350, 354 (Tex. 1966).\n\n     6.3.   There was an \"actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous\n\nsubstances\" at the Site that posed an \"imminent and substantial endangerment to the\n\npublic health and safety or the environment,\" and the Counter-Defendants and Third-\n\nParty Defendants were \"liable for the elimination of the release or threatened release, in\n\nwhole or in part,\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(g).\n\n     6.4.   The remedy selected for the Site was not \"arbitrary or unreasonable,\" based\n\nupon the substantial evidence rule. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(h), Gerst,\n\n411 S.W.2d at 354.\n\n     6.5.   Accordingly, the Order should be upheld pursuant to TEX. HEAL TH & SAFETY\n\nCODE§§ 361.321and361.322(g).\n\n     6.6.   Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant should be ordered to\n\ncomply with all the terms and provisions of the Order.\n\n      7.    INJUNCTION AS ALTERNATIVE TO ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER\n\n     7.1.   The Third-Party Defendants listed in subsec. 2.D, above, are \"persons\n\nresponsible for solid waste,\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\n\n\n                                                                                             164\n\f§§ 361.271 & 361.273.\n\n     7.2.   Accordingly, these Third-Party Defendants should be enjoined to \"provide\n\nand implement a cost effective and environmentally sound remedial action plan\n\ndesigned to eliminate the release or threatened release,\" as required by TEX. HEAL TH &\n\nSAFETY CODE § 361.273(2).\n\n     7.3.   These Third-Party Defendants should be ordered to carry out all the terms\n\nand provisions of the Order.\n\n                         8.    ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS\n\n     8.1.   The TCEQ has incurred reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable costs to\n\nprepare and provide witnesses, and reasonable costs of investigating and assessing the\n\nSite, and asks that these costs and fees be recovered from the Counter-Defendants and\n\nThird-Party Defendants as allowed by TEX. WATER CODE§ 7.108, TEX. Gov'T CODE\n\n§ 402.006(c) and TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.341.\n\n                                      9.   PRAYER\n\n     WHEREFORE, the TCEQ requests that:\n\n     A.     Each Third-Party Defendant be served with citation;\n\n     B.     Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant be required to appear\n\nherein and answer this petition within the time specified by law;\n\n     C.     The Court uphold the Order and require each Defendant to comply with all\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\n\n\n                                                                                          165\n\fof its terms and provisions;\n\n     D.    The TCEQ have judgment against all Counter-Defendants and Third-Party\n\nDefendants, jointly and severally, for its costs incurred and to be incurred in responding\n\nto the release or threatened release of solid waste and hazardous substances at the Site,\n\nplus interest at the legal rate until paid;\n\n     E.    The TCEQ have judgment against each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party\n\nDefendant for reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable costs to prepare and provide\n\nwitnesses, and all of its court costs; and\n\n     F.

Shaw, Ph.D., Commissioner Buddy Garcia, Commissioner Carlos\n\nRubinstein, and Commissioner Toby Baker,1 in their official capacities; file this Third\n\nAmended Original Answer, responding to the Second Amended Original Petition filed\n\nby Chevron USA, Inc., et al.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n     ExxonMobil Corporation and Shell Oil Company were among a group of plaintiffs\n\n\n\n     1\n       Commissioner Toby Baker replaced Commissioner Garcia in 2012 and might be\nconsidered to have been substituted into this lawsuit; accordingly he is also listed as a\nrespondent herein.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    675\n\fthat filed their Original Petition in case that was subsequently consolidated into the\n\npresent case. 2 They filed their First Amended Original Petition in that action on March\n\n26, 2010; the TCEQ answered on March 30, 2010. That cause was consolidated with\n\nothers into the present case. See Agreed Order for Consolidation (May 18, 2010). The\n\nTCEQ then filed a counterclaim. See TCEQ's Original Counter-pet. and Third-party Pet.\n\n(Aug. 1, 2011). Subsequently most parties settled their claims with the TCEQ in a\n\nsevered action. 3\n\n     Plaintiffs/Counter-Defendants ExxonMobil Corporation, Mobil Oil Corporation,\n\nPennzoil-Quaker State Company and Shell Oil Company filed an Original Answer\n\n(Aug. 7, 2012), that contained a General Denial and incorporated the affirmative\n\ndefenses from their First Amended Original Petition. The TCEQ then filed 4 a Second\n\nSupplement to Counter-petition and Third-party Petition (Feb. 7, 2013), which corrected\n\nthe name of Mobil Oil Corporation to ExxonMobil Oil Corporation and added Exxon\n\nMobil Corporation to the case. These parties filed a General Denial that, as before,\n\nincorporated the affirmative defenses in the First Amended Original Petition. See\n\n\n\n     2\n         See Chevron USA Inc. v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, No. D-1-GN-10-000793 (419th\nDist. Ct., Travis County, Tex. Mar. 26, 2010).\n\n     3\n         See Agreed Final J., Young Chevrolet, Inc. v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, No. D-1-GN-\n12-002297 (345th Dist. Ct., Travis County, Tex. July 30, 2012).\n\n     4\n       The First Supplement to Counter-petition and Third-party Petition (Oct. 5, 2011) is not\nrelevant here.\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    676\n\fOriginal Answer to Counter-pet. and Third-party Pet. Oune 11, 2013).\n\n     Thus the remaining plaintiffs from the original Chevron USA case, properly\n\nnamed, are Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Pennzoil-Quaker\n\nState Company and Shell Oil Company. The TCEQ and the Commissioners file the\n\nfollowing amended answer to these plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition and also\n\nrespond to their original answers, to the extent those answers incorporate affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n                               II. PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n     A. Request for Declaratory Judgment\n\n     The Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition includes a claim under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (\"UDJA\"), TEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 37.001 et seq.,\n\nseeking a declaration that the TCEQ's Administrative Order (Docket No. 2009-1706-SPF,\n\nentered Feb. 12, 2010) (\"Order\") is invalid or is an ultra vires action by the TCEQ. 5 The\n\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Order \"is of no legal effect\" and seeks\n\ntheir attorney's fees and costs under TEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE§ 37.009. 6\n\n     The court lacks jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' UDJA claim because it seeks a\n\nredundant remedy to that afforded by the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, TEX. HEALTH\n\n\n\n     5\n         See Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet. (No. D-1-GN-10-000793), paras. 8, 48, 52, 68 and 74.\n\n     6\n         See Pl.' s First Am. Orig. Pet. paras. 48, 68 and 74.\n\n                                                    3\n\n\n\n                                                                                               677\n\f& SAFETY CODE § 361.001 et seq. (\"TSWDA\"). The Texas Legislature has defined the sole\n\nmethod for appealing the Order at TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322. The TSWDA\n\nsets forth the burden and method for challenging the remedy detailed in the Order at\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(g)-(h), and also sets forth the burden and means\n\nfor recovering attorneys' fees and costs if the entirety of the Order itself is challenged (to\n\nbe awarded only upon a finding by the Court that the Order is \"frivolous, unreason-\n\nable, or without foundation\").7\n\n     This standard subsumes any assertion that the TCEQ or its Commissioners\n\ncommitted an ultra vires act in issuing the Order. The TSWDA unambiguously sets forth\n\nthe sole means and method for parties seeking to challenge the validity of a Superfund\n\norder, and the sole means and method for parties that are successful in such a challenge\n\nto recover their attorneys' fees and costs.\n\n     When a statute provides a means to attack an administrative agency's order, one\n\n\n     7\n         The Solid Waste Disposal Act provides:\n\n     Sec. 361.342. COST RECOVERY BY APPEALING OR CONTESTING PARTY. If the\n     court finds that an administrative order [of the type relevant here] is frivolous,\n     unreasonable, or without foundation with respect to a party named by the order, the\n     party appealing or contesting the order is entitled to recover from the state its\n     reasonable:\n           (1) attorney's fees;\n           (2) costs to prepare and provide witnesses; and\n           (3) costs of studies, analyses, engineering reports, tests, or other projects the\n     court finds were necessary to prepare the party's case.\n\nTEX. HEALTH   &   SAFETY CODE§   361.342.\n\n                                                  4\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 678\n\fmay not maintain a declaratory judgment action seeking remedies that are merely\n\nredundant with those available from the statute. See Strayhorn v. Raytheon E-Sys., Inc.,\n\n101 S.W.3d 558, 572 (Tex. App. -Austin 2003, pet. denied).\n\n     Accordingly, because Plaintiffs' claims under the UDJA are redundant of and\n\nsupplanted by the TSWDA, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear them and they should be\n\nstruck. See id.; see also Becon Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 86 S.W.3d 260, 266-67 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Austin 2002, no pet.) (merely alleging that an agency has exceeded its authority\n\nis insufficient to confer jurisdiction under the UDJA when a statute provides an express\n\n\"avenue for attacking an agency order,\" because \"a declaratory judgment action will\n\nnot lie to provide redundant remedies\") and Martin v. Amerman, 133 S.W.3d 262, 267\n\n(Tex. 2004) (when a statute expressly governs a party's substantive claims, a party may\n\nnot proceed under the UDJA and recover attorneys' fees).\n\n     For these same reasons, the court is similarly without jurisdiction over Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims that the Plaintiffs' due process rights under the U.S. Constitution (U.S. CONST.\n\nart. XIV) and the Texas Constitution (TEX. CONST. art. I,§ 19) were violated because the\n\nlaw did not \"afford Plaintiffs an opportunity for an adjudicative hearing\" before entry\n\nof the Order, Pl.'s First Am. Orig. Pet. para. 49, or as to the \"necessity, appropriateness,\n\nand reasonableness of past and future investigation and remedial costs incurred by the\n\nTCEQ,\" Pl.'s First Am. Orig. Pet. para. 50, because the TSWDA provides the sole\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\n\n\n                                                                                               679\n\fmethod and means for attacking the Order. See Young Chevrolet, Inc. v. Tex. Motor Vehicle\n\nBd., 974 S.W.2d 906, 911 (Tex. App.-Austin 1998, pet. denied).\n\n     B. Naming Individuals in Official Capacity\n\n     The Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition names TCEQ Chairman Bryan W.\n\nShaw and Commissioners Buddy Garcia and Carlos Rubinstein, in their official capaci-\n\nties. Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet. paras. 3-5 at 2-3. However, the Plaintiffs have an adequate\n\nstatutory method of appeal against the Commission, not the Commissioners, see TEX.\n\nHEALTH & SAFETY CODE§§ 361.321, 361.322, and they have brought their appeal under\n\nthose sections. See Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet. para. 8 at 3.\n\n     The TSWDA specifically provides that:\n\n     The person appealing the order must join the commission as a party and may\n     join as parties any other person named as a responsible party in the adminis-\n     trative order and any other person who is or may be liable for the elimination\n     of the actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous substances\n     governed by the administrative order.\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(d). This section limits the parties whom the\n\nPlaintiffs may join to their appeal. The individual Commissioners are not included and\n\nare rightfully subsumed within the meaning of \"commission as a party.\" Accordingly,\n\nthe claims against the individual Commissioners are without statutory authority (and as\n\nset forth in II.A., any claim against the Commissioners under the UDJA is redundant\n\nand adds nothing to the Plaintiffs' remedies) and should be struck.\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\n\n                                                                                               680\n\f                               III. PLEA IN ABATEMENT\n\n     Defendants re-allege the matters set forth in their plea to the jurisdiction and assert\n\nthem also as a plea in abatement.\n\n                             IV. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n     Subject to the foregoing plea to the jurisdiction and plea in abatement, Defendants\n\nre-allege the matters set forth in their plea to the jurisdiction and assert them also as\n\naffirmative defenses. Additionally, Defendants assert that:\n\n     •    Plaintiffs' UDJA claim is barred, in whole or in part, by the doctrine of\n\n          sovereign immunity, including both immunity from suit and immunity from\n\n          liability.\n\n     •    The Plaintiffs' request for a declaration under the UDJA that the Order is\n\n          invalid, or is an ultra vires action by the TCEQ or the Commissioners, is not\n\n          within the scope of the actions authorized by the UDJA.\n\n     •    Plaintiffs' claims against TCEQ Chairman Bryan W. Shaw and Commissioners\n\n          Buddy Garcia and Carlos Rubinstein, in their official capacities, are barred, in\n\n          whole or in part, by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, including both\n\n          immunity from suit and immunity from liability.\n\n     •    Plaintiffs' claims against TCEQ Chairman Bryan W. Shaw and Commissioners\n\n          Buddy Garcia and Carlos Rubinstein, in their official capacities, are not within\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\n\n\n                                                                                               681\n\f            the scope of the action provided in Section 361.322 of the Texas Health &\n\n             Safety Code.\n\n                                    V. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n     Defendants specially except to the Plaintiffs' attempt to impose a burden of proof\n\nand a standard of review not contemplated by the TSWDA. Plaintiffs assert that TCEQ\n\nand/or its Commissioners committed an ultra vires act or acts in issuing this Superfund\n\nOrder. 8 However, the TSWDA clearly sets forth the burden of proof and standards of\n\nreview for appeals of Superfund orders, as follows:\n\n     The district court shall uphold the administrative order if the commission\n     proves by a preponderance of the evidence that:\n          (1) there is an actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous\n     substances that is an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public\n     health and safety or the environment; and\n          (2) the person made subject to the administrative order is liable for the\n     elimination of the release or threatened release, in whole or in part.\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(g) (emphasis added). For parties challenging the\n\n\"appropriateness of the selected remedial action ... in the appeal of the administrative\n\norder, the remedial action shall be upheld unless the court determines that the remedy\n\nis arbitrary or unreasonable.\" Id. § 361.322(h) (emphasis added). Finally, a party challeng-\n\ning the administrative order as a whole may establish that it is \"frivolous, unreasonable, or\n\nwithout foundation with respect to a party named by the order.\" Id.§ 361.342 (emphasis\n\n\n\n     8\n         See Pl.s' First Am.

The board\nmay not require a permit under this Act for the disposal of any solid\nwaste to which this subsection applies, but this does not change or limit\nany authority the board may have with respect to the requirement of\npermits, the control of water quality, or otherwise, under the Texas Water\nQuality Act. However, the board may adopt rules and regulations as\nprovided under Subsection (c) of this section to govern and control the\ncollection, handling, storage, and disposal of the industrial solid waste\nto which this subsection applies so as to protect the property of others,\npublic property and rights-of-way, groundwater, and other rights requir-\ning protection. The board may require a person who disposes or plans to\ndispose of industrial solid waste under the authority of this subsection to\nsubmit to the board such information as may be reasonably required to\nenable the board, or the executive director of the board when so author-\nized by the board, to determine whether in the judgment of the board or\nthe executive director the waste disposal activity is one to which this\nsubsection applies.\n    (g) The state agencies may, either individually or jointly:\n    (1) provide educational, advisory, and technical services to other agen-\ncies of the state, regional planning agencies, local governments, special\ndistricts, institutions, and individuals with respect to solid waste man-\nagement and control, including collection, storage, handling and dis-\nposal;\n    (2) assist other agencies of the state, regional planning agencies, local\ngovernments, special districts, and institutions in acquiring federal grants\nfor the development of solid waste facilities and management programs,\nand for research to improve the state of the art; and\n    (3) accept funds from the federal government for purposes relating\nto solid waste management, and to expend money received from the federal\ngovernment for those purposes in the manner prescribed by law and in\naccordance with such agreements as may be necessary and appropriate\nbetween the federal government and each state agency.\n                                    1323\n\fCh. 405       61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n    If a state agency engages in any of the programs and activities named\nin this subsection on an individual basis, it may do so only as the partici-\npation by that state agency is related to the management and control of\nthe solid waste over which it has jurisdiction. When the state agencies do\nnot participate jointly, they shall coordinate on any efforts undertaken by\neither one individually so that similar programs and activities of the state\nagencies will be compatible.\n    (h) The state agencies are authorized to administer and expend state\nfunds provided to them by legislative appropriations, or otherwise, for\nthe purpose of making grants to local governments for solid waste plan-\nning, the installation of solid waste facilities, and the administration of\nsolid waste programs. The grants made under the terms of this Act\nshall be distributed in a manner determined by the state agency to whom\nthe appropriation is made. Any financial assistance granted by the state\nthrough either of the state agencies to any local government under the\nterms of this Act must, at a minimum, be equally matched by local gov-\nernment funds.\n    Sec. 5. (a) Every county has the solid waste management powers\nwhich are enumerated in this Section 5. However, the exercise of the\nlicensing authority and other powers granted to counties by this Act\ndoes not preclude the department or the board from exercising any of\nthe powers vested in the department or the board under other provisions\nof this Act, including specifically the provisions authorizing the depart-\nment and the board to issue permits for the operation and maintenance\nof sites for the disposal of solid waste. The powers specified in Sub-\nsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section may not be exercised by a county\nwith respect to the industrial solid waste disposal practices and areas\nto which Subsection (f) of Section 4 of this Act applies. The department\nor the board, by specific action or directive, may supersede any authority\nor power granted to or exercised by a county under this Act, but only\nwith respect to those matters which are, under this Act, within the juris-\ndiction of the state agency acting.\n    (b) A county is authorized to appropriate and expend money from\nits general revenues for the collection, handling, storage and disposal\nof solid waste and for administering a solid waste program; and to\ncharge reasonable fees for the services.\n    (c) A county may develop county solid waste plans and coordinate\nthose plans with the plans of local governments, regional planning agen-\ncies, other governmental entities, the department, and the board.\n    (d) Except as provided in Subsection (a) of this section, a county\nis empowered to require and issue licenses authorizing and governing\nthe operation and maintenance of sites used for the disposal of solid\nwaste in areas not within the territorial limits of incorporated cities\nand towns. If this power is exercised, the county shall prescribe the form\nof and reasonable requirements for the license application and the pro-\ncedures to be followed in processing the application, to the extent not\notherwise provided for in this subsection. The following additional\nprovisions apply if a county exercises the power authorized in this Sub-\nsection ( d) :\n    (1) The county shall mail a copy of the license application or a sum-\nmary of its contents to the department, the board, and the Texas Air\nControl Board, and to the mayor and health authorities of any city\nwithin whose extraterritorial jurisdiction the solid waste disposal site\nis located. The governmental entities to whom the information is mailed\nshall have a reasonable time, as prescribed by the county, to submit\n                                   1324\n\f              61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                     Ch. 405\ncomments and recommendations on the license application before the\ncounty acts on the application,\n    (2) A separate license shall be issued for each site. The license shall\ninclude the names and addresses of the person who owns the land where\nthe waste disposal site is located and the person who is or will be the\noperator or person in charge of the site; a legal description of the land on\nwhich the site is located; and the terms and conditions on which the\nlicense is issued, including the duration of the license. The county is\nauthorized to charge a fee for a license of not to exceed $100.00, as set by\nthe commissioners court of the county. Receipts from the fees shall be\nplaced in the general revenue fund of the county.\n    (3) The county may extend or renew any license it issues in accord-\nance with reasonable procedures prescribed by the county, The proce-\ndures prescribed in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection (d) apply also to\napplications to extend or renew a license.\n    (4) No license for the use of a site for disposal of solid waste may be\nissued, renewed, or extended without the prior approval, as appropriate,\nof the department or the board, or the executive director of the board\nwhen so authorized by the board. If a license is issued, renewed, or\nextended by a county in accordance with this Subsection (d), the owner\nor operator of the site does not need to obtain a permit from the depart-\nment or the board for the same site.\n    (5) A license is issued in personam and does not attach to the realty\nto which it relates. A license may not be transferred without prior notice\nto and prior approval by the county which issued it.\n    (6) The county has the authority, for good cause, after hearing with\nnotice to the licensee and to the governmental entities named in Para-\ngraph (1) of this Subsection (d), to revoke or amend any license it issues\nfor reasons pertaining to public health, air or water pollution, land use,\nor violation of this Act or of any other applicable laws or regulations\ncontrolling the disposal of solid waste. For like reasons, the department\nand the board each may, for good cause, after hearing with notice to the\nlicensee, the county which issued the license, and the other governmental\nentities named in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection (d), revoke or amend\nany license issued by a county, but only as to those sites which fall, under\nthe terms of this Act, within the jurisdiction of the state agency acting.\n    ( e) Subject to the limitation specified in Subsection (a) of this sec-\ntion, a county may designate land areas not within the territorial limits\nof incorporated cities and towns as suitable for use as solid waste dis-\nposal sites. The county shall base these designations on the principles of\npublic health, safety, and welfare, including proper land use, compliance\nwith state statutes, the reasonable projections of growth and development\nfor any city or town within whose extraterritorial jurisdiction the land\narea may be located, and any other pertinent considerations.\n    (f) A county is authorized to enforce the requirements of this Act and\nthe rules and regulations promulgated by the department and the board as\nrelated to the handling of solid waste.\n    (g) Subject to the limitation prescribed in Subsection (a) of this\nsection, a county, acting through its commissioners court, may make reg-\nulations for the areas of the county not within the territorial limits of\nincorporated cities and towns to provide for governing and controlling\nsolid waste collection, handling, storage and disposal. The regulations\nshall not authorize any activity, method of operation or procedure which\nis prohibited by this Act or by the rules and regulations of the department\nor the board. The county shall not, in its regulations, under the licensing\n                                   1325\n\fCh. 405       61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\npower granted in this Act, or otherwise, prohibit the use of a site within\nthe county for the disposal of solid waste on the basis that the solid waste\noriginates outside that county, or impose any unreasonable requirements\non the disposal of such solid waste in the county not warranted by the\ncircumstances. The county may institute legal proceedings to enforce its\nregulations.\n    (h) A county may enter into cooperative agreements with local gov-\nernments and other governmental entities for the purpose of the joint\noperation of solid waste collection, handling, storage and disposal fa-\ncilities, and to charge reasonable fees for the services.\n    Sec. 6. This section applies to a political subdivision of the state\nwhich has jurisdiction over two or more counties or parts of two or more\ncounties, and which has been granted the power by the Legislature to\nregulate solid waste handling or disposal practices or activities within\nits jurisdiction. The governing body of such a political subdivision may,\nby formal resolution, assume for the political subdivision the exclusive\nauthority to exercise, within the area subject to its jurisdiction, the powers\ngranted in this Act to a county, to the exclusion of the exercise of the same\npowers by the counties otherwise having jurisdiction over the area. In\nthe exercise of these powers the political subdivision is subject to the\nsame duties, limitations and restrictions applicable to counties under this\nAct. When a political subdivision assumes this authority, it shall also\nserve as the coordinator of solid waste handling and disposal practices\nand activities for all cities, counties and other governmental entities with-\nin its jurisdiction which have solid waste disposal regulatory powers or\nengage in solid waste handling or disposal practices or activities. Once\na political subdivision assumes the authority granted in this section, it\nis empowered to and shall exercise the authority so long as the resolution\nof the political subdivision remains in effect.\n    Sec. 7. The authorized agents or employees of the department, the\nboard, and local governments have the right to enter at all reasonable\ntimes in or upon any property, whether public or private, within the gov-\nernmental entity's jurisdiction, including in the case of an incorporated\ncity or town its extraterritorial jurisdiction, for the purpose of inspecting\nand investigating conditions relating to solid waste management and\ncontrol. Agents and employees shall not enter private property having\nmanagement in residence without notifying the management, or the\nperson in charge at the time, of their presence and exhibiting proper\ncredentials. The agents and employees shall observe the rules and regu-\nlations of the establishment being inspected concerning safety, internal\nsecurity, and fire protection.\n    Sec. 8. (a) No person may cause, suffer, allow or permit the col-\nlection, storage, handling or disposal of solid waste, or the use or opera-\ntion of a site for the disposal of solid waste, in violation of this Act or of\nthe rules, regulations, permits, licenses or other orders of the department\nor the board, or a county or a political subdivision exercising the authority\ngranted in Section 6 of this Act within whose jurisdiction the violation\noccurs.\n    (b) Any person who violates any provision of this Act or of any rule,\nregulation, permit, license, or other order of the department or the board,\nor a county or a political subdivision exercising the authority granted in\nSection 6 of this Act within whose jurisdiction the violation occurs, is\nsubject to a civil penalty of not less than $50.00 nor more than $1,000.00\nfor each act of violation and for each day of violation, as the court may\ndeem proper, to be recovered in the manner provided in this Section 8.\n                                    1326\n\f              61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                       Ch. 405\n\n    (c) Whenever it appears that a person has violated, or is violating\nor threatening to violate, any provision of this Act, or of any rule, regula-\ntion, permit, or other order of the department or the board, then the\ndepartment or the board, or the executive director of the board when so\nauthorized by the board, may cause a civil suit to be instituted in a district\ncourt for injunctive relief to restrain the person from continuing the\nviolation or threat of violation, or for the assessment and recovery of a\ncivil penalty of not less than $50.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each act\nof violation and for each day of violation, as the court may deem proper,\nor for both injunctive relief and civil penalty. Upon application for\ninjunctive relief and a finding that a person is violating or threatening\nto violate any provision of this Act or any rule, regulation, permit, or other\norder of the department or the board, the district court shall grant ap-\npropriate injunctive relief. At the request of the department or the\nboard, or the executive director of the board when so authorized by the\nboard, the attorney general shall institute and conduct a suit in the name\nof the State of Texas for injunctive relief or to recover the civil penalty,\nor for both injunctive relief and penalty, as authorized in this subsection.\n    (d) Whenever it appears that a violation or threat of violation of any\nprovision of this Act, or of any rule, regulation, permit, license, or other\norder of the department, the board, a county, or a political subdivision\nexercising the authority granted in Section 6 of this Act, has occurred or\nis occurring within the jurisdiction of that county or political subdivision,\nthe county or political subdivision, in the same manner as the board and\nthe department, may cause a L,viJ suit to be instituted in a district court\nthrough its own attorney for the injunctive relief or civil penalties, or\nbuth, as authorized in Subsection (c) of this section, against the person\nwho committed, is committing, or is threatening to commit, the violation.\n    (e) Wheneve::r it appears that a violation or threat of violation of any\nprovision of this Act, or of any rule, regulation, permit, license, or other\norder of the department, the board, a county, or a political subdivision\nexercisin . r the authority granted in Section 6 of this Act, has occurred or\nis occurring within the area of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of an\nincorporated city or town, or is causing or will cause injury to or an\nadverse effect on the health, welfare or physical property of the city or\ntown or its inhabitants, then the city or town, in the same manner as the\nboard and the department, may cause a civil suit to be instituted in a dis-\ntrict court through its own attorney for the injunctive relief or civil\npenalties, or both, as authorized in Subsection ( c) of this section, against\nthe person who committed, is committing, or is threatening to commit, the\nviolation.\n    (f) A suit for injunctive relief or for recovery of a civil penalty,\nor for both injunctive relief and penalty, may be brought either in the\ncounty where the defendant resides or in the county where the violation or\nthreat of violation occurs. In any suit brought to enjoin a violation or\nthreat of violation of this Act or of any rule, regulation, permit, license\nor other order of the board, the department, a county, or a political\nsubdivision exercising the authority granted in Section 6 of this Act, the\ncourt may grant the governmental en'.ity bringing the suit, without bond\nor other undertaking, any prohibitory or mandatory injunction the facts\nmay warrant, including temporary restraining orders after notice and\nhearing, temporary injunctions, and permanent injunction8.\n    (g) In a suit brought by a local government under Subsection (d) or\n (e) of this section, the board and the department arc necessary and in-\ndispensable parties.\n                                    1327\n\fCh. 405        GIST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     (h) Any party to a suit may appeal from a final judgment as in other\ncivil cases.\n     (i) All civil penalties recovered in suits instituted under this Act by\nthe State of Texas through the board or the department shall be paid to\nthe General Revenue Fund of the State of Texas.

Subsections (c) and (d), Section lla, Solid Waste Disposal Act (Article\n4477-7, Vernon's Texas Civil StatuU>'l), are amended to read as follows:\n   (c) The hazardous waste disposal fee fund shall consist of money collected by the\ncommission from fees imposed on the operator of a solid waste facility for disposal of\nhazardous waste under Section 12 of this Act, from interest and penalties imposed under\nSection 14a of this Act for late payment of a disposal fee or late filing of a report, and\nfrom money paid by a liable party for facility cleanup and maintenance under Subsection\n(m) [(g)] of Section 13 of this Act. In addition, the interest received from the\ninvestment of this fund, in accounts under the charge of the treasurer, shall be\ncredited to the hazardous waste disposal fee fund on a pro rata basis. The com mis·\nsion may use the money credited to the account from interest received from the\ninvestment of the fund for only those purposes specified in Subsection (d) of this\nsection.\n   (d) The commission may use the money collected and deposited in the fund under\nSubsection (c) of this section only for:\n      (1) necessary and appropriate removal and remedial action at sites at which solid\n   [hazardGus] waste or hazardous substances have been disposed if funds from a liable\n   party, independent third party, or the federal government are not sufficient for the\n   removal or remedial action;\n      (2) necessary and appropriate maintenance of removal and remedial actions for the\n   expected life of those actions if funds from a liable party have been collected and\n   deposited in the fund for that purpose or if funds from a liable party, Independent third\n   party, or the federal government are not sufficient for the maintenance; and\n      (3) expenses related to complying with the federal Comprehensive Environmental\n   Response, Compensation, and Liabilit.y Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), the\n   federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, and Sections 8(g) and\n   13 of this Act.                                                                     ·\n   SECTION 5. Section 13, Solid Waste Disposal Act (Article 4477-7, Vernon's Texas\nCivil Statutes), is revised to read as follows:\n   Sec. 13. IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS\nWASTE FACILITIES. (a) The commission shall annually publish an updated state\nregistry identifying, to the extent feasible, every facility that may constitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the environ·\nment due to a release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environ·\n                                           3218\n\f71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAU SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n ment. The registry shall identify the relative priority for action at each listed\nfacility. The relative priority for action at facilities listtd on the registry shall be\n periodically reviewed and revised by the commission, as necessary to accurately\n reflect the need/or action at the facilities. For thtJ purposes of this section, \"facility\"\n means (1) any building, structure, installation, equipment, pipe, or pipeline (includ-\ning any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned treatment works, well, pit, pond, lagoon,\nimpoundment, ditch, landfill, storage container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or\naircraft), or (2) any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,\nstored, disposed of, or placed or otherwise come to be located,· but does not include\n any consumer product in con.'lumer use or any vessel.\n   (b) The executive director may conduct investigations of facilities which are listed\n on the state registry, or which it has reason to believe should be included on the state\nregistry, in accordance with Section 7 of this Act. If there is a reasonable basis to\n believe there may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a\nfacility, the executive director may submit requests for information and requests for\n the production of documents to any person who has or may have information' or\ndocuments relevant to:\n      (1) the identification, nature, or quantity of materials that have been generated,\n   treated, stored, or disposed of at a facility or transported to a facility;\n      (2) the identification of soils, ground water, or surface water at a facility that\n   have been or may be affected by an actual or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance;\n      (3) the nature or extent of a release or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance at or from a facility; or\n      (4) the ability of a person to pay for or to perform a remedial action.\n   If the requested information or documents are not produced in a timely manner,\n the commission may issue an order directing compliance with the requests for\ninformation or production of documents. Information or documents requested\nunder this subsection shall be public records, except that, if a showing satisfactory to\n the commission is made by the owner of the records that the records would divulge\n trade secrets if made public, then the commission shall consider the copied records as\nconfidential. Nothing in this subsection .'/hall require the commission to consider the\ncomposition or characteristics of hazardous substances being processed, stored, dis·\nposed of, or otherwise handled to be held confidential. The commission shall promul-\ngate rules regarding the provision of notice and an opportunity for a hearing before\n the commission on whether the requested injormaf.ion or documents should be\nproduced.\n   (c) Prior to the listing of a facility on the state registry, the executive director shall\nfirst determine whether the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the\nenvironment at the facility can be resolved by the present owner or operator under\n the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8901) or by\nsome or all of the potentially responsible parties identified in Section B(g), pursuant\n to an agreed administrati?Je order issued by the commission. If the potential endan-\ngerment to public health and safety or the environment can be resolved in such a\nmanner, the facility shall not be listed on the state registry. Notice of the approach\nselected to resolve the apparent endangerment to health and public safety or the\nenvironment and the fact that this action is being taken in lieu of listing the facility\non the state registry shall be published in the Texas Register. If after reasonable\nefforts the executive director determines that the potential endangerment to public\nhealth and safety or the environment cannot be resolved by either of these approaches,\n the executive director shall evaluate the facility to determine whether the site exceeds\n the commission~ minimum criteria for listing on the state regisi ry. These minimum\ncriteria shall be promulgated by rule. The executive director sltall also evaluate the\nfacility to determine whether it is eligible for listing on the federal National Priorities\nList. The commission shall proceed under this section only if, based on information\navailable to the executive director, the facility is eligible for listing on the state\nregistry but not eligible for the federal National Priorities List.\n                                           3219\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              7lst LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     (1) Once the executive director has determined that the facility is eligible for\n listing on the state registriJ, the commission shall publish in the Texas Register and\n in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located a\n notice of intent to list the facility on the state registry. The notice shall at least\n specify the name and location of tlte facility, the general nature of the potential\n endangerment to public health and safety or the environment as determined by\n information available to the executive director at that time, and the duties and\n restrictions imposed by Subsection (c)(3) . of this section. The notice also shall\n provide that interested parties may do either or both of the following: (A) submit\n written comments to the commission relative to the proposed listing of the facility,·\n or (B) request a public meeting to discuss the proposed listing by submitting a\n  request within 30 days of issi;ance of the notice.\n    (2) Once the facility is determined tCJ be eligible for listing on the state registry,\n  the executive director shall make all reasonable efforts to identify all potentially\n responsible parties/or remediation of the facility. Concurrent with the publication\n of general notice in accordance with Subdivision (1) of this subsection, the executive\n director shall provide to e3.ch identified potentially responsible party direct, written\n notification of the proposed listing of the facility on the state registry and of the\n procedures for requesting a public meeting to discuss the listit.:i and the inform.a·\n  tion included in the general notice as required by Subdivision (1) of thi'l subsection.\n  Written notifications under this subsection shall be by certified mail, return receipt\n requested, by mailing notice to each named responsible party at the party 8 last\n known address.\n    (3) If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on\n  the state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and\n location of the public meeting in the Texas Register and in the same newspaper in\n which the notice of the opportunity to request the public meetin,Q was published.\n  The public meeting notice shall be provided at least 30 days in advance of the\n meeting. Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, to all identified potentially responsible parties at the parties' last\n known addresses. Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible\n party pursuant to this subdivision or Subdivision (2) of this subsection shall in no\n way affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party. Contem·\n poraneously with the issuance of notice of the public meeting, the executive director\n shall make available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the\n facility. For the purposes of providing this information, the executive director\n shall provide a brief summary of the public records he has and make these public\n records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.\n    (4) The public meetings will be legislative in nature and not contested case\n hearings under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article\n 6252-13a, Vernons Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held/or the purpose\n of obtaining additional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility\n of the facility for listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially\n respon:Jible partfos.\n    (5) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a public\n meeting has passed, the commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or\n notice in the real property records of the county in which a facility is located\n identifying the facility as one proposed for listing on the state registry, unless the\n executive director determines, based on information presented at the public meet·\n ing, that efforts to list the facility on the state registry should not be pursued.\n    (6)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a pubtic\n meeting has passed, but prior to any listing of the facility on the state registry, the\n commission shall allow all identified potentially responsible parties the opportuni·\n ty to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial investigation/feasibility study, or\n similar study as approved by the executive director, for the facility. The potentially\n responsible parties shall have 90 days from the date of the issuance of notice of the\n opportunity to request a public meeting to make a good faith offer to conduct the\n                                         3220\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                         Ch. 703, § 5\n study. If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible parties is\n received by the commission within 90 days, those making the offer sl:all have an\n additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from\n  the commission, which shall include a scope of work. The commission shall not\n require the participating potentially responsible parties to agree to perform the\n remedial action or admit liability for the facility remediation in this agreed\n administrative order.\n       (B) If no potentially responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the\n    executive director or .if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to\n    conduct or complete an· approved study, the commission is authorized to conduct\n    or complete the study using funds from the hc;,zardous waste disposal fee fund.\n       (C) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial inves-\n    tigation/feasibility Etudy or other similar study as approved by the executive\n    director, no costs for commission oversight of the study may be assessed against\n    those parties who fund or perform the study. Nonparticipating pote.ttially\n    responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of\n    the facility under this Act or who subsequentll' enter into an agreed ordu relative\n    to the remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs fot\n    commission oversight of the study process. If all potentially responsible parties\n    participate or agree to fund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other\n    similar study, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the hazardous\n    waste disposal fee fund.\n       (D) Once the executive director has determin 1u;! that a facility is eligible for\n    listing on the state registry, no person shall perform at the facility any partial or\n    total removal activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropri-\n    ate circumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other poten-\n    tially responsible parties. The commission may develop rules determining what\n    constitutes an appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this\n    paragraph. Authorization by the executive director to conduct a partial or total\n    removal action shall not constitute a final determination of the party$ ultimate\n    liability for remediation of the facility, nor a determination of divisibility.\n    (7)(A) Once the facility is determined to be eligibl1?for listing on the state registry,\n the owner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with\n written notice of any substantial change in use of the facility at least 60 days before\n the change in use is made. Notice of a prnposed substantial change in use shall be\n in writing, addressed to the executive director, provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, and shall include a brief description of the proposed change in\n use. A substantia! change in use shall be defined by rule and shall include but not\n be limited to actions such as the erection of a building or other structure at the\n facility, the use of the facility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility\n for use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\n private recreational use on the facility.\n       (B) If, within 30 days of the notice, the executive director determines that the\n    proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a proposed or\n    ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study, or similar study approved by\n    the executive director, or expose the public health and safety or the environment\n    to a significantly increased threat of harm, then he shall notify the owner or\n    operator of his determination. Once the determination is made and notification\n    given, the owner or operator shall not proceed with the proposed substantial\n    change in use. The owner or operator may request a hearing before the commis-\n    sion on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submitting\n    a request within 30 days of receipt of the executive director$ determination. If a\n    hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing within 45 days of\n    the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the\n    Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon$\n                                          3221\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     Texas Civil Statutes). The executive director's determination shall become unap-\n     pealable 30 days after issuance if a hearing is not requested.\n    (8) Within a reasonable time following the completion of the remedial investiga·\n  tionlfeasibility study or other similar study, if required, the executive director shall\n select a proposed remedial action. Subsequent to its selection of a proposed\n remedial action, the commission shall hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed\n action. The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register\n and in a newspaper ofgeneral circulation in the county where the facility is located\n at least 45 days prior to the public meeting. The notice shall provide information\n regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, and place of the\n meeting. The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially\n responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at each party's last\n known address at least 45 days prior to the publii: meeting Contemporaneously\n with the issuance of notice of the public meeti1~g, the executive director shall make\n available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the facility.\n For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall provide a\n brief summary of the public records he has and make these public records available\n for inspection and copying during regular business hours. Nonreceipt of any notice\n mailed to a potentially responsible party pursuant to this subdivision shall in no\n 1;ay affect the responsibilities, duties, 01· liabilities imposed on any such party.\n    (9) The public meeting shall bt legislative in nature and not conducted as a\n contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act\n (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the\n purpose :if obtaining additional information regarding the facility and the identifi·\n cation of additional potentially responsible parties. Those in attendance may\n present their comments on the proposed remedial action, and the executive director\n may revise its proposed remedial action in light of the presentations.\n    (JO)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the\n commission shall provide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportu-\n nity to fund or perform the proposed remedial action. The potentially responsible\n parties shall have 60 days from the date of the public meeting in which to make a\n good faith offer to perform or fund the proposed remedial action. If a good faith\n offer is made by all or some of the potentially responsible parties within the 6{1-day\n period, then these parties will have an additional 60 days to negotiate an aoreed\n administrative order from the commission, which shall include a scope of u ork.\n The commission shall not require an admission of liability in the agreed adr.1 inis·\n trative order.\n       (B) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial ac·\n    tion, no costs for commission oversight of the remedial action may be assessed\n    against those parties who fund or perform the remedial action. Nonpartic·\n    ipating potentially responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable\n    for remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs/or commission\n    oversight of the remedial action. If all potentially responsible parties conduct or\n    fund the remedial action, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the\n    hazardous waste disposal fee fund. Participation in the remedial action does not\n    relieve those who did not conduct or fund the remedial investigation/feasibility\n    study or other similar study approved by the executive director from paying their\n    portion of the oversight costs of that phase of the remediation.\n       (C) The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to\n    conduct a partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if the executive\n    director determines that the release or threatened release is divisible after notice\n    and opportunity for comment to all other potentially responsible parties. For\n    purposes of this section, \"divisible\" means that the hazardous substance released\n    or threatened to be released is capable of being managed separately under the\n    remedial action plan. A determination of divisibility by the executive director\n    shall have no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on a potentially responsible\n    party's ultimate liability for remediation of the facility under Section 8.\n                                         3222\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n      (11) After consideration of all good faith offers to perform a remedial action, the\n   commission shall issue a final administrative order that shall:\n        (A) list the facility on the state registry, thus determining that the facility poses\n      an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\n      environment;\n        (B) specify the selected remedial action,·\n         (C) list the parties determined to be responsible for remediating the facility,·\n         (D) make findings offact describing actions voluntarily undertaken by respon-\n      sible parties,·\n        (E) order the responsible parties to remediate the facility and, if appropriate,\n      reimburse the hazardous waste disposal fee fund for remedial investigation/fea-\n      sibility study and remediation costs;\n        (F) establish a schedule for completion of the remedial action,·\n        (G) state any determination of divisibility of responsible party liability; and\n        (H) give notice of the duties and restrictions imposed by Subsection (/) of this\n      section.      ·\n   The provisions in Sections B(g), 9, 10, and 11 of this Act relating to administrative\norders shall apply to orders issued pursuant to this paragraph.\n      (12) If a potentially responsible party is newly identified after a final administra-\n   tive order has been issued by the commission pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this\n   sub~ection, that party shall have 60 days to negotiate an amendment to the existing\n   order. The commission shall not be prohibited from issuing a separate order for\n   the newly identified potentially responsible party if it determines that the circum-\n   stances warrant a separate order. The responsible parties identified in the order\n   issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this subsection shall be allowed to comment\n   on the issuance of a separate order for the newly identified potentially responsible\n   party.\n   (d) The commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real\nproperty records of the county in which the facility is located stating that the facility\nhas been listed on or deleted from the state registry or is no longer proposed for\nlisting on the state registry, within a reasonable period after a determination has\nbeen made.\n   (e) Any owner or operator or other named responsible party of a facility listed or to\nbe listed in the state registry may request the commission to delete the facility from\n the state registry, modify the facility~ priority within the state registry, or modify\nany information regarding the facility by submitting a written statement setting\nforth the grounds of the request in the form as the commission may require pursuant\n to its promulgated rules. The commission shall promulgate rules establishing proce-\ndures, including public hearings, for review of requests submitted pursuant to this\nsubsection.\n   (/) Subsequent to the listing of a facility on the state registry, no person may\nsubstantially change the manner in which the facility is used without notifying the\nexecutive director and receiving written approval of the executive director for the\nchange. A substantial change in use shall be rll!fined by rule and shall include but\nnot be limited to actions such as the erection of u building or other structure at the\nfacility, the use of the facility for agriculturq,l production, the paving of the facility\nfor use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\nprivate recreational use on the facility. The notice shall be in writing, addressed to\n the executive director, provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall\ninclude a brief description of the proposed change of use. The executive director shall\napprove or disapprove the proposed action within 60 days of receipt of the notice of\nproposed change in use. The executive director shall not approve the proposed change\nof use if such new use will significantly interfere with a proposed, ongoing, or\ncompleted remedial action program at a facility or expose the public health and\nsafety or the environment to a significantly increased threat of harm.\n                                           3223\n\fCh. 703, § 5                                71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n   (g)(J) Whenever the commission, after investigation, finds that there exists a release\nor threatened release of a hazardous substance at n facility that: (A) is causing\nirreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and safety or the environment,·\nand (B) the immediacy of the situation makes it prejudic.ial to the public interest to\ndelay action until an administrative order can be issue1t to potentially responsible\nparties or until a judgment can be entered in an appeal of an administrative order,·\n the commission may, with the funds available to the corn.mission from the hazardous\nwaste disposal fee fund, undertake immediate removal action at the facility to\nalleviate the harm. After the immediate danger of irreversible or irreparable harm\nhas been alleviated, the commission shall proceed pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection. Fi.ndings required pursuant to this subsection shall be in writing and may\nbe made by the commission on an ex parte basis subject to judicial review pursuant to\n the substantial evidence rule as provided by the Administrative Procedure and Texas\nRegister Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon~ Texas Civil Statutes).\n      (2) The reasonable expenses of any immediate removal action taken by the\n   commission may be recoverable from the persons described in Section 8, and the\n   state may seek to recover the reasonable expenses in any court of appropriate\n   jurisdiction.\n   (h) Whenever a person ordered to eliminate an imminent and substantial endan·\ngerment to the public health and safety or the environment has failed to do so within\n the time limits specified in the order or any extension of time approved by the\ncommission, the commission may implement the remedial action program for the\nfacility. The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by\n the commission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be\nrecoverable under the provisions of Subsection (m) of this section.\n   (i)(J) The goal of any remedial action shall be the elimination of the imminent and\nsubstantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment posed\n by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility. The\nappropriate extent of the remedial action at any particular facility shall be deter-\n mined by the commission~ selection of the remedial alternative which the state\nagency determines is cost effective (i.e., the lowest cost alternative that is technologi-\ncally feasible and reliable and which effectively mitigates and minimizes damage to\nand provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the environment).\n      (2) In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular\n   facility, the commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or\n   standard of control at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and\n   appropriate standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or\n   local law, if the commission finds that:\n         (A) the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will\n      attain such level or standard of control when completed,·\n         (B) compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk\n      to public health and safety or the environment than alternative options,·\n         (C) compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an\n      engineering perspective,·\n         (D) the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performance that is\n      equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement,\n      criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach,·\n         (E) with respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the\n      locality has not consistently applied (or demonstrated the intention to consistent-\n      ly apply) the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circum-\n      stances of other remedial actions within the locality,· or\n         (F) with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial\n      action that attains such levels or standards of control will not provide a balance\n      between the need/or protection of public health and safety or the environment at\n      the facility and the availabilty of state funds to respond to other sites that present\n                                           3224\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                        Ch. 703, § 5\n      a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration\n      the relative immediacy of the threats.\n  (jJ In adflition to all other remedies available to the state under this Act or any\nother law or statute, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to the state\nshall constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to the\nreal property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action. This provision is\ncumulative of other remedies available to the state under this Act.\n      (JJ The lien imposed by this subsection shall arise and attach to th,e real property\n  subject to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and\n  indexed in accordance with this subsection in the county in which the real property\n  is located. For the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien\n  shall not relate back to a time prior to the date on which the affidavit is recorded,\n  which date shall be the lien inception date.

The bond shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the\n  real property subject to the lien is located. An action to establish, enforce, or\n  foreclose any lien or claim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later\n   than the 90th day after the date of service of notice of the bond.\n      (BJ The bond must:\n         (AJ describe the real property upon which the lien is claimed,·\n         (BJ refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it,·\n          (CJ be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to,·\n          (DJ be payable to the commission;\n         (EJ be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety\n      authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety,· and\n          (FJ be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the\n      commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be\n      a lien on the real property.\n      (9J .After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the\n  named obligee. A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice. The notice may\n  be served on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person\n  competent to make oath of the delivery. The original notice shall be returned to the\n                                          3225\n\fCh. 703, § 5                               71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n    office of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath\n    on the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.\n    The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that\n    purpose. In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely\n    on and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.\n       (10) The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day following the date on\n    which the notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the\n    date on which the notice is served. If the commission recovers in a suit on the lien\n    or on the bond, it is entitled to also recover reasonable attorney's fees.\n   (k) Money for actions taken or to be taken by the commission in connection with the\n elimination of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and\n safety or the environment pursuant to this section shall be payable directly to the\n commission from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund. This includes any costs of\n inspection or sampling and laboratory analysis of wastes, soils, air, surface water,\n and ground water done on behalf of a state agency and the costs of investigations to\n identify and locate potentially responsible parties.\n    (l) The commission shall seek remediation of facilities by potentially responsible\n parties prior to expenditure offederal or state funds for the remediations. Potential·\n ly responsible parties shall coordinate with ongoing federal and state hazardous waste\n programs, although no state or local permit shall be required for any removal or\n remedial action conducted on site. Subject to the provisions nf Subsection (i) of this\n section, the state may enforce any federal or state standard, requirement, criterion,\n or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be required to conform if a\n permit were required. No action taken by the person to contain or remove a release\n or threatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be\n construed as an admission of liability for said release or threatened release. No\n person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or threatened\n release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be liable for any\n additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or omissions of\n the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals required by\n this subsection, unless the remediation costs were caused by the person's gross\n negligence or wilful misconduct. Except as specifically provided in this subsection,\n these provisions shall not be construed to expand or diminish the common law tort\n liability, if any, of private parties participa~ing in a remediation action for civil\n damages to third parties.\n    (m) The commission sh1ill file a cost recovery action against all respomnble parties\n who have not complied with the terms of an administrative order issued pursuant to\n Subdivision (11} or (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The commission shall file\n the cost recovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been\n completed. The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the\n total amount of the cost of the remedial action, including costs of any necessary\n studies and oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any\n other responsible parties pursuant to an order issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) or\n (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The action may also include a plea seeking civil\n penalties for noncompliance with the commission's administrative order and a claim\n for up to double the state's costs if the responsible party's defenses are determined by\n the court to be unreasonable, frivolous, or without foundation.\n· (n)(l) A responsible party named in an administrative order who does not comply\n with the order shall become subject to the imposition of administrative or civil\n penalties under Section Bb of this Act. The penalties may be assessed only from the\n date after which the administrative order becomes nonappealable.\n       (2) The commission is authorized to include provisions within an agreed adminis·\n    trative order that stipulate administrative penalty amounts for failure to comply\n    with the order. The penalty provisions may be applicable to either or both of the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study and remedial action orders.\n    (o)(l) The commiss-ion shall promulgate rules necessary to develop a mixed funding\n program in which available money from potentially responsible parties is combined\n                                          8226\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                            Ch. 703, § 5\nwith state or federal funds to clean up a facility in a timely manner. Use of the state\nor federal funds in a mixed funding approach shall not preclude the state or federal\ngovernment from seeking recovery of its costs from nonparticipating potentially\nresponsible parties.\n      (2) The commission shall assess and may, through rulemaking, develop and\n  implement a de minimis settlement program. Under the program, the commission\n  shall be required to consider the advantages of developing a final settlement with\n   potentially responsible parties that are responsible for only a minor portion of the\n  response costs at a facility because the hazardous substances the party is respon•\n  sible for are minimal in amount or in hazardous effect by comparison with the\n  hazardous substances attributable to other parties.\n      (3) The commission shall investigate additional alternative programs to encour·\n  age potentially responsible parties to investigate or remediate facilities and report\n   its findings to the 72nd Legislature with recommendations for legislative action.\n  (p) The commission is authorized to determine whether a potentially responsible\nparty is. financially capable of conducting any necessary remediation studies or\nremedial action. The commission shall promulgate rules to develop the criteria for\ndetermination of financial capability. If no financially capable potentially r~pon·\nsible parties exist for a facility, the commission shall issue an administrative order\nstating its determination that the facility constitutes an imminent and substantial\nendangerment and that there are no financially capable potentially responsible\nparties. The commission shall then conduct its own remediation study and remedial\naction, using federal funds if available. Iffederal funds are not available, state funds\nfrom the hazardous waste disposal fee fund shall be used. Generally, the remediation\nof listed facilities shall be achieved first by private party funding, second with the aid\nof federal funds, and third, if necessary, with state funds from the hazardous waste\ndisposal fee fund.\n  (q) The executive director or the commission shall have the authority to extend any\ntime period specified in this section if deemed appropriate.\n   [Seo. 13, IDENTIFICATION AND J..SSESSMENT OF HAZJ..RDO:US WASTE FA\nCIUTIES, (a) The department ef water reseurees, in eeeperatien with the department,\nshall oenduot and oemplete a survey ef the state by July 1, 11~8G 1 the pUFf19Se ef whioh is\nt9 identify te the extent feasible every hazardeus waste faoility whieh may oenstitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment te publio health and safety er the envirenment,\nThe werk already perfermed te identify eandidate sites fur inolusien in the federal\nNatienal Pri9rities list shall serve as the basis fer suoh a sun•ey, As seen as pessible\nafter e9mpletien ef a draft survey, the department ef water reseurees shall eenduot a\npublio hearing te selieit oemments en the draft survey and inf9rmatien en additienal\neandidate sites.

Because these operations often impact their\nenvironment, they generally must obtain water-quality permits from the Texas Commission on\nEnvironmental Quality (the “TCEQ” or “Commission”). These permits are designed to control the\nwaste produced at such facilities and through regulation prevent it from polluting nearby water\nsources.\n\n    When a CAFO applies for a permit, interested parties may object to the proposed permit during\na comment period. These parties may also seek to intervene and request a public hearing on the\nproposed permit. But before granting a contested case hearing—a trial-like proceeding with at-\ntendant expense and delay—a threshold determination must be made as to whether the party is an\n“affected person” with standing to request such a hearing.\n\n    *411 In this appeal, the TCEQ granted an amendment to a dairy CAFO's water-quality permit\nover objections from a downstream city, which claimed that the dairy's operations under the\namended permit would adversely affect the quality of the municipal water supply. The city sought\nto intervene in the permit process and obtain a contested case hearing. After a period for public\ncomment and meeting, the Commission granted the amended permit without a contested case\nhearing, and the city sought judicial review, complaining that it was entitled to a contested case\nhearing because it was an “affected person.” By rule, an affected person may request a contested\ncase hearing, “when authorized by law.” 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(b)(4).\n\n    The court of appeals agreed that the city was an affected person and held that the Commission\nabused its discretion in denying the city's request for a contested case hearing. 346 S.W.3d 781,\n827 (Tex.App.-Austin 2011). The court accordingly reversed the district court's judgment, which\nhad affirmed the Commission's decision, and remanded the matter to the TCEQ. Because we do\nnot agree that the Commission abused its discretion in denying the hearing request, we reverse and\nrender judgment for the Commission.\n\n                                                 I\n    Waste water discharges are generally regulated and permitted through the federal Clean Water\nAct and the delegation of the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n(“NPDES”) Program to the State of Texas.FN1 The Clean Water Act requires states to prepare\nreports every two years on the quality of water in the state and to make recommendations for re-\nducing pollution. 33 U.S.C. § 1315. The federal act further requires states to update water-quality\nstandards every three years. The standards are then used to set effluent limitations in water-quality\npermits.

J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\n\n        FN1. At one time, water quality protection was left largely to the states, but with the en-\n        actment of the Federal Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, commonly known as\n        the Clean Water Act, the federal government took on this responsibility. See 33 U.S.C. §§\n        1251–1387. The Clean Water Act created a federal permitting system (the NPDES) that\n        requires a permit of any person discharging pollutants into a surface water body.\n\n    In Texas, the TCEQ has the primary authority to establish surface water quality standards,\nwhich it implements, in part, in its permitting actions. See 33 U.S.C. § 1313(a), (d); TEX. WATER\nCODE § 26.023; see also id. § 5.013(a)(3) (granting the TCEQ general jurisdiction over “the\nstate's water quality program including issuance of permits, enforcement of water quality rules,\nstandards, orders, and permits, and water quality planning”). The agency continually monitors and\nevaluates the state's water quality as part of its primary responsibility to preserve and conserve the\nstate's natural resources. TEX. WATER CODE § 5.012. Over the past fifteen years, the TCEQ has\ndevoted particular attention to the water quality of the North Bosque River.\n\n   The North Bosque River extends from its headwaters in Erath County, through Hamilton and\nBosque Counties, and into McLennan County where it joins two other branches of the Bosque to\nform Lake Waco. Lake Waco serves as the municipal water supply for the City of Waco. The City\nowns all adjudicated and permitted rights to the water impounded in the lake, which is the sole\nsource of drinking water for approximately 160,000 people.\n\n   In recent decades, the dairy industry in the North Bosque watershed has experienced signifi-\ncant growth. This, in turn, *412 has raised concerns over the increasing volumes of animal waste\nproduced by these dairies and the possibilities for such waste to damage the water quality of the\nNorth Bosque and, ultimately, Lake Waco.\n\n    The drinking water in Waco has historically had taste and odor problems. For many years, the\nCity has attributed these problems to algae blooms in Lake Waco, which the City believes to be\nexacerbated by the proliferation of animal waste in the North Bosque watershed. As a result, the\nCity and others have sought to impose stricter regulatory limits on dairies in the North Bosque\nwatershed.\n\n   The Clean Water Act requires Texas and the other states to identify water bodies that do not\nmeet, or are not expected to meet, water-quality standards. 33 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(1). In 1998, the\nCommission determined that two segments FN2 (Segments 1255 and 1226) of the North Bosque\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works.\n\f                                                                                              Page 6\n\n\n413 S.W.3d 409, 56 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\nRiver above Lake Waco were “impaired” under “narrative” water-quality standards “related to\nnutrients and aquatic plant growth.” FN3 Segment 1255 extends from the North Bosque's head-\nwaters to a point just downstream from Stephenville, and Segment 1226 extends from that point to\nwhere the river flows into Lake Waco. Lake Waco itself, however, was not determined to be an\n“impaired” water body.\n\n        FN2. For purposes of water quality management, the TCEQ segments the state's major\n        surface waters.\n\n        FN3. The court of appeals defined a “narrative” water-quality standard as “qualitative,\n        somewhat subjective assessments of ‘too much,’ in contrast to quantitative or numeric\n        measures.” 346 S.W.3d at 793.\n\n    Once a water body is identified as impaired, the state must determine a “total maximum daily\nload” or TMDL for the water body. The TMDL serves to budget the maximum amount of a pol-\nlutant that a water body can receive and still meet the applicable water-quality standard. See id. §\n1313(d)(1)(C). Following study and public comment from the City and others, the Commission\ndetermined that soluble phosphorus, which it attributed primarily to dairies' waste application\nfields and municipal water-treatment plants, was the key variable that could be controlled to limit\nalgal plant growth in the North Bosque River. The Commission accordingly approved TMDLs that\nproposed a fifty-percent reduction in soluble phosphorus loading over time. After further study\nand comment (including comments from the City), the Commission in 2002 proposed an imple-\nmentation plan through which dairies and cities could reduce phosphorus loadings. In 2004, the\nCommission amended its rules, making parts of the plan legally enforceable. See 30 Tex. Admin.\nCode §§ 321.31–321.47.\n\n    Meanwhile, in 2001, the Legislature, at the City's urging, imposed new environmental re-\nstrictions on dairy CAFOs located in a “major sole source impairment zone” (MSSIZ). See gen-\nerally TEX. WATER CODE §§ 26.501–.504. At the time of enactment, the North Bosque wa-\ntershed was the only area to which the MSSIZ legislation applied. See id. § 26.502 (defining major\nsole source impairment zone). The legislation required that new or expanded CAFOs located\nwithin a MSSIZ obtain an individual water-quality permit—a permit tailored to the dairy's par-\nticular circumstances. See id. § 26.503(a). Before this legislation, CAFOs in the North Bosque\nwatershed could operate under general permits, a permit type exempted from the contest-\ned-case-hearing process. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(7). The MSSIZ legislation thus\neffectively removed that exemption for CAFOs covered by the statute, opening their permit pro-\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig.

J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\nceedings*413 to the potential for contested-case hearings.\n\n    The Commission thereafter amended its rules to incorporate the legislative changes for CAFOs\nin the North Bosque River impairment zone. See 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 321.32–.35, .39,\n.48, .49. The amended rules required dairy CAFOs in the watershed to obtain individual permits\nwhen their current permits expired. Id. The amended rules also imposed stricter requirements on\nthe management and disposal of wastewater and manure by the CAFOs.\n\n    About this same time, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new rules and guidelines\ngoverning CAFOs. 40 C.F.R. §§ 122, 123, 412. The federal changes expanded the federal defini-\ntion of CAFOs and imposed stricter nutrient-management and record-keeping requirements on the\nfacilities. See id. In response, the Commission again rewrote its rules in 2004 to mirror the federal\nchanges, imposing more stringent controls on CAFOs, especially those in the North Bosque wa-\ntershed. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 321.31–.47. The rules provided, however, that CAFOs\nneeding individual permits could continue to operate under their old authorizations so long as the\noperator applied for an individual permit by July 27, 2004. 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 321.33(g). In\nMarch 2004, the operators of the O–Kee Dairy applied to amend their water-quality permit.\n\n    The O–Kee Dairy is in Hamilton County about 80 miles upstream from Lake Waco. It is sit-\nuated a few miles from the North Bosque River but within its watershed. Under the new regula-\ntions, O–Kee needed to convert from a general to an individual permit. In its application, the dairy\nalso sought to expand its herd from 690 to 999 cows and its total waste-application acreage from\n261 to 285.4 acres.\n\n     The Commission's executive director declared the O–Kee Dairy permit application adminis-\ntratively complete, conducted technical review, prepared a draft permit, and issued a preliminary\ndecision that the draft permit met all statutory and regulatory requirements. The draft permit\nproposed to increase the dairy's maximum herd size and total waste application acreage as re-\nquested. The draft also proposed several new measures to strengthen the overall water-quality\nprotections at the facility, even with the increase in the number of cows. These measures included\nreducing the possibility of discharges from the dairy's retention control structures (RCSs) FN4 by,\namong other things, more than doubling their total storage capacity and improving monitoring of\nsludge and water levels. There were also new restrictions aimed at reducing the risk of waste\nrunoff from the waste application fields. The dairy was further required to expand the size of\nnon-vegetative buffer zones around the waste application fields and to transport excess waste\noff-site. The new measures purported to conform to the numerous regulatory changes imposed on\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

Retention control structures are ponds used to collect runoff of manure and\n        wastewater from areas where cows are confined.\n\n    The executive director's preliminary decision that the draft permit met all statutory and regu-\nlatory requirements triggered a period of public notice and comment. See TEX. WATER CODE §\n5.553(b), (c). The City submitted public comments and requested a public meeting, which was\ngranted. See id. § 5.554. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the executive *414 di-\nrector responded to the City's public comments, agreeing to make some changes to permit provi-\nsions governing waste application in the dairy's waste application fields or off-site, but otherwise\nrejecting the City's complaints. See id. § 5.555.\n\n    The City next filed a written request for a contested case hearing that incorporated its prior\ncomments, replied to the executive director's responses, and identified the legal and factual issues\nit considered to be in dispute. See id. § 5.556; 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201 (Texas Comm'n on\nEnvtl. Quality, Requests for Reconsideration or Contested Case Hearing). In its request, the City\nasserted it was an “affected person” with a personal justiciable interest in the O–Kee permit ap-\nplication process. The City attached two affidavits to its hearing request—one from a professional\nengineer, Bruce L. Wiland, whom the City presented as an expert in water-quality analysis, the\nother from the City's water-utility director, Richard L. Garrett, also an engineer. The City's claim\nto affected-party status rested on the assertions and opinions of these two experts, which the court\nof appeals summarized as follows:\n\n  • The City possesses a personal justiciable interest in the quality of the water in Lake Waco\n  because it owns all adjudicated and permitted rights to the water impounded in the lake and uses\n  the water as its sole source of supply for its municipal water utility, exclusive of emergency\n  connections. The City must treat the water to ensure that it is safe for uses that include drinking\n  and bathing and that it will be regarded as palatable by the customers to whom the City sells the\n  water, including 113,000 City residents, approximately 45,000 residents of surrounding mu-\n  nicipalities, and major industrial customers “that place a premium on the quality of the water\n  they use.” Otherwise, the City is placed at a competitive disadvantage in preserving and growing\n  its water-utility customer base and, ultimately, its broader economic health.\n\n  • For many years, the City has received complaints about offensive taste and odor in its drinking\n  water. The source of these problems has proven to be a geosmin (earthy odor) produced by de-\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\n  caying algae that grows in Lake Waco during warm weather. Beginning in the 1980s, Lake\n  Waco began to experience more frequent and longer durations of algal blooms, with corre-\n  spondingly more taste and odor problems in the City's drinking water. To counter these prob-\n  lems, the City has incurred escalating costs in attempting to treat the water. Despite these addi-\n  tional expenditures, current treatment methods (chiefly, the use of powdered activated carbon)\n  have repeatedly fallen short of eliminating the geosmin, necessitating that the City deliver of-\n  fensive smelling and tasting water to customers for the time being and that it plan and budget to\n  install different and more expensive water-treatment systems in the future.\n\n  • There is a causal linkage between the increasing algal growths in Lake Waco (and resultant\n  taste and odor problems in the City's drinking water) and phosphorus loading from dairies up-\n  stream in the North Bosque watershed. The North Bosque contributes approximately 64 percent\n  of the total flow into Lake Waco and over 72 percent of the total phosphorus loading to the lake.\n  Between 30 to 40 percent of the lake's total phosphorus load is attributable to dairy operations in\n  the North Bosque watershed, most of which stems from runoff and discharges that occur during\n  heavy rainstorms. This phosphorus loading attributable to dairies in the North Bosque*415\n  watershed, in turn, is the primary cause of the lake's heavy algal growth.\n\n  • In addition to contributing nutrients that lead to algal growth and, ultimately, to taste and odor\n  problems in drinking water, CAFOs in the North Bosque watershed are also a source of bacteria\n  and other pathogens entering Lake Waco. In addition to driving up water treatment costs, the\n  presence of these pathogens in the lake endanger the health and enjoyment of the City's many\n  citizens who swim, fish, sail, ski, and engage in other water recreation there.\n\n  • If the problems with the proposed O–Kee Dairy permit identified in the City's comments are\n  not remedied to any greater extent than described in the executive director's response, the in-\n  creases in the dairy's herd size from 690 to 999 will increase the amounts of phosphorus and\n  bacteria transmitted from the dairy, its waste application fields, and third-party fields into the\n  North Bosque and downstream to Lake Waco, where it will contribute to increased algal growth,\n  more bacteria, and the problems that follow. Although Lake Waco is approximately eighty miles\n  downstream from the O—Kee Dairy, the distance does not substantially reduce these adverse\n  effects because the primary mechanism through which these pollutants are transported are heavy\n  rains, which can deliver the pollutants downstream in as little as 3–5 days.\n\n    346 S.W.3d at 795–96. Anyone may publicly comment on a pending water-quality permit, but\nonly those commentators who are also “affected persons” may obtain a public hearing.

Code § 55.201(b).\n\n    After analyzing a non-exclusive list of factors prescribed by agency rule for making this de-\ntermination, the executive director concluded that the City was not entitled to a hearing because it\ndid not meet the requirement of an “affected person” with regard to the O–Kee Dairy permit. See\nid. § 55.203(c). The executive director accordingly recommended that the Commission deny the\nCity's request for a contested case hearing. 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.209(d), (e). The City re-\nplied, filing a supplemental affidavit from its expert Wiland, who disputed the executive director's\nanalysis and elaborated on his opinion of the causal link between claimed deficiencies in the\nproposed permit and water-quality problems in Lake Waco. See id. § 55.209(g).\n\n    After a public meeting at which the Commission considered the City's hearing request and the\nO–Kee Dairy permit application, see id. § 55.209(g), the City's hearing request was denied. See id.\n§ 55.211(b). The Commission also adopted the executive director's response to public comment,\napproved the permit amendment, and issued the permit as the executive director proposed. Alt-\nhough the City was denied a contested case hearing, it was afforded several opportunities to make\na record in the agency, including during the public comment period, at two public meetings, in a\nwritten request for contested case hearing, and in responses to the executive director's written\ncomments and analysis. There is no indication that the Commission prevented the City from filing\nany evidence it deemed relevant to the proposed amended permit.\n\n    The City sought judicial review of the Commission's order in district court. See TEX. WATER\nCODE §§ 5.351, .354. The district court affirmed the Commission's decision. The City next ap-\npealed to the court of appeals, which reversed and remanded the case to the Commission. 346\nS.W.3d 781, 827. The court of appeals concluded that the City was an affected person that *416\nwas entitled to a contested case hearing and that “the Commission acted arbitrarily and abused its\ndiscretion in concluding” otherwise. Id. The Commission has appealed that decision to this Court.\n\n                                                 II\n    Chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code governs CAFO water-quality permits, authorizing the\nTCEQ to “issue permits and amendments to permits for the discharge of waste or pollutants into or\nadjacent to waters in the state.” TEX. WATER CODE § 26.027(a). Under this chapter, the\nCommission is required to give public notice of a permit application and, when requested by a\ncommissioner, the executive director, or “any affected person,” hold a “public hearing” on the\napplication.

Exempt from the “public hearing” requirement, however, are\napplications to amend or renew a water-quality permit that do not seek either to “increase signif-\n\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id. § 26.028(d).\n\n    The term “public hearing” is not defined in chapter 26, see id. § 26.001 (Definitions), but in\ncontext can refer either to a hearing before the Commission or a contested case hearing before the\nState Office of Administrative Hearings. See id. § 26.020 (authorizing the Commission to hold\nhearings “with respect to administering the provisions of this chapter”); id. § 26.01 (authorizing\nthe Commission to delegate any hearing to the State Office of Administrative Hearings). Public\nhearings under chapter 26 can be expansive, such as a public hearing on water quality standards at\nwhich “any person may appear and present evidence” or limited, such as a public hearing on a\nparticular application for a water quality permit. Compare id. § 26.024 (pertaining to public\nhearings on standards) with id. § 26.028(c) (pertaining to public hearings on permit applications).\nIn the permit application context, the Code indicates that a public hearing means a contested case\nhearing under the Texas Administrative Procedure Act. See TEX. WATER CODE § 5.551 (re-\nferring to “an opportunity for public hearing under Subchapters C–H, Chapter 2001, Government\nCode, regarding commission actions relating to a permit issued under Chapter 26 [of the Water\nCode]”). Chapter 5, subchapter M, of the Water Code makes that connection while laying out the\nprocedure for notice and opportunities for public comment, public meetings, and contested case\nhearings in the environmental permitting process. See id. at §§ 5.551–.559.\n\n    As part of that procedure, subchapter M provides that interested parties, who have filed\ncomments during the process, may request a contested case hearing. Id. § 5.556(c). The Com-\nmission may not grant the request, however, without first determining that the requestor is an\n“affected person,” id., which subchapter M defines as:\n\n  [A] person who has a personal justiciable interest related to a legal right, duty, privilege, power,\n  or economic interest affected by the administrative hearing. An interest common to members of\n  the general public does not qualify as a personal justiciable interest.\n\n    TEX. WATER CODE § 5.115(a); see also 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.103 (Agency rule in-\ncorporating same definition of “affected person”). The Commission is further delegated the au-\nthority to promulgate “rules specifying factors which must be considered in determining whether a\nperson is *417 an affected person.” TEX.

Admin. Code § 55.203(c)(1)–(6).\n\n    In addition to being an affected person, the requestor must timely file a written request for a\ncontested case hearing, “identify[ing] the person's personal justiciable interest affected by the\n[permit] application” and “list [ing] all relevant and material disputed issues of fact that were\nraised during the public comment period and that are the basis of the hearing request.” 30 Tex.\nAdmin. Code § 55.201(a), (c), (d)(2), (4); see also TEX.

The Commission then “evaluates” the request and must grant it if it is made by an “af-\nfected person” and is (1) timely filed, (2) “is pursuant to a right to hearing authorized by law,” (3)\ncomplies with the form and content requirements of rule section 55.201, and (4) “raises disputed\nissues of fact that were raised during the [public] comment period, that were not withdrawn ... and\nthat are relevant and material to the commission's decision on the application.” See 30 Tex.

Code § 55.211(b)–(d).\n\n    As a matter of statutory interpretation, the court of appeals concluded that section 5.115's af-\nfected-person definition embodied the constitutional principles of standing. See 346 S.W.3d at 801\n(observing that the “cornerstone” of the definition “denotes the constitutionally minimal re-\nquirements for litigants to have standing to challenge governmental actions in court”). The court\nexplained that those principles required the City to establish a concrete and particularized injury in\nfact, not common to the general public, that is: (1) actual or imminent; (2) fairly traceable to the\nissuance of the permit as proposed; and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision on its\ncomplaint. Id. at 801, 810–11.\n\n    *418 The court concluded that the City possessed a legally protected interest in Lake Waco's\nwater quality, distinct from that of the general public, but that the City's personal justiciable in-\nterest in the O–Kee Dairy permit application—its status as an affected party—depended on the\nresolution of disputed fact issues. Id. at 811. The court further acknowledged that the Commission\nhad weighed the evidence and found these disputed facts against the City, reasoning that the City\nhad failed to establish “the requisite ‘concrete and particularized,’ imminent injury ‘fairly tracea-\nble’ to the issuance of the O–Kee Dairy permit and likely redressed by denying the permit or\nimposing additional conditions.” Id. The court summarized the Commission's factual determina-\ntions, bearing on the City's status as an affected party, in its opinion, writing:\n\n  • the amended O–Kee Dairy permit would not increase but reduce the risk and amount of\n  phosphorus or pathogens being contributed by the dairy to the North Bosque River;\n\n  • any phosphorus or pollutants the dairy did contribute would be “assimilated” or “diluted” as\n  they washed downstream so as to have no ultimate impact on Lake Waco;\n\n  • assuming any phosphorus from the dairy actually reached Lake Waco, whether it would con-\n  tribute to algal growth would be, at best, speculative because (a) myriad other sources also\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Nor has North Bosque\n  segment 1226—the segment immediately north of Lake Waco that includes the O–Kee\n  Dairy—been deemed impaired by bacteria since 2002.\n\n    Id. at 811. Although not determined in a contested case hearing, the court found no reason to\nforeclose the Commission's discretion to consider evidence when determining “whether a ‘request\nwas filed by an affected person as defined by Section 5.115.’ ” Id. at 813 (quoting TEX. WATER\nCODE § 5.556(c)).\n\n    The court, however, rejected the Commission's thesis that the City could not show any con-\ncrete or imminent adverse effect or injury if the amended permit were approved simply because the\namended permit was designed to be more protective of the North Bosque's water quality than the\ncurrent one. The court reasoned that the relative protectiveness of the amended permit was,\nstanding alone, irrelevant because it was an “acknowledged certainty” that there would be some\ndischarge or runoff into the North Bosque under the amended permit. Id. at 822. And, if that\ndischarge were to “harm Lake Waco's water quality and the City's legally protected interest in it,\nthe City would have a personal justiciable interest in ensuring that the permitted activities comply\nwith current legal requirements.” Id. The court then concluded that “to the extent that the Com-\nmission denied the City's hearing request based on the premise that *419 the amended O–Kee\nDairy permit would be ‘more protective’ of the environment than the current one, it acted arbi-\ntrarily by relying on a factor that is irrelevant to the City's standing to obtain a hearing.” Id. at\n822–23.FN6 Finally, the court suggested that the Commission had conceded the City's entitlement\nto a contested case hearing by classifying the O–Kee Dairy permit as a “major amendment,” be-\ncause the City otherwise met the definition of an “affected person.” Id. at 825.\n\n        FN6.

Concluding that the water code and Commission rules\n        create an entitlement to a contested case hearing that is analogous to a civil claimant's right\n        to have disputed material fact issues determined at trial, the court held that the Commission\n        could not resolve disputed, merit-based issues relevant to standing without a contested case\n        hearing. Id. at 824–25 (citing Tex. Dep't of Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217\n        (Tex.2004)).\n\n                                                   III\n    The Commission complains that its classification of the O–Kee permit application as a major\namendment was not a concession that the City (or for that matter an affected person) was entitled\nto a contested case hearing. A major amendment is defined by rule as one that “changes a sub-\nstantive term ... or a limiting parameter of a permit.” 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 305.62(c)(1). A minor\namendment, on the other hand, is one that “improve[s] or maintain[s] the permitted quality or\nmethod of disposal of waste” (among other things). Id. The Commission submits that the terms are\nnot mutually exclusive. An application to amend a permit may fit both definitions. For example, an\namendment that changes a substantive term and improves the quality of the waste discharge, the\nCommission submits, is both major and minor.\n\n    The distinction is significant in the first instance because a contested case hearing is not\navailable for a minor amendment to an existing permit. 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(1). But\nthere is also no express right to a contested case hearing merely because the applicant seeks a\nmajor amendment. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(5) (limiting right to contested case\nhearing where applicant is not applying to increase significantly the quantity of waste discharged\nor materially change the pattern or place of discharge, among other considerations).\n\n    [1] Although the Water Code generally grants a person affected by a permit application a right\nto a public hearing, the Code also provides exceptions to this general rule. TEX. WATER CODE §\n26.028(c), (d). Exempt from this public hearing requirement is an application to amend or renew a\nwater-quality permit that does not seek either to “increase significantly the quantity of waste au-\nthorized to be discharged” or “change materially the pattern or place of discharge,” if “the activi-\nties to be authorized ... will maintain or improve the quality of waste authorized to be discharged,”\nand meet certain other requirements.

As noted, the court of appeals viewed the inquiry as irrelevant to the issue of the\nparty's status as an affected person, and, in any event, conceded by *420 the Commission as not\nexempt from the hearing requirement because of the “major amendment” label it attached to the\napplication. Id. at 822–25. In light of the discretion the statute confers on the Commission in de-\ntermining the need for a public hearing, however, we cannot agree that a proposed amended permit\nthat purports to provide greater protection for water quality is an irrelevant consideration when\nevaluating the need for a public hearing.\n\n    The Commission asserts that the more protective nature of the amended permit is a relevant\nfactor in its determination of whether the City will be affected by the permit. But whether we\naccept this as part of the affected person analysis, as the Commission urges, or follow the court of\nappeals' analysis of “affected person” as merely a codification of the constitutional principal of\nstanding does not ultimately determine the City's right to a hearing in this case. Under either ap-\nproach, we must account for the Commission's discretion to limit or deny public hearings on\namended permits that maintain or improve the quality of any discharge and that neither increase\nsignificantly the quantity of waste authorized to be discharged nor change materially the pattern or\nplace of discharge. TEX. WATER CODE § 26.028(d). Thus, even assuming the City might oth-\nerwise qualify as an affected person under the statute's definition, it may still not be entitled to a\npublic hearing if section 26.028(d)'s exception reasonably applies.\n\n    The Commission's list of factors to be considered in determining affected person status and the\npublic hearing exemption expressed in section 26.028(d) overlap to some degree. Compare 30\nTex. Admin.Code § 55.203(c) with TEX. WATER CODE § 26.028. For example, one of the\nCommission's factors focuses on the “likely impact of the regulated activity on use of the impacted\nnatural resource by the person.” 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.203(c)(5). During the comment period,\nthe City argued that the increase in the size of the O–Kee herd authorized by the amended permit\nwould naturally lead to more waste and inevitably to more phosphorous and other nutrients and\npathogens making their way into the North Bosque and eventually into Lake Waco, which, in turn,\nwould increase the City's water treatment costs. The City supported its argument with expert\nopinion in affidavit form. One of the City's experts attested to a causal link between the increasing\nalgal growths in Lake Waco and phosphorus loading from dairies upstream in the North Bosque\nwatershed. This expert estimated that the North Bosque contributed about 64 percent of the total\nflow into Lake Waco. He further attributed about 30 to 40 percent of the lake's total phosphorus\nload to dairy operations in the North Bosque, stemming from runoff and waste discharges during\nheavy rainstorms. This source of phosphorus loading was in his opinion the primary cause of the\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

The\nexecutive director, however, did not agree that the proposed amendment to the O–Kee permit\nwould have an adverse affect on Lake Waco or the City.\n\n    Relying on the sworn application, attached expert reports, the analysis and opinions of pro-\nfessionals on its staff, and reports, opinions and data about the North Bosque watershed gathered\nand analyzed by the TCEQ for nearly a decade, the executive director recommended that the\nCommission issue O–Kee's amended permit without a hearing. With this recommendation, he\nincluded a map and fact sheet, the draft permit, his response to public comments, and the dairy's\ncompliance history. The fact sheet discussed the water-quality inventory for Segments 1226 and\n1255, the TMDLs, the TDML implementation*421 plan, the “White Paper” (which was also\nsubmitted by the City), and interoffice memos of the professional staff documenting their analysis\nof the application.\n\n    The Commission points out that a permit application to the TCEQ amounts to an affidavit with\nexpert reports attached. The applicant must verify that the information submitted is true, accurate,\nand complete. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 305.44(b), 321.34(b). Maps and technical reports must be\nprepared by a licensed professional engineer, a licensed professional geoscientist, or other quali-\nfied person. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 305.45(a)(6), (8), 321.34(f). The applications are then re-\nviewed by the executive director's professional staff.\n\n    The Commission submits that the O–Kee permit was drafted by an engineer on the executive\ndirector's staff and reviewed by several other professionals. A geoscientist on the executive di-\nrector's Water Quality Assessment Team evaluated the proposed permit, as did a soil conserva-\ntionist and an engineer at the National Resource Conservation Service and the Texas Soil & Water\nConservation Board. The draft permit incorporated their comments. The Land Application Team\nconcluded that the permit application proposed adequate buffer zones, and the Water Quality\nAssessment Team determined that the permit terms “are expected to preclude a permitted increase\nin pollutant loadings from [the dairy].”\n\n    The Commission had before it evidence that the proposed permit's modifications to the dairy's\nmanagement of its wastewater and manure would reduce the pollutants from the dairy that were\nlikely to be discharged into the watershed. There was also evidence that the more stringent waste\napplication requirements imposed by the proposed permit would reduce the amount of phosphorus\nrunoff from waste application fields. Indeed, the proposed permit implemented the new regula-\ntions promulgated by the Commission to comply with Environmental Protection Agency rules and\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These new requirements were\ncategorized by their intended goals: reduce the potential for discharges, minimize the nutrient\nloading to land and surface water, and increase Commission oversight of the dairy's operational\nactivities.\n\n    The proposed permit thus requires the dairy to bring its operations into compliance with the\nnew rules regulating CAFOs. This includes increasing its wastewater and manure retention control\nstructure capacity by approximately 13 acre feet. The increased storage capacity is designed to\nreduce the number of discharges from the dairy during heavy rainfall events, and reflects that,\nunder the new rules, CAFOs may only discharge during a 25 year/10 day rainfall event as opposed\nto a 25 year/24 hour rainfall event. The existing retention structures were designed to capture and\nretain runoff from a 7.3 inch rainfall; the new structures must capture and retain runoff from a 12.2\ninch rainfall. The dairy is also required to implement a retained control structure management plan\nto assure that it maintains wastewater volumes within the designed operating capacity of the\nstructures, except during chronic or catastrophic rainfall events, and maintain sludge at or below\nthe design sludge volume. These management tools reduce the likelihood of discharge during\nsmaller rainfall events and reduce overflows associated with insufficient wastewater storage ca-\npacity.\n\n    The proposed permit also requires changes in the land application of manure and wastewater\nfrom the dairy, imposing a nutrient management plan designed to *422 minimize nutrient loading\nto land and surface water through measurement of soil and waste phosphorus levels. This meas-\nurement, known as a risk potential assessment,FN7 ensures that phosphorus levels remain in a\nproper balance, which, in turn, reduces runoff risk. Further, in order to minimize nutrient loading,\nthe land application rate of manure and wastewater must be based on the crop's phosphorus re-\nquirements rather than its nitrogen requirements as under the old permit. For a coastal bermuda\ncrop, all other things being equal, the result is a 40% decrease in the application rate. Manure,\nsludge, or wastewater in excess of that permitted to be applied to the land must be delivered to a\ncomposting facility, delivered to a permitted landfill, beneficially used by land application outside\nthe watershed, or provided to operators of third-party fields for beneficial use in a manner con-\nsistent with Commission rules. The regulations on manure disposal contained in the proposed\npermit limit the unregulated disposal of manure and wastewater in the watershed.\n\n        FN7. Risk potential is determined by measuring, among other things, the current phos-\n        phorus levels in the soil, the proposed phosphorus application rate, and dairy's proximity to\n        the nearest water body—here the Bosque. Application rates are then adjusted according to\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\n        the risk potential—i.e. the higher the risk, the lower the application rate. In addition, the\n        application rate is determined by the amount of nutrients needed for optimal crop produc-\n        tion and then balances that need between the nutrients in the soil and the nutrient\n        source—manure and wastewater. Once the nutrients are in balance, it is very unlikely that\n        excess nutrients will leave the site and affect water quality.\n\n    Any waste stored temporarily on-site must be stockpiled in well-drained areas and adequately\nsloped to ensure proper drainage and prevent ponding of water. To protect against discharge,\nstockpiles must generally be kept beneath impermeable roofs to ensure that waste does not leave\nthe storage area. Waste may also be composted on-site so long as it is done in accordance with\nCommission rules. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 332.\n\n    Excess waste that cannot be used on site must be removed. See TEX. WATER CODE\n26.503(b)(2). Most removal methods require delivery of the waste to locations outside of the North\nBosque watershed, but the Code also allows delivery of waste to third-party fields—areas of land\nin the watershed not owned, operated or otherwise controlled by the permitee. The City objected to\nthis aspect of the permit, but the Commission found it to be in compliance with the rules, which\nrequire all transferred waste to be applied to those fields at the proper agronomic rate based on the\nsoil's existing phosphorus content. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 321.36, 321.40. The dairy is further\nprohibited from delivering manure or wastewater to a third-party field once the soil test phos-\nphorus analysis shows a level equal to or greater than 200 ppm. Moreover, the third-party fields\nmust be identified in the dairy's pollution prevention plan, and quarterly reports with the name,\nlocations, and amounts of manure and wastewater transferred to operators of third party fields\nmust be submitted. To ensure compliance with all the new requirements, the permit implements\nincreased oversight of operational activities by the Commission. These measures require O–Kee to\nsubmit reports to the Commission concerning, among other things, land application records, an-\nnual soil samples, and chronic rainfall discharges.\n\n    The Commission considered these management tools and found that although there will be\nmore cows at the dairy, the overall impact of the permit's requirements will be to reduce the like-\nlihood that phosphorus from the dairy will enter the *423 watershed. The Commission concluded\nthat the proposed permit would effectively decrease, rather than increase, the amount of phos-\nphorus discharged into the watershed and thus have an overall beneficial environmental impact. It\ntherefore rejected the City's argument that the City would be adversely affected by its granting the\npermit.\n\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\n    The City questions whether the proposed permit will improve the water quality in the North\nBosque and argues that, in any event, it has a justiciable interest in the proposed permit because it\nauthorizes the discharge of waste that ultimately affects its interests in Lake Waco. The City thus\nfocuses on potential harm rather than any relative environmental improvement under the proposed\npermit. The issue, however, is whether the City has a statutory right to intervene in the permitting\nprocess and obtain a contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n    [2] Although the APA defines “contested case” and sets the procedural framework, the\nagency's enabling act here sets out whether rights are to be determined after an opportunity for\nadjudicative hearing, and agency rules may decide whether that opportunity may include a con-\ntested case hearing. For example, this court of appeals has previously affirmed the TCEQ's rule\nthat a request for a contested case hearing is not itself a contested case hearing, concluding that a\nhearing request may be decided through a less formal proceeding before the Commission. Collins\nv. Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n, 94 S.W.3d 876, 884–85 (Tex.App.–Austin 2002, no\npet.).\n\n     Collins involved a poultry farm that applied for an individual water quality permit to change\nfrom a dry waste management system to a system that generated wastewater to be stored in lined\nlagoons and irrigated onto crop land. A neighbor to the poultry operation protested the application\nand requested a contested case hearing. After briefing and a limited hearing before the State Office\nof Administrative Hearings to determine the neighbor's proximity, the TCEQ denied the neigh-\nbor's hearing request. Construing Water Code § 5.115, as it existed before the statute's amendment\nin 1999, the court found that the Commission's denial of the hearing request was supported by\nsubstantial evidence. Id. at 885.\n\n    The Collins court also rejected the neighbor's claim that he was denied due process. The court\nreasoned that the issuance of a permit in itself does not deprive a neighboring landowner of any\nconcrete liberty or property interest. Id. at 884–85. The court observed that the Commission's rules\nseek to protect such interests and expressly state that “the issuance of a permit does not authorize\nany injury to persons or property or an invasion of any other property rights.” Id. at 884 (quoting\n30 Tex. Admin. Code § 305.122(c)). The court further concluded that even if a private property\ninterest were at issue, “due process never requires all the trial-like procedures of a statutory con-\ntested case hearing.” Id. at 885. The court of appeals accordingly upheld the Commission's denial\nof the neighbor's hearing request, concluding that the Commission's process for evaluating hearing\nrequests by persons who claimed to be affected, satisfied procedural due process requirements.

J. 931\n(Cite as: 413 S.W.3d 409)\n\n    Focusing on its “affected party” analysis, the court of appeals concludes that the case here is\ncontrolled by other decisions which hold “that it is the existence of some impact from a permitted\nactivity, and not necessarily the extent or amount of impact, that is relevant to standing.” 346\nS.W.3d at 822 (citing *424United Copper Indus., Inc. v.

Justice, 962 S.W.2d 288, 295 (Tex.App.–Austin 1998, pet. denied)). United Copper and\nHeat Energy likewise focus on the requestor's status as an affected person and do not otherwise\nconsider the person's statutory right to a hearing or statutory exceptions to that right.\n\n    In Heat Energy, the owner of a hazardous and industrial waste storage and processing facility\nsought to renew its permit to conduct its business. 962 S.W.2d at 289. A coalition of nearby res-\nidents asked the Commission to conduct a contested case hearing on the renewal application. Id.\nThe request was filed pursuant to section 361.088 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, which requires\nthe Commission to “provide an opportunity for a hearing to the applicant and persons affected”\nbefore a permit is issued, amended, extended or renewed. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §\n361.088(c). The requirement for a contested case hearing does not apply, however, when the ap-\nplication is to renew a permit for the storage or processing of hazardous waste that was generated\non-site and not mixed with waste generated elsewhere, and the Commission has complied with the\nnotice and comment requirements of the Water Code. Id. § 361.088(e); see also TEX. WATER\nCODE §§ 5.552–.555. This hearing-requirement exemption was not at issue in Heat Energy.\nSimilarly, no hearing-requirement exemption was discussed, or even asserted, in United Copper.\n\n    The Commission complains that the court of appeals has misread the statutory exemption and\nagency rules that define hearing rights under chapter 26 of the Water Code. Agency rules provide\nthat an affected person may request a contested case hearing “when authorized by law.” 30 Tex.\nAdmin. Code § 55.201(b)(4). But no right to a contested case hearing exists for “an application,\nunder Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, to renew or amend a permit” under certain circumstances.\nId. § 55.201(i)(5). Thus, a person affected by a proposed water-quality permit has the right to\nrequest a hearing (if the person meets the statutory definition of “affected person” in section 5.115\nof the Water Code), but the Commission has discretion to deny the request when the proposed\npermit is an amendment or renewal and (1) the applicant is not applying to significantly increase\nthe discharge of waste or materially change the pattern or place of discharge, (2) the authorization\nunder the permit will maintain or improve the quality of the discharge, (3) when required, the\nCommission has given notice, the opportunity for a public meeting, and considered and responded\nto all timely public comments, and (4) applicant's compliance history raises no additional con-\ncerns.

Collins, 94 S.W.3d at 884–85. The\nstatute similarly supports a less formal determination when section 26.028(d) applies, stating that\nthe Commission may under these circumstances approve an application to renew or amend a\npermit “at a regular meeting without the necessity of holding a public hearing.” TEX. WATER\nCODE § 26.028(d).\n\n    [3] We conclude that there is evidence in the record to support the Commission's determination\nthat the proposed amended permit here did not seek to significantly increase or materially change\nthe authorized discharge of waste or otherwise foreclose Commission discretion to consider the\namended application at a regular meeting*425 rather than after a contested case hearing. The\nCommission therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying the City's request for a contested case\nhearing on O–Kee's application for an amended permit.\n\n   The court of appeals' judgment remanding the matter to the Commission for a contested case\nhearing is accordingly reversed and judgment is rendered affirming the Commission's decision to\ndeny the hearing request.\n\nTex.,2013.\nTexas Com'n on Environmental Quality v.

The Solid Waste Disposal Act authorizes the Commission to issue\n     administrative orders under § 361.188 and § 361.272, but these orders are\n     not mutually exclusive and are subject to the same appellate provisions.\n\n2.   The Commission issued the Administrative Order for the Voda Site pursuant\n     to § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n\n3.   Judicial review of the Administrative Order for the Voda Site is\n     constitutional and appropriate under § 361.322 of the Solid Waste Disposal\n     Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - ix -\n\f           STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      A.     History of the Voda Site.\n\n      The Voda Petroleum State Superfund Site (the “Voda Site”) is comprised of\n\napproximately 6.12 acres located in Gregg County, Texas. (AR 2907.) The Voda\n\nSite was historically used by Voda Petroleum, Inc. as an oil blending and recycling\n\nfacility from approximately 1981 to 1991, when all operations ceased and the Voda\n\nSite was abandoned. (AR 3126.)\n\n      B.     EPA performs a removal action for the Voda Site.\n\n      In the mid-1990s, both the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and\n\nthe Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (“TNRCC”) investigated\n\nthe Voda Site to determine whether historic operations had resulted in the release\n\nof hazardous substances. (AR 3030, 3495.) Part of this investigation included a\n\nHazard Ranking System (“HRS”) evaluation of the Voda Site. (AR 3495.) The\n\nVoda Site scored a 23.6 on the HRS scale, which was too low to qualify the Voda\n\nSite for the federal Superfund program. (AR 3509.) Instead, the Voda Site was\n\nreferred in 1995 to EPA for an immediate removal action. (AR 3029.) EPA’s\n\nAction Memorandum seeking approval for the removal action indicated that\n\nfollowing the removal action “there is no potential for further state/local response.”\n\n(AR 3033.)\n\f      EPA conducted the removal action in 1996, removing drums and above-\n\nground tanks of grease and corrosive wastes, including associated soil exposed to\n\nthese materials, and backfilling with clean soil. (AR 943.) After the removal action\n\nwas complete, EPA’s contractor sampled both on-site soils and groundwater as\n\npart of a post-removal assessment. (AR 3127.) EPA issued a post-closure report\n\nconfirming the removal action had abated the imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment and that cleanup activities at the site had met EPA’s health based\n\ncleanup standards for industrial land usage. (AR 3128, 61877.) Following its\n\nremoval action, EPA sought recovery of its costs and entered into Administrative\n\nOrders of Consent (“AOCs”) with companies that EPA had named as potentially\n\nresponsible parties (“PRPs”) for the Voda Site. (AR 61852.)\n\n      C.    The TNRCC initiates the state listing process without\n            reevaluating the Voda Site following the EPA’s removal action.\n\n      More than four years after the EPA removal action, the TNRCC proposed\n\nthe Voda Site for listing on the Texas Superfund registry on November 17, 2000.\n\n(AR 46233.) Although the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (“SWDA”) requires\n\nthe agency to ensure that a site exceed 5.0 on the HRS score to proceed with\n\nlisting, the Commission did not re-score the Voda Site to account for the EPA’s\n\nwork. The Commission sent correspondence to certain entities it believed had\n\nhistorically shipped materials to the Voda Site. (AR 16708-16710.) The\n\nCommission asserted that each recipient was potentially responsible for\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fenvironmental investigation and eventual remediation at the Voda Site, informed\n\nthe recipients of the proposed listing, and included a Notice of Opportunity to\n\nMake Good Faith Offer to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study\n\n(“RI/FS”). (AR 08614-46109.) Several parties submitted written comments and\n\nobjections, noting that there was no empirical data to support an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment finding and no evidence to support listing the Voda Site\n\non the Texas Superfund registry. (AR 41577-41578.) Nevertheless, the State went\n\nforward with its plan to list the Voda Site.\n\n      D.     The TCEQ issues an administrative order for the Voda Site\n             pursuant to § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the SWDA.\n\n      A draft administrative order for the Voda Site was docketed for\n\nconsideration by the Commissioners at a public meeting of the Texas Commission\n\non Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”)1 on February 10, 2010. (AR 51125.) Agenda\n\nItem No. 7 pertaining to the Voda Site was described on the docket as\n\n“Consideration of a Final Administrative Order (Final Order) pursuant to Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code Sections 361.188 and 361.272 for the Voda Petroleum,\n\nInc. State Superfund Site….” (AR 51127.)\n\n      Charmaine Backens, counsel for the Executive Director of the TCEQ,\n\npresented the draft administrative order to the Commissioners. Following a brief\n\n1\n   The TNRCC was renamed the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality effective\nJanuary 1, 2004.\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdescription of the Voda Site and the remedial action plan, Backens testified that\n\n“the Executive Director respectfully requests…recommends [sic] issuing this\n\nAdministrative Order for remedial activities at the Voda Petroleum State\n\nSuperfund Site pursuant to Chapter 361, sections 188 and 272 of the Health and\n\nSafety Code.” (AR 50382.)\n\n      A handful of PRPs were granted approximately five minutes to address the\n\nCommissioners regarding the agenda item, in which they argued that the\n\nCommissioners should delay issuance of the administrative order and allow the\n\nparties to present evidence to the Commission. Id. Counsel for the Executive\n\nDirector responded that “the law governing this case does not provide for an\n\nadjudicatory hearing at this time” and noted that the Executive Director would not\n\ndirectly address these objections, suggesting instead that the appropriate remedy\n\nwas to appeal to the district court. Id.\n\n      The Commissioners followed the Executive Director’s recommendation and\n\non February 12, 2010, issued a unilateral administrative order for the Voda Site\n\npursuant to § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the SWDA (“the Order” or “AO”).\n\n(CR:29-108; App. A.) The AO named ExxonMobil and Shell—among\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fapproximately 350 other entities—as responsible parties and ordered them to pay\n\nthe TCEQ’s response costs for the Voda Site.2 Id.\n\n      E.     PRPs named in the AO seek a rehearing but are denied.\n\n      On March 12, 2010, Luminant, one of the parties named in the Order, filed a\n\nmotion for rehearing before the Commission. (AR 50870.) Luminant argued that\n\nthe SWDA requires the Commission to determine “the lowest cost alternative” to\n\nremediate the Voda Site and that another contractor was prepared to present a\n\nlower cost alternative remedy than had been adopted in the AO. (AR 50864.)\n\n      The TCEQ filed a written response to Luminant’s motion, first noting that\n\n“the Commission issued the Order pursuant to Tex. Health and Safety Code §§\n\n361.188 and 361.272 (West 2010).” (AR 49650; App B.) The TCEQ then argued\n\nthat Luminant was “not entitled to a rehearing because the law did not afford it a\n\nhearing in the first instance. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.274 (West\n\n2010) (stating that ‘[a]n administrative order under Section 361.272 does not\n\nrequire prior notice or an adjudicative hearing before the commission’.”) Id. To\n\ndrive the point home, the TCEQ concluded that “[b]ecause the Order was issued\n\nunder Sections 361.272 and 361.188 (Administrative Order 1), it did not require an\n\nadjudicative hearing before the Commission.” (AR 49650; App. B.) The\n\n2\n    Appellees ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Exxon Mobil Corporation, Pennzoil-Quaker State\nCompany, and Shell Oil Company are referred to collectively as “ExxonMobil and Shell”\nthroughout this brief.\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fCommission did not timely grant Luminant’s request, and the AO became final on\n\nApril 8, 2010. (AR 10.)\n\n       F.     ExxonMobil and Shell challenge the AO in Travis County District\n              Court.\n\n       On March 26, 2010, ExxonMobil and Shell filed their First Amended\n\nOriginal Petition appealing the AO in Travis County District Court. (CR:4-27;\n\nApp. C.)3 ExxonMobil and Shell challenged the AO and the Commission’s actions\n\nunder the SWDA as well as § 37.001 of the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct. Id.\n\n       On August 1, 2011, the TCEQ filed its Original Counter-Petition and Third-\n\nParty Petition, pleading as follows: “On February 12, 2010, the TCEQ issued an\n\nadministrative order (“the Order”) under §§ 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….”\n\n(CR:127-169; App. D.)4 The TCEQ brought claims for cost recovery against\n\nExxonMobil and Shell and other PRPs pursuant to § 361.197(d), an action to\n\nenforce the AO pursuant to § 361.321 and § 361.322(g), and injunctive relief\n\npursuant to § 361.273(2). Id.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Appellees filed their Original Petition on March 12, 2010. On May 18, 2010, the Amended\nPetition was consolidated, along with nine other lawsuits filed by a number of other entities\nnamed in the AO, into a new cause number. (CR:112-26.)\n4\n    The TCEQ has filed two “supplements” to its Original Petition. However, neither supplement\nrevised or amended the factual allegations discussed herein. (CR:450-54.)\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f       G.     The parties engage in broad discovery at the trial court.\n\n       Although the State now argues judicial review of the AO is limited to the\n\nTCEQ’s administrative record for the Voda Site, the State’s discovery at the trial\n\ncourt contained no such limitations. Consistent with their live pleadings5 and each\n\nsuccessive amended scheduling order, the State spent nearly four years pursuing\n\nunrestricted discovery on ExxonMobil and Shell. The Commission propounded\n\nextensive written discovery on ExxonMobil and Shell and deposed corporate\n\nrepresentatives for both entities on a wide variety of issues outside the\n\nadministrative record. (Supp. CR at ___ [TCEQ’s First Written Discovery to\n\nExxonMobil Corporation and Shell Oil Company (served on September 10, 2013)];\n\n(Supp. CR at ___ [TCEQ’s Notice of Oral Deposition (served on Sep. 20, 2012));\n\nTCEQ’s Notice of Oral Deposition (served on Oct. 4, 2012)]. The State also\n\nengaged in extensive expert discovery, designating eight state employee expert\n\nwitnesses, five non-state employee retained expert witnesses, and two non-retained\n\ntestifying expert witnesses which are presently identified to testify at trial, despite\n\nthe Commission’s current claim that the testimony of their own experts is actually\n\nirrelevant to the case. (Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on Environmental\n\nQuality’s Amended Designation of Experts (served on May 10, 2013)].\n\n5\n    Shortly before filing current Plea to the Jurisdiction, the Commission filed a Motion for\nLeave to Amend Pleadings and Discovery. However, the trial court denied this motion via\nwritten order on July 31, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f      H.    The State reverses course and argues that review is limited to an\n            administrative record.\n\n      On December 18, 2013—approximately four years after the case was filed—\n\nthe State filed a Motion for Revised Discovery Control Plan in the trial court.\n\n(Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Motion for\n\nRevised Discovery Control Plan (filed December 18, 2013)]. For the first time, the\n\nState advanced the argument that: (1) the AO was issued exclusively under §\n\n361.188 of the SWDA; and (2) judicial review of the AO was therefore limited to\n\nan administrative record the TCEQ was in the process of compiling. Id. The trial\n\ncourt rejected the State’s arguments and denied the motion via a written order\n\nsigned on March 4, 2014. The Commission did not seek an interlocutory appeal of\n\nthis order. (Supp. CR at ___ [Order Denying Motion for Revised Discovery\n\nControl Plan (filed March 4, 2014)].\n\n      On July 15, the TCEQ recycled precisely these same arguments in a new\n\nmotion restyled as a “Plea to the Jurisdiction.” (CR:729-859.) Although the State’s\n\nnewly-filed plea did not contain any reference to sovereign immunity—in fact, the\n\nwords “sovereign immunity” did not even appear in the motion—the State argued\n\nin a reply brief and at a subsequent hearing that because the AO was a strictly “188\n\nOrder” judicial review under any standard other than § 361.321 violated the state’s\n\nimmunity from suit. Following a hearing on this motion, the trial court rejected the\n\nmotion via written order on October 1, 2014. (CR:1151.)\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n      The TCEQ issued a unilateral administrative order pursuant to two\n\nprovisions of the SWDA—§ 361.188 and § 361.272—ordering ExxonMobil and\n\nShell to pay millions of dollars to reimburse the State’s remediation of the Voda\n\nSite. ExxonMobil and Shell were denied an adjudicatory hearing prior to issuance\n\nand had no opportunity to present experts or cross-examine the State’s witnesses\n\nregarding liability. Instead, the TCEQ invoked its broadest powers under the\n\nSWDA to block any hearing and attempted to hold persons named in the order\n\njointly and severally liable for response costs. For nearly four years, these were\n\nuncontested procedural facts while the parties litigated the case at the district court.\n\n      Following the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco, the TCEQ\n\nmade a strategic decision to expand the boundaries of that holding in this case.\n\nAlthough the AO was subject to judicial review based on a preponderance of the\n\nevidence at the district court, the State attempts to whitewash the AO’s history and\n\nthe Commission’s own pleadings by claiming that it actually issued the Order\n\nsolely under § 361.188, which the State believes now entitles it to pure substantial\n\nevidence review. But regardless of whether the Commission issued the Order\n\npursuant to § 361.188, § 361.272, or both, the SWDA presents the same appellate\n\nremedy for both orders, and nothing from the statutory history or current text\n\nindicates that these orders are mutually exclusive. Even if the SWDA did intend to\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fsplit appellate remedies between different SWDA administrative orders, there is no\n\ndoubt the TCEQ issued the AO for the Voda Site under § 361.272, and therefore\n\n§ 361.322 is the appropriate appellate provision.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco does nothing to change\n\nthis analysis. The City of Waco holding is limited to a threshold determination of\n\nwhether a third-party seeking to intervene in a permitting case is an “affected\n\nperson” sufficient to trigger a contested-case hearing. That case has no application\n\nto an appeal by parties named responsible in a unilateral administrative order,\n\nparticularly when the relevant statute already provides an appropriate standard of\n\nreview.\n\n      After spending an enormous amount of time and money prosecuting this\n\ncase as both a § 361.188 and § 361.272 Order, the State is now erroneously\n\nemboldened by City of Waco to believe it can simply issue Superfund enforcement\n\norders demanding millions of dollars in response costs without an agency hearing\n\nor de novo review at the district court. Instead, the State suggests that pure\n\nsubstantial evidence review of its own record is sufficient. But City of Waco deals\n\nsolely with a permitting issue rather than the more onerous cost recovery\n\nenforcement. Moreover, the plain language of the SWDA unequivocally waives\n\nsovereign immunity to judicial review of the Order and provides for de novo\n\nreview based on a preponderance of the evidence. In this type of action, City of\n\n\n\n                                       - 10 -\n\fWaco does nothing to relieve the State of its ultimate burden to prove liability.\n\nPotentially responsible parties are entitled to their day in court, and the trial court\n\nhas the power to hear their claims under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n\n                       STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n      ExxonMobil and Shell believe the Court is without jurisdiction to hear this\n\nappeal. A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the trial court’s power to adjudicate\n\nthe subject matter of the controversy. Heckman v.

The trial court has the\n\npower to either uphold or set aside the Order and to award attorneys’ fees to the\n\nprevailing party. What the parties actually dispute is precisely what evidence the\n\ntrial court may consider in reviewing the Order. The State asserts the trial court is\n\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\flimited to the Commission’s administrative record, while ExxonMobil and Shell\n\nargue that the trial court can consider new evidence through a trial de novo. The\n\nState’s plea is not a challenge to the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction, but\n\ninstead a maneuver to set the procedures the trial court will use to enter an order\n\nthat it unquestionably has the power to enter.\n\n      Assuming this evidentiary question did implicate the court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction, the State cannot maintain a plea to the jurisdiction in this case because\n\nits own pleadings defeat its claim. In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, the court\n\nmust not weigh the claims’ merits but should look to the pleadings and determine\n\nif they allege facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court’s jurisdiction to hear\n\nthe case.

The State’s live pleadings\n\nindicate that “[t]he Texas Legislature has defined the sole method for appealing the\n\nOrder at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 361.322.” (CR:675-87: App. E.)\n\nExxonMobil and Shell agree, as their Amended Petition invokes § 361.322 and\n\nchallenges the TCEQ to prove—by a preponderance of the evidence—that\n\nAppellees are liable for the elimination of any release at the Voda Site. Therefore,\n\nthe court need not look past the parties’ own pleadings to determine that they have\n\nalleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate both that the Court has jurisdiction to\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fhear this case and that the appropriate standard of review and burden of proof can\n\nbe found in § 361.322 of the SWDA.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\nI.    Appellees’ Response to Appellant’s Issue One.\n\n      The Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (“SWDA” or “Act”) does not create\n\nmutually exclusive Superfund orders with separate waivers of sovereign immunity.\n\nAlthough the Act empowers the Commission to issue an administrative order\n\nbefore a remedial investigation/feasibility study has been conducted or at the\n\nconclusion of the state Superfund listing process, either type of administrative\n\norder is subject to the same appellate provisions.\n\n      A.     The TCEQ can issue administrative orders under § 361.188 and\n             § 361.272, and both share common attributes relevant to this\n             appeal.\n\n      The SWDA permits the Commission to issue an administrative order under\n\nSubchapter F regarding a site “that may constitute an imminent or substantial\n\nendangerment to public health and safety or the environment due to a release or\n\nthreatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.” Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.181 (West 2010). Pursuant to the Act, an Order issued\n\nunder § 361.188 comes at the conclusion of the listing process, which would\n\ninclude investigating the site proposed for listing and recommending a remedial\n\naction to cleanup any hazardous substances identified. Id. Such an order lists the\n\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fidentified site on the state registry and provides the necessary details regarding the\n\nproposed remedy for the hazardous substances found during the investigation. Id.\n\n      The Act also permits the Commission to issue an administrative order under\n\nSubchapter K “to a person responsible for solid waste if it appears that there is an\n\nactual or threatened release of solid waste that presents an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment.” Id. at\n\n§ 361.272. This administrative order need not necessarily come at the conclusion\n\nof the Commission’s investigation of a site believed to harbor hazardous\n\nsubstances. Instead, the order issued under § 361.272 must only identify a party\n\nallegedly responsible for “solid waste”—not hazardous substances—and order the\n\nparty “to take any action necessary to provide and implement a cost effective and\n\nenvironmentally sound remedial action plan designed to eliminate the release or\n\nthreatened release.” Id. at § 361.272(b)(2).\n\n      Although the power to issue administrative orders is found in two separate\n\nsections of the SWDA, the two provisions are not mutually exclusive. Nothing in\n\nthe statute forbids the Commission from issuing an administrative order listing a\n\nsite alleged to contain “hazardous substances” and to issue that same order to a\n\nperson responsible for “solid waste” that presents an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment. Moreover, both types of orders share elements outlined in\n\nSubchapters I, K, and L of the Act, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\f    The four-part definition of a “person responsible for solid waste.” Tex.\n     Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.271 (West 2010);\n\n    Statutory defenses to liability. Id. at § 361.275;\n\n    Apportionment of liability among potentially responsible parties. Id. at\n     § 361.276; and\n\n    An appellate provision. Id. at § 361.322.\n\n      Although the power to issue administrative orders can be found in two parts\n\nof the SWDA—and orders under each subsection can arise at different times in\n\nresponse to different threats to human health or the environment—the essential\n\nfeatures relevant to this appeal remain the same, and nothing within the SWDA\n\nmakes § 361.188 and § 361.272 orders mutually exclusive.\n\n      B.    The statutory history of the SWDA shows that administrative\n            orders have always been subject to the same appellate standards.\n\n            1.     The original SWDA established a permitting program to\n                   regulate solid waste.\n\n      The SWDA was enacted in 1969 to control “the collection, handling,\n\nstorage, and disposal” of solid waste. Act approved June 2, 1969, 61st Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 405, 1969 Tex. Gen. Laws 1320, 1320 (repealed 1989) recodified by Act\n\napproved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 678, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230 (App.\n\nF.) In its original form, the SWDA divided powers between two state agencies—\n\nthe Texas State Department of Health was tasked with regulating municipal solid\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\fwaste while the Texas Water Quality Board was assigned industrial solid waste. Id.\n\nat 1321 (App. F.) The original statute gave broad power to these agencies to:\n\n         “require and issue permits authorizing and governing the\n          operation and maintenance of sites used for the disposal of solid\n          waste,” including the power to “revoke or amend any permit\n          issues.” Id. at 1322. (App. F.); and\n\n         “establish minimum standards of operation for all aspects of\n          the management and control” of solid waste, including the\n          “collection, handling, storage, and disposal by incineration,\n          sanitary landfill, composting, or other method.” Id. at 1323. (App.\n          F.)\n\n      To effectuate enforcement, the Act imposed civil penalties for entities that\n\nengaged in the “collection, storage, handling, or disposal of solid waste, or the use\n\nor operation of a site for the disposal of solid waste, in violation of the Act.” Id. at\n\n1326-27. (App. F.) Any “person affected by any ruling, order, decision, or other act\n\nof the department or the board” enjoyed the right to “appeal by filing a petition in\n\nthe district court of Travis County.” Id. at 1328. (App. F.) The original SWDA\n\ncontained no definition for the term “person affected,” opening the door for a\n\nbroad judicial interpretation of standing to appeal permitting decisions. However,\n\nthe Legislature addressed this shortcoming in the following session, adding a\n\ndefinition for “person affected” as:\n\n      “any person who is a resident of a county in which a site, facility, or\n      plant is to be located including any person who is doing business or\n      owns land in the county or adjacent or contiguous county and any\n      local government. Such person affected shall also demonstrate that he\n      has suffered or will suffer actual injury economic damage.”\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\fAct approved June 15, 1973, 63rd Leg., R.S., ch. 576, 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1595\n\n(current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.003(24) (West 2010))\n\n(App. G.)\n\n      Missing from the original statute was the power to issue administrative\n\norders like the Order at issue in this case. As enacted, the SWDA did not empower\n\nthe state to clean up sites contaminated with solid waste or hazardous substances\n\nand to order persons the state believed responsible for solid waste to execute and/or\n\nfund such a cleanup. Instead, the statute regulated solid waste through the\n\npermitting program. Although a person affected by a permitting decision could\n\nseek judicial review under 8(g), this clause was not applicable to an administrative\n\norder to clean up a contaminated site simply because the SWDA did not grant the\n\npower to issue any such order under the terms of the original act.\n\n             2.    Following the Congressional passage of CERCLA, the\n                   Texas legislature amended the SWDA to create a Texas\n                   state Superfund program.\n\n      The United States Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) in 1980, giving the\n\nfederal government the power to identify parties responsible for the release of\n\nhazardous substances and compel those parties to clean up the sites via\n\nadministrative orders or civil actions. 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 9601–9628. CERCLA also\n\npermitted the government to clean up contaminated sites using the Superfund—a\n\n\n\n                                       - 17 -\n\ftrust fund—and then recover costs from responsible parties through civil litigation.\n\nId. CERCLA was triggered by the presence of abandoned hazardous waste dump\n\nsites like the infamous Love Canal site in New York. A critical feature of\n\nCERCLA was the creation of a broad liability scheme under which parties who\n\narranged for disposal of waste (i.e, a dump site’s customers) and transporters of the\n\nwaste could be found jointly and severally liable for all remediation costs. No\n\nlonger was liability limited to the site’s permit holder or operator.

Act\n\napproved June 12, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 566, 1985 Tex. Gen. Laws 2166\n\n(repealed 1989) recodified by Act approved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch.\n\n678, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230 (App. H.). Like CERCLA, the new provisions of\n\nthe SWDA created a broad liability scheme under which those who arrange for\n\ndisposal of waste or transport of waste can be held liable for remediation costs at\n\nsites they do not own or operate. See, e.g., R.R. Street & Co. v. Pilgrim Enters.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894680\"><a href=\"/opinion/894680/rr-street-co-v-pilgrim-enterprises/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238 (Tex. 2005) (“SWDA, like CERCLA, provides mechanisms\n\nfor the clean-up of solid waste and for both governmental entities and private\n\nparties to recover clean-up costs from those responsible for the waste.”). However,\n\ninstead of having the new liability scheme stand separately from the existing solid\n\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\fwaste permitting statute as Congress had done, the Texas Legislature embedded\n\nthese new provisions into the SWDA.\n\n         The 1985 amendments expanded the SWDA beyond permitting and\n\nempowered the state to issue administrative orders to persons responsible for solid\n\nwaste,\n\n         “restraining such person or persons from allowing or continuing the\n         threatened release and requiring those persons to take actions\n         necessary to provide and implement a cost effective and\n         environmentally sound remedial action plan to designed to eliminate\n         the release or threatened release.”\n\nAct approved June 12, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 566, 1985 Tex. Gen. Laws 2166,\n\n2176 (repealed 1989) recodified by Act approved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 678, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230 (App. H.)\n\n         The 1985 amendments further empowered the state to survey and list “every\n\nhazardous waste facility which may constitute an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment to public health and safety or the environment” and provided\n\nguidelines for the “cleanup of a facility identified.” Id. at 2178, 2180 (App. H.)\n\nWithin those guidelines, the state was empowered as follows:\n\n         “whenever the department of water resources finds that there exists an\n         actual or threatened release of hazardous wastes at a hazardous facility\n         listed on the registry that presents an imminent and substantial\n         endangerment to the public health and safety of the environment, it\n         may order the owner and/or operator of such facility and/or any other\n         person responsible for the release or threatened release at such facility\n         (A) to develop a remedial action program, subject to the approval of\n         the department of water resources, at such facility; and (B) to\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\f      implement such program within reasonable time limits specified in the\n      order.”\n\nId. at 2180 (App. H.) To ensure the same basic elements for all administrative\n\norders issued under the new amendments, the statute made clear that “[t]he\n\nprovisions in Sections 8(g), 9, 10, and 11 of this Act relating to administrative\n\norders shall apply to orders issued pursuant to this paragraph.” Id. (App. H.)\n\n      The 1985 amendments also added a new appellate provision to the SWDA to\n\nexclusively cover administrative orders issued pursuant to the new Superfund\n\nprogram. While leaving the earlier appellate provision for the permitting program\n\nunchanged, the new Section 9 placed the burden of proof on appeal of an\n\nadministrative order squarely on the state, providing that:\n\n      “The district court shall uphold an administrative order issued\n      pursuant to Section 8(g) if the department or the department of water\n      resources, by a preponderance of the evidence, proves: (1) that there is\n      an actual or threatened release of solid waste that is an imminent and\n      substantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the\n      environment; and (2) that the person made subject to the\n      administrative order is liable for the elimination of the release or\n      threatened release, in whole or in part.”\n\nId. at 2177 (App. H.)\n\n      In short, the 1985 amendments established the modern state Superfund\n\nprogram, empowering the state to issue administrative orders and seek to recover\n\nits costs under a handful of different circumstances, but made both types of orders\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 20 -\n\fsubject to certain procedural baselines, found in sections 8(g), 9, 10, and 11 of the\n\nrevised statute, including:\n\n    A standard definition for persons responsible for solid waste. Id. at 2176\n     (App. H.);\n\n    Allowing persons responsible for solid waste to prove a statutory defense by\n     a preponderance of the evidence. Id. (App. H.);\n\n    Allowing persons responsible for solid waste to prove that the release is\n     divisible, therefore avoiding the consequences of joint and several liability.\n     Id. at 2176-77 (App. H.); and\n\n    Granting the right to appeal an administrative order and placing the burden\n     on the state based on a preponderance of the evidence for the appeal. Id. at\n     2177 (App. H.)\n\n      Nothing in the 1985 amendments gave the State the power to issue\n\nadministrative orders under the new Superfund program without these provisions.\n\n      Subsequent amendments to the SWDA further clarified both the burden of\n\nproof for an appeal of an administrative order and the class of persons who could\n\nfile such an appeal. The Legislature narrowed the standing for appeal of an\n\nadministrative order in 1989 to “any person subject to an administrative order\n\nunder 8(g),” replacing earlier language that effectively allowed any person to file a\n\npetition appealing an administrative order issued under that provision. Act\n\napproved June 14, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 703, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 3212, 3217\n\n(current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322 (West 2010)) (App.\n\nI.) The same bill clarified the standard of review for challenging the remedy\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fselection, adding a subsection “(h) If the appropriateness of the selected remedial\n\naction is contested in the appeal of the administrative order, the remedial action\n\nshall be upheld unless the court determines that the remedy is arbitrary or\n\nunreasonable.” Id. at 3217 (App. I.) The bill also revised subsection (e), clarifying\n\nthat an appeal “does not prevent the state agency issuing the administrative order\n\nfrom proceeding with the remedial action program under Subchapter F unless the\n\ncourt enjoins the remedial action under its general equity jurisdiction.” Id. (App. I.)\n\n             3.     The codified SWDA makes all administrative orders subject\n                    to these same provisions.\n\n      Following codification, the SWDA retained the same procedural framework\n\noutlined above. The procedure to list a site on the state Superfund list was\n\nreorganized under “Subchapter F: Registry and Cleanup of Certain Hazardous\n\nWaste Facilities.” The procedural building blocks of an administrative order\n\ndiscussed above were reorganized into “Subchapter I: Enforcement, Administrative\n\nOrders Concerning Imminent and Substantial Endangerment.” The appellate\n\nprovision was reorganized under “Subchapter K. Appeals; Joinder of Parties.” The\n\nCommission retained the power to issue an administrative order either before or\n\nafter the listing process, but all administrative orders retained these elements.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\f      C.     The current statute does not create mutually exclusive orders with\n             separate waivers of sovereign immunity.\n\n      The State’s brief traces largely the same statutory history, but erroneously\n\nconcludes that the Legislature intended to create “two types of Superfund order”\n\nthat the State argues are “separate and distinct.” (Appellant’s Brief at 9.) The State\n\nargues that the two types of orders are mutually exclusive for three reasons:\n\n(1) they are contained in different sections; (2) they are expressed in different\n\nlanguage; and (3) they are subject to different appellate provisions that present an\n\nirreconcilable conflict. Id. But as discussed below, none of these factors support\n\nthe conclusion that the Legislature intended to create mutually exclusive Superfund\n\norders with separate appellate provisions, and the statutory history combined with\n\nthe current structure of the Act lead to precisely the opposite conclusion.\n\n             1.    Appearing in different sections using different language\n                   does not make the orders mutually exclusive.\n\n      Although the Act empowers the TCEQ to issue orders in more than one part\n\nof the statute, the text is clear that parties named in both § 361.188 and § 361.272\n\norders are subject to certain procedural protections which the TCEQ cannot\n\nrevoke. This was true when the 1985 amendments creating the Superfund program\n\nwere passed and remains true through the modern codification of the statute.\n\nPursuant to § 361.188(b), “the provisions in Subchapters I, K, and L relating to\n\nadministrative orders apply to orders issued under this section.” Tex. Health &\n\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fSafety Code Ann. § 361.188(b) (West 2010). This is the same cross-reference that\n\nwas in the statute when it was enacted in 1985. This incorporation of Subchapters\n\nI, K, and L into “orders issued under this section” is not limited to what the State\n\nself-servingly identifies as “relevant provisions.” (Appellant’s Brief at 16.) Instead\n\nit is open ended and inclusive, and demonstrates that the Legislature intended all\n\n“administrative orders” of the SWDA to share common procedural attributes,\n\nincluding the same appellate provisions. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 361.188(b) (West 2010).\n\n      The structural link between orders issued under § 361.188 and § 361.272 is\n\nnot limited to this provision. Just as section § 361.188 of Subchapter F directly\n\nincorporates Subchapters I, K, and L, a similar link between the two types of\n\norders is found within Subchapter K at § 361.322. That appellate provision—\n\nlimited to administrative orders issued under the Superfund program—states that\n\n“[t]he filing of the petition does not prevent the commission from proceeding with\n\nthe remedial action program under Subchapter F unless the court enjoins the\n\nremedial action under its general equity jurisdiction.” Tex. Health & Safety Code\n\nAnn. § 361.322(e) (West 2010). Therefore, if the Commission issues an\n\nadministrative order before it has commenced with the remedial action program\n\nunder § 361.272, that cleanup program can continue just as it would have if the\n\norder was issued under § 361.188 during the pendency of the appeal.\n\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\f      Although they appear in different sections of the Act and are expressed in\n\ndifferent language, § 361.188 and § 361.272 do not create mutually exclusive\n\norders. Instead, regardless of whether a Superfund order comes at the conclusion of\n\nthe listing and remedy selection process through § 361.188 or instead prior to the\n\nremedial action program through § 361.272, the SWDA guarantees certain\n\nprotections to persons the state believes are responsible for solid waste.\n\n             2.     The SWDA appellate provisions distinguish between\n                    appeals of Superfund orders and appeals of permitting\n                    decisions, not separate kinds of Superfund orders.\n\n      The State contends that because there are two separate appellate provisions\n\ncontained within the SWDA, the Legislature must have intended that a different\n\nappellate provision would apply to each type of Superfund order, and thus the\n\norders are mutually exclusive. However, the State’s argument misunderstands the\n\nstructure of the SWDA and the role both provisions play in the context of the entire\n\nAct. The two appellate provisions are principally aimed at different types of orders\n\nor actions of the Commission. Therefore, they grant appellate remedies to different\n\ncategories of parties, establish different timetables to perfect an appeal, and feature\n\ndifferent burdens of proof and standards of review.\n\n      Section 361.321 of Subchapter K tracks the language of the 1969 Act and\n\nstates that “a person affected by a ruling, order, decision, or other act of the\n\ncommission may appeal the action by filing a petition in a district court of Travis\n\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fCounty.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.321(a) (West 2010). The appeal\n\nmust be perfected within 30 days of the date that the offending act of the\n\nCommission occurs. Id. at § 361.321(b). The provision grants an appellate remedy\n\nnot limited to formal commission orders, but to virtually any action by the\n\nCommission. An appellant under § 361.321 is not a named party subject to an\n\nadministrative order, but instead is “a person affected” by the actions of the\n\nCommission. Id. at § 361.321(b). The SWDA defines a “person affected” as one\n\nwho “has suffered or will suffer actual injury or economic damage and, if the\n\nperson is not a local government: (A) is a resident of a county, or a county adjacent\n\nor contiguous to the county, in which a solid waste facility is to be located; or\n\n(B) is doing business or owns land in the county or adjacent or contiguous county.”\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.003(24) (West 2010).\n\n      The modern § 361.321 does not state that it is limited to—or even applicable\n\nto—administrative orders for Superfund cases. Id. at § 361.321(b). This is entirely\n\nconsistent with its statutory history, as the provision was adopted with the original\n\nversion of the SWDA in 1969, which did not empower the state to identify parties\n\nresponsible for the release of solid waste and to compel those parties to clean up\n\nwaste sites. As discussed above, the codified SWDA retains a solid waste\n\npermitting program distinct from the Superfund program that allows the\n\nCommission to issue permits for the construction, operation, and maintenance of\n\n\n\n                                       - 26 -\n\fsolid waste disposal facilities. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.061\n\n(West 2010). Hence, § 361.321 is directed at parties aggrieved by this permitting\n\nprocess who can show that they meet the economic injury test under the statute—it\n\nis not directed at parties named liable in Superfund orders. Both its statutory\n\nhistory and its current role in the SWDA demonstrate clear legislative intent that\n\n§ 361.321 is the appellate provision for the permitting program, not the Superfund\n\nprogram. See, e.g., Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. Sierra Club, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1591426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1591426/texas-natural-res-conserv-v-sierra-club/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (Tex. 2002) (appeal of solid waste permitting decision under\n\n§ 361.321 following contested-case hearing at the agency); TJFA, L.P. v.

(mem. op.) (same).\n\n      In contrast, § 361.322 applies to “an administrative order issued under\n\n361.272” of the SWDA. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322(a) (West\n\n2010). Instead of 30 days under § 361.321(b), the appeal must be perfected within\n\n45 days of receipt of the order. Id. The section does not authorize appeals of solid\n\nwaste permits or other Commission actions, but is limited to administrative orders\n\nissued under the Superfund program. Id.; see also Sierra Club, 70 S.W.3d at 812\n\n(noting that § 361.322 was “not applicable” to appeal of permit decision). Instead\n\nof restricting appeals to a “person affected” by a Commission action as defined in\n\nthe statute, § 361.322 is limited to a person “subject to” the administrative order on\n\n\n\n                                        - 27 -\n\fappeal. Id. This too is consistent with the statutory history of the SWDA, as the\n\nLegislature created both the power to issue administrative Superfund orders and\n\nthe right to appeal those orders within the 1985 amendments, granting the same\n\nappellate remedy for all Superfund orders. The State has never enjoyed the power\n\nto issue these administrative orders without the appellate provisions of the modern\n\n§ 361.322.\n\n             3.    Forcing all appeals of Superfund orders into § 361.321\n                   creates an absurd result.\n\n      Ignoring the plain language of § 361.188(b)—which incorporates “all\n\nprovisions relating to administrative orders” into § 361.188 orders—the State\n\nsuggests that “[t]he proper reading of this section is that the relevant provisions of\n\nthe other subchapters apply to Section 361.188 orders, to the extent they do not\n\ncreate contradictions or absurd results.” (Appellant’s Brief at 16.) Yet at the same\n\ntime, the State asks the Court to force Superfund appeals into an appellate\n\nprovision explicitly limited to entities surrounding the geographic area in which “a\n\nsolid waste facility is to be located.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 361.003(24) (West 2010). But the statutory history of both appellate provisions\n\nshows that the Legislature never intended to force appeals of Superfund orders into\n\nthe preexisting regime for permitting decisions. The separate appellate provisions\n\nof Subchapter K were adopted alongside their respective programs—the permitting\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fprogram and the Superfund program—to provide appellate remedies to parties\n\naggrieved by either type of agency action.\n\n      Taking the State’s argument to its logical conclusion, a party’s standing to\n\nappeal a Superfund order under the SWDA would not depend on whether or not\n\nthe entity was named in the administrative order per § 361.322, but instead would\n\nturn on the entity’s geographic nexus to the site at issue pursuant to § 361.321.\n\nAssuming the site in question even qualified as a “solid waste facility” under the\n\nAct, parties who owned land or did business within the defined geographic zone\n\nwould have a right to appeal, while parties missing this geographic link would\n\nhave no clear appellate remedy. At the same time, the Commission is free to\n\nidentify and name in an administrative order persons it believes responsible for\n\nsolid waste without regard to their geography, and order them to remediate the site\n\nor pay the State’s response costs. No such concept exists in the CERLCA\n\njurisprudence, and the Legislature never intended to create such an anomalous\n\nappellate scheme for the Texas program.\n\nII.   Appellees’ Response to Appellant’s Issue Two.\n\n      The Administrative Order for the Voda Site was issued under both § 361.188\n\nand § 361.272 of the SWDA. The AO is directed at both solid wastes and\n\nhazardous substances, and plainly invokes the TCEQ’s powers under § 361.188\n\nand § 361.272. Immediately before and after the AO was issued, the Commission\n\n\n\n                                       - 29 -\n\funambiguously declared that it issued the Order pursuant to both sections of the\n\nAct, and the TCEQ has unequivocally pled the same procedural facts throughout\n\nthis litigation. In fact, the Commission’s live pleadings state that the Order was\n\nissued under both § 361.188 and § 361.272 and that the sole method for appealing\n\nthe Order resides at § 361.322. Therefore, even if the State were correct that\n\n§ 361.188 and § 361.272 orders are subject to different appellate provisions, the\n\nAO for the Voda Site was issued under § 361.272, making application of § 361.322\n\nappropriate for this Order.\n\n      A.     The language of the AO demonstrates the Order was issued under\n             § 361.188 and § 361.272.\n\n      The language used by the TCEQ in the AO demonstrates the Commission’s\n\nintent and action to issue the Order under both § 361.188 and § 361.272. The very\n\nfirst paragraph of the AO invokes the Commission’s power to issue the Order “as\n\nauthorized by Sections 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act.” (CR:29; App. A.) In\n\ndetailing the Chemicals of Concern at the Voda Site, the AO specifically invokes\n\n“Sections 361.271 through 361.277 and 361.343 through 361.345” of the SWDA.\n\n(CR:48; App. A.) The Order also names ExxonMobil and Shell as “responsible\n\nparties (‘RPs’) pursuant to Section 361.271 of the Act” (CR:29; App. A.) and\n\nannounces the TCEQ’s conclusion that the “release or threatened release… has not\n\nbeen proven to be divisible pursuant to Section 361.276 of the Act.” (CR:50; App.\n\nA.) In the event there are disagreements between the Agreeing Respondents and\n\n\n                                      - 30 -\n\fthe Executive Director, the AO states such disagreements will be handled pursuant\n\nto “Sections 361.321 and/or Sections 361.322 of the Act.” (CR:86; App. A.) And\n\nthe AO orders Respondents to preserve records “relating to each Respondent’s\n\npotential liability or to any other person’s potential liability for the Site under\n\nSection 361.271 of the Act.” (CR:78; App. A.) All of these provisions flatly\n\ncontradict the State’s position that the AO was issued solely under § 361.188.\n\n      The dual nature of the AO is even more apparent when looking at the\n\nmaterials the Commission alleges are present at the Voda Site. Subchapter F of the\n\nSWDA authorizes the TCEQ to identify and list sites where the release of\n\n“hazardous substances” has allegedly endangered public health. Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.181(a) (West 2010). The term “solid waste” does not\n\nappear within §§ 361.181-361.188 of the SWDA, which instead is focused\n\nexclusively on the listing, cleanup, and remediation of sites containing “hazardous\n\nsubstances.” Id. In contrast, Subchapter K authorizes the Commission to issue an\n\norder to a person responsible for “solid waste” if a release of “solid\n\nwaste…presents an imminent and substantial endangerment.” Id. at § 361.272.\n\nThis provision makes no mention of hazardous substances.\n\n      The AO for the Voda Site is not limited to “hazardous substances” as would\n\nbe expected for an order limited solely to § 361.188, but instead declares parties\n\nresponsible for “the solid waste and/or hazardous substances at the Site.” (CR:29;\n\n\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fApp. A.) The AO declares that certain substances “which are found at the Site, are\n\nsolid wastes as defined in Section 361.003(34) of the Act” and further alleges that\n\nthe PRPs are responsible for “solid wastes [that] were stored, processed, disposed\n\nof, or discarded at the Site.” (CR:50; App. A.)\n\n      B.     Counsel for the Executive Director asked the Commissioners to\n             issue the Order under both § 361.188 and § 361.272.\n\n      The State argues that “the TCEQ intended to issue a Section 361.188 order.”\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 23.) Yet the words of the counsel for the Executive Director\n\nof the TCEQ—immediately before, during, and immediately after the AO was\n\nissued—demonstrate the Commission’s intent to issue the AO pursuant to both\n\n§ 361.188 and § 361.272, and a clear understanding that the TCEQ had done just\n\nthat. The Commission’s agenda item for the Voda Site was docketed as\n\n“Consideration of a Final Administrative Order (Final Order) pursuant to Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code Sections 361.188 and 361.272 for the Voda Petroleum,\n\nInc. State Superfund Site….” (AR 51127: App. J (emphasis added).) When counsel\n\nfor the Executive Director presented the administrative order to the Commission,\n\nshe asked the Commissioners to issue the order “pursuant to Chapter 361, sections\n\n188 and 272 of the Health and Safety Code.” (AR 50382 (emphasis added).) And\n\nwhen the TCEQ opposed Luminant’s rehearing request, it argued that “[b]ecause\n\nthe Order was issued under Sections 361.272 and 361.188 (Administrative Order\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 32 -\n\f1), it did not require an adjudicative hearing before the Commission.” (AR 49650;\n\nApp. B (emphasis added).)\n\n      C.     Understanding that the AO invokes both § 361.188 and § 361.272,\n             the State described the Order as having been issued under both\n             sections for years.\n\n      Since this case was filed in 2010, the State has understood the true nature of\n\nthe Order by repeatedly and unequivocally pleading that the AO was issued under\n\nboth § 361.188 and § 361.272 of the SWDA. These statements appeared in the\n\nTCEQ’s Original Counter-Petition and Third-Party Petition, Response to Plea in\n\nAbatement, Motions for Entry of Default, and their Motions for Entry of Agreed\n\nFinal Judgment. (CR:127-69; Tab D.) Following denial of the TCEQ’s Motion for\n\nLeave to Amend, they remain the Commission’s live pleading in the case. The\n\nState’s claim that the Commission intended to issue a purely § 361.188 Order is\n\nflatly contradicted multiple times by the text of the Order and by the Commission’s\n\nown justification for its actions.\n\n             1.     The TCEQ repeatedly and unequivocally described the AO\n                    as being issued under § 361.188 and § 361.272.\n\n      In its Original Counter-Petition and Third-Party Petition, the State pled that:\n\n“On February 12, 2010, the TCEQ issued an administrative order (“the Order”)\n\nunder §§ 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….” (CR:158; App. D.) The State further\n\npled that ExxonMobil and Shell “were ‘liable for the elimination of the release or\n\nthreatened release, in whole or in part,’ within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\n\n                                       - 33 -\n\fSAFETY CODE § 361.322(g)” and that “the Order should be upheld pursuant to\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.321 and 361.322(g).” (CR:164; App.\n\nD.)\n\n         The State unequivocally repeated the same description of the AO—as an\n\norder issued under § 361.188 and § 361.272—in myriad other filings at the trial\n\ncourt:\n\n            On October 20, 2011 Third-Party Defendant Howard Frelich filed a\n             Plea in Abatement along with his Original Answer. In its Response to\n             this Plea in Abatement, the TCEQ stated that “The Order was issued\n             pursuant to two sections of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act:\n             Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 361.188 & 361.277 (sic).” As proof\n             that the AO relied on both sections, the State cited to the very first\n             paragraph of the AO—“Order sec. I at 1.” (Supp. CR at ___\n             [TCEQ’s Response to Plea in Abatement by Third-Party Defendant\n             Howard Freilich and Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 9-10\n             (filed November 14, 2011) (emphasis added) (attachments omitted)].\n\n            On July 30, 2012, the State moved for entry of an agreed final\n             judgment between the TCEQ and a group of approximately 154\n             potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”). In the agreed final judgment,\n             the State pled that “the TCEQ issued the Order under Sections\n             361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….” (Supp. CR at ___ [Agreed Final\n             Judgment, Cause No. D-1-GN-12-002297, Young Chevrolet, Inc., et\n             al. v.

(filed July\n             30, 2012) (emphasis added) (attachments omitted)].\n\n            On May 3, 2013, the State moved for entry of another agreed final\n             judgment between the TCEQ and a single PRP, Ark-La-Tex Waste\n             Oil Company, Inc. Once again, the State pled that “the TCEQ issued\n             the Order under Sections 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act….” (Supp.\n             CR at ___ [Agreed Final Judgment, Cause No. D-1-GN-13-003373,\n             Young Chevrolet, Inc., et al. v.

(filed September 26, 2013) (emphasis added) (attachments\n            omitted)].\n\n          On February 4, 2014, the State moved for entry of default against\n           PRPs Billy D. Cox Truck Leasing, Inc. and SBC Holdings, Inc. f/k/a/\n           the Stroh Brewery Company. In ¶ 3 of those motions, the State noted\n           that “The TCEQ issued a Superfund Order on February 12, 2010,\n           (“the Order”) under Tex. Health and Safety Code §§ 361.188 and\n           361.272….” (Supp. CR at ___ [Motion for Partial Default Judgment\n           Against Billy D. Cox Truck Leasing, Inc. at ¶ 3 (filed February 4,\n           2014) (emphasis added); Motion for Partial Default Judgment Against\n           SBC Holdings, Inc., f/k/a The Stroh Brewery Company at ¶ 3 (filed\n           February 3, 2014) (emphasis added).].\n\n      Though the State has filed a handful of supplements to its pleadings at the\n\ntrial court, the Commission’s live pleadings directly contradict their core\n\narguments on appeal. The State’s Third Amended Answer acknowledged that\n\n“[t]he Texas Legislature has defined the sole method for appealing the Order at\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code § 361.322.” (CR:678; App. E (emphasis added).) The\n\nTCEQ concluded this Answer by pleading that “the standard of review in the\n\nappeal of this Order is…whether: (a) TCEQ can prove, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, the two factors listed in § 361.322(g)(1) and (2); (b) Plaintiffs can show\n\nthat the selection of the remedy by TCEQ was arbitrary or unreasonable; or\n\n(c) Plaintiffs can show that the Order as a whole is ‘frivolous, unreasonable, or\n\nwithout foundation with respect to a party named by the order.’ Id. at § 361.342.”\n\n(CR:683; App. E (emphasis added).)\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 35 -\n\f             2.    The State disclosed that it issued the AO under both\n                   sections to obtain advantages of a § 361.272 order.\n\n      The State’s discovery disclosures make clear why the Commission chose to\n\nissue the AO under § 361.272 as well § 361.188. Pursuant to § 361.274, “[a]n\n\nadministrative order under Section 361.272 does not require prior notice or an\n\nadjudicative hearing before the commission.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 361.274 (West 2010). In stating why ExxonMobil and Shell were not entitled to\n\nan agency hearing prior to issuing the AO, the State disclosed that “a party does\n\nnot have a right to an adjudicative hearing prior to a § 361.272 Order, pursuant to\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code § 361.274.” (Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on\n\nEnvironmental Quality’s Response to Request for Disclosure at 3-4 (served\n\nSeptember 6, 2012) (attachments omitted)].\n\n      Moreover, the State has steadfastly argued that ExxonMobil and Shell, as the\n\nwell as other PRPs, are jointly and severally liable for contamination at the Voda\n\nSite. The statutory basis for joint and several liability under the SWDA is found in\n\n§ 361.276, which states that “[i]f the release or threatened release is not proved to\n\nbe divisible, persons liable under Section § 361.272 or § 361.273 are jointly and\n\nseverally liable for eliminating the release or threatened release.” Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.276 (West 2010) (emphasis added). Nothing in\n\nSubchapter F for a § 361.188 order establishes joint and several liability for\n\nresponsible parties, and § 361.276 does not state that persons declared by TCEQ to\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\fbe a responsible party under a § 361.188 order are jointly and severally liable. At\n\nthe trial court, the State disclosed that: “[t]he TCEQ is not required to prove\n\nallocation of liability, because the responsible parties are jointly and severally\n\nliable unless they can prove ‘divisibility’ by a preponderance of the evidence.”\n\n(Supp. CR at ___ [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Response to\n\nRequest for Disclosure at 3-4 (served September 6, 2012) (attachments omitted)].\n\nIn other words, the Commission invoked § 361.272 in an attempt to hold the PRPs\n\nfor the Voda Site jointly and severally liable under the SWDA.\n\n      D.    Following the listing procedures of Subchapter F does not insulate\n            the AO from review under Subchapter K.\n\n      Despite explicitly referencing numerous provisions of Subchapter K\n\nthroughout the AO, the State argues that the AO arose exclusively under § 361.188\n\nbecause the agency followed the listing requirements of Subchapter F of the\n\nSWDA. Therefore, the State argues, the AO can only be reviewable under the pure\n\nsubstantial evidence rule. But as discussed above, the issuance of an order under\n\n§ 361.272 does not preclude the Commission from the listing process of § 361.181-\n\n188. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322(e) (West 2010). Thus, § 361.322\n\nauthorizes the Commission to proceed with investigation and remedy selection\n\nduring the appeal of the administrative order under § 361.322, and nothing in\n\n§ 361.322 indicates that once the TCEQ proceeds with the remedial action program\n\nof Subchapter F, the appellate remedies of § 361.322 are mooted.\n\n\n                                      - 37 -\n\f      E.     Reviewing an administrative order under § 361.322 does not make\n             Subchapter F redundant.\n\n      The State suggests that if an administrative order issued under § 361.188\n\nwere subject to review based on a preponderance of the evidence, it would make\n\nthe listing procedures of Subchapter F effectively redundant. This suggestion\n\nmisapprehends what occurs prior to issuance of an administrative order compared\n\nto what occurs at the district court upon judicial review.\n\n      The TCEQ purposefully invoked § 361.272 and § 361.274 such that\n\nExxonMobil and Shell were not afforded a contested-case hearing prior to issuance\n\nof the AO for the Voda Site. The Commission did not prove—by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence to a neutral third party—that ExxonMobil and Shell were persons\n\nresponsible for solid waste at the Voda Site. Had ExxonMobil and Shell been\n\ngranted an adjudicative hearing, some procedures would be duplicated through\n\njudicial review. However, the AO was issued without any such hearing, and the\n\ndistrict court will present the first opportunity for ExxonMobil and Shell to\n\nchallenge the AO and the first time the Commission will be required to carry its\n\nstatutory burden to prove ExxonMobil and Shell are responsible for solid waste.\n\n      The State further suggests that the extensive procedure to list a site on the\n\nSuperfund registry should entitle the Commission to substantial evidence deference\n\nbecause the agency spent significant time and effort investigating the Site and\n\nchoosing an appropriate remedy. Yet from the perspective of a party subject to an\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fadministrative order, virtually none of the Commission’s purported expertise is\n\nbrought to bear on issues most relevant to the responsible party—namely, whether\n\nthey are in fact a person responsible for solid waste or hazardous substances. In\n\npractice, the agency’s identification of persons responsible for solid waste consists\n\nof little more than collecting invoices or manifests, many of which are decades old,\n\nand making a list of every entity mentioned in the paperwork. The SWDA does not\n\nmandate any standard for how this identification must take place nor what\n\nevidentiary threshold must be crossed before a party is named in an order.\n\n      Although the Commission can issue administrative orders without\n\nadjudicatory hearings, the potentially responsible party’s opportunity to establish\n\nits innocence is delayed—not abrogated—by the SWDA. The appellate structure of\n\nthe SWDA allows those parties to challenge their status as PRPs and places the\n\nburden on the Commission to ultimately prove them responsible at the district\n\ncourt. When liability for such Sites routinely reaches into the millions of dollars,\n\nthe Legislature never intended the Commission’s unilateral order to be the final\n\nword on liability.\n\n      In contrast, the Commission does expend technical resources in developing a\n\nremedy it believes suitable for a proposed site. This can occur either before the\n\nissuance of the administrative order under § 361.188 or after the issuance of the\n\nadministrative order under § 361.272. In either event, the SWDA makes review of\n\n\n\n                                       - 39 -\n\fthat remedy selection subject to greater deference than whether a party is\n\nresponsible for solid waste or whether the waste is divisible pursuant to the Act.\n\nWhen a person subject to the order challenges the selected remedy, the\n\nCommission is not required to prove it chose the best remedy by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, but instead the selected remedy is upheld “unless the court\n\ndetermines that the remedy is arbitrary or unreasonable.” Tex. Health & Safety\n\nCode Ann. § 361.322(h) (West 2010). In short, the Commission already receives\n\ngreater deference for issues where technical expertise was brought to bear, but the\n\nCommission is not entitled to greater deference when simply naming parties it\n\nbelieves responsible for the release of solid waste or hazardous substances.\n\n      F.     If the Commission is correct that it exceeded its powers under the\n             SWDA then the AO must be set aside.\n\n      If the State is correct that “[a] single order cannot arise under both Sections\n\n361.188 and 361.272” (Appellant’s Brief at 18.) the proper course of action is not\n\nto grant the plea to the jurisdiction but to overturn the Order as a violation of law.\n\nAdministrative agencies “may exercise only those powers the law, in clear and\n\nexpress statutory language, confers upon them.” Subaru of Am., Inc. v.

Now, the State argues that the Commission has no\n\nsuch power under the statute. If this Court agrees that the Commission is without\n\npower to issue the AO under both § 361.188 and § 361.272, then the Court should\n\nset aside the Order as exceeding the Commission’s power under the statute.\n\nIII.   Appellees’ Response to Appellant’s Issue Three.\n\n       Review of the AO pursuant to § 361.322 of the SWDA is proper under the\n\nAct and the Texas Constitution. The SWDA contains the applicable standard of\n\nreview, placing the burden on the Commission to prove, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that ExxonMobil and Shell are responsible for solid waste. The pure\n\nsubstantial evidence review procedures found in the APA are not applicable to this\n\nappeal, and the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco regarding certain\n\nthreshold questions of standing for affected persons under the Texas Water Code is\n\nnot relevant to this Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 41 -\n\f      A.     Texas courts are not constitutionally limited to review of\n             administrative orders only as to matters of law.\n\n      The State argues that courts are empowered to review administrative orders\n\nonly “as to matters of law” and that to do otherwise would offend the separation of\n\npowers doctrine of the Texas Constitution. (Appellant’s Brief at 35.) Yet the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine only prohibits the Legislature from authorizing de\n\nnovo judicial review of quasi-legislative acts that address broad questions of public\n\npolicy or promulgate rules for future application. The AO is not a quasi-legislative\n\nact, and thus judicial review under § 361.322 does not violate the separation of\n\npowers doctrine.\n\n      The Texas Constitution divides the state’s government into three coequal\n\nbranches, and forbids any branch from exercising a power properly vested in a\n\ncoordinate branch.

The insurance code provided that “such causes of action ‘shall be tried and\n\ndetermined upon a trial de novo’ and, moreover, ‘the substantial evidence rule shall\n\nnot apply.’” Id. at 553-54. The Insurance Board argued that the statute violated the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine and the Insurance Board’s decision was subject only\n\nto substantial evidence review. Id. at 555. The trial court in Commercial Life\n\naccepted the Insurance Board’s argument, refusing to hold a trial de novo as\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 43 -\n\frequired by the statute, and, based on the record, sustained the Insurance Board’s\n\norder on the ground that it was supported by substantial evidence. Id. at 554.\n\n         This Court reversed. This Court first identified the proper test for\n\nconstitutionality as “whether the reviewing court is required to exercise a function\n\nthat is deemed nonjudicial.” Id. at 556. Explaining this dichotomy, the Court\n\nwrote:\n\n         An inquiry by a court is nonjudicial and unconstitutional if it looks to\n         the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule\n         which is to be applied thereafter. However, a court engages in a\n         judicial inquiry if it investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as\n         they stand on present or past facts and under laws already in\n         existence. Thus, the court’s action is adjudicatory in nature if its\n         action is particular and immediate rather than general and future.\n\n         Id.\nThe Court held that the Insurance Board’s decision was “quasi-judicial and not\n\nlegislative in nature” such that trial de novo at the district court was permissible\n\nunder the separation of powers doctrine.

App.—Austin 1999, no\n\npet.). In that case, the Texas Comptroller issued an order temporarily suspending\n\nMacias’s broker’s license. Id. at 831. Macias sought judicial review of the\n\nComptroller’s order. Id. Although the statute called for judicial review via trial de\n\n\n\n                                           - 44 -\n\fnovo, the Comptroller convinced the district court to review the Comptroller’s\n\norder pursuant to the substantial evidence rule, arguing that pure de novo review\n\nviolates the Texas Constitution. Id. at 832. The district court upheld the suspension\n\nbased on substantial evidence review and Macias appealed. Id.\n\n      Writing for the Court, Justice Yeakel framed the issue on appeal as “whether\n\na trial de novo of the Comptroller’s charges against Macias violates the\n\nconstitution, allowing only substantial-evidence review confined to the agency\n\nrecord.” Id. at 832. Justice Yeakel first identified the relevant separation of powers\n\ndoctrine, noting that “[i]f the function of the agency is legislative, judicial review is\n\nconstrained by the substantial-evidence rule because the court may not substitute\n\nits judgment for that which is considered to be a legislative function.” Id. at 832. In\n\ncontrast, “when an agency has acted in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, a court\n\nmay conduct a trial de novo without violating separation-of-powers principles.” Id.\n\nat 833.\n\n      Drawing the distinction between the legislative and judicial, Justice Yeakel\n\nexplained that “an administrative agency acts in a legislative capacity when it\n\naddresses broad questions of public policy and promulgates rules for future\n\napplication ‘to all or some part of those subject to its power.’” Id. But a “judicial\n\ninquiry…typically involves an investigation of present or past facts and a\n\ndetermination of liability based on laws already in existence.” Id. Applying this\n\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\fframework to the facts of Macias, Justice Yeakel held that the Comptroller’s\n\nactions were judicial in nature because instead of “promulgating rules that would\n\nbroadly affect customs brokers as a whole,” the Comptroller had only “engaged in\n\na factual inquiry into the conduct of a particular individual.” Id. Finding that “the\n\ndistrict court erred in conducting a substantial-evidence review of the\n\nComptroller’s order” the Court decided to “remand this case to the district court for\n\nconsideration by trial de novo.” Id.\n\n      The State advances the same argument presented by the Insurance Board in\n\nCommercial Life and the Comptroller in Macias, suggesting that the separation of\n\npowers doctrine requires that the trial court may only review the AO under the\n\nsubstantial evidence test as to matters of law. Yet the State makes no effort to\n\nexplain how issuance of the AO was a quasi-legislative, as opposed to a quasi-\n\njudicial, act. Unlike a quasi-legislative action, the AO does not address “broad\n\nquestions of public policy” nor promulgate “rules for future application.” Macias,\n\n995 S.W.2d at 833. Instead, it fits squarely within the quasi-judicial framework\n\nbecause it “investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or\n\npast facts and under laws already in existence.” Commercial Life Ins. Co., 808\n\nS.W.2d at 556. The AO purports to make specific factual findings about materials\n\nExxonMobil and Shell shipped to the Voda Site, the alleged release of those\n\nmaterials, and the harm allegedly caused—all predicates to alleged liability under\n\n\n\n                                        - 46 -\n\fthe SWDA.

That case dealt with an\n\napplication to the Savings and Loan Commission for a charter to open a new\n\nsavings and loan association.

Id. In short, Gerst was directed at a\n\npermitting decision that was reached following the opportunity for a hearing at the\n\nagency level, and has no application to the facts of this AO.\n\n      B.     The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco is not\n             controlling in this SWDA appeal.\n\n      The State relies on the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Texas\n\nCommission on Environmental Quality v.

Yet the State misapprehends the\n\nsignificance of that decision at both the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court\n\nlevels.\n\n      The central issue in City of Waco was a threshold determination on whether\n\na third-party could intervene and force a contested-case hearing for an existing\n\npermit modification. Under the Texas Water Code, interested third-parties may\n\nobject to requested permit modifications during a comment period and may attempt\n\nto intervene and force the applicant into a contested-case hearing. However, only\n\n\n                                        - 48 -\n\fan “affected person” has standing to receive a contested-case hearing. Therefore, a\n\nthreshold determination must be made as to whether the objecting party is an\n\n“affected person” with standing to request a contested-case hearing.\n\n      In City of Waco, a concentrated animal feeding operation sought to modify\n\nits existing water-quality permit from the TCEQ. The City objected to the proposed\n\npermit modification and sought to initiate a contested-case hearing. The\n\nCommission determined that the City was not an “affected person” entitled to force\n\na contested-case hearing, and the Executive Director issued the amended permit.\n\nThe City appealed to the district court, which affirmed the Commission’s decision.\n\nThis Court reversed, holding that the Commission acted arbitrarily as a matter of\n\nlaw.

Id. at 818. However, this Court based its holding on its conclusion that the\n\nagency had “acted arbitrarily by relying on a factor that is irrelevant to the City’s\n\nstanding to obtain a hearing.” Id. at 823. Therefore, the Commission’s decision\n\ncould be overturned as arbitrary “independently and apart from whether substantial\n\nevidence could be found to support those findings.” Id. at 819.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 49 -\n\f      The Texas Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the Commission’s\n\ndecision to deny the City’s request. City of Waco, 413 S.W.3d at 425. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court found that the Commission’s actions were not arbitrary and that\n\nthere was evidence in the record to support the Commission’s conclusion that the\n\nCity was not entitled to force a contested-case hearing. Id. In finding that the\n\nCommission’s action was not arbitrary, the Texas Supreme Court did not articulate\n\nwhat standard of review it used to uphold the TCEQ’s threshold determination on\n\nwhether the City was an affected person entitled to force a contested-case hearing.\n\nNor did the Texas Supreme Court address this Court’s extensive analysis regarding\n\nthe inapplicability of pure substantial evidence review in the absence of a factual\n\nrecord developed in a contested-case proceeding. In fact, the words “substantial\n\nevidence” are absent from the Texas Supreme Court’s analysis of the agency’s\n\nactions. Instead, the Texas Supreme Court gave deference to the agency’s answer\n\nto the threshold statutory question of whether the permit was exempt from the\n\nhearing requirement under the statute.\n\n      The State suggests that City of Waco should be interpreted to mean that all\n\nthe Commission’s actions are subject to review only under the substantial evidence\n\nstandard, regardless of the statute involved or the procedures afforded the\n\naggrieved party at the agency level. But this over-reads the limited issue at stake in\n\nCity of Waco. The issue on appeal was not the agency’s ultimate decision on the\n\n\n\n                                         - 50 -\n\fmerits of the permit, but what the Texas Supreme Court characterized as a\n\n“threshold determination of whether the party is an ‘affected person’” sufficient to\n\nintervene in the application process of a third party. Id. at 410. While both cases\n\ninvolve activities by the TCEQ, their similarities largely end there, as the present\n\ncase has no connection to the Texas Water Code, permitting, or the standing of\n\nthird parties—rather it involves the appeal of an agency order under liability-\n\ndeclaring provisions of the SWDA. The TCEQ’s determination on right-to-hearing\n\ndecisions for third parties is not analogous to enforcement of a unilateral\n\nadministrative order against an entity that the agency alone has determined to be\n\nresponsible for environmental contamination.\n\n      More importantly, the decision in City of Waco came in the context of an\n\nappeal under § 5.351 of the Texas Water Code, which itself does not supply any\n\nstandard of review. Tex. Water Code Ann. § 5.351 (West 2008). Through case law,\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court has held that such decisions are subject to “substantial\n\nevidence review.” Texas Water Comm’n v.

In contrast, this case is brought under the appellate provisions of the\n\nSWDA, which places an affirmative burden of proof on the agency to prove certain\n\nfacts by a preponderance of the evidence to the satisfaction of the district court.\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.322 (West 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 51 -\n\f      The State further argues that a post-City of Waco decision from this Court,\n\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality v. Sierra Club, No. 03-12-00335-\n\nCV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7464085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin Dec. 30, 2014, no pet. h.), “reinforced\n\n[the State’s] interpretation.” (Appellant’s Brief at 39.)6 In that case, a waste control\n\ncompany applied to the TCEQ for a permit to construct and operate two facilities\n\nfor the disposal of low-level radioactive waste under the Texas Radiation Control\n\nAct (“TRCA”). Similar to the Water Code provisions at issue in City of Waco, the\n\nTRCA requires the TCEQ to hold a contested-case hearing on the merits of an\n\napplication if a “person affected” requests one. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §\n\n401.229(a) (West 2010). Two members of the Sierra Club sought to intervene and\n\nforce the applicant to defend its permit application through the contested-case\n\nprocess. Id. at *2. This Court identified “the critical, or threshold, inquiry in\n\ncontested-case hearing requests—and importantly the focus of the parties to this\n\nappeal—is whether the person requesting the hearing is an ‘affected person.’” Id.\n\nat *4. Applying the holding from City of Waco, the Court held it must review “a\n\nTCEQ determination regarding affected-person status for an abuse of discretion.”\n\nId. Upon review, this Court found a reasonable basis for the agency’s decision to\n\ndeny the hearing request. Id. at *9. And consistent with City of Waco, this Court\n\n\n6\n   The opinion cited by Appellant was withdrawn by the Court on December 30, 2104, and\nsubstituted with the opinion discussed herein.\n\n\n\n                                         - 52 -\n\fdetermined that the Commission was not required to hold a contested-case hearing\n\nsimply to determine whether or not it was required to hold a contested-case\n\nhearing. Id. at 10.\n\n      No court interpreting or applying City of Waco has adopted the State’s\n\nposition that all TCEQ decisions—including those with specific statutory appellate\n\nprovisions to the contrary—are subject to review only through pure substantial\n\nevidence. The cases citing City of Waco only reiterate its application to the limited,\n\nthreshold inquiry of whether a party is an affected person sufficient to trigger a\n\ncontested-case hearing. Consequently, the issues before the Court are neither\n\ncontrolled nor informed by City of Waco or its limited progeny.\n\n      C.     The APA provisions authorizing pure substantial evidence review\n             on a contested-case record are not applicable to this appeal.\n\n      Ignoring the statutory language for judicial review of the AO, the State tries\n\nto shoehorn judicial review of the case into pure substantial evidence review under\n\nTexas Government Code § 2001.174 with the claim that the Court should “look to\n\nthe APA” to “interpret the existing law of administrative review.” (Appellant’s\n\nBrief at 36.) Yet by its express terms, Texas Government Code § 2001.174 does\n\nnot apply because there was no contested-case hearing at the TCEQ and because\n\nthe SWDA already provides the appropriate standard of review. If the Court does\n\nchoose to look to the APA, the lessons drawn should only reinforce the trial court’s\n\ndecision denying the State’s plea.\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\f             1.    The APA does not apply, and the available guidance leads\n                   to different conclusions than advocated by the State.\n\n      The statutory basis for pure substantial evidence review advanced by the\n\nState is found in the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), Texas Government\n\nCode Chapter 2001. Texas Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2001.171-178 (West 2008). By its\n\nexpress terms, this APA provision is limited to the appeal of a contested-case\n\nhearing. Id. at § 2001.171. When an aggrieved party appeals an administrative\n\norder issued after a contested-case hearing, the APA provides that the scope of\n\njudicial review “is as provided by the law under which review is sought.” Id. at\n\n§ 2001.172. If the law under which review is sought grants a right to trial de novo\n\nof the administrative order, the APA provides the relevant procedures for this de\n\nnovo review under § 2001.173. If the law under which review is sought instead\n\nallows only substantial evidence review of the contested-case order—or if it does\n\nnot define a scope of review—the APA outlines the procedures for that review in\n\n§ 2001.174. None of these three situations are applicable to the AO in this case.\n\n      Absent express application, to the extent the APA offers any guidance for\n\nhow the Court should determine the proper procedure for the appeal of the AO, the\n\nState draws precisely the wrong conclusions. First, the Commission suggests the\n\nCourt should ignore the statutory appellate provisions of the SWDA and simply\n\nsubstitute substantial evidence review under § 2001.174. But even when the APA\n\napplies, it does not supplant the statutory provisions of the law under which review\n\n\n                                       - 54 -\n\fis sought as reflected in § 2001.172, but is expressly subject to the specific statute\n\nunder which the administrative order is being reviewed. Second, the State has\n\nargued that administrative orders can only be reviewed as to questions of law based\n\non the separation of powers doctrine. Yet Subchapter K of the APA establishes that\n\nadministrative orders can be reviewed via trial de novo at the district court, even if\n\nthey are issued following a contested-case hearing at the agency.\n\n             2.    Outside of threshold standing questions, pure substantial\n                   evidence requires a true contested-case record under the\n                   APA.\n\n      The APA standard of “substantial evidence” permits the reviewing court to\n\nreverse if the decision is “not reasonably supported by substantial evidence\n\nconsidering the reliable and probative evidence in the record as a whole.” Texas\n\nGov’t Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E) (West 2008) (emphasis added). The “record as\n\na whole” within which the court looks for substantial evidence is the contested-\n\ncase record, not any type of informal record developed in a non-contested-case\n\nproceeding. In fact, the items identified as part of such a record in the APA—\n\npleadings, evidence received, offers of proof, etc.—demonstrates that the “record\n\nas a whole” is an adjudicative record. Id. at § 2001.060. Therefore, pure substantial\n\nevidence review under the APA presupposes an open, adjudicative hearing where\n\nboth sides may present evidence and cross-examine testifying witnesses.

Sierra Club, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7463875</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. Those decisions can be reviewed by the trial court for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. None of the features applicable to this limited exception are present in\n\nthis case. This is a Superfund case in which the TCEQ has declared ExxonMobil\n\nand Shell liable, not a permitting case brought by a third-party. ExxonMobil and\n\nShell challenged a unilateral administrative order, not a denial of their contested-\n\ncase hearing request. Perhaps most importantly, the relevant statute contains a\n\nstandard of review, and there is no basis for substituting a standard of review other\n\nthan the one called for in the statute.\n\n      The State ignores these prerequisites for pure substantial evidence review\n\nand points to a handful of cases to argue that the Court should apply pure\n\n\n\n                                          - 56 -\n\fsubstantial evidence review to this appeal of a state Superfund order.

However, the case was not decided on substantive grounds\n\nbecause the party failed to timely appeal the executive director’s decision. Id. at\n\n97.7\n\n       The State also relies upon United Copper to claim that the AO should only\n\nbe reviewed under the pure substantial evidence rule. United Copper Indus., Inc. v.\n\nGrissom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1561404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1561404/united-copper-industries-inc-v-grissom/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. dism’d). But like City of\n\nWaco, United Copper was focused on whether a third-party was an affected person\n\nsufficient to intervene in a permitting matter, and more specifically, what formal\n\nprocedures the agency must adopt to make that threshold determination. United\n\nCopper applied to the Commission for an air quality permit to construct and\n\n7\n   The Court’s observation in Kelsoe about whether a contested-case hearing was required\nbefore the executive director could determine if a permit application was administratively\ncomplete—even if it were somehow relevant to this Superfund case—was dicta.\n\n\n\n                                          - 57 -\n\foperate two copper melting furnaces. Id. at 799. Shortly after receiving notice of\n\nthe application, Grissom, an adjacent landowner, sought a hearing on United\n\nCopper’s permit. Id. at 800. The Commission denied his request, and Grissom\n\nappealed to the district court. Id. at 800-01. The district court found that the\n\nCommission erred by denying Grissom’s request without first providing him an\n\nopportunity to present his evidence at a preliminary adjudicative hearing, and\n\nremanded the case to the Commission for such a hearing. Id. at 801. This Court\n\naffirmed, determining that Grissom was an affected person under the rule and that\n\nthe agency had erred by denying Grissom a meaningful opportunity to present\n\nevidence in support of his hearing request. Id. at 806.\n\n      United Copper was curtailed by Collins two years later (which the State also\n\nrelies upon) which itself was distinguished by the Texas Supreme Court in City of\n\nWaco. Whereas the landowner in United Copper was given a hearing to prove he\n\nwas an affected person sufficient to intervene in the permitting process, the\n\nlandowner in Collins (who received no such hearing) was unable to show that he\n\nwas an affected person under the statute, and this Court upheld the agency’s\n\ndecision to deny his request for a contested-case hearing on the permit.

Because parties subject to the order have not been afforded any\n\nhearing prior to issuance of the AO, the trial court may only uphold the order if the\n\nCommission “proves by a “preponderance of the evidence” the factors in\n\n§ 361.322(g). The “use of the term prove” suggests that the Legislature intended\n\nevidence to be presented—and that the agency could not rely on its own non-\n\nadjudicative agency record to justify its actions.

Failure to Attain Remediation Goals or Findings of Significant Difference\n\n       A.     If at any point in the Remedial Activities the Performing Parties conclude that the\n              Remedial Activities as implemented in accordance with this AO will not attain the\n              Remediation Goals, or if the Performing Parties find that conditions at the Site differ\n              from those that form the basis of the RSD and significantly change the scope,\n              performance or costs of the Remedial Activities, then the Performing Parties shall\n              take the actions specified in this Section.\n\n       B.     Within ten (10) Pays after the Performing Parties initially determine that a failure to\n              attain Remediation Goals or that a significant difference in the scope, performance\n              or cost of the Remedial Activities as described in this Section exists, Performing\n              Parties shall notify the ED of that determination with a description of its basis.\n\n\n\n                                Page ~2 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        70\n\fC.   Not later than sixty (60) Days after the initial assertion of a failure to attain\n     Remediation Goals or of a significant difference in the scope, performance or cost\n     of the Remedial Activities, the Performing Parties shall submit a Failure Evaluation\n     Report to the ED for his approval.\n\nD.

Data\n     presented in the Failure Evaluation Report will comply with the DQOs.\n\nE.   The ED will not consider the failure of a design element or remedial action that is not\n     required by this AO to be the basis for a failure to attain the Remediation Goals.\n\nF.   The ED will consider differences in the quantity or extent of contaminants as the\n     basis for a determination of a significant difference only when such differences are\n     so significant as to cause the Remedy not to be the lowest cost alternative that is\n     technologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes\n     damage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the\n     environment.\n\nG.   After receipt of the Failure Evaluation Report, the ED will notify the Site\n     Coordinator of his approval or disapproval of the report with comments. If the ED\n     determines that the basis of the Performing Parties' assertion of a failure to attain\n     Remediation Goals or of a significant difference is valid, no applicable stipulated\n     penalties will be imposed for missed deadlines subsequent to the Performing Parties'\n     notification made in accordance with Paragraph B above, except for failure to submit\n     documents pursuant to this Section. If the ED determines that the basis of a failure\n     to attain Remediation Goals or of an assertion of a significant difference is not valid,\n     the ED will direct that Remedial Activities continue and that the Performing Parties\n     pay any applicable stipulated penalties for any missed deadlines.\n\nH.   Unless the ED approves the Failure Evaluation Report and/or directs continuation of\n     Remedial Activities, within thirty (30) Days after the ED provides written comments\n     to the Site Coordinator, the Performing Parties shall resubmit the Failure Evaluation\n     Report, in both clean and redline, strikeout format, with a summary note which\n     clearly and explicitly indicates how each of the ED' s comments on the previous draft\n     ofthe Failure Evaluation Report has been satisfactorily addressed and which will also\n     identify all other revisions or changes from the previous version of the Failure\n     Evaluation Report.\n\n\n\n                       Page 43 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                71\n\f        I.     The ED will notify the Site Coordinator of his approval or disapproval, with\n               comments, of each resubmittal of the Failure Evaluation Report. Each resubmittal\n               will be submitted in accordance with Paragraph H above. Disapproval of the first\n               resubmittal and each subsequent resubmittal is subject to assessment of stipulated\n               penalties in accordance with Section XXI (Stipulated Penalties).\n\n        J.     Not later than ninety (90) Days after a determination by the ED that the Remedy will\n               not attain the Remediation Goals or a significant difference exists, the Respondents\n               shall submit to the ED for approval a written report evaluating alternatives to the\n               Remedial Activities and may submit a proposal for such alternative Remedial\n               Activities as may be necessary to achieve the Remediation Goals. Any proposed\n               alternatives must comply with the remedy selection criteria contained in 30 TEX.\n               ADMIN CODE Chapter 335, Subchapter Kand 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE Chapter 350.\n               The Remedy may be modified, as stated in Section V (Order) Paragraph J, only as\n               specified in 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE Section 335.349.\n\n        K.     In the event TCEQ determines that alternate or additional remedial actions are\n               necessary because of the Remedy's failure, TCEQ may terminate this AO.\n\nVTII.   Project Manager/Site Coordinator\n\n        A.

Respondents shall direct all communications regarding the Remedial Activities,\n               whether written or oral, at a minimum, to the Project Manager or, ifnot available, the\n               alternate Project Manager.\n\n        C.    In addition to fulfilling the requirements of Section V (Order) Paragraph I, within ten\n              (10) Days after the Effective Date, the Agreeing Respondents or, if there are no\n              Agreeing Respondents to this AO, the Performing Parties shall submit a written\n              notice to the Project Manager containing the Site Coordinator's address, phone\n              number and/or pager number at which he/she may be contacted at any time in case\n              of emergency. The Site Coordinator shall notify the ED in writing at least seven (7)\n              Days prior to the start date of any field activities associated with the Remedial\n              Activities.

Endangerment and Immediate Threat\n\n      A.     In the event of any action or occurrence during the performance of the Remedial\n             Activities which causes or threatens a release of a solid waste or hazardous substance\n             or which may present an immediate threat to public health or welfare or the\n             environment, Respondents shall immediately take all appropriate action to prevent,\n             abate, or minimize such release or threat and shall immediately notify the Project\n             Manager and Site Representative or, if the Project Manager cannot be contacted, the\n             alternate Project Manager and Site Representative.

At that time all responsibilities and obligations that attach to RPs in\n      addition to those that attach to Performing Parties will attach to Defaulting Performing\n\n\n                                 Page 52 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           80\n\f       Parties that are RPs, including the requirement to pay TCEQ costs in accordance with\n       Section V (Order) Paragraph C.\n\n       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this AO, the Agreeing Respondents or, ifthere\n       are no Agreeing Respondents to this AO, the Performing Parties shall bear no costs for any\n       fines, penalties, or increases in the ED's oversight of the Remedial Activities resulting from\n       Defaulting Performing Parties actions or inactions. Defaulting Performing Parties and the\n       RPs may be assessed the ED's full costs for oversight of the Work. If actions required by\n       this AO are delayed or are not timely completed because of acts or omissions of one or more\n       Defaulting Performing Parties, the Agreeing Respondents, or if there are no Agreeing\n       Respondents to this AO, the Performing Parties may request a time extension. Upon such\n       request, the ED will approve the time extension, disapprove it, or approve such alternative\n       time extension as the ED in his sole discretion deems appropriate. Thereafter, Respondents\n       shall adhere to all remaining deadlines in this AO and in any documents developed in\n       accordance with this AO and approved by the ED.\n\n       The Agreeing Respondents may seek and the ED may grant an extension of any deadline\n       contained in this AO or in any document submitted pursuant to this AO. Agreeing\n       Respondents shall submit the request for a deadline extension no later than seven (7) Days\n       prior to the deadline date and shall substantiate good cause for extension of the deadline.\n       The determination of what constitutes good cause and the length of any deadline extension\n       will be at the ED's sole discretion.\n\nXIX.   Reserved\n\nXX.    Compliance with Applicable Laws\n\n       A.

This AO is not, and shall not be\n              construed to be, a permit issued pursuant to any federal or state statute or regulation.\n\n       B.     All materials removed from the Site shall be disposed of or treated at a facility which\n              is in compliance with all applicable or relevant and appropriate federal, state, and\n              local laws and shall be disposed of or treated in accordance with all such\n              requirements.\n\nXXI.

With the exception of the stipulated penalties referenced in Paragraphs E, G and H\n     above which attach to individual Agreeing Respondents, all stipulated penalties\n     assessed in accordance with this Section are joint and several, not individual,\n     obligations.\n\nJ.   Agreeing Respondents shall pay stipulated penalties assessed under this Section as\n     specified in ParagraphK below within sixty (60) Days after ED transmits a demand\n     letter stating that stipulated penalties have accrued or after resolution of a\n     disagreement as specified in Section XXIII (Resolution of Disagreements),\n     whichever comes later. Stipulated penalties will accrue from the date of\n     noncompliance until the noncompliance is corrected, provided however, that if any\n     Respondent prevails in resolution of disagreements as specified in Section XX.III\n     (Resolution of Disagreements), it shall have no liability to pay stipulated penalties\n     with regard to those matters submitted for resolution of disagreements in accordance\n     with Section XXIII (Resolution of Disagreements) in which it prevails.\n\n                       Page 55 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             83\n\f      K.     Agreeing Respondents shall pay stipulated penalties to \"General Revenue Fund of\n             the State of Texas\" and shall mail payments to:\n\n             Chief Fiscal Officer (MC 180)\n             Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\n             \"Re: Voda Petroleum, Inc.

The requirement to pay stipulated penalties that have been incurred prior to the\n             termination of this AO in accordance with Section XXXIIl (Termination of the\n             Administrative Order) will survive termination of this AO.\n\n      M.    A single act or omission may be the basis for more than one type of stipulated\n            penalty. A single act or omission may also be subject to more than one (1) Day of\n            stipulated penalties. In cases where more than one stipulated penalty applies to a\n            single act or omission, the ED may choose which stipulated penalties to assess.\n\n      N.    The ED has the sole discretion to reduce or waive stipulated penalties and to do so\n            as to specific Agreeing Respondents or groups of Agreeing Respondents.\n\n      0.    Stipulated penalties against Agreeing Respondents will be in lieu of administrative\n            and civil penalties for the same violation but will not prevent TCEQ from seeking\n            enforcement of the ordering provisions by injunctive relief. Respondents that are not\n            Agreeing Respondents are subject to administrative and civil penalties.\n\nXXII. Force Majeure\n\n      A.    If a delay in performance is caused (in whole or in part) by events beyond the\n            reasonable control of the Agreeing Respondents, that failure will not be construed as\n            a violation of this AO. The burden of establishing that an event is beyond their\n            reasonable control lies with the Agreeing Respondents. The Agreeing Respondents\n            shall notify the ED in writing within seven (7) Days of the start oftheForceMajeure\n            event and within seven (7) Days of the end of the Force Majeure event. Agreeing\n            Respondents shall submit the notification as specified in this Section. Failure to so\n            notify the ED will constitute a waiver of the claim of Force Majeure.\n\n            Such notice will describe in detail the cause of the delay; the anticipated duration of\n            the delay; the measures taken and to be taken by the Agreeing Respondents, their\n            contractors or consultants, to prevent or minimize the delay; and the timetable by\n            which these measures have been, are being, and will be implemented. Measures to\n            prevent or minimize the delay will be implemented upon the ED's written approval\n            of the timetable. The Agreeing Respondents shall also submit, forthe ED's approval,\n\n                              Page 56 - Voda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      84\n\f               a proposed schedule for subsequent Remedial Activities whose deadlines have been\n               affected by the Force Majeure event. Neither the ED's approval of the timetable of\n               measures to be taken to prevent or minimize delays or of the revised schedule of\n               Remedial Activities will be construed as excusing the delay or as a waiver of\n               TCEQ's rights to enforce this AO.\n\n        B.     Force Majeure events will not include increased costs or expenses of any part or all\n               of the Work or the financial inability of any Agreeing Re.spondent to perform any part\n               or all of the Work.\n\n        C.     Ifthe ED and the Agreeing Respondents cannot agree that the cause for the delay was\n               a Force Majeure event or cannot agree upon the schedule for subsequent Remedial\n               Activities, then the disagreement will be resolved according to Section XX:ill\n               (Resolution of Disagreements). The Agreeing Respond~mts shall have the burden of\n               demonstrating that Force Majeure is warranted.\n\n:xxm.   Resolution of Disagreements\n\n        A.    The Agreeing Respondents and the ED shall attempt to resolve on an informal basis\n              any issues arising under Sections V (Order) through XXXIlI (Termination of the\n              Administrative Order) on which there is disagreement. The Agreeing Respondents\n              shall commence informal negotiations by notifying the Project Manager in writing\n              that there is a disagreement and that this Section is being invoked. Except as\n              provided below in Paragraph D, informal negotiations will not extend beyond thirty\n              (30) Days from the date the Project Manager receives such notification, unless the\n              Agreeing Respondents and the ED agree otherwise in writing.\n\n        B.    The Agreeing Respondents shall notify the Project Manager within thirty (30) Days\n              after the Day the Agreeing Respondents knew or should have known of the events\n              giving rise to the disagreement. Should the Agreeing Respondents fail to give such\n              notice, the ED's decision on any disagreement will be binding.\n\n        C.    Notification of the Project Manager in accordance with Paragraph A above will not\n              by itself postpone the deadlines established in accordance with this AO or stay the\n              accrual of any applicable stipulated penalties for the matter at issue. However, the\n              obligation to pay any applicable stipulated penalties to the TCEQ will be stayed\n              pending resolution of the disagreement in accordance with thiS Section.\n\n        D.    If the ED makes a determination to perform a portion or all of the Remedial\n              Activities, the Agreeing Respondents shall have five (5) Days after notification to the\n              Site Coordinator to commence informal negotiations by notifying the Project\n              Manager in accordance with Paragraph A above. Informal negotiations will not\n              extend beyond fifteen (15) Days from the date the ED receives notification, unless\n              the Agreeing Respondents and the ED agree otherwise in writing.\n\n                                 Page 57 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., Stale Superfund Sile\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        85\n\f       E.     The procedure for any resolution of disagreements subsequent to informal\n              negotiations will be found in Sections 361.321 and/or 361.322 of the Act.\n\n       F.     Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, the fact that resolution of\n              disagreements is not specifically set forth in individual Sections is not intended to\n              and will not bar the Agreeing Respondents from invoking this Section as to any\n              disagreement arising under Sections V (Order) through XXXIII (Termination of the\n              Administrative Order), including any disagreement concerning the ED's exercise of\n              discretion under the terms of this AO.\n\nXXIV. Indemnification\n\n       Respondents agree to indemnify and hold harmless TCEQ and its officers, employees,\n       agents, principals and assigns from and against all fines, penalties, claims, damages, losses,\n       demands, judgments, settlements, costs of suit, and attorneys fees that arise out of or result\n       from:\n\n              1.

Liability\n\n      The State of Texas, by issuing this AO, assumes no liability for any injuries or damages to\n      persons or property resulting from acts or omissions of Respondents, or their directors,\n      officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors, assigns, contractors, or consultants\n      in carrying out any of the Work. Neither TCEQ nor the State of Texas will be deemed a\n      party to any contract entered into by any Respondent or its directors, officers, employees,\n      agents, successors, assigns, contractors, or consultants to perform any or all of the Work or\n      any other activity at the Site.\n\nXXVI. Severability\n\n      The provisions of this AO are intended to be severable and are deemed severable. Should\n      any provision of this AO be rendered unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or\n      other appropriate authority the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n                                Page 58 - Yoda Petroleum, Inc., State Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        86\n\fXXVII. TCEQ's General Reservation of Rights and Retention of Claims\n\n       Except as specified herein, nothing in this AO will constitute or be construed as a covenant\n       not to sue by TCEQ or the State of Texas or a release from any claim, cause of action, or\n       demand in law or equity against any person, firm, partnership, or corporation. Except as\n       specified herein, the ED reserves and this AO is without prejudice to all rights against\n       Respondents with respect to all matters including:\n\n              1.      Claims based on Respondents' failure to fulfill the requirements of this AO;\n\n              2.      Liability arising from the past, present, or future disposal, release, or threat\n                      of release of solid wastes or hazardous substances outside of or not related to\n                      the Site;\n\n              3.

Liability for violations of federal or state law which occur during or after\n                      implementation of the Remedial Activities;\n\n              5.      Claims based on criminal liability; and\n\n              6.

INTRODUCTION\n\nVoda Petroleum, Inc., (aka Ultra Oil) (Voda Site) occupies 6.12 acres at 211 Duncan Road,\napproximately 1.25 miles west of the intersection of FM 2275 (George Richey Road) and FM\n3272 (North White Oak Road), 2.6 miles north-northeast of Clarksville City in Gregg County.\nThe Voda Site was operated as a waste oil recycling facility from about 1981 until it was\nabandoned in November 1991.      ·\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is an agency in the State of Texas\nthat implements many of the state laws relating to the conservation of natural resources and the\nprotection of public health and safety and the environment. The TCEQ addresses certain sites\nthat may constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\nenvironment through the state Superfund program.\n\nII.    PURPOSE\n\nThis Remedy Selection Document (RSD) presents the Remedial Action (also known as \"the\nremedy\") for the Voda Site, which is designed to address the contamination and provide\nprotection of public health and safety and the environment.\n\nWords appearing in italics in this document are defined in Section VIII, \"Glossary,\" of this RSD.\n\nIII.   LEGAL AUTHORITY\n\nThe investigation of the nature and extent of contamination at the Voda Site and the selection of\nthe Remedial Action is in accordance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act, Tex. Health & Safety\nCode §§ 361.001-966 (West 2008); Subchapter K: Hazardous Substance Facilities Assessment\nand Remediation (Subchapter K) rules found in 30 Tex. Admin. Code (TAC) §§ 335.341-351\n(2009); and the Texas Risk Reduction Program (TRRP) rules found in 30 TAC §§ 350.1-135\n(2009).\n\nWhile the Subchapter K rules are specific to the Superfund process, the TRRP rules are a\ncomprehensive program for addressing environmental contamination and apply to many different\ntypes of corrective action administered by the TCEQ. The TRRP mles establish procedures for\ndetermining the concentration of contaminants to which a person or other environmental receptor\ncan be exposed without unacceptable risk of harm. These acceptable concentration levels are\ncalled Protective Concentration Levels (PCLs ).\n\nA three-tiered approach may be used under the TRRP mies to calculate the PCLs for a site. The\ntiers represent increasing levels of evaluation where site-specific infmmation is factored into the\nprocess. For example, Tier 1 uses conservative, generic models that do not account for site-\nspecific factors, Tier 2 allows for the use of site-specific information but must use PCL equations\n\n\n\n                                                1\n                                                                                                      94\n\fprovided by the TCEQ, and Tier 3 allows for more detailed and complex evaluations so that\nPCLs are appropriate for specific site conditions. The PCLs for the Voda Site were developed\nunder Tier 1.\n\nCritical to the analysis under all three of the tiers is the land use classification for the site. Under\nthe TRRP rules, the land can be classified as either residential or commercial/industrial.\nRemediation to residential standards assumes that the site may be occupied by children and\ntherefore is applicable not only to strictly residential land but also to playgrounds, schools,\ndaycare centers and similar land uses. Remediation to commercial/industrial standards assumes\nthat the site will not be regularly occupied by children and is protective of persons who may\noccupy the site as workers. Sites remediated to commercial/industrial standards cannot be used\nfor residential-type activities unless further controls are implemented to make the site safe for\nthat use. The TCEQ determined that a commercial/industrial use was appropriate for the Voda\nSite.\n\nThe TRRP rules allow risks posed by the presence of contamination above a PCL to be managed\nby any combination of the following: 1) removal or decontamination of contaminated media; 2)\nphysical controls, such as landfills and caps, which limit exposure to the contaminated media; or\n3) institutional controls, such as deed restrictions on the future use of the property, which are\nalso intended to limit exposure to the contaminated media. These remedies under the TRRP\nrules are divided into two main categories: Remedy Standard A and Remedy Standard B. To\nmeet Remedy Standard A requirements, the contaminated media must be removed and/or\ndecontaminated such that physical controls and, in most cases, institutional controls are not\nnecessary to protect human and ecological receptors from unprotective levels of contamination\nbased on the designated land use. To meet the requirements of Remedy Standard B, however,\nphysical controls and institutional controls may be relied on to limit exposure to unprotective\nlevels of contamination. These standards are described in detail in 30 TAC § 350.32 and §\n350.33. The proposed remedy at the Voda Site meets the criteria established for Remedy\nStandard A..\n\nIV.    SITE HISTORY\n\nThe Voda Site was operated as a waste oil recycling facility from about 1981 until it was\nabandoned in November 1991. The Voda Site is located in a rural residential neighborhood with\noccupied residences directly on the east and west sides of the facility. A review of the facility\nwaste management activity records revealed that Voda Petroleum, Inc., had received, stored and\nprocessed waste gas.olines; oily wastes; used oil mixed with methyl ethyl ketone, varsol,\ntrichloroethane, toluene, and hexane; crude oil; greases; and waxes. In 1996, the EPA conducted\nan emergency removal of 462 fifty-five-gallon drums of grease or oily wastes, 14 fifty-five-\ngallon drums of corrosive wastes, 16 above-ground tanks, and associated contaminated soil. The\nsite was then backfilled to approximate the undisturbed topography to facilitate site drainage.\nThe EPA response action removed the immediate threat to human health and the environment\nbut was not intended to be and did not constitute a final remediation solution. Post removal\nanalysis of soil and groundwater samples indicated that soil and groundwater continued to be\ncontaminated above appropriate cleanup levels.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n                                                                                                           95\n\fV.   SUMMARY OF REPORTS\n\n     A.     HAZARD RANKING SYSTEM REPORT\n\n     The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is a numerically-based screening system that uses\n     information from initial, limited investigations to assess whether a site qualifies for the\n     state or federal Superfund program. Sites scoring 28.5 or greater may qualify for the\n     federal Superfund program, while sites scoring 5 or greater may qualify for the state\n     Superfund program. The HRS scoring for the Voda Site was prepared by the TCEQ in\n     August 1995 and is presented in the report titled \"Hazard Ranking System (HRS)\n     Documentation Record, Yoda Petroleum Site, Gregg County, Texas.\" The Voda Site\n     earned a score of 23.63. The TCEQ proposed to list the Yoda Site on the State Registry\n     of Superfund Sites and published notice of its intent in the Texas Register on November\n     17, 2000. 25 Tex. Reg. 11594-95 (Nov. 17, 2000).\n\n     B.     REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\n\n     The Remedial Investigation (RI) includes field work, laboratory analysis and\n     interpretation of collected data for the purpose of detennining the nature and extent of\n     contamination associated with the Vada Site. The Phase I RI Rep01i, dated August 2002,\n     included a summary of the RI activities conducted at the site in May 2002. Based on the\n     Phase I results, a second phase was conducted in April 2004, focusing on the area known\n     as the \"East Tank Farm.\" The Phase II RI Technical Memorandum (TM), dated July\n     2004, concluded that the investigation of the extent of soil contamination above cleanup\n     standards was complete; however, additional groundwater monitor wells were needed to\n     complete the groundwater investigation. Additional groundwater monitor wells were\n     installed from April 2005 through May 2007. The final round of monitor well\n     installations was found to fully define the extent of the groundwater contamination.\n\n     The following summarizes the findings of the RI:\n\n     Groundwater - The Queen City Aquifer beneath the Voda Site is impacted by various\n     volatile organic constituents (VOCs) exceeding the PCLs applicable to a Class 1\n     groundwater resource.\n\n     Onsite Soil - Soil containing contaminants above cleanup standards at the Voda Site is\n     generally limited to the East Tank Farm area, encompassing an area of approximately 60\n     feet by 120 feet and 12 feet deep. Contaminants exceeding cleanup standards include\n     VOCs and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH).\n\n     Offsite Soil/Sediment - No offsite soil or sediment contamination was detected.\n\n     Ecological Risks - The Tier 1 Exclusion Criteria Checklist determined that conditions at\n     the Voda Site precluded the need for a formal ecological risk assessment (ERA) because\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n                                                                                                   96\n\f       the site meets the conditions for \"de minimis land area,\" meaning there are insignificant\n       ecological exposure pathways at the site.\n\n       C.      FEASIBILITY STUDY PHASE REPORT\n\n       The Feasibility Study (FS) for the Yoda Site, dated January 2008, presented an evaluation\n       of the potential remedial alternatives to address the chemicals of concern (COCs) in\n       onsite soil and onsite and offsite groundwater found exceeding the applicable PCLs.\n\n       D.      REMEDY SELECTION PHASE REPORTS AND MEETING\n\n       The Proposed Remedial Action Document (PRAD), dated June 2008, presented a brief\n       discussion of remedial actions evaluated and the specific remedy proposed by the TCEQ\n       to address the contaminants exceeding the PCLs at the Yoda Site.\n\n       On October 23, 2008, a public meeting was held at the Broadway Elementary School\n       Cafeteria in Gladewater, Texas, for the purpose of presenting the PRAD and soliciting\n       public comment about the proposed remedy. Upon consideration of the comments\n       received during the public comment period, the TCEQ selected the remedy described in\n       this RSD.\n\n       E.     PLUME MANAGEMENT ZONE (PMZ) DEMONSTRATION TECHNICAL\n              MEMORANDUM (TM)\n\n       In May 2009, TCEQ technical staff reevaluated information that could be read to support\n       the finding of two possible classifications for the groundwater at the Yoda Site. As a\n       result, pursuant to 30 TAC § 350.33(f)(4), the TCEQ conducted a PMZ demonstration in\n       accordance with TCEQ publication RG-366/TRRP-29, Soil and Groundwater Response\n       Objectives in July 2009. The PMZ demonstration, detailed in the PMZ Demonstration\n       TM dated August 3, 2009, showed that the COC concentrations will exceed cleanup\n       levels at the nearest point of exposure, an intermittent creek located on the offsite\n       affected property. Therefore, it was confirmed that a PMZ would not meet the remedial\n       action goals and would not be an appropriate remedy for the groundwater at the Yoda\n       Site, and the currently selected remedial action continues to best fit the statutory criteria\n       for remedial selection.\n\nVI.    ACTION LEVELS\n\nRemedial Action Objectives are the stated goal of the remedy that must be achieved to make the\nsite protective of human health and the environment. Action levels are the maximum numeric\nconcentrations of the COCs which must not exceed the Tier 1 PCLs for the appropriate land use\nand groundwater resource classification. For the onsite and offsite groundwater, the Tier 1 PCLs\nare those developed for Class I groundwater resources established in TRRP. For the onsite soil,\nthe Tier 1 PCLs are those developed for Commercial/Industrial Soil with a greater than 0.5 acre\nsource area for groundwater protection, with the exception of TPH which was developed based\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n                                                                                                       97\n\fon site-specific exposure criteria.

THE SELECTED REMEDIAL ACTION\n\nIn accordance with 30 TAC§ 335.348(1) and the requirements of section 361.193 of the Solid\nWaste Disposal Act, the TCEQ selects the Remedial Action for a site by determining which\nremedial alternative is \"the lowest cost alternative which is technologically feasible and reliable,\neffectively mitigates and minimizes damage to the environment, and provides adequate\nprotection of the public health and safety and the environment.\" 30 TAC § 335.348(1). The\nTCEQ has selected excavation with offsite disposal for the onsite soil, and the installation of\nreactive biobaiTier wells with institutional controls for the onsite and offsite shallow\ngroundwater.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n                                                                                                       98\n\fAlso in accordance with TRRP, the Performing Parties (or the TCEQ if no parties agree to fund\nor perfmm the remedial action) shall record an institutfonal control in the real property records\nof Gregg County. The institutional control shall be placed on each property which overlies\ngroundwater contaminated above the PCLs and shall describe the specific area of the\ngroundwater plume on each affected property. The institutional control shall remain in place\nuntil such time as the TCEQ has determined that the Remedial Action Objectives have been\npe1manently achieved. If the Remedial Action is implemented by the TCEQ, the TCEQ will\nrequest that the owner of each affected property voluntarily agree to record a restrictive covenant\nto serve as the institutional control. If the property owner does not agree to the restrictive\ncovenant, the TCEQ shall record a deed notice to serve as the institutional control. If the\nRemedial Action is implemented by Performing Parties, the Pe1forming Parties shall be\nresponsible for securing the institutional control in the form of a restrictive covenant from the\nowner of the affected property. All of the elements of the Remedial Action described above shall\nbe in accordance with detailed requirements established in TRRP.\n\nMonitor wells installed at the Voda Site shall be sampled for the COCs identified in Section VI,\nAction Levels, and the hydraulic gradient shall be measured quarterly during the first two years\nand semi-annually for the following two years of the Remedial Action. Monitoring results shall\nbe evaluated no less frequently than annually to verify that the plume has been reduced in both\nareal extent and concentration of COCs. Once the TCEQ determines that the Action Levels have\nbeen permanently achieved, the TCEQ will discontinue sampling and/or monitoring activities.\n\nVIII.

Plaintiffs seek to conduct discovery under a Level 3 Discovery Control Plan.\n\n                                               III.\n                                     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n        7.       This is a direct appeal of a unilateral Administrative Order issued by the TCEQ on\n\nFebruary 12, 2010. A copy of the Order is attached hereto.\n\n        8.       This action is brought pursuant to§§ 361.188(b), 361.321, and 361.322 of the\n\nTexas Health and Safety Code and § 37.001, et. seq. of the Texas Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (\"TUDJA\").             Section 361.321 allows a person affected by a ruling, order,\n\ndecision or other act of the TCEQ to appeal said ruling, order, decision, or other act by filing a\n\npetition in a district court of Travis County. Plaintiffs are all named by the TCEQ in the Order as\n\nparties responsible for reimbursing the TCEQ's expenses related to certain investigations into\n\npotential environmental contamination at a state superfund site, as well as ordered to undertake\n\nremedial action; as such, Plaintiffs are affected by the Order. Section 361.322 allows any person\n\nsubject to an administrative order issued pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.272 to\n\nappeal said order in district court. Because the Order at issue was issued pursuant to § 361.271\n\nand§ 361.272, and the Plaintiffs are all persons subject to the Order, § 361.188(b) makes the\n\nOrder subject to appeal under§§ 361.321 and 361.322. Finally, the Texas Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act, Texas Civil Practices and Remedy Code § 37.004 allows this district court to\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                Page 3\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                           6\n\fdeclare that the Order       IS   invalid, or   IS   an ultra vires action by the TCEQ and/or the\n\nCommissioners.\n\n        9.       This action is timely filed under the provis10ns of §§ 361.321 and 361.322.\n\nSection 361.321 provides that an appeal must be brought not later than the 301h day after the\n\nruling, order, decision, or other act of the governmental entity (here, the TCEQ) whose action is\n\nappealed. The TCEQ issued the unilateral order effective as of February 12, 2010, but served the\n\nOrder on PRPs subsequent to that date. Accordingly, this petition, which is filed within 30 days\n\nof that date, is timely. Section 361.322 provides that an appeal brought pursuant to that section\n\nmust be filed before the 461h day after the date of receipt, hand delivery, or publication service of\n\nthe order that is being appealed. Accordingly, this petition, which is filed within 46 days of the\n\ndate of publication and receipt, is timely.\n\n        10.      Venue is proper in Travis County District Court pursuant to § 361.32l(a) of the\n\nTexas Health and Safety Code. As stated above, Section 361.321 allows a person affected by a\n\nruling, order, decision or other act of the TCEQ to appeal said ruling, order, decision, or other act\n\nby filing a petition in a district court of Travis County. Plaintiffs are \"persons affected\" by the\n\nOrder and \"persons subject to\" the Order because each is named as a \"responsible party\" who\n\nhas been ordered to conduct remedial activities and reimburse the TCEQ's Hazardous and Solid\n\nWaste Remediation Fee Account for costs the TCEQ allegedly incurred.\n\n                                                      IV.\n                                     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n        11.      The tract of land designated by the TCEQ as the \"Yoda Petroleum State\n\nSuperfund Site\" (the \"Site\") is comprised of approximately 6.12 acres located in Gregg County,\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                               Page 4\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          7\n\fTexas. According to TCEQ 1 records, the Site was historically used as an oil recycling facility\n\nfrom approximately 1981 to 1991, when all operations ceased and the Site was essentially\n\nabandoned by the owners and operators.\n\n        12.      In 1995, the TCEQ conducted an investigation of the Site to determine if the\n\nhistoric operations had resulted in environmental contaminants entering the groundwater and/or\n\nsoils at the Site.     Part of this investigation included a Hazard Ranking System (\"HRS\")\n\nevaluation of the Site. The HRS is a scoring system used to evaluate potential, relative risk(s) to\n\npublic health and the environment from releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances.\n\nThe HRS score assigned to a site as the result of the evaluation is the primary factor in deciding\n\nif that site is eligible to be placed on the federal National Priorities List. The HRS score assigned\n\nto the Site was not sufficient to qualify the Site as a federal Superfund Site. Instead, the Site was\n\nreferred in 1995 to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") for an\n\nimmediate removal action to address the TCEQ' s belief that the Site presented an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\n        13.      An EPA Action Memorandum, dated March 27, 1996, documented that, in\n\naddition to the presence of hazardous substances, the Site received crude oil. The Action\n\nMemorandum also noted the presence of large quantities of oil that were subject to the Clean\n\nWater Act and the Oil Pollution Act.\n\n        14.      In 1996, the EPA removed drums of grease or oily wastes, drums of corrosive\n\nwastes, aboveground storage tanks, and contaminated soils. Fencing was also installed around\n\nthe Site at this time to restrict public access to the Site to insure public health and safety.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  During some of the events outlined in the Factual Background, the TCEQ was known as the Texas Natural\nResource Conservation Commission. For convenience, the agency is referred to throughout this document by its\ncurrent name, the TCEQ.\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                     Page 5\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                                 8\n\f        15.      In December 1997, after the removal action was complete, EPA's contractor\n\nsampled both on-site soils and groundwater as part of a post-removal action assessment. EPA' s\n\nassessment found that the removal action had removed minimized the threat of direct human\n\ncontact and inhalation threats that may have been present pre-removal.\n\n        16.      The EPA then sought recovery of the costs it incurred in undertaking this removal\n\naction, and in 1999 and 2000, the EPA settled with a number of companies that the EPA had\n\nnamed as potentially responsible parties for the Site, including Shell Oil Company and Industrial\n\nLubricants Co., which settled as de minimis parties, and Mobil Oil Corporation, which made a\n\nsignificant settlement payment to EPA\n\n        17.      EPA was informed that Westland Oil, a subsidiary of Specialty Oil Company,\n\nperiodically sent unused (virgin) lube oil mixed with water to Yoda to be dehydrated. The oil\n\nwas then returned to Westland and sold by Westland.        Some of the virgin oil obtained from\n\nWestland may also have been sold by Yoda to third parties, and Westland may have purchased\n\noil that had been obtained by Yoda from other facilities. The evidence regarding the Westland\n\nfacts and the status of the Westland lube oils includes the Yoda Petroleum documentation and\n\nsworn statements by Mr. Ron Yoda, the operator of Yoda Petroleum, and others.                 EPA\n\ndetermined that the Westland lube oil qualified for the CERCLA petroleum exclusion and that\n\nthe transactions between Westland/Specialty and Yoda did not constitute the arrangement for\n\ntreatment or disposal of a hazardous substance. The factual record also demonstrates why this\n\nWestland Oil was not \"waste\" (it was never discarded) and thus was not \"solid waste\" under\n\nSection 361.003 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.          EPA did not demand a settlement\n\npayment or pursue a claim for the Westland materials shipped to Yoda.\n\n        18.      According to the sworn statements of Mr. Yoda, and upon the Plaintiffs'\n\ninformation and belief, different sections of the property were operated by two separate entities -\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 6\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                        9\n\fYoda Petroleum and Ultra Oil. Ultra Oil conducted operations on approximately one acre of the\n\nproperty (also known as the \"Southwest Tank Farm\"). While the Southwest Tank Farm was\n\neventually purchased by Mr. Yoda, there were no Yoda Petroleum operations on the Southwest\n\nTank Farm at any time. The EPA stated that the PRPs who sent materials to the Site would not\n\nbe liable for the EPA' s costs associated with the Ultra Oil operations at the Site.\n\n           19.   TCEQ had knowledge of the EPA's removal action, post-removal sampling and\n\nassessment results, and of the EPA settlement.             Plaintiffs are unaware of any TCEQ\n\ncorrespondence commenting on or disputing the sufficiency of the EPA removal action at the\n\ntime of the removal action itself or immediately following the removal action.\n\n           20.   On information and belief, Yoda Petroleum's operation segregated paraffin\n\nmaterials into specific geographic areas of the Yoda site, specifically the \"West Tank Farm.\"\n\nEPA' s removal action addressed the contamination in the areas where paraffin was stored or\n\nspilled.\n\n           21.   Three years after the EPA removal action, and without re-scoring the Site under\n\nthe HRS, the TCEQ proposed the Site for listing on the State Superfund Registry on November\n\n17, 2000 and published a Notice of that proposal in the Texas Register ( 25 Tex. Reg. 11594).\n\n           22.   In November, 2000 the TCEQ also sent correspondence to certain entities it\n\nbelieved had historically shipped materials to the Site. That correspondence asserted that the\n\nrecipient was considered by the TCEQ to be a PRP at the Site as defined in § 361.271 of the\n\nTexas Health & Safety Code (the Texas Superfund Statute), and therefore potentially responsible\n\nfor environmental investigation and eventual remediation at the Site.           The correspondence\n\ninformed the recipients of the Site's proposed listing on the State Registry and the date for\n\nsubmitting comments on the proposed listing.           The correspondence included a Notice of\n\nOpportunity to Make Good Faith Offer to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 7\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                        10\n\f(\"RI/FS\") at the Site. Several PRPs submitted written comments and objections, particularly\n\ncomplaining that there was no empirical data to support an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment finding and no evidence to support listing the Site on the State Superfund\n\nRegistry.\n\n        23.      Upon information and belief, the statutory requirement to notify all persons\n\npotentially responsible for the Site's contamination, the November, 2000 Notice of an\n\nopportunity to conduct the RI/FS, was not provided to numerous entities, for which the TCEQ\n\nhad records in its possession allegedly identifying these companies as entities that had allegedly\n\nshipped hazardous materials to the Site (herein after the \"No-Notice PRPs\"). Accordingly, the\n\nNo-Notice PRPs had no knowledge of, or opportunity to participate in, the TCEQ's proposed\n\nRI/FS or to provide comments on the Site's proposed listing on the State Registry, despite\n\nTCEQ's knowledge of their alleged shipments to the Site.\n\n        24.      On or about March 6, 2001, the TCEQ sent correspondence to several of the\n\nentities who had allegedly shipped significant quantities of material to the Site and who had\n\nreceived the TCEQ RI/FS Notice as PRPs. That correspondence informed each of those entities\n\nthat they had been removed from the TCEQ's PRP list, purportedly releasing these entities from\n\nliability related to the Site. In several of the letters, TCEQ cited as the reason for removing the\n\nPRP, the so-called CERCLA \"petroleum exclusion\", which exclusion TCEQ staff currently deny\n\nexists under the Texas Health and Safety Code.       The entities receiving these letters are not\n\nnamed as parties to the Order. The documentation those entities submitted and on which the\n\nTCEQ relied at least in part to remove them from the TCEQ PRP list, on the basis that the\n\npetroleum exclusion had been met, included EPA' s conclusion that \"the bulk of the material on\n\nthe list\" attributed to Specialty Oil/Westland Oil Co., \"did not support attribution of CERCLA\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 8\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                        11\n\fliability because it appeared that the Voda facility de-watered those materials and then returned\n\nthem to Specialty.\"\n\n        25.      According to its records, the TCEQ undertook remedial investigations and a\n\nfeasibility study at the Site from 2001 through 2008.\n\n        26.      In June, 2008, the TCEQ issued a Remedy Selection Document. This document\n\nprovides a discussion of, and the TCEQ's conclusions regarding, a proposed remedy for the Site.\n\nThe remedy proposed by TCEQ consists of soil removal and off-site disposal, together with the\n\ninstallation of a bio-reactive barrier in the groundwater. TCEQ estimates that this remedy will\n\ncost $1.2 Million dollars.\n\n        27.      On February 12, 2010, the Commission issued its unilateral Administrative Order\n\nwith respect to the Site to 350 parties, including the Plaintiffs. There was no evidentiary hearing\n\nheld before the Order was issued, nor was there an opportunity for such an evidentiary hearing.\n\n        28.      The Order makes various Findings of Fact, including listing persons identified by\n\nthe Commission as PRPs for the solid waste and/or hazardous substances at the Site. The Order\n\nfurther includes a Conclusion of Law that the PRPs are responsible parties (\"RPs\"). Among\n\nthose listed as RPs are the Plaintiffs.\n\n        29.      The Order purports to establish, among other things, (1) the RPs for the Site, (2)\n\nthe existence of a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or solid waste, and (3)\n\nthat there is an imminent and substantial endangerment. It then orders the RPs to reimburse the\n\nTCEQ for all costs related to the RI/FS, to reimburse the TCEQ's past and future costs in some\n\nunspecified amount, to undertake remedial activities based on the Remedy Selection Document,\n\nand to provide post-construction financial assurance, among other responsibilities. The Order\n\nalso asserts that stipulated penalties accrue for failure to comply with the Order or its deadlines.\n\nThe Order does not specify the amount of the TCEQ costs, or explain why they are reasonable or\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 9\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                         12\n\fappropriate or why the TCEQ's actions were necessary or appropriate. Rather, the Order states\n\nthat the RPs will receive at some time in the future a demand letter from the TCEQ stating the\n\namount owed. As authority for the Order, the Commission cites to the Texas Health and Safety\n\nCode, Chapter 361, §§ 361.188 (Final Administrative Order) and 361.272 (Administrative\n\nOrders Concerning Imminent and Substantial Endangerment).\n\n        30.        Westland operated a lubricating oil blending and packaging facility in Shreveport,\n\nLouisiana.       This was not a manufacturing plant per se, and did not operate processes that\n\ngenerated waste streams of used or waste oils. Westland, at times referenced by the name of its\n\nparent Specialty, sent unused lubricating oil to Yoda Petroleum in order to have it dewatered.\n\nThe oil was then returned to Westland and sold to others. Some of the oil may have been sold by\n\nYoda to others after dewatering. The Westland lubricating oil is excluded from the definition of\n\nhazardous substance under CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9601(14) and the Texas SWDA (Chapter 361\n\nof the Health and Safety Code), Tex. Health & Safety Code § 361.003(11). This material does\n\nnot constitute a solid waste under §361.003(34) of the Health and Safety Code as it was never\n\ndiscarded. Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, it could be considered a \"waste,\" the valuable\n\nmaterial sent from the Westland/Specialty facility to Yoda qualifies for exclusions under federal\n\nand state law from the definition of \"solid waste\" including, e.g., the exclusion for commercial\n\nchemical products at 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 335.1(133) (D) (iii) and 40 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) (3).\n\nFor these reasons, EPA did not seek a settlement from or pursue a claim against Westland Oil or\n\nits parent Specialty Oil. TCEQ has recognized both the referenced petroleum exclusion and the\n\nexemptions from the solid waste definitions in many regulatory contexts and similar factual\n\nsituations.      Shell Oil Company sent no materials to Yoda.       A Shell branded service station\n\noperated by an independent dealer reportedly sent a single shipment of material to Yoda.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 10\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          13\n\f        31.      Mobil Oil Corporation reportedly sold and sent paraffin or wax material to Yoda\n\nPetroleum. The material was food grade quality for use in food packaging. It was sent to Yoda\n\nbecause it was off specification, but it was not contaminated. This material had commercial\n\nvalue and was petroleum based.       Neither Exxon Mobil nor Mobil Oil sent materials to Yoda\n\nfrom gasoline service stations. Service stations branded Exxon or Mobil, on information and\n\nbelief operated by independent dealers, reportedly sent material to Yoda.\n\n        32.      Warren Petroleum reportedly sold and sent used lubricating oil to Yoda for\n\nreclaiming. Texaco Chemical Company reportedly sold and sent to Yoda certain materials from\n\na facility in Texas. Chevron USA Inc., Texaco Inc., Texaco Chemical, and Warren Petroleum did\n\nnot send materials to Yoda from gasoline service stations. Two Texaco branded stations, on\n\ninformation and belief operated by independent dealers, reportedly sent material to Yoda.\n\n                                                 v.\n                                             DENIAL\n\n        33.      Plaintiffs demand TCEQ meet its burden of proof that the Site constitutes an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment and that Plaintiffs are liable for Site-related\n\nenvironmental remediation and/or associated costs as required in § 361.322(g) of the Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code.\n\n        34.      Plaintiffs deny that they have caused or contributed to the alleged release or\n\nthreatened release of any solid waste or hazardous substances from or at the Site that are causing\n\nor contributing to alleged environmental contamination at the Site.\n\n        35.      Plaintiffs deny that they have committed acts or omissions which have resulted in\n\nany release or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous substances from or at the Site.\n\n        36.      Plaintiffs deny that they are a PRP or a RP as defined in the Order.

Further, Plaintiffs were given no\n\nopportunity to challenge or rebut this \"evidence\" in violation of their due process and other legal\n\nrights.\n\n          37.    Plaintiffs deny that they sent hazardous substances or solid wastes to the Site as\n\ndefined by relevant law.\n\n          38.    Plaintiffs deny that the contamination at the Site constitutes an \"actual or\n\nthreatened release of solid waste that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the\n\npublic health and safety or the environment\" as required to support Order issuance by Texas\n\nHealth & Safety Code § 361.272(a) and § 361.188(a) (1).           The definition of imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment as defined in the TCEQ's rules at 30 Texas Administrative Code §\n\n335.342 is as follows: \"[a] danger is imminent if, given the entire circumstances surrounding\n\neach case, exposure of persons or the environment to hazardous substances is more likely than\n\nnot to occur in the absence of preventive action. A danger is substantial if, given the current state\n\nof scientific knowledge, the harm to public health and safety or the environment which would\n\nresult from exposure could cause adverse environmental or health effects.\" Plaintiffs deny that\n\nthis Site met this standard at the time the Order was issued because, among other things:\n\n          a.     Exposure of persons or the environment to hazardous substances was not \"more\n\n                 likely than not\" because EPA' s contractor's assessment found that the 1997 EPA\n\n                 removal action had minimized the threat of direct human contact and inhalation\n\n                 threats that may have been present pre-removal, residual contamination was\n\n                 covered with clean soil and grass; and the Site was fenced to preclude public\n\n                 access;\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 12\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          15\n\f        b.       TCEQ's 2009 Remedy Selection Document at p. 3-4, states that the Site is not a\n\n                 threat to ecological resources because there are insignificant ecological exposure\n\n                 pathways at the Site;\n\n        c.       Exposure from contaminated groundwater is not likely, due to gradient direction\n\n                 and plume stability data provided to TCEQ documenting that constituents of\n\n                 concern have not continued to migrate and in fact may be attenuating\n\n                 significantly;\n\n        d.       TCEQ's 2009 Remedy Selection Document at p. 2 acknowledges that the EPA\n\n                 response action \"removed the immediate threat to human health and the\n\n                 environment\";\n\n        e.       Upon information and belief, although TCEQ has studied the Site, the TCEQ has\n\n                 not taken any remedial actions to protect humans or the environment from\n\n                 potential exposure pathways from 1997 until the present, including a three year\n\n                 period between the EPA removal action and the TCEQ proposed listing on the\n\n                 State Superfund Registry and an eight year RI/FS period.\n\n        39.      Plaintiffs deny that proper statutory notice of the RI/FS was given to many of the\n\nPRPs, and thus deny that the Order is reasonable.\n\n        40.      Plaintiffs deny that the Order is supported by the preponderance of the evidence\n\nas to the TCEQ's claims of necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of past and future\n\ninvestigations and remedial and removal costs incurred by the TCEQ. This includes the TCEQ\n\ndeterminations related to imminent and substantial endangerment.\n\n        41.      Plaintiffs deny that materials they are alleged to have sent to the Site have caused\n\nor contributed to the remedial activities ordered to be conducted by the TCEQ in the Order.\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 13\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          16\n\f        42.      Plaintiffs deny that they are liable for remedial actions or costs associated with\n\nthe Southwest Tank Farm, also known as Ultra Oil.\n\n        43.      Plaintiffs deny they are \"arrangers\" for purposes of liability under the Texas Solid\n\nWaste Disposal Act, based on the Supreme Court ruling in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe\n\nRailway Co., et al. v. United States (\"BNSF\") as the requisite intent was not present.\n\n        44.      Plaintiffs deny that they can be liable for the actions of an independent service\n\nstation dealer, even assuming arguendo that the dealer sent materials to the Yoda site.\n\n        45.      In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that they are no more than de minimis\n\ncontributors to any contamination at the Site.\n\n        46.      Plaintiffs contend that any contribution from them to the site is divisible, and they\n\nare not subject to joint and several liability.\n\n        47.      For all the reasons stated in this Petition, the Plaintiffs deny that the Order is\n\nreasonable and therefore it must be overturned pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code §\n\n361.32l(e).\n\n                                              VI.\n                                        ORDER IS INVALID\n\n        48.      The Order lacks finality because it requires additional, discretionary actions by\n\nthe TCEQ. Specifically, the Order requires the TCEQ to make discretionary decisions in the\n\nfuture about the eligibility, necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of past and future\n\nTCEQ costs to be paid by Plaintiffs as RPs, and even the amount of those costs. Accordingly,\n\nthe Order is neither effective nor enforceable against any Plaintiff, and is of no legal effect.\n\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment recognizing that the Order is of no legal effect.\n\n        49.      At no time prior to the issuance of the Order did the TCEQ afford Plaintiffs an\n\nopportunity for an adjudicative hearing as to their status as a PRP. As a result, Plaintiffs have\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                               Page 14\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                           17\n\fhad no opportunity to protect their interests before being adversely affected by the actions taken\n\nby the authority of the Order.         The Order violates due process rights afforded by the U. S\n\nConstitution (u.s.   CONST.   art. XIV) and Texas Constitution (TEX. CONST. art. I, § 19).\n\n        50.      The Order further violates Plaintiffs' United States and Texas due process rights\n\nbecause it does not afford Plaintiffs' the opportunity for an adjudicative hearing as to the\n\nnecessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of past and future investigation and remedial\n\ncosts incurred by the TCEQ for which it seeks a reimbursement. As a result, Plaintiffs have had\n\nno opportunity to protect their interests before being adversely affected by the actions taken by\n\nthe authority of the Order. At no time prior to the issuance of the Order were the Plaintiffs\n\nafforded an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or\n\nthreatened release is divisible pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.276. As a result,\n\nPlaintiffs have had no opportunity to protect their interests before being adversely affected by the\n\nactions taken by the authority of the Order.\n\n        51.      The Order imposes liability on certain Plaintiffs who are in the same position as\n\nother entities who were released by the TCEQ from liability under the so-called \"petroleum\n\nexclusion\" exception of CERCLA. This is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and violates\n\nthe equal protection clauses of both the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n\n        52.      The Order constitutes an ultra vires act by the TCEQ and/or the Commissioners\n\non several grounds, including the following:\n\n              a. The Order is not properly limited m scope as contemplated by the vanous\n\n                 applicable statutory provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code, such as\n\n                 §§ 361.19l(d) and 361.192, both of which limit the TCEQ's recovery to\n\n                 \"reasonable\" costs.\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                             Page 15\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                         18\n\f            b. The Order names many Plaintiffs who did not receive the required statutory notice\n\n                 (referred to previously as the No-Notice PRPs) that was provided to some of the\n\n                 named RPs via the November 6, 2000, Notice of Opportunity to Make a Good\n\n                 Faith Offer for the RI/FS. Texas Health & Safety Code§§ 361.184(b) and .185\n\n                 require the TCEQ to make \"all reasonable efforts\" to identify PRPs and to provide\n\n                 identified PRPs with written notice of an opportunity to make a Good Faith Offer\n\n                 to fund or perform the RI/FS. While the TCEQ did send correspondence to some\n\n                 of the PRPs seeking a good faith offer to fund or perform the RI/FS, on\n\n                 information and belief, approximately 150 companies (or close to 50% of the\n\n                 PRPs), including the No Notice Plaintiffs, did not receive an opportunity to make\n\n                 a good faith offer, even though the TCEQ has acknowledged that it had in its\n\n                 actual possession records containing the names of those companies as allegedly\n\n                 shipping materials to the Site. The TCEQ did not undertake the minimal effort of\n\n                 reviewing the documents in its possession to make a list of those companies and\n\n                 include them as recipients of the November 6, 2000 Notice and thus allow them\n\n                 an opportunity to participate in the RI/FS process.       This defect impacts the\n\n                 Plaintiffs in two significant ways. First, the TCEQ unilaterally performed the\n\n                 RI/FS over a period of almost eight years, incurred costs, and is now seeking\n\n                 reimbursement of those costs from those it failed to properly notify. Second, the\n\n                 RI/FS process is so fundamental to the remedy selection process that a flaw in the\n\n                 RI/FS process unavoidably and profoundly taints the remedy process. The Texas\n\n                 Health & Safety Code creates a statutory scheme in which the culmination of the\n\n                 RI/FS process -- the proposed remedy -- is what serves as the basis for the\n\n                 Remedy Order. The TCEQ's RI/FS Notice defect means that approximately 50%\n\n                 of the identifiable PRPs at this Site had no opportunity to participate in the RI/FS\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 16\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          19\n\f                 process through public comments or otherwise.           Had all of the PRPs been\n\n                 properly notified and allowed to participate in the development and evaluation of\n\n                 the alternative remedies, a remedy significantly different from the one chosen by\n\n                 the TCEQ could have been studied, selected and implemented in an agreed\n\n                 manner by the parties. The failure to comply with the fundamental statutory\n\n                 notice requirements related to the RI/FS Notice thus renders the Order invalid,\n\n                 arbitrary, and unreasonable, and outside the scope of the TCEQ's statutory\n\n                 authority.\n\n            c. The Order is invalid because the remedy selected does not comply with the\n\n                 standards found in Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.193 and .322(h). Section\n\n                 361.193 states that the TCEQ is required to select the \"lowest cost alternative that\n\n                 is technologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and\n\n                 minimizes damage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and\n\n                 safety or the environment.\"   TEX. HEAL TH   & SAFETY CODE § 361.193.\n\n\n                     1.   The TCEQ has classified the groundwater at the Site to be Class I\n\n                          groundwater, when in fact it should be Class II. If the proper classification\n\n                          had been used by the TCEQ, the appropriate remedy for this Site would\n\n                          very likely have been the lowest cost alternative that is technologically\n\n                          feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes damage\n\n                          to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the\n\n                          environment. The most recent data acquired from the Site indicates that\n\n                          an alternative remedy would be appropriate because the groundwater\n\n                          plume boundary has not grown and the concentrations of the constituents\n\n                          of concern identified by the TCEQ have actually decreased over time.\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                Page 17\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                            20\n\f                    11.   Effective on May 25, 2007, the Municipal Settings Designation (\"MSD\")\n\n                          statute was amended to allow small municipalities to have the benefit of\n\n                          the MSD certification. The MSD statute allows municipalities to enforce\n\n                          specific deed restrictions on properties within their city limits restricting\n\n                          the use of the groundwater beneath the property so that it cannot be used\n\n                          as drinking water. The deed restriction acts as an institutional control to\n\n                          protect human health, but at a fraction of the costs of a groundwater\n\n                          remediation plan. The Site is within the City of Clarksville and thus is\n\n                          potentially eligible for an MSD. The MSD is recognized by statute to be\n\n                          protective of human health and the environment. No statute or regulation\n\n                          prohibits the application of an MSD at a state Superfund Site.           The\n\n                          Feasibility Study was issued in January of 2008 and the Remedy Selection\n\n                          Document was issued in June 2008. Neither document even evaluated the\n\n                          MSD option, which at that point in time was certainly available for\n\n                          consideration and which could very well be the lowest cost remedy for\n\n                          groundwater at the Site.    Thus, the TCEQ's Order is invalid in that it\n\n                          selects a remedy that is arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore cannot be\n\n                          upheld pursuant to Texas Health and Safety Code§ 361.323(h).\n\n            d. Plaintiffs have asserted previously in this Petition that the Order violates certain\n\n                 of the Plaintiffs' constitutional equal protection rights because the TCEQ relieved\n\n                 certain PRPs, but not others similarly situated, from liability based on the\n\n                 \"petroleum exclusion.\" Without waiving that argument, Plaintiffs alternatively\n\n                 assert that, if the released PRPs are not entitled to the petroleum exclusion, those\n\n                 PRPs must be named in the Order as an RP and that TCEQ's failure to do so is\n\n                 arbitrary and capricious to the severe detriment of Plaintiffs. Section 361.188\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                                Page 18\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                            21\n\f                 (a)(4) and (6) of the Texas Health & Safety Code states that that final\n\n                 administrative order must list the Responsible Parties and order the Responsible\n\n                 Parties to remediate the facility and reimburse the TCEQ's RI/FS costs. Nothing\n\n                 in that statutory provision allows the TCEQ to ignore certain otherwise\n\n                 Responsible Parties.     In fact, § 361.1875 states exactly when the TCEQ can\n\n                 exclude certain PRPs from liability associated with a Site, and none of the\n\n                 particular exclusions apply here. The Order is invalid for failure to name all RPs.\n\n              e. The TCEQ's unilateral order of the payment of stipulated penalties is beyond the\n\n                 authority of the TCEQ.\n\n        53.      The Order is invalid under § 361.188(a)(l) because it does not present an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment as needed to support listing on the State Superfund\n\nRegistry. There is no evidence of imminent and substantial endangerment. Any imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment was abated by the 1996 EPA' s removal action.\n\n        54.      The Order should be deemed invalid as to Plaintiffs because the TCEQ did not\n\notherwise properly carry out its statutory and regulatory duties to fully investigate and identify\n\nPRPs, RPs, and de minimis parties prior to naming Plaintiffs as RPs.\n\n        55.      For all of the reasons previously stated in this Petition, the Order is invalid,\n\narbitrary, and unreasonable pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code§ 361.32l(e).\n\n                                             VII.\n                                     AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n        56.      Certain Plaintiffs contributed materials to the Site that are the same as those\n\nmaterials contributed by entities that have been released by the TCEQ pursuant to the \"Petroleum\n\nExclusion\" and thus are also entitled to such a release.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                              Page 19\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                          22\n\f        57.      Even if Plaintiffs had contributed any materials to the Site, those materials were\n\nsold as a useful product, and did not constitute an arrangement for the processing, storing, or\n\ndisposal of a solid waste, and did not contribute to the release or threatened release to the\n\nenvironment.\n\n        58.      Westland Oil's unused lube oil was a petroleum material and a valuable\n\ncommercial product intended to be dehydrated by Yoda and sold, and/or returned to Westland\n\nfor sale to its customers, and thus the oil was neither a \"solid waste\" nor a \"hazardous\n\nsubstance.\"\n\n        59.      ExxonMobil discharged all or part of any Yoda site responsibility through its\n\nsettlement with and payments to EPA Further, the Mobil paraffin was handled at a specific\n\narea of the Yoda site and was addressed by the EPA removal action. Any harm or liability\n\nattributable to Exxon Mobil or Mobil is therefore capable of being apportioned.\n\n        60.      Plaintiffs' materials, to the extent any were sent to Yoda, are distinct from those\n\nchemicals causing the harm that is being addressed under TCEQ's AO. Therefore, any liability\n\nof Plaintiffs' must be apportioned and limited to the harm attributable to their materials at the\n\nYoda site.\n\n        61.      Plaintiffs did not intend for waste or hazardous substances to be disposed of at the\n\nSite.\n\n        62.      Plaintiffs assert that they are not RPs, but in the alternative assert they are no\n\nmore than a de minimis contributor to any contamination at the Site.\n\n        63.      Plaintiffs are not liable for remedial actions or costs associated with the Southwest\n\nTank Farm, also known as Ultra Oil.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's First Amended Petition\n                                                                                               Page 20\nA-230571 4.DOC                                                                                           23\n\f        64.      The evidence demonstrates that the Site does not pose an imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment.\n\n        65.      The TCEQ failed to provide the required notices necessary to support recovery of\n\ninvestigation costs from the PRPs.\n\n        66.      The facts do not support listing the Site on the State Superfund registry or the use\n\nof the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act to impose liability upon Plaintiffs.\n\n        67.      In the alternative, even if Plaintiffs contributed solid waste or hazardous\n\nsubstances to the Site, the costs are subject to apportionment under the Texas Health and Safety\n\nCode§ 361.276.\n\n                                                VIII.\n                                     COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES\n\n        68.      Plaintiffs have had to employ legal counsel to contest the Order. TCEQ is liable\n\nfor Plaintiffs' reasonable attorney's fees and reasonable costs pursuant to the TUDJA and Texas\n\nHealth & Safety Code§ 361.342.\n\n                                                    IX.\n                                            JURY DEMAND\n\n        69.      Plaintiffs request a jury as the trier of fact for this matter.\n\n                                                     x.\n                                                PRAYER\n\n        70.      WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the TCEQ be cited to appear and answer and\n\nthat the TCEQ be required to prove its allegations against Plaintiffs by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence and that the Court on final trial enter an order:\n\n        a.

(See Ex. B to Attach. 1).\n\n     4.2.    The Site has been proposed for listing on the State Registry of Superfund\n\nSites. 25 Tex. Reg. 11594 (Nov. 17, 2000). When ranked, the Site had a hazard ranking\n\nscore of 23.6, as specified in 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE§ 335.343. The Order required certain\n\npotentially responsible parties to reimburse the Hazardous and Solid Waste Remedia-\n\ntion Fee Account for all costs incurred by the TCEQ for the remedial investigation\n\n(\"RI\"), feasibility study (\"FS\"), and oversight of these activities. In addition, the Order\n\nrequired certain parties to reimburse the Hazardous and Solid Waste Fee Account for\n\nall uncompensated Pre-Remedial Investigation costs, including oversight and other\n\ncosts.\n\n     4.3.    The State adopts the allegations, findings and conclusions of the Order herein\n\nby reference.\n\n\n     1\n         For further description and current status, see:\nhttp://www. tceg .state. tx. us/remediation/superfund/state/voda.html.\n\n                                                 33\n\n\n\n                                                                                              159\n\f     4.4.     The Counter-Defendants listed in subsec. 2.B, above, or their predecessors,\n\nwere named as responsible parties in the Order and appealed the Order.\n\n     4.5.     The Third-Party Defendants listed in subsec. 2.C, above, or their predeces-\n\nsors, were named as responsible parties in the Order. These parties received copies of\n\nthe Order with a certified forwarding letter, as shown on Attach. 2, but failed to appeal\n\nwithin the time specified by law. Accordingly, the Order is now final and unappealable\n\nas to them.\n\n     4.6.     The Third-Party Defendants listed in subsec. 2.D, above, were not named in\n\nthe Order. Their liability arises as a matter of law and they are joined herein pursuant to\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.323 (\"the attorney general shall, and a party may,\n\njoin as a party a person reasonably believed to be liable .... \").\n\n     4.7.     To date the TCEQ has spent more than $1,750,000 on pre-remedial and\n\nremoval actions, the RI/FS, and remedial action. The TCEQ anticipates that total\n\nresponse costs will exceed $2,100,000.\n\n     4.8.     Now the State seeks to recover the costs of its remedial investigation,\n\nfeasibility study, removal action, remedial design and remedial action at the Site, plus\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees. The State specifically reserves all claims for natural resource\n\ndamages.\n\n\n\n\n                                               34\n\n\n\n                                                                                              160\n\f                   5.   CAUSE OF ACTION FOR COST RECOVERY\n\n     5.1.   The chemicals of concern found in the soil and sediment at the Site (see\n\nAttach. 1, Ex. B) were \"hazardous substances,\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§ 361.003(11) or \"solid wastes\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE §§ 361.003(34)(B) and 361.271.\n\n     5.2.   Each hazardous substance, waste or contaminant found at the Site was a\n\n\"discarded material\" and thus a \"solid waste\" within the meaning of TEX. HEAL TH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§§ 361.003(34) and 361.271.\n\n     5.3.   The release of hazardous substances, waste and contaminants at the Site was\n\na discharging, depositing, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of solid waste into or\n\non land or water, so that the solid waste or a constituent thereof might be emitted into\n\nthe air, discharged into surface water or groundwater, or introduced into the environ-\n\nment in another manner, and was thus a \"disposal\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH\n\n& SAFETY CODE§ 361.003(7) and 361.133.\n\n     5.4.   The Site was a site \"at which solid waste or hazardous substances have been\n\ndisposed\" of, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.133(c).\n\n     5.5.   The Site was a tract of land on which solid waste was disposed of, and thus\n\nwas a \"solid waste facility\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n\n§§ 361.003(36) and 361.271.\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\n\n\n                                                                                           161\n\f     5.6.     Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant is a \"person\" within the\n\nmeaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§§ 361.003(23) and 361.271.\n\n     5.7.     Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant owned or operated a\n\nsolid waste facility at the Site at the time of processing, storage or disposal of solid\n\nwaste; or arranged to process, store, or dispose of solid waste at the facility; or accepted\n\nsolid waste for transport to a facility; and is thus a \"person responsible for solid waste\"\n\nwithin the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.271(a), and a \"responsible\n\nparty\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.197.\n\n     5.8.     The Counter-Defendants and Third-Party Defendants are responsible parties\n\nwho have not complied with the terms of the Order, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH\n\n& SAFETY CODE§ 361.197(a).\n\n     5.9.     The Counter-Defendants and Third-Party Defendants are therefore \"non-\n\ncompliant parties\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.197(b).\n\n     5.10.     The TCEQ's response action at the Site was a \"remedial action\" or \"re-\n\nmoval\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§§ 361.003(29-30) and\n\n361.133(c).\n\n     5.11.     The funds used by the TCEQ for the response actions were taken from the\n\nHazardous and Solid Waste Remediation Fee Account, established at TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§ 361.133(a).\n\n\n\n                                              36\n\n\n\n                                                                                               162\n\f     5.12.    The funds expended by the TCEQ were for necessary and appropriate\n\nremoval and remedial action at a site where solid waste or hazardous substances had\n\nbeen disposed of, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.133(c)(l).\n\n     5.13.    Funds from a liable person or independent third person were not sufficient\n\nfor the removal or remedial action, within the meaning of TEX. HEAL TH & SAFETY CODE\n\n§ 361.133(c)(l).\n\n     5.14.    Funds from the federal government were not sufficient for the removal or\n\nremedial action, within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.133(c)(l).\n\n     5.15.    Thus, the funds expended by the TCEQ were \"costs of an action taken\n\nunder Section 361.133(c)(l), (2), (3), (5) or (6),\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH &\n\nSAFETY CODE§ 361.197(d).\n\n     5.16.    Accordingly, the TCEQ should have judgment against the Counter-Defen-\n\ndants and Third-Party Defendants for all of its response costs at the Site, as allowed by\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.197(d).\n\n                6.   ACTION TO ENFORCE ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER\n\n     6.1.    Each Third-Party Defendant named in subsec. 2.C, above, failed to appeal the\n\nOrder within 30 days of issuance as required by TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n\n§ 361.321(c), or within 45 days of the date of receipt, hand delivery, or publication\n\nservice as required by TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(a). Thus, the Order is final\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\n\n\n                                                                                            163\n\fand unappealable as to those Third-Party Defendants.\n\n     6.2.   The Order is not \"invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable\" within the meaning of\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.321(e), based upon the substantial evidence rule. See\n\nGerst v. Nixon, 411S.W.2d350, 354 (Tex. 1966).\n\n     6.3.   There was an \"actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous\n\nsubstances\" at the Site that posed an \"imminent and substantial endangerment to the\n\npublic health and safety or the environment,\" and the Counter-Defendants and Third-\n\nParty Defendants were \"liable for the elimination of the release or threatened release, in\n\nwhole or in part,\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(g).\n\n     6.4.   The remedy selected for the Site was not \"arbitrary or unreasonable,\" based\n\nupon the substantial evidence rule. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(h), Gerst,\n\n411 S.W.2d at 354.\n\n     6.5.   Accordingly, the Order should be upheld pursuant to TEX. HEAL TH & SAFETY\n\nCODE§§ 361.321and361.322(g).\n\n     6.6.   Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant should be ordered to\n\ncomply with all the terms and provisions of the Order.\n\n      7.    INJUNCTION AS ALTERNATIVE TO ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER\n\n     7.1.   The Third-Party Defendants listed in subsec. 2.D, above, are \"persons\n\nresponsible for solid waste,\" within the meaning of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\n\n\n                                                                                             164\n\f§§ 361.271 & 361.273.\n\n     7.2.   Accordingly, these Third-Party Defendants should be enjoined to \"provide\n\nand implement a cost effective and environmentally sound remedial action plan\n\ndesigned to eliminate the release or threatened release,\" as required by TEX. HEAL TH &\n\nSAFETY CODE § 361.273(2).\n\n     7.3.   These Third-Party Defendants should be ordered to carry out all the terms\n\nand provisions of the Order.\n\n                         8.    ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS\n\n     8.1.   The TCEQ has incurred reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable costs to\n\nprepare and provide witnesses, and reasonable costs of investigating and assessing the\n\nSite, and asks that these costs and fees be recovered from the Counter-Defendants and\n\nThird-Party Defendants as allowed by TEX. WATER CODE§ 7.108, TEX. Gov'T CODE\n\n§ 402.006(c) and TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.341.\n\n                                      9.   PRAYER\n\n     WHEREFORE, the TCEQ requests that:\n\n     A.     Each Third-Party Defendant be served with citation;\n\n     B.     Each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party Defendant be required to appear\n\nherein and answer this petition within the time specified by law;\n\n     C.     The Court uphold the Order and require each Defendant to comply with all\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\n\n\n                                                                                          165\n\fof its terms and provisions;\n\n     D.    The TCEQ have judgment against all Counter-Defendants and Third-Party\n\nDefendants, jointly and severally, for its costs incurred and to be incurred in responding\n\nto the release or threatened release of solid waste and hazardous substances at the Site,\n\nplus interest at the legal rate until paid;\n\n     E.    The TCEQ have judgment against each Counter-Defendant and Third-Party\n\nDefendant for reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable costs to prepare and provide\n\nwitnesses, and all of its court costs; and\n\n     F.

Shaw, Ph.D., Commissioner Buddy Garcia, Commissioner Carlos\n\nRubinstein, and Commissioner Toby Baker,1 in their official capacities; file this Third\n\nAmended Original Answer, responding to the Second Amended Original Petition filed\n\nby Chevron USA, Inc., et al.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n     ExxonMobil Corporation and Shell Oil Company were among a group of plaintiffs\n\n\n\n     1\n       Commissioner Toby Baker replaced Commissioner Garcia in 2012 and might be\nconsidered to have been substituted into this lawsuit; accordingly he is also listed as a\nrespondent herein.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    675\n\fthat filed their Original Petition in case that was subsequently consolidated into the\n\npresent case. 2 They filed their First Amended Original Petition in that action on March\n\n26, 2010; the TCEQ answered on March 30, 2010. That cause was consolidated with\n\nothers into the present case. See Agreed Order for Consolidation (May 18, 2010). The\n\nTCEQ then filed a counterclaim. See TCEQ's Original Counter-pet. and Third-party Pet.\n\n(Aug. 1, 2011). Subsequently most parties settled their claims with the TCEQ in a\n\nsevered action. 3\n\n     Plaintiffs/Counter-Defendants ExxonMobil Corporation, Mobil Oil Corporation,\n\nPennzoil-Quaker State Company and Shell Oil Company filed an Original Answer\n\n(Aug. 7, 2012), that contained a General Denial and incorporated the affirmative\n\ndefenses from their First Amended Original Petition. The TCEQ then filed 4 a Second\n\nSupplement to Counter-petition and Third-party Petition (Feb. 7, 2013), which corrected\n\nthe name of Mobil Oil Corporation to ExxonMobil Oil Corporation and added Exxon\n\nMobil Corporation to the case. These parties filed a General Denial that, as before,\n\nincorporated the affirmative defenses in the First Amended Original Petition. See\n\n\n\n     2\n         See Chevron USA Inc. v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, No. D-1-GN-10-000793 (419th\nDist. Ct., Travis County, Tex. Mar. 26, 2010).\n\n     3\n         See Agreed Final J., Young Chevrolet, Inc. v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, No. D-1-GN-\n12-002297 (345th Dist. Ct., Travis County, Tex. July 30, 2012).\n\n     4\n       The First Supplement to Counter-petition and Third-party Petition (Oct. 5, 2011) is not\nrelevant here.\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    676\n\fOriginal Answer to Counter-pet. and Third-party Pet. Oune 11, 2013).\n\n     Thus the remaining plaintiffs from the original Chevron USA case, properly\n\nnamed, are Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Pennzoil-Quaker\n\nState Company and Shell Oil Company. The TCEQ and the Commissioners file the\n\nfollowing amended answer to these plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition and also\n\nrespond to their original answers, to the extent those answers incorporate affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n                               II. PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n     A. Request for Declaratory Judgment\n\n     The Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition includes a claim under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (\"UDJA\"), TEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 37.001 et seq.,\n\nseeking a declaration that the TCEQ's Administrative Order (Docket No. 2009-1706-SPF,\n\nentered Feb. 12, 2010) (\"Order\") is invalid or is an ultra vires action by the TCEQ. 5 The\n\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Order \"is of no legal effect\" and seeks\n\ntheir attorney's fees and costs under TEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE§ 37.009. 6\n\n     The court lacks jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' UDJA claim because it seeks a\n\nredundant remedy to that afforded by the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, TEX. HEALTH\n\n\n\n     5\n         See Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet. (No. D-1-GN-10-000793), paras. 8, 48, 52, 68 and 74.\n\n     6\n         See Pl.' s First Am. Orig. Pet. paras. 48, 68 and 74.\n\n                                                    3\n\n\n\n                                                                                               677\n\f& SAFETY CODE § 361.001 et seq. (\"TSWDA\"). The Texas Legislature has defined the sole\n\nmethod for appealing the Order at TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322. The TSWDA\n\nsets forth the burden and method for challenging the remedy detailed in the Order at\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(g)-(h), and also sets forth the burden and means\n\nfor recovering attorneys' fees and costs if the entirety of the Order itself is challenged (to\n\nbe awarded only upon a finding by the Court that the Order is \"frivolous, unreason-\n\nable, or without foundation\").7\n\n     This standard subsumes any assertion that the TCEQ or its Commissioners\n\ncommitted an ultra vires act in issuing the Order. The TSWDA unambiguously sets forth\n\nthe sole means and method for parties seeking to challenge the validity of a Superfund\n\norder, and the sole means and method for parties that are successful in such a challenge\n\nto recover their attorneys' fees and costs.\n\n     When a statute provides a means to attack an administrative agency's order, one\n\n\n     7\n         The Solid Waste Disposal Act provides:\n\n     Sec. 361.342. COST RECOVERY BY APPEALING OR CONTESTING PARTY. If the\n     court finds that an administrative order [of the type relevant here] is frivolous,\n     unreasonable, or without foundation with respect to a party named by the order, the\n     party appealing or contesting the order is entitled to recover from the state its\n     reasonable:\n           (1) attorney's fees;\n           (2) costs to prepare and provide witnesses; and\n           (3) costs of studies, analyses, engineering reports, tests, or other projects the\n     court finds were necessary to prepare the party's case.\n\nTEX. HEALTH   &   SAFETY CODE§   361.342.\n\n                                                  4\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 678\n\fmay not maintain a declaratory judgment action seeking remedies that are merely\n\nredundant with those available from the statute.

XIV) and the Texas Constitution (TEX. CONST. art. I,§ 19) were violated because the\n\nlaw did not \"afford Plaintiffs an opportunity for an adjudicative hearing\" before entry\n\nof the Order, Pl.'s First Am. Orig.

Naming Individuals in Official Capacity\n\n     The Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition names TCEQ Chairman Bryan W.\n\nShaw and Commissioners Buddy Garcia and Carlos Rubinstein, in their official capaci-\n\nties. Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet. paras. 3-5 at 2-3. However, the Plaintiffs have an adequate\n\nstatutory method of appeal against the Commission, not the Commissioners, see TEX.\n\nHEALTH & SAFETY CODE§§ 361.321, 361.322, and they have brought their appeal under\n\nthose sections. See Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet. para. 8 at 3.\n\n     The TSWDA specifically provides that:\n\n     The person appealing the order must join the commission as a party and may\n     join as parties any other person named as a responsible party in the adminis-\n     trative order and any other person who is or may be liable for the elimination\n     of the actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous substances\n     governed by the administrative order.\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(d). This section limits the parties whom the\n\nPlaintiffs may join to their appeal. The individual Commissioners are not included and\n\nare rightfully subsumed within the meaning of \"commission as a party.\" Accordingly,\n\nthe claims against the individual Commissioners are without statutory authority (and as\n\nset forth in II.A., any claim against the Commissioners under the UDJA is redundant\n\nand adds nothing to the Plaintiffs' remedies) and should be struck.\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\n\n                                                                                               680\n\f                               III. PLEA IN ABATEMENT\n\n     Defendants re-allege the matters set forth in their plea to the jurisdiction and assert\n\nthem also as a plea in abatement.\n\n                             IV. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n     Subject to the foregoing plea to the jurisdiction and plea in abatement, Defendants\n\nre-allege the matters set forth in their plea to the jurisdiction and assert them also as\n\naffirmative defenses. Additionally, Defendants assert that:\n\n     •    Plaintiffs' UDJA claim is barred, in whole or in part, by the doctrine of\n\n          sovereign immunity, including both immunity from suit and immunity from\n\n          liability.\n\n     •    The Plaintiffs' request for a declaration under the UDJA that the Order is\n\n          invalid, or is an ultra vires action by the TCEQ or the Commissioners, is not\n\n          within the scope of the actions authorized by the UDJA.\n\n     •    Plaintiffs' claims against TCEQ Chairman Bryan W. Shaw and Commissioners\n\n          Buddy Garcia and Carlos Rubinstein, in their official capacities, are barred, in\n\n          whole or in part, by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, including both\n\n          immunity from suit and immunity from liability.\n\n     •    Plaintiffs' claims against TCEQ Chairman Bryan W. Shaw and Commissioners\n\n          Buddy Garcia and Carlos Rubinstein, in their official capacities, are not within\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\n\n\n                                                                                               681\n\f            the scope of the action provided in Section 361.322 of the Texas Health &\n\n             Safety Code.\n\n                                    V. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n     Defendants specially except to the Plaintiffs' attempt to impose a burden of proof\n\nand a standard of review not contemplated by the TSWDA. Plaintiffs assert that TCEQ\n\nand/or its Commissioners committed an ultra vires act or acts in issuing this Superfund\n\nOrder. 8 However, the TSWDA clearly sets forth the burden of proof and standards of\n\nreview for appeals of Superfund orders, as follows:\n\n     The district court shall uphold the administrative order if the commission\n     proves by a preponderance of the evidence that:\n          (1) there is an actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous\n     substances that is an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public\n     health and safety or the environment; and\n          (2) the person made subject to the administrative order is liable for the\n     elimination of the release or threatened release, in whole or in part.\n\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 361.322(g) (emphasis added). For parties challenging the\n\n\"appropriateness of the selected remedial action ... in the appeal of the administrative\n\norder, the remedial action shall be upheld unless the court determines that the remedy\n\nis arbitrary or unreasonable.\" Id. § 361.322(h) (emphasis added). Finally, a party challeng-\n\ning the administrative order as a whole may establish that it is \"frivolous, unreasonable, or\n\nwithout foundation with respect to a party named by the order.\" Id.§ 361.342 (emphasis\n\n\n\n     8\n         See Pl.s' First Am. Orig. Pet., paras. 8, 48, 52, 68 and 74.\n\n                                                     8\n\n\n\n                                                                                                682\n\fadded). The TSWDA does not contemplate any other burdens or standards of review\n\nfor challenges to Superfund Orders.\n\n     Therefore, the standard of review in the appeal of this Order is not whether the\n\nTCEQ committed an ultra vires act, but whether:\n\n          (a) TCEQ can prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the two factors\n\n     listed in§ 361.322(g)(l) and (2);\n\n          (b) Plaintiffs can show that the selection of the remedy by TCEQ was arbitrary\n\n     or unreasonable; or\n\n          (c) Plaintiffs can show that the Order as a whole is \"frivolous, unreasonable,\n\n     or without foundation with respect to a party named by the order.\" Id.§ 361.342.\n\nPlaintiffs' attempts to change these standards of review and burdens (in particular in\n\nthe allegations stated in para. 52 in Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition) are\n\nwithout merit and must be stricken or properly amended.\n\n                                 VI.

A permit may not be transferred without prior notice\nto and prior approval by the state agency which issued it.\n    (6) The state agency has the authority, for good cause, after hearing\nwith notice to the permittee and to the governmental entities named in\nParagraph (1) of this Subsection (e), to revoke or amend any permit it\nissues for reasons pertaining to public health, air or water pollution, land\nuse, or violation of this Act or of any other applicable laws or regulations\ncontrolling the disposal of solid waste.\n    (f) This subsection applies to the collection, handl:lng, storage, and\ndisposal of industrial solid waste which is disposed of within the property\nboundaries of a tract of land owned and controlled by the owners or\noperators of the particular industrial plant, manufacturing plant, mining\noperation, or agricultural operation from which the waste results or is\nproduced, and which tract of land is within 50 miles from the plant or\noperation which is the source of the industrial solid waste.

The board\nmay not require a permit under this Act for the disposal of any solid\nwaste to which this subsection applies, but this does not change or limit\nany authority the board may have with respect to the requirement of\npermits, the control of water quality, or otherwise, under the Texas Water\nQuality Act. However, the board may adopt rules and regulations as\nprovided under Subsection (c) of this section to govern and control the\ncollection, handling, storage, and disposal of the industrial solid waste\nto which this subsection applies so as to protect the property of others,\npublic property and rights-of-way, groundwater, and other rights requir-\ning protection. The board may require a person who disposes or plans to\ndispose of industrial solid waste under the authority of this subsection to\nsubmit to the board such information as may be reasonably required to\nenable the board, or the executive director of the board when so author-\nized by the board, to determine whether in the judgment of the board or\nthe executive director the waste disposal activity is one to which this\nsubsection applies.\n    (g) The state agencies may, either individually or jointly:\n    (1) provide educational, advisory, and technical services to other agen-\ncies of the state, regional planning agencies, local governments, special\ndistricts, institutions, and individuals with respect to solid waste man-\nagement and control, including collection, storage, handling and dis-\nposal;\n    (2) assist other agencies of the state, regional planning agencies, local\ngovernments, special districts, and institutions in acquiring federal grants\nfor the development of solid waste facilities and management programs,\nand for research to improve the state of the art; and\n    (3) accept funds from the federal government for purposes relating\nto solid waste management, and to expend money received from the federal\ngovernment for those purposes in the manner prescribed by law and in\naccordance with such agreements as may be necessary and appropriate\nbetween the federal government and each state agency.\n                                    1323\n\fCh. 405       61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n    If a state agency engages in any of the programs and activities named\nin this subsection on an individual basis, it may do so only as the partici-\npation by that state agency is related to the management and control of\nthe solid waste over which it has jurisdiction. When the state agencies do\nnot participate jointly, they shall coordinate on any efforts undertaken by\neither one individually so that similar programs and activities of the state\nagencies will be compatible.\n    (h) The state agencies are authorized to administer and expend state\nfunds provided to them by legislative appropriations, or otherwise, for\nthe purpose of making grants to local governments for solid waste plan-\nning, the installation of solid waste facilities, and the administration of\nsolid waste programs. The grants made under the terms of this Act\nshall be distributed in a manner determined by the state agency to whom\nthe appropriation is made. Any financial assistance granted by the state\nthrough either of the state agencies to any local government under the\nterms of this Act must, at a minimum, be equally matched by local gov-\nernment funds.\n    Sec. 5. (a) Every county has the solid waste management powers\nwhich are enumerated in this Section 5. However, the exercise of the\nlicensing authority and other powers granted to counties by this Act\ndoes not preclude the department or the board from exercising any of\nthe powers vested in the department or the board under other provisions\nof this Act, including specifically the provisions authorizing the depart-\nment and the board to issue permits for the operation and maintenance\nof sites for the disposal of solid waste. The powers specified in Sub-\nsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section may not be exercised by a county\nwith respect to the industrial solid waste disposal practices and areas\nto which Subsection (f) of Section 4 of this Act applies. The department\nor the board, by specific action or directive, may supersede any authority\nor power granted to or exercised by a county under this Act, but only\nwith respect to those matters which are, under this Act, within the juris-\ndiction of the state agency acting.\n    (b) A county is authorized to appropriate and expend money from\nits general revenues for the collection, handling, storage and disposal\nof solid waste and for administering a solid waste program; and to\ncharge reasonable fees for the services.\n    (c) A county may develop county solid waste plans and coordinate\nthose plans with the plans of local governments, regional planning agen-\ncies, other governmental entities, the department, and the board.\n    (d) Except as provided in Subsection (a) of this section, a county\nis empowered to require and issue licenses authorizing and governing\nthe operation and maintenance of sites used for the disposal of solid\nwaste in areas not within the territorial limits of incorporated cities\nand towns. If this power is exercised, the county shall prescribe the form\nof and reasonable requirements for the license application and the pro-\ncedures to be followed in processing the application, to the extent not\notherwise provided for in this subsection. The following additional\nprovisions apply if a county exercises the power authorized in this Sub-\nsection ( d) :\n    (1) The county shall mail a copy of the license application or a sum-\nmary of its contents to the department, the board, and the Texas Air\nControl Board, and to the mayor and health authorities of any city\nwithin whose extraterritorial jurisdiction the solid waste disposal site\nis located. The governmental entities to whom the information is mailed\nshall have a reasonable time, as prescribed by the county, to submit\n                                   1324\n\f              61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                     Ch. 405\ncomments and recommendations on the license application before the\ncounty acts on the application,\n    (2) A separate license shall be issued for each site. The license shall\ninclude the names and addresses of the person who owns the land where\nthe waste disposal site is located and the person who is or will be the\noperator or person in charge of the site; a legal description of the land on\nwhich the site is located; and the terms and conditions on which the\nlicense is issued, including the duration of the license. The county is\nauthorized to charge a fee for a license of not to exceed $100.00, as set by\nthe commissioners court of the county. Receipts from the fees shall be\nplaced in the general revenue fund of the county.\n    (3) The county may extend or renew any license it issues in accord-\nance with reasonable procedures prescribed by the county, The proce-\ndures prescribed in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection (d) apply also to\napplications to extend or renew a license.\n    (4) No license for the use of a site for disposal of solid waste may be\nissued, renewed, or extended without the prior approval, as appropriate,\nof the department or the board, or the executive director of the board\nwhen so authorized by the board. If a license is issued, renewed, or\nextended by a county in accordance with this Subsection (d), the owner\nor operator of the site does not need to obtain a permit from the depart-\nment or the board for the same site.\n    (5) A license is issued in personam and does not attach to the realty\nto which it relates. A license may not be transferred without prior notice\nto and prior approval by the county which issued it.\n    (6) The county has the authority, for good cause, after hearing with\nnotice to the licensee and to the governmental entities named in Para-\ngraph (1) of this Subsection (d), to revoke or amend any license it issues\nfor reasons pertaining to public health, air or water pollution, land use,\nor violation of this Act or of any other applicable laws or regulations\ncontrolling the disposal of solid waste. For like reasons, the department\nand the board each may, for good cause, after hearing with notice to the\nlicensee, the county which issued the license, and the other governmental\nentities named in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection (d), revoke or amend\nany license issued by a county, but only as to those sites which fall, under\nthe terms of this Act, within the jurisdiction of the state agency acting.\n    ( e) Subject to the limitation specified in Subsection (a) of this sec-\ntion, a county may designate land areas not within the territorial limits\nof incorporated cities and towns as suitable for use as solid waste dis-\nposal sites. The county shall base these designations on the principles of\npublic health, safety, and welfare, including proper land use, compliance\nwith state statutes, the reasonable projections of growth and development\nfor any city or town within whose extraterritorial jurisdiction the land\narea may be located, and any other pertinent considerations.\n    (f) A county is authorized to enforce the requirements of this Act and\nthe rules and regulations promulgated by the department and the board as\nrelated to the handling of solid waste.\n    (g) Subject to the limitation prescribed in Subsection (a) of this\nsection, a county, acting through its commissioners court, may make reg-\nulations for the areas of the county not within the territorial limits of\nincorporated cities and towns to provide for governing and controlling\nsolid waste collection, handling, storage and disposal. The regulations\nshall not authorize any activity, method of operation or procedure which\nis prohibited by this Act or by the rules and regulations of the department\nor the board. The county shall not, in its regulations, under the licensing\n                                   1325\n\fCh. 405       61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\npower granted in this Act, or otherwise, prohibit the use of a site within\nthe county for the disposal of solid waste on the basis that the solid waste\noriginates outside that county, or impose any unreasonable requirements\non the disposal of such solid waste in the county not warranted by the\ncircumstances. The county may institute legal proceedings to enforce its\nregulations.\n    (h) A county may enter into cooperative agreements with local gov-\nernments and other governmental entities for the purpose of the joint\noperation of solid waste collection, handling, storage and disposal fa-\ncilities, and to charge reasonable fees for the services.\n    Sec. 6. This section applies to a political subdivision of the state\nwhich has jurisdiction over two or more counties or parts of two or more\ncounties, and which has been granted the power by the Legislature to\nregulate solid waste handling or disposal practices or activities within\nits jurisdiction. The governing body of such a political subdivision may,\nby formal resolution, assume for the political subdivision the exclusive\nauthority to exercise, within the area subject to its jurisdiction, the powers\ngranted in this Act to a county, to the exclusion of the exercise of the same\npowers by the counties otherwise having jurisdiction over the area. In\nthe exercise of these powers the political subdivision is subject to the\nsame duties, limitations and restrictions applicable to counties under this\nAct. When a political subdivision assumes this authority, it shall also\nserve as the coordinator of solid waste handling and disposal practices\nand activities for all cities, counties and other governmental entities with-\nin its jurisdiction which have solid waste disposal regulatory powers or\nengage in solid waste handling or disposal practices or activities. Once\na political subdivision assumes the authority granted in this section, it\nis empowered to and shall exercise the authority so long as the resolution\nof the political subdivision remains in effect.\n    Sec. 7. The authorized agents or employees of the department, the\nboard, and local governments have the right to enter at all reasonable\ntimes in or upon any property, whether public or private, within the gov-\nernmental entity's jurisdiction, including in the case of an incorporated\ncity or town its extraterritorial jurisdiction, for the purpose of inspecting\nand investigating conditions relating to solid waste management and\ncontrol. Agents and employees shall not enter private property having\nmanagement in residence without notifying the management, or the\nperson in charge at the time, of their presence and exhibiting proper\ncredentials. The agents and employees shall observe the rules and regu-\nlations of the establishment being inspected concerning safety, internal\nsecurity, and fire protection.\n    Sec. 8. (a) No person may cause, suffer, allow or permit the col-\nlection, storage, handling or disposal of solid waste, or the use or opera-\ntion of a site for the disposal of solid waste, in violation of this Act or of\nthe rules, regulations, permits, licenses or other orders of the department\nor the board, or a county or a political subdivision exercising the authority\ngranted in Section 6 of this Act within whose jurisdiction the violation\noccurs.\n    (b) Any person who violates any provision of this Act or of any rule,\nregulation, permit, license, or other order of the department or the board,\nor a county or a political subdivision exercising the authority granted in\nSection 6 of this Act within whose jurisdiction the violation occurs, is\nsubject to a civil penalty of not less than $50.00 nor more than $1,000.00\nfor each act of violation and for each day of violation, as the court may\ndeem proper, to be recovered in the manner provided in this Section 8.\n                                    1326\n\f              61ST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                       Ch. 405\n\n    (c) Whenever it appears that a person has violated, or is violating\nor threatening to violate, any provision of this Act, or of any rule, regula-\ntion, permit, or other order of the department or the board, then the\ndepartment or the board, or the executive director of the board when so\nauthorized by the board, may cause a civil suit to be instituted in a district\ncourt for injunctive relief to restrain the person from continuing the\nviolation or threat of violation, or for the assessment and recovery of a\ncivil penalty of not less than $50.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each act\nof violation and for each day of violation, as the court may deem proper,\nor for both injunctive relief and civil penalty. Upon application for\ninjunctive relief and a finding that a person is violating or threatening\nto violate any provision of this Act or any rule, regulation, permit, or other\norder of the department or the board, the district court shall grant ap-\npropriate injunctive relief. At the request of the department or the\nboard, or the executive director of the board when so authorized by the\nboard, the attorney general shall institute and conduct a suit in the name\nof the State of Texas for injunctive relief or to recover the civil penalty,\nor for both injunctive relief and penalty, as authorized in this subsection.\n    (d) Whenever it appears that a violation or threat of violation of any\nprovision of this Act, or of any rule, regulation, permit, license, or other\norder of the department, the board, a county, or a political subdivision\nexercising the authority granted in Section 6 of this Act, has occurred or\nis occurring within the jurisdiction of that county or political subdivision,\nthe county or political subdivision, in the same manner as the board and\nthe department, may cause a L,viJ suit to be instituted in a district court\nthrough its own attorney for the injunctive relief or civil penalties, or\nbuth, as authorized in Subsection (c) of this section, against the person\nwho committed, is committing, or is threatening to commit, the violation.\n    (e) Wheneve::r it appears that a violation or threat of violation of any\nprovision of this Act, or of any rule, regulation, permit, license, or other\norder of the department, the board, a county, or a political subdivision\nexercisin . r the authority granted in Section 6 of this Act, has occurred or\nis occurring within the area of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of an\nincorporated city or town, or is causing or will cause injury to or an\nadverse effect on the health, welfare or physical property of the city or\ntown or its inhabitants, then the city or town, in the same manner as the\nboard and the department, may cause a civil suit to be instituted in a dis-\ntrict court through its own attorney for the injunctive relief or civil\npenalties, or both, as authorized in Subsection ( c) of this section, against\nthe person who committed, is committing, or is threatening to commit, the\nviolation.\n    (f) A suit for injunctive relief or for recovery of a civil penalty,\nor for both injunctive relief and penalty, may be brought either in the\ncounty where the defendant resides or in the county where the violation or\nthreat of violation occurs. In any suit brought to enjoin a violation or\nthreat of violation of this Act or of any rule, regulation, permit, license\nor other order of the board, the department, a county, or a political\nsubdivision exercising the authority granted in Section 6 of this Act, the\ncourt may grant the governmental en'.ity bringing the suit, without bond\nor other undertaking, any prohibitory or mandatory injunction the facts\nmay warrant, including temporary restraining orders after notice and\nhearing, temporary injunctions, and permanent injunction8.\n    (g) In a suit brought by a local government under Subsection (d) or\n (e) of this section, the board and the department arc necessary and in-\ndispensable parties.\n                                    1327\n\fCh. 405        GIST LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     (h) Any party to a suit may appeal from a final judgment as in other\ncivil cases.\n     (i) All civil penalties recovered in suits instituted under this Act by\nthe State of Texas through the board or the department shall be paid to\nthe General Revenue Fund of the State of Texas.

Subsections (c) and (d), Section lla, Solid Waste Disposal Act (Article\n4477-7, Vernon's Texas Civil StatuU>'l), are amended to read as follows:\n   (c) The hazardous waste disposal fee fund shall consist of money collected by the\ncommission from fees imposed on the operator of a solid waste facility for disposal of\nhazardous waste under Section 12 of this Act, from interest and penalties imposed under\nSection 14a of this Act for late payment of a disposal fee or late filing of a report, and\nfrom money paid by a liable party for facility cleanup and maintenance under Subsection\n(m) [(g)] of Section 13 of this Act. In addition, the interest received from the\ninvestment of this fund, in accounts under the charge of the treasurer, shall be\ncredited to the hazardous waste disposal fee fund on a pro rata basis. The com mis·\nsion may use the money credited to the account from interest received from the\ninvestment of the fund for only those purposes specified in Subsection (d) of this\nsection.\n   (d) The commission may use the money collected and deposited in the fund under\nSubsection (c) of this section only for:\n      (1) necessary and appropriate removal and remedial action at sites at which solid\n   [hazardGus] waste or hazardous substances have been disposed if funds from a liable\n   party, independent third party, or the federal government are not sufficient for the\n   removal or remedial action;\n      (2) necessary and appropriate maintenance of removal and remedial actions for the\n   expected life of those actions if funds from a liable party have been collected and\n   deposited in the fund for that purpose or if funds from a liable party, Independent third\n   party, or the federal government are not sufficient for the maintenance; and\n      (3) expenses related to complying with the federal Comprehensive Environmental\n   Response, Compensation, and Liabilit.y Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), the\n   federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, and Sections 8(g) and\n   13 of this Act.                                                                     ·\n   SECTION 5. Section 13, Solid Waste Disposal Act (Article 4477-7, Vernon's Texas\nCivil Statutes), is revised to read as follows:\n   Sec. 13. IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS\nWASTE FACILITIES. (a) The commission shall annually publish an updated state\nregistry identifying, to the extent feasible, every facility that may constitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the environ·\nment due to a release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environ·\n                                           3218\n\f71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAU SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n ment. The registry shall identify the relative priority for action at each listed\nfacility. The relative priority for action at facilities listtd on the registry shall be\n periodically reviewed and revised by the commission, as necessary to accurately\n reflect the need/or action at the facilities. For thtJ purposes of this section, \"facility\"\n means (1) any building, structure, installation, equipment, pipe, or pipeline (includ-\ning any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned treatment works, well, pit, pond, lagoon,\nimpoundment, ditch, landfill, storage container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or\naircraft), or (2) any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,\nstored, disposed of, or placed or otherwise come to be located,· but does not include\n any consumer product in con.'lumer use or any vessel.\n   (b) The executive director may conduct investigations of facilities which are listed\n on the state registry, or which it has reason to believe should be included on the state\nregistry, in accordance with Section 7 of this Act. If there is a reasonable basis to\n believe there may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a\nfacility, the executive director may submit requests for information and requests for\n the production of documents to any person who has or may have information' or\ndocuments relevant to:\n      (1) the identification, nature, or quantity of materials that have been generated,\n   treated, stored, or disposed of at a facility or transported to a facility;\n      (2) the identification of soils, ground water, or surface water at a facility that\n   have been or may be affected by an actual or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance;\n      (3) the nature or extent of a release or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance at or from a facility; or\n      (4) the ability of a person to pay for or to perform a remedial action.\n   If the requested information or documents are not produced in a timely manner,\n the commission may issue an order directing compliance with the requests for\ninformation or production of documents. Information or documents requested\nunder this subsection shall be public records, except that, if a showing satisfactory to\n the commission is made by the owner of the records that the records would divulge\n trade secrets if made public, then the commission shall consider the copied records as\nconfidential. Nothing in this subsection .'/hall require the commission to consider the\ncomposition or characteristics of hazardous substances being processed, stored, dis·\nposed of, or otherwise handled to be held confidential. The commission shall promul-\ngate rules regarding the provision of notice and an opportunity for a hearing before\n the commission on whether the requested injormaf.ion or documents should be\nproduced.\n   (c) Prior to the listing of a facility on the state registry, the executive director shall\nfirst determine whether the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the\nenvironment at the facility can be resolved by the present owner or operator under\n the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8901) or by\nsome or all of the potentially responsible parties identified in Section B(g), pursuant\n to an agreed administrati?Je order issued by the commission. If the potential endan-\ngerment to public health and safety or the environment can be resolved in such a\nmanner, the facility shall not be listed on the state registry. Notice of the approach\nselected to resolve the apparent endangerment to health and public safety or the\nenvironment and the fact that this action is being taken in lieu of listing the facility\non the state registry shall be published in the Texas Register. If after reasonable\nefforts the executive director determines that the potential endangerment to public\nhealth and safety or the environment cannot be resolved by either of these approaches,\n the executive director shall evaluate the facility to determine whether the site exceeds\n the commission~ minimum criteria for listing on the state regisi ry. These minimum\ncriteria shall be promulgated by rule. The executive director sltall also evaluate the\nfacility to determine whether it is eligible for listing on the federal National Priorities\nList. The commission shall proceed under this section only if, based on information\navailable to the executive director, the facility is eligible for listing on the state\nregistry but not eligible for the federal National Priorities List.\n                                           3219\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              7lst LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     (1) Once the executive director has determined that the facility is eligible for\n listing on the state registriJ, the commission shall publish in the Texas Register and\n in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located a\n notice of intent to list the facility on the state registry. The notice shall at least\n specify the name and location of tlte facility, the general nature of the potential\n endangerment to public health and safety or the environment as determined by\n information available to the executive director at that time, and the duties and\n restrictions imposed by Subsection (c)(3) . of this section. The notice also shall\n provide that interested parties may do either or both of the following: (A) submit\n written comments to the commission relative to the proposed listing of the facility,·\n or (B) request a public meeting to discuss the proposed listing by submitting a\n  request within 30 days of issi;ance of the notice.\n    (2) Once the facility is determined tCJ be eligible for listing on the state registry,\n  the executive director shall make all reasonable efforts to identify all potentially\n responsible parties/or remediation of the facility. Concurrent with the publication\n of general notice in accordance with Subdivision (1) of this subsection, the executive\n director shall provide to e3.ch identified potentially responsible party direct, written\n notification of the proposed listing of the facility on the state registry and of the\n procedures for requesting a public meeting to discuss the listit.:i and the inform.a·\n  tion included in the general notice as required by Subdivision (1) of thi'l subsection.\n  Written notifications under this subsection shall be by certified mail, return receipt\n requested, by mailing notice to each named responsible party at the party 8 last\n known address.\n    (3) If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on\n  the state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and\n location of the public meeting in the Texas Register and in the same newspaper in\n which the notice of the opportunity to request the public meetin,Q was published.\n  The public meeting notice shall be provided at least 30 days in advance of the\n meeting. Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, to all identified potentially responsible parties at the parties' last\n known addresses. Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible\n party pursuant to this subdivision or Subdivision (2) of this subsection shall in no\n way affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party. Contem·\n poraneously with the issuance of notice of the public meeting, the executive director\n shall make available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the\n facility. For the purposes of providing this information, the executive director\n shall provide a brief summary of the public records he has and make these public\n records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.\n    (4) The public meetings will be legislative in nature and not contested case\n hearings under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article\n 6252-13a, Vernons Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held/or the purpose\n of obtaining additional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility\n of the facility for listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially\n respon:Jible partfos.\n    (5) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a public\n meeting has passed, the commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or\n notice in the real property records of the county in which a facility is located\n identifying the facility as one proposed for listing on the state registry, unless the\n executive director determines, based on information presented at the public meet·\n ing, that efforts to list the facility on the state registry should not be pursued.\n    (6)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a pubtic\n meeting has passed, but prior to any listing of the facility on the state registry, the\n commission shall allow all identified potentially responsible parties the opportuni·\n ty to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial investigation/feasibility study, or\n similar study as approved by the executive director, for the facility. The potentially\n responsible parties shall have 90 days from the date of the issuance of notice of the\n opportunity to request a public meeting to make a good faith offer to conduct the\n                                         3220\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                         Ch. 703, § 5\n study. If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible parties is\n received by the commission within 90 days, those making the offer sl:all have an\n additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from\n  the commission, which shall include a scope of work. The commission shall not\n require the participating potentially responsible parties to agree to perform the\n remedial action or admit liability for the facility remediation in this agreed\n administrative order.\n       (B) If no potentially responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the\n    executive director or .if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to\n    conduct or complete an· approved study, the commission is authorized to conduct\n    or complete the study using funds from the hc;,zardous waste disposal fee fund.\n       (C) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial inves-\n    tigation/feasibility Etudy or other similar study as approved by the executive\n    director, no costs for commission oversight of the study may be assessed against\n    those parties who fund or perform the study. Nonparticipating pote.ttially\n    responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of\n    the facility under this Act or who subsequentll' enter into an agreed ordu relative\n    to the remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs fot\n    commission oversight of the study process. If all potentially responsible parties\n    participate or agree to fund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other\n    similar study, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the hazardous\n    waste disposal fee fund.\n       (D) Once the executive director has determin 1u;! that a facility is eligible for\n    listing on the state registry, no person shall perform at the facility any partial or\n    total removal activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropri-\n    ate circumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other poten-\n    tially responsible parties. The commission may develop rules determining what\n    constitutes an appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this\n    paragraph. Authorization by the executive director to conduct a partial or total\n    removal action shall not constitute a final determination of the party$ ultimate\n    liability for remediation of the facility, nor a determination of divisibility.\n    (7)(A) Once the facility is determined to be eligibl1?for listing on the state registry,\n the owner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with\n written notice of any substantial change in use of the facility at least 60 days before\n the change in use is made. Notice of a prnposed substantial change in use shall be\n in writing, addressed to the executive director, provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, and shall include a brief description of the proposed change in\n use. A substantia! change in use shall be defined by rule and shall include but not\n be limited to actions such as the erection of a building or other structure at the\n facility, the use of the facility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility\n for use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\n private recreational use on the facility.\n       (B) If, within 30 days of the notice, the executive director determines that the\n    proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a proposed or\n    ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study, or similar study approved by\n    the executive director, or expose the public health and safety or the environment\n    to a significantly increased threat of harm, then he shall notify the owner or\n    operator of his determination. Once the determination is made and notification\n    given, the owner or operator shall not proceed with the proposed substantial\n    change in use. The owner or operator may request a hearing before the commis-\n    sion on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submitting\n    a request within 30 days of receipt of the executive director$ determination. If a\n    hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing within 45 days of\n    the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the\n    Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon$\n                                          3221\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     Texas Civil Statutes). The executive director's determination shall become unap-\n     pealable 30 days after issuance if a hearing is not requested.\n    (8) Within a reasonable time following the completion of the remedial investiga·\n  tionlfeasibility study or other similar study, if required, the executive director shall\n select a proposed remedial action. Subsequent to its selection of a proposed\n remedial action, the commission shall hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed\n action. The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register\n and in a newspaper ofgeneral circulation in the county where the facility is located\n at least 45 days prior to the public meeting. The notice shall provide information\n regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, and place of the\n meeting. The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially\n responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at each party's last\n known address at least 45 days prior to the publii: meeting Contemporaneously\n with the issuance of notice of the public meeti1~g, the executive director shall make\n available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the facility.\n For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall provide a\n brief summary of the public records he has and make these public records available\n for inspection and copying during regular business hours. Nonreceipt of any notice\n mailed to a potentially responsible party pursuant to this subdivision shall in no\n 1;ay affect the responsibilities, duties, 01· liabilities imposed on any such party.\n    (9) The public meeting shall bt legislative in nature and not conducted as a\n contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act\n (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the\n purpose :if obtaining additional information regarding the facility and the identifi·\n cation of additional potentially responsible parties. Those in attendance may\n present their comments on the proposed remedial action, and the executive director\n may revise its proposed remedial action in light of the presentations.\n    (JO)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the\n commission shall provide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportu-\n nity to fund or perform the proposed remedial action. The potentially responsible\n parties shall have 60 days from the date of the public meeting in which to make a\n good faith offer to perform or fund the proposed remedial action. If a good faith\n offer is made by all or some of the potentially responsible parties within the 6{1-day\n period, then these parties will have an additional 60 days to negotiate an aoreed\n administrative order from the commission, which shall include a scope of u ork.\n The commission shall not require an admission of liability in the agreed adr.1 inis·\n trative order.\n       (B) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial ac·\n    tion, no costs for commission oversight of the remedial action may be assessed\n    against those parties who fund or perform the remedial action. Nonpartic·\n    ipating potentially responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable\n    for remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs/or commission\n    oversight of the remedial action. If all potentially responsible parties conduct or\n    fund the remedial action, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the\n    hazardous waste disposal fee fund. Participation in the remedial action does not\n    relieve those who did not conduct or fund the remedial investigation/feasibility\n    study or other similar study approved by the executive director from paying their\n    portion of the oversight costs of that phase of the remediation.\n       (C) The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to\n    conduct a partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if the executive\n    director determines that the release or threatened release is divisible after notice\n    and opportunity for comment to all other potentially responsible parties. For\n    purposes of this section, \"divisible\" means that the hazardous substance released\n    or threatened to be released is capable of being managed separately under the\n    remedial action plan. A determination of divisibility by the executive director\n    shall have no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on a potentially responsible\n    party's ultimate liability for remediation of the facility under Section 8.\n                                         3222\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n      (11) After consideration of all good faith offers to perform a remedial action, the\n   commission shall issue a final administrative order that shall:\n        (A) list the facility on the state registry, thus determining that the facility poses\n      an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\n      environment;\n        (B) specify the selected remedial action,·\n         (C) list the parties determined to be responsible for remediating the facility,·\n         (D) make findings offact describing actions voluntarily undertaken by respon-\n      sible parties,·\n        (E) order the responsible parties to remediate the facility and, if appropriate,\n      reimburse the hazardous waste disposal fee fund for remedial investigation/fea-\n      sibility study and remediation costs;\n        (F) establish a schedule for completion of the remedial action,·\n        (G) state any determination of divisibility of responsible party liability; and\n        (H) give notice of the duties and restrictions imposed by Subsection (/) of this\n      section.      ·\n   The provisions in Sections B(g), 9, 10, and 11 of this Act relating to administrative\norders shall apply to orders issued pursuant to this paragraph.\n      (12) If a potentially responsible party is newly identified after a final administra-\n   tive order has been issued by the commission pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this\n   sub~ection, that party shall have 60 days to negotiate an amendment to the existing\n   order. The commission shall not be prohibited from issuing a separate order for\n   the newly identified potentially responsible party if it determines that the circum-\n   stances warrant a separate order. The responsible parties identified in the order\n   issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this subsection shall be allowed to comment\n   on the issuance of a separate order for the newly identified potentially responsible\n   party.\n   (d) The commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real\nproperty records of the county in which the facility is located stating that the facility\nhas been listed on or deleted from the state registry or is no longer proposed for\nlisting on the state registry, within a reasonable period after a determination has\nbeen made.\n   (e) Any owner or operator or other named responsible party of a facility listed or to\nbe listed in the state registry may request the commission to delete the facility from\n the state registry, modify the facility~ priority within the state registry, or modify\nany information regarding the facility by submitting a written statement setting\nforth the grounds of the request in the form as the commission may require pursuant\n to its promulgated rules. The commission shall promulgate rules establishing proce-\ndures, including public hearings, for review of requests submitted pursuant to this\nsubsection.\n   (/) Subsequent to the listing of a facility on the state registry, no person may\nsubstantially change the manner in which the facility is used without notifying the\nexecutive director and receiving written approval of the executive director for the\nchange. A substantial change in use shall be rll!fined by rule and shall include but\nnot be limited to actions such as the erection of u building or other structure at the\nfacility, the use of the facility for agriculturq,l production, the paving of the facility\nfor use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\nprivate recreational use on the facility. The notice shall be in writing, addressed to\n the executive director, provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall\ninclude a brief description of the proposed change of use. The executive director shall\napprove or disapprove the proposed action within 60 days of receipt of the notice of\nproposed change in use. The executive director shall not approve the proposed change\nof use if such new use will significantly interfere with a proposed, ongoing, or\ncompleted remedial action program at a facility or expose the public health and\nsafety or the environment to a significantly increased threat of harm.\n                                           3223\n\fCh. 703, § 5                                71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n   (g)(J) Whenever the commission, after investigation, finds that there exists a release\nor threatened release of a hazardous substance at n facility that: (A) is causing\nirreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and safety or the environment,·\nand (B) the immediacy of the situation makes it prejudic.ial to the public interest to\ndelay action until an administrative order can be issue1t to potentially responsible\nparties or until a judgment can be entered in an appeal of an administrative order,·\n the commission may, with the funds available to the corn.mission from the hazardous\nwaste disposal fee fund, undertake immediate removal action at the facility to\nalleviate the harm. After the immediate danger of irreversible or irreparable harm\nhas been alleviated, the commission shall proceed pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection. Fi.ndings required pursuant to this subsection shall be in writing and may\nbe made by the commission on an ex parte basis subject to judicial review pursuant to\n the substantial evidence rule as provided by the Administrative Procedure and Texas\nRegister Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon~ Texas Civil Statutes).\n      (2) The reasonable expenses of any immediate removal action taken by the\n   commission may be recoverable from the persons described in Section 8, and the\n   state may seek to recover the reasonable expenses in any court of appropriate\n   jurisdiction.\n   (h) Whenever a person ordered to eliminate an imminent and substantial endan·\ngerment to the public health and safety or the environment has failed to do so within\n the time limits specified in the order or any extension of time approved by the\ncommission, the commission may implement the remedial action program for the\nfacility. The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by\n the commission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be\nrecoverable under the provisions of Subsection (m) of this section.\n   (i)(J) The goal of any remedial action shall be the elimination of the imminent and\nsubstantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment posed\n by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility. The\nappropriate extent of the remedial action at any particular facility shall be deter-\n mined by the commission~ selection of the remedial alternative which the state\nagency determines is cost effective (i.e., the lowest cost alternative that is technologi-\ncally feasible and reliable and which effectively mitigates and minimizes damage to\nand provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the environment).\n      (2) In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular\n   facility, the commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or\n   standard of control at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and\n   appropriate standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or\n   local law, if the commission finds that:\n         (A) the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will\n      attain such level or standard of control when completed,·\n         (B) compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk\n      to public health and safety or the environment than alternative options,·\n         (C) compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an\n      engineering perspective,·\n         (D) the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performance that is\n      equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement,\n      criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach,·\n         (E) with respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the\n      locality has not consistently applied (or demonstrated the intention to consistent-\n      ly apply) the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circum-\n      stances of other remedial actions within the locality,· or\n         (F) with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial\n      action that attains such levels or standards of control will not provide a balance\n      between the need/or protection of public health and safety or the environment at\n      the facility and the availabilty of state funds to respond to other sites that present\n                                           3224\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                        Ch. 703, § 5\n      a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration\n      the relative immediacy of the threats.\n  (jJ In adflition to all other remedies available to the state under this Act or any\nother law or statute, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to the state\nshall constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to the\nreal property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action. This provision is\ncumulative of other remedies available to the state under this Act.\n      (JJ The lien imposed by this subsection shall arise and attach to th,e real property\n  subject to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and\n  indexed in accordance with this subsection in the county in which the real property\n  is located. For the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien\n  shall not relate back to a time prior to the date on which the affidavit is recorded,\n  which date shall be the lien inception date.

The bond shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the\n  real property subject to the lien is located. An action to establish, enforce, or\n  foreclose any lien or claim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later\n   than the 90th day after the date of service of notice of the bond.\n      (BJ The bond must:\n         (AJ describe the real property upon which the lien is claimed,·\n         (BJ refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it,·\n          (CJ be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to,·\n          (DJ be payable to the commission;\n         (EJ be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety\n      authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety,· and\n          (FJ be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the\n      commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be\n      a lien on the real property.\n      (9J .After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the\n  named obligee. A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice. The notice may\n  be served on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person\n  competent to make oath of the delivery. The original notice shall be returned to the\n                                          3225\n\fCh. 703, § 5                               71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n    office of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath\n    on the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.\n    The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that\n    purpose. In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely\n    on and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.\n       (10) The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day following the date on\n    which the notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the\n    date on which the notice is served. If the commission recovers in a suit on the lien\n    or on the bond, it is entitled to also recover reasonable attorney's fees.\n   (k) Money for actions taken or to be taken by the commission in connection with the\n elimination of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and\n safety or the environment pursuant to this section shall be payable directly to the\n commission from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund. This includes any costs of\n inspection or sampling and laboratory analysis of wastes, soils, air, surface water,\n and ground water done on behalf of a state agency and the costs of investigations to\n identify and locate potentially responsible parties.\n    (l) The commission shall seek remediation of facilities by potentially responsible\n parties prior to expenditure offederal or state funds for the remediations. Potential·\n ly responsible parties shall coordinate with ongoing federal and state hazardous waste\n programs, although no state or local permit shall be required for any removal or\n remedial action conducted on site. Subject to the provisions nf Subsection (i) of this\n section, the state may enforce any federal or state standard, requirement, criterion,\n or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be required to conform if a\n permit were required. No action taken by the person to contain or remove a release\n or threatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be\n construed as an admission of liability for said release or threatened release. No\n person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or threatened\n release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be liable for any\n additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or omissions of\n the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals required by\n this subsection, unless the remediation costs were caused by the person's gross\n negligence or wilful misconduct. Except as specifically provided in this subsection,\n these provisions shall not be construed to expand or diminish the common law tort\n liability, if any, of private parties participa~ing in a remediation action for civil\n damages to third parties.\n    (m) The commission sh1ill file a cost recovery action against all respomnble parties\n who have not complied with the terms of an administrative order issued pursuant to\n Subdivision (11} or (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The commission shall file\n the cost recovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been\n completed. The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the\n total amount of the cost of the remedial action, including costs of any necessary\n studies and oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any\n other responsible parties pursuant to an order issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) or\n (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The action may also include a plea seeking civil\n penalties for noncompliance with the commission's administrative order and a claim\n for up to double the state's costs if the responsible party's defenses are determined by\n the court to be unreasonable, frivolous, or without foundation.\n· (n)(l) A responsible party named in an administrative order who does not comply\n with the order shall become subject to the imposition of administrative or civil\n penalties under Section Bb of this Act. The penalties may be assessed only from the\n date after which the administrative order becomes nonappealable.\n       (2) The commission is authorized to include provisions within an agreed adminis·\n    trative order that stipulate administrative penalty amounts for failure to comply\n    with the order. The penalty provisions may be applicable to either or both of the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study and remedial action orders.\n    (o)(l) The commiss-ion shall promulgate rules necessary to develop a mixed funding\n program in which available money from potentially responsible parties is combined\n                                          8226\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                            Ch. 703, § 5\nwith state or federal funds to clean up a facility in a timely manner. Use of the state\nor federal funds in a mixed funding approach shall not preclude the state or federal\ngovernment from seeking recovery of its costs from nonparticipating potentially\nresponsible parties.\n      (2) The commission shall assess and may, through rulemaking, develop and\n  implement a de minimis settlement program. Under the program, the commission\n  shall be required to consider the advantages of developing a final settlement with\n   potentially responsible parties that are responsible for only a minor portion of the\n  response costs at a facility because the hazardous substances the party is respon•\n  sible for are minimal in amount or in hazardous effect by comparison with the\n  hazardous substances attributable to other parties.\n      (3) The commission shall investigate additional alternative programs to encour·\n  age potentially responsible parties to investigate or remediate facilities and report\n   its findings to the 72nd Legislature with recommendations for legislative action.\n  (p) The commission is authorized to determine whether a potentially responsible\nparty is. financially capable of conducting any necessary remediation studies or\nremedial action. The commission shall promulgate rules to develop the criteria for\ndetermination of financial capability. If no financially capable potentially r~pon·\nsible parties exist for a facility, the commission shall issue an administrative order\nstating its determination that the facility constitutes an imminent and substantial\nendangerment and that there are no financially capable potentially responsible\nparties. The commission shall then conduct its own remediation study and remedial\naction, using federal funds if available. Iffederal funds are not available, state funds\nfrom the hazardous waste disposal fee fund shall be used. Generally, the remediation\nof listed facilities shall be achieved first by private party funding, second with the aid\nof federal funds, and third, if necessary, with state funds from the hazardous waste\ndisposal fee fund.\n  (q) The executive director or the commission shall have the authority to extend any\ntime period specified in this section if deemed appropriate.\n   [Seo. 13, IDENTIFICATION AND J..SSESSMENT OF HAZJ..RDO:US WASTE FA\nCIUTIES, (a) The department ef water reseurees, in eeeperatien with the department,\nshall oenduot and oemplete a survey ef the state by July 1, 11~8G 1 the pUFf19Se ef whioh is\nt9 identify te the extent feasible every hazardeus waste faoility whieh may oenstitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment te publio health and safety er the envirenment,\nThe werk already perfermed te identify eandidate sites fur inolusien in the federal\nNatienal Pri9rities list shall serve as the basis fer suoh a sun•ey, As seen as pessible\nafter e9mpletien ef a draft survey, the department ef water reseurees shall eenduot a\npublio hearing te selieit oemments en the draft survey and inf9rmatien en additienal\neandidate sites.

Because these operations often impact their\nenvironment, they generally must obtain water-quality permits from the Texas Commission on\nEnvironmental Quality (the “TCEQ” or “Commission”). These permits are designed to control the\nwaste produced at such facilities and through regulation prevent it from polluting nearby water\nsources.\n\n    When a CAFO applies for a permit, interested parties may object to the proposed permit during\na comment period. These parties may also seek to intervene and request a public hearing on the\nproposed permit. But before granting a contested case hearing—a trial-like proceeding with at-\ntendant expense and delay—a threshold determination must be made as to whether the party is an\n“affected person” with standing to request such a hearing.\n\n    *411 In this appeal, the TCEQ granted an amendment to a dairy CAFO's water-quality permit\nover objections from a downstream city, which claimed that the dairy's operations under the\namended permit would adversely affect the quality of the municipal water supply. The city sought\nto intervene in the permit process and obtain a contested case hearing. After a period for public\ncomment and meeting, the Commission granted the amended permit without a contested case\nhearing, and the city sought judicial review, complaining that it was entitled to a contested case\nhearing because it was an “affected person.” By rule, an affected person may request a contested\ncase hearing, “when authorized by law.” 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(b)(4).\n\n    The court of appeals agreed that the city was an affected person and held that the Commission\nabused its discretion in denying the city's request for a contested case hearing. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2547102\"><a href=\"/opinion/2547102/city-of-waco-v-comn-on-envtl-quality/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n827 (Tex.App.-Austin 2011).

At one time, water quality protection was left largely to the states, but with the en-\n        actment of the Federal Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, commonly known as\n        the Clean Water Act, the federal government took on this responsibility. See 33 U.S.C. §§\n        1251–1387. The Clean Water Act created a federal permitting system (the NPDES) that\n        requires a permit of any person discharging pollutants into a surface water body.\n\n    In Texas, the TCEQ has the primary authority to establish surface water quality standards,\nwhich it implements, in part, in its permitting actions. See 33 U.S.C. § 1313(a), (d); TEX. WATER\nCODE § 26.023; see also id. § 5.013(a)(3) (granting the TCEQ general jurisdiction over “the\nstate's water quality program including issuance of permits, enforcement of water quality rules,\nstandards, orders, and permits, and water quality planning”). The agency continually monitors and\nevaluates the state's water quality as part of its primary responsibility to preserve and conserve the\nstate's natural resources. TEX. WATER CODE § 5.012. Over the past fifteen years, the TCEQ has\ndevoted particular attention to the water quality of the North Bosque River.\n\n   The North Bosque River extends from its headwaters in Erath County, through Hamilton and\nBosque Counties, and into McLennan County where it joins two other branches of the Bosque to\nform Lake Waco. Lake Waco serves as the municipal water supply for the City of Waco. The City\nowns all adjudicated and permitted rights to the water impounded in the lake, which is the sole\nsource of drinking water for approximately 160,000 people.\n\n   In recent decades, the dairy industry in the North Bosque watershed has experienced signifi-\ncant growth. This, in turn, *412 has raised concerns over the increasing volumes of animal waste\nproduced by these dairies and the possibilities for such waste to damage the water quality of the\nNorth Bosque and, ultimately, Lake Waco.\n\n    The drinking water in Waco has historically had taste and odor problems. For many years, the\nCity has attributed these problems to algae blooms in Lake Waco, which the City believes to be\nexacerbated by the proliferation of animal waste in the North Bosque watershed. As a result, the\nCity and others have sought to impose stricter regulatory limits on dairies in the North Bosque\nwatershed.\n\n   The Clean Water Act requires Texas and the other states to identify water bodies that do not\nmeet, or are not expected to meet, water-quality standards. 33 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(1). In 1998, the\nCommission determined that two segments FN2 (Segments 1255 and 1226) of the North Bosque\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

Lake Waco itself, however, was not determined to be an\n“impaired” water body.\n\n        FN2. For purposes of water quality management, the TCEQ segments the state's major\n        surface waters.\n\n        FN3. The court of appeals defined a “narrative” water-quality standard as “qualitative,\n        somewhat subjective assessments of ‘too much,’ in contrast to quantitative or numeric\n        measures.” 346 S.W.3d at 793.\n\n    Once a water body is identified as impaired, the state must determine a “total maximum daily\nload” or TMDL for the water body. The TMDL serves to budget the maximum amount of a pol-\nlutant that a water body can receive and still meet the applicable water-quality standard. See id. §\n1313(d)(1)(C). Following study and public comment from the City and others, the Commission\ndetermined that soluble phosphorus, which it attributed primarily to dairies' waste application\nfields and municipal water-treatment plants, was the key variable that could be controlled to limit\nalgal plant growth in the North Bosque River. The Commission accordingly approved TMDLs that\nproposed a fifty-percent reduction in soluble phosphorus loading over time. After further study\nand comment (including comments from the City), the Commission in 2002 proposed an imple-\nmentation plan through which dairies and cities could reduce phosphorus loadings. In 2004, the\nCommission amended its rules, making parts of the plan legally enforceable. See 30 Tex. Admin.\nCode §§ 321.31–321.47.\n\n    Meanwhile, in 2001, the Legislature, at the City's urging, imposed new environmental re-\nstrictions on dairy CAFOs located in a “major sole source impairment zone” (MSSIZ). See gen-\nerally TEX. WATER CODE §§ 26.501–.504. At the time of enactment, the North Bosque wa-\ntershed was the only area to which the MSSIZ legislation applied. See id. § 26.502 (defining major\nsole source impairment zone). The legislation required that new or expanded CAFOs located\nwithin a MSSIZ obtain an individual water-quality permit—a permit tailored to the dairy's par-\nticular circumstances. See id. § 26.503(a). Before this legislation, CAFOs in the North Bosque\nwatershed could operate under general permits, a permit type exempted from the contest-\ned-case-hearing process. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(7). The MSSIZ legislation thus\neffectively removed that exemption for CAFOs covered by the statute, opening their permit pro-\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig.

See 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 321.32–.35, .39,\n.48, .49. The amended rules required dairy CAFOs in the watershed to obtain individual permits\nwhen their current permits expired. Id. The amended rules also imposed stricter requirements on\nthe management and disposal of wastewater and manure by the CAFOs.\n\n    About this same time, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new rules and guidelines\ngoverning CAFOs. 40 C.F.R. §§ 122, 123, 412. The federal changes expanded the federal defini-\ntion of CAFOs and imposed stricter nutrient-management and record-keeping requirements on the\nfacilities. See id. In response, the Commission again rewrote its rules in 2004 to mirror the federal\nchanges, imposing more stringent controls on CAFOs, especially those in the North Bosque wa-\ntershed. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 321.31–.47. The rules provided, however, that CAFOs\nneeding individual permits could continue to operate under their old authorizations so long as the\noperator applied for an individual permit by July 27, 2004. 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 321.33(g). In\nMarch 2004, the operators of the O–Kee Dairy applied to amend their water-quality permit.\n\n    The O–Kee Dairy is in Hamilton County about 80 miles upstream from Lake Waco. It is sit-\nuated a few miles from the North Bosque River but within its watershed. Under the new regula-\ntions, O–Kee needed to convert from a general to an individual permit. In its application, the dairy\nalso sought to expand its herd from 690 to 999 cows and its total waste-application acreage from\n261 to 285.4 acres.\n\n     The Commission's executive director declared the O–Kee Dairy permit application adminis-\ntratively complete, conducted technical review, prepared a draft permit, and issued a preliminary\ndecision that the draft permit met all statutory and regulatory requirements. The draft permit\nproposed to increase the dairy's maximum herd size and total waste application acreage as re-\nquested. The draft also proposed several new measures to strengthen the overall water-quality\nprotections at the facility, even with the increase in the number of cows. These measures included\nreducing the possibility of discharges from the dairy's retention control structures (RCSs) FN4 by,\namong other things, more than doubling their total storage capacity and improving monitoring of\nsludge and water levels. There were also new restrictions aimed at reducing the risk of waste\nrunoff from the waste application fields. The dairy was further required to expand the size of\nnon-vegetative buffer zones around the waste application fields and to transport excess waste\noff-site. The new measures purported to conform to the numerous regulatory changes imposed on\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

Retention control structures are ponds used to collect runoff of manure and\n        wastewater from areas where cows are confined.\n\n    The executive director's preliminary decision that the draft permit met all statutory and regu-\nlatory requirements triggered a period of public notice and comment. See TEX. WATER CODE §\n5.553(b), (c). The City submitted public comments and requested a public meeting, which was\ngranted. See id. § 5.554. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the executive *414 di-\nrector responded to the City's public comments, agreeing to make some changes to permit provi-\nsions governing waste application in the dairy's waste application fields or off-site, but otherwise\nrejecting the City's complaints. See id. § 5.555.\n\n    The City next filed a written request for a contested case hearing that incorporated its prior\ncomments, replied to the executive director's responses, and identified the legal and factual issues\nit considered to be in dispute. See id. § 5.556; 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201 (Texas Comm'n on\nEnvtl. Quality, Requests for Reconsideration or Contested Case Hearing). In its request, the City\nasserted it was an “affected person” with a personal justiciable interest in the O–Kee permit ap-\nplication process. The City attached two affidavits to its hearing request—one from a professional\nengineer, Bruce L. Wiland, whom the City presented as an expert in water-quality analysis, the\nother from the City's water-utility director, Richard L. Garrett, also an engineer. The City's claim\nto affected-party status rested on the assertions and opinions of these two experts, which the court\nof appeals summarized as follows:\n\n  • The City possesses a personal justiciable interest in the quality of the water in Lake Waco\n  because it owns all adjudicated and permitted rights to the water impounded in the lake and uses\n  the water as its sole source of supply for its municipal water utility, exclusive of emergency\n  connections. The City must treat the water to ensure that it is safe for uses that include drinking\n  and bathing and that it will be regarded as palatable by the customers to whom the City sells the\n  water, including 113,000 City residents, approximately 45,000 residents of surrounding mu-\n  nicipalities, and major industrial customers “that place a premium on the quality of the water\n  they use.” Otherwise, the City is placed at a competitive disadvantage in preserving and growing\n  its water-utility customer base and, ultimately, its broader economic health.\n\n  • For many years, the City has received complaints about offensive taste and odor in its drinking\n  water. The source of these problems has proven to be a geosmin (earthy odor) produced by de-\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

Beginning in the 1980s, Lake\n  Waco began to experience more frequent and longer durations of algal blooms, with corre-\n  spondingly more taste and odor problems in the City's drinking water. To counter these prob-\n  lems, the City has incurred escalating costs in attempting to treat the water. Despite these addi-\n  tional expenditures, current treatment methods (chiefly, the use of powdered activated carbon)\n  have repeatedly fallen short of eliminating the geosmin, necessitating that the City deliver of-\n  fensive smelling and tasting water to customers for the time being and that it plan and budget to\n  install different and more expensive water-treatment systems in the future.\n\n  • There is a causal linkage between the increasing algal growths in Lake Waco (and resultant\n  taste and odor problems in the City's drinking water) and phosphorus loading from dairies up-\n  stream in the North Bosque watershed. The North Bosque contributes approximately 64 percent\n  of the total flow into Lake Waco and over 72 percent of the total phosphorus loading to the lake.\n  Between 30 to 40 percent of the lake's total phosphorus load is attributable to dairy operations in\n  the North Bosque watershed, most of which stems from runoff and discharges that occur during\n  heavy rainstorms. This phosphorus loading attributable to dairies in the North Bosque*415\n  watershed, in turn, is the primary cause of the lake's heavy algal growth.\n\n  • In addition to contributing nutrients that lead to algal growth and, ultimately, to taste and odor\n  problems in drinking water, CAFOs in the North Bosque watershed are also a source of bacteria\n  and other pathogens entering Lake Waco. In addition to driving up water treatment costs, the\n  presence of these pathogens in the lake endanger the health and enjoyment of the City's many\n  citizens who swim, fish, sail, ski, and engage in other water recreation there.\n\n  • If the problems with the proposed O–Kee Dairy permit identified in the City's comments are\n  not remedied to any greater extent than described in the executive director's response, the in-\n  creases in the dairy's herd size from 690 to 999 will increase the amounts of phosphorus and\n  bacteria transmitted from the dairy, its waste application fields, and third-party fields into the\n  North Bosque and downstream to Lake Waco, where it will contribute to increased algal growth,\n  more bacteria, and the problems that follow. Although Lake Waco is approximately eighty miles\n  downstream from the O—Kee Dairy, the distance does not substantially reduce these adverse\n  effects because the primary mechanism through which these pollutants are transported are heavy\n  rains, which can deliver the pollutants downstream in as little as 3–5 days.\n\n    346 S.W.3d at 795–96. Anyone may publicly comment on a pending water-quality permit, but\nonly those commentators who are also “affected persons” may obtain a public hearing.

See\nid. § 55.203(c). The executive director accordingly recommended that the Commission deny the\nCity's request for a contested case hearing. 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.209(d), (e). The City re-\nplied, filing a supplemental affidavit from its expert Wiland, who disputed the executive director's\nanalysis and elaborated on his opinion of the causal link between claimed deficiencies in the\nproposed permit and water-quality problems in Lake Waco. See id. § 55.209(g).\n\n    After a public meeting at which the Commission considered the City's hearing request and the\nO–Kee Dairy permit application, see id. § 55.209(g), the City's hearing request was denied. See id.\n§ 55.211(b). The Commission also adopted the executive director's response to public comment,\napproved the permit amendment, and issued the permit as the executive director proposed. Alt-\nhough the City was denied a contested case hearing, it was afforded several opportunities to make\na record in the agency, including during the public comment period, at two public meetings, in a\nwritten request for contested case hearing, and in responses to the executive director's written\ncomments and analysis. There is no indication that the Commission prevented the City from filing\nany evidence it deemed relevant to the proposed amended permit.\n\n    The City sought judicial review of the Commission's order in district court. See TEX. WATER\nCODE §§ 5.351, .354. The district court affirmed the Commission's decision.

Id. § 26.028(d).\n\n    The term “public hearing” is not defined in chapter 26, see id. § 26.001 (Definitions), but in\ncontext can refer either to a hearing before the Commission or a contested case hearing before the\nState Office of Administrative Hearings. See id. § 26.020 (authorizing the Commission to hold\nhearings “with respect to administering the provisions of this chapter”); id. § 26.01 (authorizing\nthe Commission to delegate any hearing to the State Office of Administrative Hearings). Public\nhearings under chapter 26 can be expansive, such as a public hearing on water quality standards at\nwhich “any person may appear and present evidence” or limited, such as a public hearing on a\nparticular application for a water quality permit. Compare id. § 26.024 (pertaining to public\nhearings on standards) with id. § 26.028(c) (pertaining to public hearings on permit applications).\nIn the permit application context, the Code indicates that a public hearing means a contested case\nhearing under the Texas Administrative Procedure Act. See TEX. WATER CODE § 5.551 (re-\nferring to “an opportunity for public hearing under Subchapters C–H, Chapter 2001, Government\nCode, regarding commission actions relating to a permit issued under Chapter 26 [of the Water\nCode]”). Chapter 5, subchapter M, of the Water Code makes that connection while laying out the\nprocedure for notice and opportunities for public comment, public meetings, and contested case\nhearings in the environmental permitting process. See id. at §§ 5.551–.559.\n\n    As part of that procedure, subchapter M provides that interested parties, who have filed\ncomments during the process, may request a contested case hearing. Id. § 5.556(c). The Com-\nmission may not grant the request, however, without first determining that the requestor is an\n“affected person,” id., which subchapter M defines as:\n\n  [A] person who has a personal justiciable interest related to a legal right, duty, privilege, power,\n  or economic interest affected by the administrative hearing. An interest common to members of\n  the general public does not qualify as a personal justiciable interest.\n\n    TEX. WATER CODE § 5.115(a); see also 30 Tex. Admin.

Code § 55.211(b)–(d).\n\n    As a matter of statutory interpretation, the court of appeals concluded that section 5.115's af-\nfected-person definition embodied the constitutional principles of standing. See 346 S.W.3d at 801\n(observing that the “cornerstone” of the definition “denotes the constitutionally minimal re-\nquirements for litigants to have standing to challenge governmental actions in court”). The court\nexplained that those principles required the City to establish a concrete and particularized injury in\nfact, not common to the general public, that is: (1) actual or imminent; (2) fairly traceable to the\nissuance of the permit as proposed; and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision on its\ncomplaint. Id. at 801, 810–11.\n\n    *418 The court concluded that the City possessed a legally protected interest in Lake Waco's\nwater quality, distinct from that of the general public, but that the City's personal justiciable in-\nterest in the O–Kee Dairy permit application—its status as an affected party—depended on the\nresolution of disputed fact issues. Id. at 811. The court further acknowledged that the Commission\nhad weighed the evidence and found these disputed facts against the City, reasoning that the City\nhad failed to establish “the requisite ‘concrete and particularized,’ imminent injury ‘fairly tracea-\nble’ to the issuance of the O–Kee Dairy permit and likely redressed by denying the permit or\nimposing additional conditions.” Id.

Although not determined in a contested case hearing, the court found no reason to\nforeclose the Commission's discretion to consider evidence when determining “whether a ‘request\nwas filed by an affected person as defined by Section 5.115.’ ” Id. at 813 (quoting TEX. WATER\nCODE § 5.556(c)).\n\n    The court, however, rejected the Commission's thesis that the City could not show any con-\ncrete or imminent adverse effect or injury if the amended permit were approved simply because the\namended permit was designed to be more protective of the North Bosque's water quality than the\ncurrent one. The court reasoned that the relative protectiveness of the amended permit was,\nstanding alone, irrelevant because it was an “acknowledged certainty” that there would be some\ndischarge or runoff into the North Bosque under the amended permit. Id. at 822. And, if that\ndischarge were to “harm Lake Waco's water quality and the City's legally protected interest in it,\nthe City would have a personal justiciable interest in ensuring that the permitted activities comply\nwith current legal requirements.” Id. The court then concluded that “to the extent that the Com-\nmission denied the City's hearing request based on the premise that *419 the amended O–Kee\nDairy permit would be ‘more protective’ of the environment than the current one, it acted arbi-\ntrarily by relying on a factor that is irrelevant to the City's standing to obtain a hearing.” Id. at\n822–23.FN6 Finally, the court suggested that the Commission had conceded the City's entitlement\nto a contested case hearing by classifying the O–Kee Dairy permit as a “major amendment,” be-\ncause the City otherwise met the definition of an “affected person.” Id. at 825.\n\n        FN6.

A major amendment is defined by rule as one that “changes a sub-\nstantive term ... or a limiting parameter of a permit.” 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 305.62(c)(1). A minor\namendment, on the other hand, is one that “improve[s] or maintain[s] the permitted quality or\nmethod of disposal of waste” (among other things). Id. The Commission submits that the terms are\nnot mutually exclusive. An application to amend a permit may fit both definitions. For example, an\namendment that changes a substantive term and improves the quality of the waste discharge, the\nCommission submits, is both major and minor.\n\n    The distinction is significant in the first instance because a contested case hearing is not\navailable for a minor amendment to an existing permit. 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(1). But\nthere is also no express right to a contested case hearing merely because the applicant seeks a\nmajor amendment. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(5) (limiting right to contested case\nhearing where applicant is not applying to increase significantly the quantity of waste discharged\nor materially change the pattern or place of discharge, among other considerations).\n\n    [1] Although the Water Code generally grants a person affected by a permit application a right\nto a public hearing, the Code also provides exceptions to this general rule. TEX. WATER CODE §\n26.028(c), (d). Exempt from this public hearing requirement is an application to amend or renew a\nwater-quality permit that does not seek either to “increase significantly the quantity of waste au-\nthorized to be discharged” or “change materially the pattern or place of discharge,” if “the activi-\nties to be authorized ... will maintain or improve the quality of waste authorized to be discharged,”\nand meet certain other requirements. Id. § 26.028(d); see also 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(5).\nRelying on this exemption, the Commission argued in the court of appeals that it could “consider a\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig.

As noted, the court of appeals viewed the inquiry as irrelevant to the issue of the\nparty's status as an affected person, and, in any event, conceded by *420 the Commission as not\nexempt from the hearing requirement because of the “major amendment” label it attached to the\napplication. Id. at 822–25. In light of the discretion the statute confers on the Commission in de-\ntermining the need for a public hearing, however, we cannot agree that a proposed amended permit\nthat purports to provide greater protection for water quality is an irrelevant consideration when\nevaluating the need for a public hearing.\n\n    The Commission asserts that the more protective nature of the amended permit is a relevant\nfactor in its determination of whether the City will be affected by the permit. But whether we\naccept this as part of the affected person analysis, as the Commission urges, or follow the court of\nappeals' analysis of “affected person” as merely a codification of the constitutional principal of\nstanding does not ultimately determine the City's right to a hearing in this case. Under either ap-\nproach, we must account for the Commission's discretion to limit or deny public hearings on\namended permits that maintain or improve the quality of any discharge and that neither increase\nsignificantly the quantity of waste authorized to be discharged nor change materially the pattern or\nplace of discharge. TEX. WATER CODE § 26.028(d). Thus, even assuming the City might oth-\nerwise qualify as an affected person under the statute's definition, it may still not be entitled to a\npublic hearing if section 26.028(d)'s exception reasonably applies.\n\n    The Commission's list of factors to be considered in determining affected person status and the\npublic hearing exemption expressed in section 26.028(d) overlap to some degree. Compare 30\nTex. Admin.Code § 55.203(c) with TEX. WATER CODE § 26.028. For example, one of the\nCommission's factors focuses on the “likely impact of the regulated activity on use of the impacted\nnatural resource by the person.” 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 55.203(c)(5). During the comment period,\nthe City argued that the increase in the size of the O–Kee herd authorized by the amended permit\nwould naturally lead to more waste and inevitably to more phosphorous and other nutrients and\npathogens making their way into the North Bosque and eventually into Lake Waco, which, in turn,\nwould increase the City's water treatment costs. The City supported its argument with expert\nopinion in affidavit form. One of the City's experts attested to a causal link between the increasing\nalgal growths in Lake Waco and phosphorus loading from dairies upstream in the North Bosque\nwatershed. This expert estimated that the North Bosque contributed about 64 percent of the total\nflow into Lake Waco. He further attributed about 30 to 40 percent of the lake's total phosphorus\nload to dairy operations in the North Bosque, stemming from runoff and waste discharges during\nheavy rainstorms. This source of phosphorus loading was in his opinion the primary cause of the\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

The\nexecutive director, however, did not agree that the proposed amendment to the O–Kee permit\nwould have an adverse affect on Lake Waco or the City.\n\n    Relying on the sworn application, attached expert reports, the analysis and opinions of pro-\nfessionals on its staff, and reports, opinions and data about the North Bosque watershed gathered\nand analyzed by the TCEQ for nearly a decade, the executive director recommended that the\nCommission issue O–Kee's amended permit without a hearing. With this recommendation, he\nincluded a map and fact sheet, the draft permit, his response to public comments, and the dairy's\ncompliance history. The fact sheet discussed the water-quality inventory for Segments 1226 and\n1255, the TMDLs, the TDML implementation*421 plan, the “White Paper” (which was also\nsubmitted by the City), and interoffice memos of the professional staff documenting their analysis\nof the application.\n\n    The Commission points out that a permit application to the TCEQ amounts to an affidavit with\nexpert reports attached. The applicant must verify that the information submitted is true, accurate,\nand complete. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 305.44(b), 321.34(b). Maps and technical reports must be\nprepared by a licensed professional engineer, a licensed professional geoscientist, or other quali-\nfied person. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 305.45(a)(6), (8), 321.34(f). The applications are then re-\nviewed by the executive director's professional staff.\n\n    The Commission submits that the O–Kee permit was drafted by an engineer on the executive\ndirector's staff and reviewed by several other professionals. A geoscientist on the executive di-\nrector's Water Quality Assessment Team evaluated the proposed permit, as did a soil conserva-\ntionist and an engineer at the National Resource Conservation Service and the Texas Soil & Water\nConservation Board. The draft permit incorporated their comments. The Land Application Team\nconcluded that the permit application proposed adequate buffer zones, and the Water Quality\nAssessment Team determined that the permit terms “are expected to preclude a permitted increase\nin pollutant loadings from [the dairy].”\n\n    The Commission had before it evidence that the proposed permit's modifications to the dairy's\nmanagement of its wastewater and manure would reduce the pollutants from the dairy that were\nlikely to be discharged into the watershed. There was also evidence that the more stringent waste\napplication requirements imposed by the proposed permit would reduce the amount of phosphorus\nrunoff from waste application fields. Indeed, the proposed permit implemented the new regula-\ntions promulgated by the Commission to comply with Environmental Protection Agency rules and\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See 40 C.F.R. §§ 122, 123, 412. These new requirements were\ncategorized by their intended goals: reduce the potential for discharges, minimize the nutrient\nloading to land and surface water, and increase Commission oversight of the dairy's operational\nactivities.\n\n    The proposed permit thus requires the dairy to bring its operations into compliance with the\nnew rules regulating CAFOs. This includes increasing its wastewater and manure retention control\nstructure capacity by approximately 13 acre feet. The increased storage capacity is designed to\nreduce the number of discharges from the dairy during heavy rainfall events, and reflects that,\nunder the new rules, CAFOs may only discharge during a 25 year/10 day rainfall event as opposed\nto a 25 year/24 hour rainfall event. The existing retention structures were designed to capture and\nretain runoff from a 7.3 inch rainfall; the new structures must capture and retain runoff from a 12.2\ninch rainfall. The dairy is also required to implement a retained control structure management plan\nto assure that it maintains wastewater volumes within the designed operating capacity of the\nstructures, except during chronic or catastrophic rainfall events, and maintain sludge at or below\nthe design sludge volume. These management tools reduce the likelihood of discharge during\nsmaller rainfall events and reduce overflows associated with insufficient wastewater storage ca-\npacity.\n\n    The proposed permit also requires changes in the land application of manure and wastewater\nfrom the dairy, imposing a nutrient management plan designed to *422 minimize nutrient loading\nto land and surface water through measurement of soil and waste phosphorus levels. This meas-\nurement, known as a risk potential assessment,FN7 ensures that phosphorus levels remain in a\nproper balance, which, in turn, reduces runoff risk. Further, in order to minimize nutrient loading,\nthe land application rate of manure and wastewater must be based on the crop's phosphorus re-\nquirements rather than its nitrogen requirements as under the old permit. For a coastal bermuda\ncrop, all other things being equal, the result is a 40% decrease in the application rate. Manure,\nsludge, or wastewater in excess of that permitted to be applied to the land must be delivered to a\ncomposting facility, delivered to a permitted landfill, beneficially used by land application outside\nthe watershed, or provided to operators of third-party fields for beneficial use in a manner con-\nsistent with Commission rules. The regulations on manure disposal contained in the proposed\npermit limit the unregulated disposal of manure and wastewater in the watershed.\n\n        FN7. Risk potential is determined by measuring, among other things, the current phos-\n        phorus levels in the soil, the proposed phosphorus application rate, and dairy's proximity to\n        the nearest water body—here the Bosque. Application rates are then adjusted according to\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

In addition, the\n        application rate is determined by the amount of nutrients needed for optimal crop produc-\n        tion and then balances that need between the nutrients in the soil and the nutrient\n        source—manure and wastewater. Once the nutrients are in balance, it is very unlikely that\n        excess nutrients will leave the site and affect water quality.\n\n    Any waste stored temporarily on-site must be stockpiled in well-drained areas and adequately\nsloped to ensure proper drainage and prevent ponding of water. To protect against discharge,\nstockpiles must generally be kept beneath impermeable roofs to ensure that waste does not leave\nthe storage area. Waste may also be composted on-site so long as it is done in accordance with\nCommission rules. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 332.\n\n    Excess waste that cannot be used on site must be removed. See TEX. WATER CODE\n26.503(b)(2). Most removal methods require delivery of the waste to locations outside of the North\nBosque watershed, but the Code also allows delivery of waste to third-party fields—areas of land\nin the watershed not owned, operated or otherwise controlled by the permitee. The City objected to\nthis aspect of the permit, but the Commission found it to be in compliance with the rules, which\nrequire all transferred waste to be applied to those fields at the proper agronomic rate based on the\nsoil's existing phosphorus content. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 321.36, 321.40. The dairy is further\nprohibited from delivering manure or wastewater to a third-party field once the soil test phos-\nphorus analysis shows a level equal to or greater than 200 ppm. Moreover, the third-party fields\nmust be identified in the dairy's pollution prevention plan, and quarterly reports with the name,\nlocations, and amounts of manure and wastewater transferred to operators of third party fields\nmust be submitted. To ensure compliance with all the new requirements, the permit implements\nincreased oversight of operational activities by the Commission. These measures require O–Kee to\nsubmit reports to the Commission concerning, among other things, land application records, an-\nnual soil samples, and chronic rainfall discharges.\n\n    The Commission considered these management tools and found that although there will be\nmore cows at the dairy, the overall impact of the permit's requirements will be to reduce the like-\nlihood that phosphorus from the dairy will enter the *423 watershed. The Commission concluded\nthat the proposed permit would effectively decrease, rather than increase, the amount of phos-\nphorus discharged into the watershed and thus have an overall beneficial environmental impact. It\ntherefore rejected the City's argument that the City would be adversely affected by its granting the\npermit.\n\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

The City thus\nfocuses on potential harm rather than any relative environmental improvement under the proposed\npermit. The issue, however, is whether the City has a statutory right to intervene in the permitting\nprocess and obtain a contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n    [2] Although the APA defines “contested case” and sets the procedural framework, the\nagency's enabling act here sets out whether rights are to be determined after an opportunity for\nadjudicative hearing, and agency rules may decide whether that opportunity may include a con-\ntested case hearing. For example, this court of appeals has previously affirmed the TCEQ's rule\nthat a request for a contested case hearing is not itself a contested case hearing, concluding that a\nhearing request may be decided through a less formal proceeding before the Commission.

A neighbor to the poultry operation protested the application\nand requested a contested case hearing. After briefing and a limited hearing before the State Office\nof Administrative Hearings to determine the neighbor's proximity, the TCEQ denied the neigh-\nbor's hearing request. Construing Water Code § 5.115, as it existed before the statute's amendment\nin 1999, the court found that the Commission's denial of the hearing request was supported by\nsubstantial evidence. Id. at 885.\n\n    The Collins court also rejected the neighbor's claim that he was denied due process. The court\nreasoned that the issuance of a permit in itself does not deprive a neighboring landowner of any\nconcrete liberty or property interest. Id. at 884–85. The court observed that the Commission's rules\nseek to protect such interests and expressly state that “the issuance of a permit does not authorize\nany injury to persons or property or an invasion of any other property rights.” Id. at 884 (quoting\n30 Tex. Admin. Code § 305.122(c)). The court further concluded that even if a private property\ninterest were at issue, “due process never requires all the trial-like procedures of a statutory con-\ntested case hearing.” Id. at 885. The court of appeals accordingly upheld the Commission's denial\nof the neighbor's hearing request, concluding that the Commission's process for evaluating hearing\nrequests by persons who claimed to be affected, satisfied procedural due process requirements.

United Copper and\nHeat Energy likewise focus on the requestor's status as an affected person and do not otherwise\nconsider the person's statutory right to a hearing or statutory exceptions to that right.\n\n    In Heat Energy, the owner of a hazardous and industrial waste storage and processing facility\nsought to renew its permit to conduct its business. 962 S.W.2d at 289. A coalition of nearby res-\nidents asked the Commission to conduct a contested case hearing on the renewal application. Id.\nThe request was filed pursuant to section 361.088 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, which requires\nthe Commission to “provide an opportunity for a hearing to the applicant and persons affected”\nbefore a permit is issued, amended, extended or renewed. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §\n361.088(c). The requirement for a contested case hearing does not apply, however, when the ap-\nplication is to renew a permit for the storage or processing of hazardous waste that was generated\non-site and not mixed with waste generated elsewhere, and the Commission has complied with the\nnotice and comment requirements of the Water Code. Id. § 361.088(e); see also TEX. WATER\nCODE §§ 5.552–.555. This hearing-requirement exemption was not at issue in Heat Energy.\nSimilarly, no hearing-requirement exemption was discussed, or even asserted, in United Copper.\n\n    The Commission complains that the court of appeals has misread the statutory exemption and\nagency rules that define hearing rights under chapter 26 of the Water Code. Agency rules provide\nthat an affected person may request a contested case hearing “when authorized by law.” 30 Tex.\nAdmin. Code § 55.201(b)(4). But no right to a contested case hearing exists for “an application,\nunder Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, to renew or amend a permit” under certain circumstances.\nId. § 55.201(i)(5). Thus, a person affected by a proposed water-quality permit has the right to\nrequest a hearing (if the person meets the statutory definition of “affected person” in section 5.115\nof the Water Code), but the Commission has discretion to deny the request when the proposed\npermit is an amendment or renewal and (1) the applicant is not applying to significantly increase\nthe discharge of waste or materially change the pattern or place of discharge, (2) the authorization\nunder the permit will maintain or improve the quality of the discharge, (3) when required, the\nCommission has given notice, the opportunity for a public meeting, and considered and responded\nto all timely public comments, and (4) applicant's compliance history raises no additional con-\ncerns. TEX. WATER CODE § 26.028(d); Tex. Admin. Code § 55.201(i)(5). And again, the court\n\n\n\n                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov.

Collins, 94 S.W.3d at 884–85. The\nstatute similarly supports a less formal determination when section 26.028(d) applies, stating that\nthe Commission may under these circumstances approve an application to renew or amend a\npermit “at a regular meeting without the necessity of holding a public hearing.” TEX. WATER\nCODE § 26.028(d).\n\n    [3] We conclude that there is evidence in the record to support the Commission's determination\nthat the proposed amended permit here did not seek to significantly increase or materially change\nthe authorized discharge of waste or otherwise foreclose Commission discretion to consider the\namended application at a regular meeting*425 rather than after a contested case hearing. The\nCommission therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying the City's request for a contested case\nhearing on O–Kee's application for an amended permit.\n\n   The court of appeals' judgment remanding the matter to the Commission for a contested case\nhearing is accordingly reversed and judgment is rendered affirming the Commission's decision to\ndeny the hearing request.\n\nTex.,2013.\nTexas Com'n on Environmental Quality v.
