GIBSON, Circuit Judges.\n                          _____________\n\nJOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n       The Kansas City, Missouri School District appeals from an order of the district\ncourt of March 25, 1997, and particularly two statements in the opinion, one that it was\nnot the court's duty to insure funding for the KCMSD, and one denying that there was\na financial vestige that must be remedied. The funding problems that are of particular\nconcern to the KCMSD have been resolved by a state constitutional amendment\nauthorizing the board to set the levy at $4.95. See H.J.R. No. 9, 89th General\nAssembly (Mo. 1997) (approved by the voters April 7, 1998) (amending Mo. Const.\nArt. 10 ยง 11(g) to permit school boards whose operating levy for 1995 was set by court\norder to set subsequent tax rates at any level lower than the 1995 rate (which was $4.96\nfor the KCMSD) without voter approval). The uncertainty over the availability of these\nfunds seems to generate KCMSD's primary argument. The second concern is that a\nsecond piece of legislation which could provide additional funding for the district,\nSenate Bill 781, is contingent on final settlement of the St. Louis desegregation case on\nor before March 15, 1999. The KCMSD states that this issue is not yet ripe and\nsuggests holding it in abeyance until the contingency has been resolved. We believe\nour best course is to dismiss the appeal.\n\n       The district court's order of March 25, 1997, approved a settlement agreement\nbetween the KCMSD and the State of Missouri, and denied the State's claim that the\ndistrict was unitary. Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151 (W.D. Mo. 1997). We\naffirmed in Jenkins v. Missouri, 122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997) (Jenkins XIV). The\n\n                                          -3-\n\fdistrict court's decision was a lengthy one and made a detailed review of the long\nhistory of this litigation. The district court denied that there was a financial vestige as\nsuch and stated further that it was not the court's duty to insure funding for the\nKCMSD. 959 F. Supp. at 1169.\n\n       A number of issues that have been raised by the parties make some response\ndesirable, however. We must first say that when an issue is raised by the KCMSD that\npoints to two specific statements in the district court's opinion, both of which are made\nin the court's chain of reasoning for an ultimate holding, we are inclined to view such\narguments as essentially asking for an advisory opinion, and in the context of the\nstatements made in this case, comments on our earlier decisions. We need not restate\nthat which was plainly enunciated in Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F.2d 1296 (8th Cir.\n1989) (Jenkins II), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 495 U.S. 33 (1990). We think it\nsuffices to say that our decisions heretofore have been clear as to identification of the\nvestiges of the segregated school system, and we need refer only to Jenkins II, 855\nF.2d at 1305. The answers to the questions raised by the KCMSD can be found in\nthose decisions and we need not repeat what has been said before.\n\n        It should be further stated, as is so evident, that while a settlement has been\nreached between KCMSD and the State of Missouri that will ultimately, if all\nconditions are satisfied, result in a final order that the district is unitary with respect to\nclaims asserted against the State, there is no issue before the court as to whether the\ndistrict is unitary with respect to the claims asserted against it by the Jenkins class. The\nKCMSD and the Jenkins class remain subject to the orders of the district court and this\ncourt until there has been a final determination that the district is unitary. Any\ndetermination that the district is unitary must, of course, be made in accordance with\nthose standards we recognized in Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 595-97, and the teachings\nof the Supreme Court we discussed in that opinion. Until that time, when ripe issues\nare raised that affect the concerns of the KCMSD or the Jenkins Class with respect to\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\ffuture funding issues, they may be presented to the district court in the first instance,\nand any aggrieved party may appeal from any order of that court.\n        The essence of the KCMSD's argument is that it is on the brink of a funding\ncrisis because it is uncertain whether it will have sufficient funds to retire the bonds\nissued to fund the school construction projects ordered in this case. After this appeal\nwas argued, the voters of Missouri by referendum adopted a constitutional amendment\nthat allows the board of the KCMSD to set the tax rate at an amount up to $4.95 for\n$100 assessed valuation. See H.J.R. No. 9. It is now evident that KCMSD can raise\nfunds to retire the bonds. The only contingency would be that the KCMSD board\nwould fail or refuse to vote such levies, which is strictly hypothetical on the record\nbefore us. We believe that the KCMSD is asking for an advisory opinion concerning\nits predicament should certain facts come about. This is a thicket we should not enter.\nSee Preiser v. NewKirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401-03 (1975) (court lacks power to render\nadvisory opinion); Gopher Oil Co. v. Bunker, 84 F. 3d 1047, 1050-51 (8th Cir. 1996)\n(ripeness requires a live dispute, not speculative threat).\n\n        The documents authorizing the issuance of the bonds have declared the intention\nto satisfy the obligation to make payments out of the \"increase in the property tax levy\nof $1.95 per $100 assessed valuation.\" This was a portion of the additional property\ntaxes that were made possible through the procedure suggested by this court and\napproved by the Supreme Court, namely that the school board was authorized to set a\nlevy necessary to fund the operation of the school district, including the desegregation\nfunding; insofar as state laws would interfere with the adoption of said levy, the district\ncourt could enter injunctive orders to set aside the enforcement of such state laws or\nconstitutional provisions. See Jenkins II, 855 F.2d at 1314, aff'd in relevant part, 495\nU.S. 33 (1990). The new constitutional amendment now gives the KCMSD board\nauthority to maintain that part of its levy which has heretofore been devoted to retire\nits indebtedness.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        Should the KCMSD fail to provide sufficient funding to cover retirement of the\nbonds or other obligations, the aggrieved parties can seek appropriate relief. Should\nefforts be made to declare the district unitary before retirement of the obligations for\nthe new construction, the issue can appropriately be determined at that time. Should\nthis issue arise, there will be time enough to bring it before this court.\n\n       New legislation enacted after argument on this appeal, S. Bill No. 781, 89th\nGeneral Assembly (Mo. 1998) (enacted), is expected to result in significant additional\nrevenues to the KCMSD. As the parties make clear, this legislation is contingent upon\nsettlement of the St. Louis school desegregation on or before March 15, 1999. If the\nfunds are available, KCMSD's financial concerns will be greatly alleviated. KCMSD\nagrees that any issue concerning this additional funding is not yet ripe for review\ninsofar as various hypothetical occurrences arise from the arguments of the parties. If\nthe issue requires resolution in the future, it may be addressed on the record then before\nus.\n\n       Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with the clear proviso that if some of the\ncontingencies argued by the parties come to pass the issues may be raised when they\nare ripe and require a decision.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f",

After this appeal\nwas argued, the voters of Missouri by referendum adopted a constitutional amendment\nthat allows the board of the KCMSD to set the tax rate at an amount up to $4.95 for\n$100 assessed valuation. See H.J.R. No. 9. It is now evident that KCMSD can raise\nfunds to retire the bonds. The only contingency would be that the KCMSD board\nwould fail or refuse to vote such levies, which is strictly hypothetical on the record\nbefore us. We believe that the KCMSD is asking for an advisory opinion concerning\nits predicament should certain facts come about. This is a thicket we should not enter.\nSee Preiser v.

See Jenkins II, 855 F.2d at 1314, aff'd in relevant part, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112414\"><a href=\"/opinion/112414/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). The new constitutional amendment now gives the KCMSD board\nauthority to maintain that part of its levy which has heretofore been devoted to retire\nits indebtedness.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        Should the KCMSD fail to provide sufficient funding to cover retirement of the\nbonds or other obligations, the aggrieved parties can seek appropriate relief. Should\nefforts be made to declare the district unitary before retirement of the obligations for\nthe new construction, the issue can appropriately be determined at that time. Should\nthis issue arise, there will be time enough to bring it before this court.\n\n       New legislation enacted after argument on this appeal, S. Bill No. 781, 89th\nGeneral Assembly (Mo. 1998) (enacted), is expected to result in significant additional\nrevenues to the KCMSD. As the parties make clear, this legislation is contingent upon\nsettlement of the St. Louis school desegregation on or before March 15, 1999. If the\nfunds are available, KCMSD's financial concerns will be greatly alleviated. KCMSD\nagrees that any issue concerning this additional funding is not yet ripe for review\ninsofar as various hypothetical occurrences arise from the arguments of the parties. If\nthe issue requires resolution in the future, it may be addressed on the record then before\nus.\n\n       Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with the clear proviso that if some of the\ncontingencies argued by the parties come to pass the issues may be raised when they\nare ripe and require a decision.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f</pre>",
