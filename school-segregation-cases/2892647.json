At the conclusion of a prison misconduct\n\n\n   1\n    Although neither party cited his work, we view our task as\n“Hohfeldian” because Professor Wesley N. Hohfeld is generally\nregarded as the first modern proponent of a relational\nunderstanding of property rights. See Wesley N. Hohfeld, Some\nFundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial\nReasoning, 23 YALE L.J. 16 (1913). As one legal commentator\nhas put it, “[Hohfeld] develop[ed] the now standard idea that\nproperty comprises a complex aggregate of social and legal\nrelationships made up of rights, privileges, powers, and\nimmunities. . . . The Hohfeldian view moved quickly from legal\ntheory into the 1936 Restatement of Property and from there\ninto mainstream scholarship and judicial decisionmaking.”\nMichael Heller, The Boundaries of Private Property, 108 YALE\nL.J. 1163, 1191–92 (1999). The “bundle of rights” theory of\nproperty, however, may actually date back even further, to the\nlate 1800s. Id. at 1191 n.146 (“The earliest use of the term\n‘bundle of rights’ appears to be from John Lewis, in his 1888\nbook, A Treatise on the Law of Eminent Domain: ‘The dullest\nindividual among the people knows and understands that his\nproperty in anything is a bundle of rights.’”) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                3\n\fproceeding, Hearing Examiner Mary Canino determined that\nBurns had committed the assault in question and ordered him to\nserve 180 days in disciplinary custody and to forfeit his prison\njob. Additionally, and of primary interest on appeal, she\nassessed Burns’ inmate account “for Medical or other Expenses”\nassociated with Mobley’s condition after the assault.\n\n        Burns unsuccessfully appealed the disciplinary decision\nto a three-member Program Review Committee, to the\nSuperintendent of the facility, and finally to the Chief Hearing\nExaminer in the Office of Chief Counsel. On July 6, 2005,\nBurns filed a pro se complaint asserting due process and\nretaliation claims against the Pennsylvania Department of\nCorrections and certain named prison officials (collectively, the\n“Department of Corrections”) arising out of the prison’s\ndisciplinary proceedings. The District Court appointed counsel\nand, on January 5, 2007, the parties filed cross-motions for\nSummary Judgment. On February 6, 2007, the District Court\ndenied Burns’ motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\ngranted the Department of Corrections’ motion for Summary\nJudgment.\n\n       The District Court stressed that it had “serious concerns\nthat Defendants’ actions would not satisfy even those minimal\ndue process requirements [guaranteed to persons in prison].”\nBurns v. PA Dept. of Corrections, No. 05-cv-3462, 2007 WL\n442385, at *7 n.2 (E.D. Pa. 2007). Nonetheless, the Court held\nthat Burns was not entitled to such due process protections\nbecause he failed to show a deprivation of a cognizable liberty\n                               4\n\for property interest. This timely appeal followed.\n\n       Because we believe that the Department of Corrections’\nassessment of Burns’ inmate account constituted the impairment\nof a cognizable property interest, we will reverse the District\nCourt’s February 6, 2007 order granting summary judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings.2\n\n                                I.\n\n       In February of 2005, Burns was accused of assaulting a\nfellow inmate, Charles Mobley (“Mobley”), by throwing\nscalding water at Mobley’s face. Prison officials did not\nbecome aware of Mobley’s injuries until four days after they\noccurred, when corrections officers noticed that Mobley had\nsustained minor burns to his face. A nurse at the facility treated\n\n\n   2\n    For the sake of clarity, we note that the Supreme Court has\nheld that the impairment of property rights, even absent the\npermanent physical deprivation of property, is often sufficient\nto trigger due process protections. See, e.g.,Connecticut v.\nDoehr, 501 U.S. 1, 12 (1991) (“[T]he State correctly points out\nthat these effects do not amount to a complete, physical, or\npermanent deprivation of real property . . . . But the Court has\nnever held that only such extreme deprivations trigger due\nprocess concern. To the contrary, our cases show that even the\ntemporary or partial impairments to property rights that\nattachments, liens, and similar encumbrances entail are\nsufficient to merit due process protection.”).\n                                5\n\fMobley’s injuries, cleaned his burn, applied triple antibiotic\nointment, and administered a Tetanus shot. The record does not\nindicate that Mobley received or requested any additional\nmedical attention.\n\n       After he received treatment for his injuries, Mobley\noriginally identified his assailant as one of the inmates in\nBA-1022, a cell shared by Ricky Holmes and Walter Dixon.\nDuring the investigation that followed, the facility’s Security\nCaptain, Thomas Dohman (“Dohman”), interviewed Holmes\nand placed him in Administrative Custody status while the\ninvestigation continued. Thereafter, the Security Department at\nthe facility received two “hotline” calls regarding the incident\nthrough a special phone line set up to allow trusted inmates to\nrelay sensitive information. Both of these confidential\ninformants stated that Holmes was not responsible for the\nassault and that Burns had thrown hot water on Mobley after\nMobley engaged in shadow-boxing around Burns.\n\n       Dohman indicated that he viewed these reports as\ncredible because (1) he recognized the informants’ voices and\nhad received reliable information from them in the past; and (2)\nLt. Abdul Ansari (“Ansari”) separately told him that other\ninmates had reported to Ansari that Burns was responsible for\nthe assault. After receiving this information, Dohman\ninterviewed Burns and concluded that Mobley—who was\napparently “semi-incoherent” at times—had mixed up Holmes\nand Burns in his original identification. Accordingly, Dohman\nplaced Burns in Administrative Custody and continued the\n                               6\n\finvestigation. At that point, Dohman received an anonymous\nletter saying that he had locked up the “right guy.” The record\ndoes not reflect who wrote the letter, but Dohman believed it\nwas someone other than the two confidential informants who\noriginally identified Burns as the assailant.\n\n       On March 7, 2005, Dohman issued a Misconduct Report\nthat charged Burns with assault in connection with the February\n10, 2005 incident. The Misconduct Report alerted Burns to the\ncharges against him and indicated that they were primarily based\nupon information from confidential informants who witnessed\nhim commit the assault. The Report also stated that other\ninmates had informed Lt. Ansari that Burns had committed the\nassault. Consistent with facility procedure, prison officials\nprovided Burns with blank forms, along with the Misconduct\nReport itself, to allow him to request the presence of up to three\nhearing witnesses (one of whom could be a staff member) and\ndraft his own version of events. Burns submitted a witness\nrequest form asking Mobley to testify.\n\n        On March 10, 2005, Hearing Examiner Mary Canino\nconvened Burns’ misconduct hearing. Burns pleaded not guilty\nto all charges and submitted his written version of events, which\ndenied any involvement in the assault and requested a review of\nthe Day Room videotapes where the assault occurred. Examiner\nCanino adjourned the hearing to obtain the videotapes, which\nshe ultimately discovered did not exist. Canino then spoke with\nDohman, in camera, to determine the reliability of the\nconfidential informants whose information figured in the\n                                7\n\fMisconduct Report. Canino did not request the direct testimony\nof the informants, nor did she review their written statements.\nCanino summoned Mobley to testify, but Mobley indicated he\nwas unwilling to do so, even in camera.\n\n        Canino reconvened the proceedings against Burns and\ninformed him that (1) she was satisfied that the confidential\ninformants’ information referenced in the misconduct report was\ncredible based upon her in camera conversation with Dohman;\n(2) no videotapes existed; and (3) Mobley had refused to testify.\nBurns, who contends that he was in a state of disbelief, did not\noffer any further defense. Canino then issued a four-page\nhandwritten decision, in which she determined—by a\npreponderance of the evidence—that Burns had committed the\nassault in question. Accordingly, she ordered him to serve 180\ndays in Disciplinary Custody and to forfeit his prison job.\nAdditionally, she assessed his inmate account “for [Mobley’s]\nMedical or other Expenses.”\n\n                               II.\n\n        Before we address the merits of Burns’ appeal, we must\nconsider our own jurisdiction. On April 10, 2008, following\noral argument in the case, the Department of Corrections sent a\nletter to Burns purporting to declare that it would not take any\nsteps to deduct any money from his inmate account as a result\nof the Mobley incident. The Department of Corrections thus\ncontends that we lack appellate jurisdiction because any due\nprocess claim was rendered moot after this letter was issued.\n                               8\n\fSuch assurances, they argue, eliminated any “cloud” that\nlingered over Burns’ inmate account, and therefore also\naddressed the “basis for Burns’ argument to this court, regarding\nthe alleged impairment of his right to security in his inmate\naccount.” We cannot agree.\n\n        Article III of the U.S. Constitution provides that the\n“judicial Power shall extend to . . . Cases . . . [and] to\nControversies.” U.S. CONST. ART. III, § 2. As we have\nexplained, “[t]his grant of authority embodies a fundamental\nlimitation restricting the federal courts to the adjudication of\n‘actual, ongoing cases or controversies.’” County of Morris v.\nNationalist Movement, 273 F.3d 527, 533 (3d Cir. 2001)\n(citations omitted). “‘[A] case is moot when the issues\npresented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally\ncognizable interest in the outcome.’” Donovan ex rel. Donovan\nv. Punxsutawney Area Sch. Bd., 336 F.3d 211, 216 (3d Cir.\n2003) (quoting Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496\n(1969)). Further, a “court’s ability to grant effective relief lies\nat the heart of the mootness doctrine. That is, ‘[i]f developments\noccur during the course of adjudication that eliminate a\nplaintiff’s personal stake in the outcome of a suit or prevent a\ncourt from being able to grant the requested relief, the case must\nbe dismissed as moot.’” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       “[A]s a general rule, [however,] ‘voluntary cessation of\nallegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power\nto hear and determine the case, i.e., does not make the case\nmoot.’” Los Angeles County v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)\n                                9\n\f(internal citations omitted). To be sure, “jurisdiction, properly\nacquired, may abate if . . . (1) it can be said with assurance that\n‘there is no reasonable expectation . . .’ that the alleged violation\nwill recur, and (2) interim relief or events that have completely\neradicated the effects of the alleged violation.” Id. However, it\nis only “[w]hen both [these] conditions are satisfied . . . that the\ncase is moot . . . .” Id.\n\n        The Department of Corrections argues that its voluntary\npromise to refrain from the future seizure of funds from Burns’\ninmate account, in a letter submitted more than three years after\nit originally assessed that account for medical and other fees,\nobviates Burns’ interest in the case. Such an argument\nfundamentally misreads the nature of Burns’ due process claims.\n“In procedural due process claims, the deprivation by state\naction of a constitutionally protected interest in ‘life, liberty, or\nproperty’ is not in itself unconstitutional; what is\nunconstitutional is the deprivation of such interest without due\nprocess of law.” Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990).\nAccordingly, a procedural due process violation is complete at\nthe moment an individual is deprived of a liberty or property\ninterest without being afforded the requisite process. In this\ncase, Burns’ injury was therefore complete at the time that his\naccount was originally assessed if we assume that (1) the\nDepartment of Corrections impaired a cognizable property\ninterest by virtue of the assessment and (2) the disciplinary\nprocess failed to afford him sufficient process.\n\n       On that basis alone, the Department of Corrections’\n                                10\n\fsuggestion of mootness fails. A completed violation, if proven,\nwould entitle Burns to at least an award of nominal damages.\nMoreover, because of the belated nature of the\nassurance—which was offered more than three years after the\noriginal disciplinary hearing and only after oral argument was\nheard in this case—it is possible that Burns is entitled to a more\nthan nominal award as compensation for the time that his inmate\naccount operated under a cloud. At most, the Department of\nCorrections’ April 10, 2008 letter serves to stop the clock on\npotential damages. As such, we see no evidence that the\nAppellees’ assurances “have completely eradicated the effects\nof the alleged violation.” Davis, 440 U.S. at 631.\n\n       Additionally, the timing and content of the\nCommonwealth’s letter give us pause in considering whether\n“‘there is no reasonable expectation . . .’ that the alleged\nviolation will recur . . . .” Id. Again, the Department of\nCorrections’ assurances were provided exceedingly late in the\ngame. This by no means establishes that it would resume\npursuit of the assessment at the conclusion of litigation. But we\nare more skeptical of voluntary changes that have been made\nlong after litigation has commenced. See DeJohn v. Temple\nUniversity, No. 07-cv-2220, 2008 WL 2952777, at *3 (3d Cir.\n2008). That is especially true where, as here, an assertion of\nmootness would serve to preserve a party’s favorable ruling\nbefore the District Court. As the Supreme Court has instructed,\n“[o]ur interest in preventing litigants from attempting to\nmanipulate the Court’s jurisdiction to insulate a favorable\ndecision from review further counsels against a finding of\n                               11\n\fmootness here.” City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 288\n(2000).\n\n        We also find it significant that the letter in question is\nneither sworn nor notarized, and fails to detail the basis for the\nauthor’s authority. The latter point is relevant, in particular,\nbecause Burns argued on appeal that the Department of\nCorrections is required by law to deduct the type of fees at issue\nin this case. Such lack of specificity, along with the fact that the\nDepartment of Corrections urges us to refrain from vacating the\nfavorable decision entered by the District Court, counsels\nagainst the conclusion that the Appellees have met the “‘heavy,’\neven ‘formidable’ burden” that a party alleging mootness must\nbear. United States v. Gov’t of Virgin Islands, 363 F.3d 276,\n285 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n        Standing alone, Burns’ allegation of a completed\nprocedural due process claim is sufficient to defeat any assertion\nof mootness. The timing and content of the Department of\nCorrections’ assurances similarly counsel in favor of\njurisdiction, given the stringent burden that must be met to\ndemonstrate mootness based upon a party’s voluntary cessation\nof purportedly illegal conduct. United States v. Concentrated\nPhosphate Export Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968) (“The test\nfor mootness in cases [involving voluntary cessation of illegal\nconduct] . . . is a stringent one.”). Accordingly, we are well\nsatisfied of our jurisdiction.\n\n                                III.\n                                12\n\f       The District Court had jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We exercise appellate\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the\nDistrict Court’s grant of summary judgment is plenary. Carter\nv. McGrady, 292 F.3d 152, 157 (3d Cir. 2002). Summary\njudgment is proper where “there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and . . . the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.” FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c). We must draw all\nreasonable inferences from the underlying facts in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Bailey v. United Airlines,\n279 F.3d 194, 198 (3d Cir. 2002); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 322 (1986).\n\n                               IV.\n\n        Burns argues that the District Court erred by concluding\nthat the Department of Corrections’ actions did not constitute a\ndeprivation of a protected property interest for purposes of his\nprocedural due process claim. The Fourteenth Amendment\nprovides that no “State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty,\nor property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend.\nXIV, § 1. To prevail on a procedural due process claim, a\nlitigant must show (1) that the state deprived him of a protected\ninterest in life, liberty, or property and (2) that the deprivation\noccurred without due process of law. Ky. Dep't of Corr. v.\nThompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989); Reynolds v. Wagner, 128\nF.3d 166, 179 (3d Cir. 1997). Burns does not allege any liberty\nviolation. As such, the sole issue on appeal is whether the\nDepartment of Corrections impaired a protected property\n                                13\n\finterest for purposes of procedural due process.3\n\n   3\n    At the outset, we note that determining what constitutes the\nimpairment of a protected property interest for purposes of due\nprocess—as we must do here—is a distinct inquiry from\ndetermining what constitutes a taking for purposes of the\nTakings Clause. “Although there are similarities between the\nprivate interests that are ‘property’ under the Takings and Due\nProcess Clauses, the two clauses are not coterminous regarding\nthe definition of property.” John G. Laitos, LAW OF PROPERTY\nRIGHTS PROTECTION: LIMITATIONS ON GOVERNMENTAL\nPOWER, § 9.04 (Supp. 2001). Five Justices explicitly recognized\nthis distinction in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498\n(1998), which involved both a takings and a due process\nchallenge to a federal statute that sought to impose retroactive\nliability on companies by requiring them to provide retirement\nbenefits for past employees.\n        In Eastern Enterprises, a plurality of the Court, including\nJustices O’Connor, Scalia, Thomas, and then–Chief Justice\nRehnquist, concluded that the statute constituted a taking. The\nfour dissenting Justices—Breyer, Stevens, Ginsburg, and\nSouter—as well as Justice Kennedy, who wrote a separate\nconcurring and dissenting opinion, disagreed and concluded that\nthe statute did not impair an identifiable “property” interest for\npurposes of the Takings Clause. Id. at 539–40. Of greater\nimportance for purposes of this case, however, both Justice\nKennedy and the dissenting Justices recognized that\nnotwithstanding their conclusion that no identifiable property\ninterest had been impaired, the statute might still run afoul of the\nDue Process Clause. Indeed, Justice Kennedy concluded that\nthe Act in question did violate Due Process. As Justice Breyer\n                                14\n\f       “Property interests, of course, are not created by the\nConstitution. Rather they are created and their dimensions are\ndefined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\n\n\n\ninstructed in his dissent, a distinction between what constitutes\n“property” for purposes of the Due Process and Takings Clauses\nmakes sense because:\n\n       [A]pplication of the Due Process Clause [does\n       not] automatically trigger the Takings Clause, just\n       because the word ‘property’ appears in both. That\n       word appears in the midst of different phrases\n       with somewhat different objectives, thereby\n       permitting differences in the way in which the\n       term is interpreted.\n\nId. at 557.\n        This distinction is particularly important where, as here,\na litigant alleges the impairment of a particular ‘right’ out of\ntheir ‘bundle,’ because “[w]hen courts consider whether\nproperty has been ‘taken,’ the entire bundle of rights must be\nconsidered the applicable ‘property[,]’ [whereas] . . . the\n‘property’ that is protected by due process includes any\nsubsidiary property ‘right’ within the bundle of rights.” Laitos,\nsupra, at § 5.02[B]. “‘Property’ as used in the Takings Clause\nis defined much more narrowly than in the due process clause.\nThus, while certain property interests may not be taken without\ndue process, they may be taken without just compensation.”\nLaitos, supra, at § 9.04. We keep this distinction in mind as we\naddress Burns’ instant procedural due process claim.\n                               15\n\findependent source such as state law-rules or understandings\nthat secure certain benefits and that support claims of\nentitlement to those benefits.” Bd. of Regents of State Colleges\nv. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972); see also Phillips v.\nWashington Legal Found., 524 U.S. 156, 163–64 (1998). Thus,\ncourts must look to state law to determine whether a particular\nclaim of right is sufficient to constitute a property interest for\npurposes of the Due Process Clause. Logan v. Zimmerman\nBrush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 430 (1982) (“The hallmark of property\n. . . is an individual entitlement grounded in state law.”); Roth,\n408 U.S. at 577. As an initial matter, it is clear that “[i]nmates\nhave a property interest in funds held in prison accounts.”\nReynolds, 128 F.3d at 179. Accordingly, “inmates are entitled\nto due process with respect to any deprivation of money [from\ntheir accounts].” Higgins v. Beyer, 293 F.3d 683, 693 (3d Cir.\n2002) (citations omitted). Burns does not, however, allege a\nseizure of any funds from his account. Instead, he argues that\nthe Department of Corrections’ assessment of his inmate\naccount for “Medical and other Expenses,” even absent any\nattempt to seize the funds, deprived him of his “right to\nsecurity” in that account.\n\n       The Department of Corrections argues that this Court, as\nwell as other courts of appeals, have implicitly rejected this\nargument in a line of cases recognizing that an actual seizure of\nfunds from an inmate’s account is sufficient to establish a\nproperty deprivation. For example, they cite to Higgins v.\nBeyer, 293 F.3d 683 (3d Cir. 2002), where this Court held that\nthe deprivation of a property interest occurred at the moment\n                               16\n\fprison officials seized money from an inmate’s account. Such\nan argument misreads Higgins and other similar cases, which\ndealt with obvious physical seizures of property from inmates’\naccounts and, as a result, did not require a court to reach the type\nof argument that is advanced here. To be sure, those cases\nestablished that a physical seizure of funds from an inmate’s\naccount is sufficient to constitute the impairment of a property\ninterest, but they did not establish that such a seizure is\nnecessary. As such, no court has either accepted or rejected the\nargument that Burns advances in this case.4 It appears to be an\nissue of first impression across the courts of appeals.\n\n       The right to security has its roots in the “bundle of rights”\ntheory of property, which both the Supreme Court and the Third\nCircuit have embraced in numerous cases over the last seventy\nyears. See, e.g., Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 393\n\n\n    4\n     Our dissenting colleague begins his separate opinion, not\ninappropriately–indeed, to some effect–by quoting an oral\nargument exchange between the author of this opinion and\ncounsel for Burns. Dissenting Op. at 1. To be sure, this prelude\nto the dissent demonstrates some tension between the majority’s\nholding and a line of questioning developed during argument.\nIn reply, we can only harken back to words of Winston\nChurchill when confronted with a similar dilemma: “During a\nlong life I have had to eat my own words many times, and I have\nfound it a very nourishing diet.” See David Cannadine, In\nChurchill's Shadow: Confronting the Past in Modern Britain\n(2003).\n                                17\n\f(1994) (“As we have noted, this right to exclude others is ‘one\nof the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are\ncommonly characterized as property.’”); Hodel v. Irving, 481\nU.S. 704, 716 (1987) (“In Kaiser Aetna v. United States . . . we\nemphasized that the regulation destroyed ‘one of the most\nessential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly\ncharacterized as property—the right to exclude others.’”);\nAndrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65–65 (1979) (referencing a\nbundle of rights as part of takings analysis); Henneford v. Silas\nMason Co., 300 U.S. 577, 582 (1937) (“The privilege of use is\nonly one attribute, among many, of the bundle of privileges that\nmake up property or ownership.”); Flagg Bros., Inc. v.

Duncan, 771 F.2d 707, 716 (3d Cir. 1985) (referencing bundle\nof rights as part of takings analysis). Building on the “bundle of\nrights” theory, Burns argues that the Department of Corrections’\nassessment of his institutional account, even absent an attempt\nto deduct funds from it, constitutes an impairment of a right\ngenerally recognized as one of the incidents of ownership\ncontained in the “bundle.” Specifically, Burns contends that the\nAppellees’ actions impaired his right to security in his inmate\naccount, and thereby impaired his protected property interest in\nthe account itself.\n\n       Because we are aware of no precedential authority\naddressing the right to security, we turn to other sources. Legal\nphilosopher A.M. (Tony) Honoré, a professor at the University\nof Oxford, has identified a right to security as one of the eleven\n                               18\n\f“standard incidents” of property ownership, stating in pertinent\npart:\n\n       Ownership comprises the right to possess, the\n       right to use, the right to manage, the right to the\n       income of the thing, the right to the capital, the\n       right to security, the rights or incidents of\n       transmissibility and absence of term, the\n       prohibition of harmful use, liability to execution,\n       and the incident of residuarity: this makes eleven\n       leading incidents.\n\nA.M. Honore, Ownership, in OXFORD ESSAYS IN\nJURISPRUDENCE 107 (A.G. Guest, ed. 1961), reprinted in Tony\nHonoré, MAKING LAW BIND:                ESSAYS LEGAL AND\nPHILOSOPHICAL (1987) (emphasis added). By and large, legal\ncommentators appear to have accepted Honoré’s list of the\nincidents of property ownership as the basis for modern\nownership. See, e.g., Alan Ryan, PROPERTY 54 (1987) (“[a]\nlegal order recognizes ownership in the full modern sense when\n[Honoré's 11 incidents] are assigned to a single person.”);\nAbraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, A Theory of Property,\n90 CORNELL L. REV. 531, 543–46 (2005) (“A.M. Honoré played\na decisive role in advancing the bundle of rights metaphor by\ncataloguing a generally accepted list of the “incidents” of\nproperty or ownership.”); Denise R. Johnson, Reflections on the\nBundle of Rights, 32 VT. L. REV. 247 (Winter 2007) (“In the\nearly 1960s, A. M. Honoré wrote an essay on ownership in\nwhich he attempted to list the incidents of ownership that have\n\n                               19\n\fcome to be known as the bundle of rights.”). Burns focuses on\nHonoré’s sixth incident of property ownership, the right of\nsecurity, which Lawrence Becker has defined as “immunity\nfrom expropriation.” Lawrence C. Becker, PROPERTY RIGHTS:\nPHILOSOPHIC FOUNDATIONS 19 (1977). More specifically,\nHonoré instructs that:\n\n       An important aspect of the owner’s position is\n       that he should be able to look forward to\n       remaining owner indefinitely if he so chooses and\n       if he remains solvent . . . . Legally, this is in\n       effect an immunity from expropriation, based on\n       rules which provide that, apart from bankruptcy\n       and execution for debt, the transmission of\n       ownership is consensual.\n\nHonoré, Ownership, supra at 171.\n\n       Applying that concept here, Burns argues that the\nassessment of his account constituted a threat of expropriation\nand thereby impaired his right to security in his inmate account.\nMoreover, Burns contends that the assessment placed the\nDepartment of Corrections in a position analogous to that of a\nJudgment Creditor and clearly deprived him of a protected\nproperty interest for purposes of his procedural due process\nclaim. The Appellees correctly argue that this analogy is\nimperfect because the amount of the assessment has never been\nfirmly established. We agree with Burns, however, that the\nDepartment of Corrections acquired something similar to a\n\n\n                               20\n\fmoney judgment5 by assessing his inmate account.\n\n         The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has recognized that\na money judgment constitutes property in its own right. In In re\nUpset Sale, Tax Claim Bureau of Berks County, 479 A.2d 940\n(Pa. 1984), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reaffirmed that\n“a judgment is property and that a judgment creditor’s interest\ncannot be deprived without due process of law.” Id. at 944\n(citing Pennsylvania Co. v. Scott, 29 A.2d 328 (Pa. 1942). In\nreaching that conclusion, the court noted that “judgment\ncreditors are interested in the property of the debtor . . . because\nthey have a right to seize it, sell it, and satisfy the debt from the\nproceeds of the sale.” Id. Indeed, the court instructed further\nthat “[i]t is this very right of execution which gives a judgment\nlien its effectiveness and great value.” Id. We find this decision\nsignificant for two reasons.\n\n       First, the legal right obtained by the Department of\nCorrections through its assessment of Burns’ account mirrors\nthe interest held by a Judgment Creditor under Pennsylvania\nlaw. Again, the Department of Corrections is correct that this\nanalogy is technically imperfect. For example, the amount of\n\n    5\n    The Appellees chose not to directly address the merits of\nBurns’ Judgment Creditor analogy in their Brief. Instead, they\nargued that they do not literally constitute a judgment creditor\nas that term is defined. Significantly, even the Appellees\nconcede in their Brief that the “DOC may have obtained\nsomething akin to a judgment . . . .”\n                                21\n\fthe assessment has never been firmly established, as is required\nfor perfection of a money judgment. But such an argument is\nlargely beside the point. If anything, the differences between\nthe Department of Corrections’ assessment interest and a\ntraditional money judgment demonstrate that the former is\nstronger than the latter.\n\n     With respect to the amount of the assessment, for\nexample, the Department of Corrections—unlike a putative\nJudgment Creditor—controls the process through which the\namount of medical expenses will be determined.6 As such, they\n\n    6\n       The Dissent argues that the interest the Department of\nCorrections acquired through its assessment of Burns’ account\nwas not akin to a money judgment because Burns is entitled to\na “Holloway hearing” before the amount of the assessment can\nbe reduced to a liquidated sum. Dissenting Op. at 10. Where an\ninmate has been found guilty of misconduct and has been\nordered to pay for a financial loss or cost resulting from a\nviolation of written rules governing inmate behavior, the\nfacility’s Business Manager is required by regulation to\ncalculate the amount in question. At that point, the Department\nof Corrections is required to deliver a Notice of Assessment for\nMisconduct to the inmate. The inmate can then challenge the\namount of cost established in the Notice of Assessment for\nMisconduct by requesting a so called “Holloway hearing.” See\nHolloway v. Lehman, 671 A.2d 1179, 1180-82 (Pa. Commw. Ct.\n1996). However, the inmate may not contest his guilt or\ninnocence at such a hearing. See A. 34 (Department of\nCorrections Inmate Discipline Policy). Moreover, in this case,\n                              22\n\fpossess the unilateral authority to reduce their assessment to a\nspecific dollar amount.         Similarly, the Department of\nCorrections need not rely on third party enforcement of their\nassessment interest. Instead, they physically control Burns’\ninstitutional account and can deduct any assessed fees without\nresort to an intermediary. To the extent that the Department of\nCorrections’ assessment interest differs from that of a traditional\nJudgment Creditor, those differences show that the Department\nof Corrections’ interest is actually the stronger and more readily\ncollectable legal right.\n\n       Second, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s recognition\nof a money judgment as “property” is significant because a\ncorollary to a Judgment Creditor’s right of execution is a\nnecessary and inevitable diminution in the economic value of a\ndebtor’s property. The use of economics in legal analysis has\nincreased exponentially over the last three decades, with the\nadvent of the law and economics movement. See Carrie\nMenkel-Meadow, Taking Law and _____Really Seriously:\nBefore, During, and After “The Law,” 60 VAND. L. REV. 555,\n568–70 (2007) (describing the rise of the law and economics\nmovement as a “big bang” in the history of legal studies).\nResort to basic economic theory here is not intended, however,\nto imply that all legal questions should be viewed through a\n“law and economics” lens. See Charles J. Goetz, LAW AND\n\n\n\nneither the fact nor cost of Mobley’s treatment—although not\nyet formally determined—is a disputed issue.\n                                23\n\fECONOMICS: CASES AND MATERIALS 4 (1984) (“Economic\nanalysis is not a single great searchlight that will penetrate and\nilluminate every nook and cranny of the law, but neither is any\nother ‘approach,’ whether it be rooted in ethics, sociology, legal\nhistory, or some other discipline that can be brought to bear on\nlegal problems.”). We do believe, however, that “certain\nconceptual tools created by economists for the analysis of\nexplicitly economic transactions can usefully be adapted to the\nlegal environment.” Id. Moreover, where a legal issue contains\nan explicitly economic component, as does the instant case, the\n“language of economics” is not simply useful but highly\ngermane because it allows us to objectively measure and\ndescribe the economic result of a particular action.\n\n       With both the utility and limitations of applying\neconomic theory to legal analysis clearly in mind, we note that\nthe most basic of economic principles teaches that property\nsubject to seizure—even if the probability and timing of such a\nseizure is unknown—possesses a lesser present day economic\nvalue than property not so encumbered. In economic terms, the\n“expected value” of an account, for example, decreases\ndepending upon the probability that its funds will be seized in\nthe future. See Andreu Mas-Colell et al., MICROECONOMIC\nTHEORY 168–94 (1995) (providing a general discussion of\nexpected value theory); see also Hal R. Varian,\nMICROECONOMIC ANALYSIS 194–95 (3d ed. 1992).\nMathematically, the expected value of an account that is\ncurrently worth V but is subject to seizure would therefore equal\nP*(V) + (1–P)*(V– the amount seized), where ‘P’ equals the\n                               24\n\fprobability that the seizure will not be effectuated. Mas-Colell,\nsupra, at 168–94.\n\n       Similarly, the “expected utility” of Burns’ account is\nalso reduced based upon the probability of seizure.7 The\nexpected utility theory seeks to measure what an asset, such as\nBurns’ institutional account, is “worth,” i.e. what one would pay\nto buy it. As with expected value, the expected utility of an\nasset can also be expressed mathematically. Here, we again\nassume that the value of the account is equal to ‘V’ and the\nprobability of seizure equals ‘P.’ The expected utility (‘U’) then\nequals P*U(V) + (1–P)*U(V–the amount seized). See Lucas,\nsupra note 4, at 1429–45.\n\n       In the context of real property, a simple example of the\nrelationship between an asset’s value or utility and the threat of\nexpropriation can be seen in the divergent market values of an\nestate held in fee simple versus an estate held subject to an\nencumbrance. As with the estate subject to an encumbrance, the\neconomic value of Burns’ institutional account was reduced at\nthe time of the Department of Corrections’ assessment and\nremained impaired for upwards of three years. To borrow from\n\n  7\n    Asset pricing literature suggests that expected utility theory\nis the appropriate way to measure the “value” of an asset. See\nRobert E. Lucas, Jr., Asset Prices in an Exchange Economy, 46\nECONOMETRICA 1429–45 (Nov. 1978); see also Lars Ljungqvist\nand Thomas J. Sargent, RECURSIVE MACROECONOMIC THEORY\n(MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2000).\n                               25\n\fProfessor Honoré, an “important aspect of the owner’s position\nis that he should be able to look forward to remaining owner\nindefinitely if he so chooses . . . .” Honoré, Ownership, supra\nat 171. Burns was denied that aspect of ownership, and was\ntherefore faced with either constantly spending down his\naccount, or potentially losing a portion of his funds through the\nDepartment of Corrections’ discretionary execution of its\nassessment. The existence of such a choice demonstrates how\nBurns’ interest in his institutional account was impaired.8\n\n\n    8\n     The Dissent argues that today’s decision opens a “can of\nworms” by vesting inmates with due process whenever any one\nof Honore’s “incidents” of property are impaired for any length\nof time and for any reason. Dissenting Op. at 6. For example,\nthe Dissent argues that our approach “renders unconstitutional\na host of innocuous DOC regulations that limit, without due\nprocess, inmates’ rights to ‘use’ and ‘transmit’ the fund in their\naccounts” by placing limitations on the number of outside\npurchases an inmate can make or the types of over-the-counter\nmedications they can purchase. Id. at 6-7. Similarly, the\nDissent argues that pursuant to today’s decision, a DOC\nregulation that deprives inmates in disciplinary custody of the\nprivileges of enjoying personal property during the term of such\ncustody would automatically trigger due process protections. As\na result, the Dissent contends that our decision is contrary to the\nSupreme Court’s instruction in Sandin to “‘afford appropriate\ndeference and flexibility to state officials trying to manage a\nvolatile environment’ and thereby limit ‘the involvement of\nfederal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons.’”\nDissenting Op. at 4 (quoting Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n                                26\n\f482 (1995)). Respectfully, the Dissent misreads the breadth and\nimport of our holding.\n         First, we do not hold that any impairment of one of\nHonoré’s “incidents” of property is sufficient to trigger due\nprocess protections. We hold only that the Department of\nCorrections’ assessment of Burns’ institutional account, which\nthis Court has previously recognized as a cognizable property\ninterest, deprived him of a protected property interest where that\nassessment (1) placed the DOC in a position analogous to that\nof a Judgment Creditor; (2) clouded Burns’s account for a\nperiod of more than three years; and (3) reduced the economic\nvalue and utility of that account. Whether the impairment of\nother so-called “incidents” of property is sufficient to trigger the\nprotections of due process is not before us. If it were, however,\nwe would need to look to state law, as we did here, to determine\nwhether a particular claim of right is sufficient to constitute a\nproperty interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause.\nLogan, 455 U.S. at 430 (“The hallmark of property . . . is an\nindividual entitlement grounded in state law.”). Property rights,\nafter all, are “not created by the Constitution. Rather they are\ncreated and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or\nunderstandings that stem from an independent source such as\nstate law-rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and\nthat support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” Bd. of\nRegents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).\n        Second, we disagree with the Dissent’s in terrorem\ncontention that our decision will trigger due process protections\nany time an inmate in disciplinary custody is deprived of access\nto his private property. That a temporary separation of an\ninmate from his personal property is analogous to the\n                                27\n\f                                V.\n\n\n\nassessment at issue here, which placed the DOC in a position\nakin to that of a Judgment Creditor pursuant to state law and\nreduced the economic value of Burns’ account for a period of\nmore than three years is, in our view, too lacking in similitude\nto carry much weight.\n        Finally, we note that even if Due Process protections\nwere triggered by the types of “deprivations” the Dissent\nidentifies, our decision in no way compels a conclusion that\nsuch deprivations are constitutionally infirm. For purposes of\nthis appeal, the only question we need address is whether the\ngovernment has deprived Burns of a property interest; we\nanswer that question in the affirmative. The amount of process\nan inmate is “due” is a distinct inquiry, and we agree that it must\nbe informed by the Supreme Court’s instruction in Sandin to\n“afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials\ntrying to manage a volatile environment” and limit “the\ninvolvement of federal courts in the day-to-day management of\nprisons.” Sandin, 515 U.S at 482. As the Supreme Court\ninstructed in Wolff , “(t)he very nature of due process negates\nany concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to\nevery imaginable situation.” Id. at 560 (quotation omitted). As\nsuch, “consideration of what procedures due process may\nrequire under any given set of circumstances must begin with a\ndetermination of the precise nature of the government function\ninvolved as well as of the private interest that has been affected\nby governmental action.” Id.\n                               28\n\f       In sum, we are satisfied that the Department of\nCorrections’ assessment of Burns’ institutional account\nconstituted the deprivation of a protected property interest for\npurposes of procedural due process. Through its assessment, the\nDepartment of Corrections attained a status akin to that of a\nJudgment Creditor. In doing so, it necessarily reduced the\neconomic value of Burns’ account for a period of more than\nthree years. That deprivation is sufficient to trigger the\nprotections of the Due Process Clause. As such, we will reverse\nthe District Court’s order granting summary judgment in favor\nof the Appellees and remand for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fRodney Burns v. PA Department of Correction, et al.\n\nNo. 07-1678\n\n\n\n\nHARDIMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       Today the Court finds a new property right for purposes\nof 42 U.S.C. § 1983: an inmate’s right to “security” in his\nprison account. As the following colloquy at oral argument\nmakes plain, this Court becomes the first in the Nation to find\nsuch a right:\n\n      JUDGE SMITH: [C]utting to the chase, do you\n      have . . . any authority from this Court or any\n      other Court of Appeals or any other court of\n      record . . . recognizing the right to security that is\n      one of the types of property interests that . . . your\n      arguments suggest[s] are entitled to protection?\n\n      MR. BOERGER: Not a specific reference to the\n      right of security. This is a matter of first\n      impression in this Court.\n\n\n                               30\n\f       JUDGE SMITH: So it is . . . really a creature of\n       academic discussion, not a recognized property\n       interest heretofore by any court?\n\n                               ...\n\n       MR. BOERGER: Yes.\n\n\n\n\nThat no court has previously recognized an inmate’s right to\nsecurity in his prison account does not preclude us from doing\nso today. But the absolute lack of precedent in support of such\na proposition suggests that we should tread cautiously, and I find\nno warrant on the facts presented here to establish a new\nproperty right. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                                I.\n\n       I begin with several points of agreement with the\nMajority’s scholarly opinion. First, the Majority correctly\nrejects the Department of Correction’s (DOC) mootness\nargument. Second, the Majority has properly framed the\nquestion, i.e.: whether Burns has shown that he was deprived of\na property right recognized by Pennsylvania law without due\nprocess. See Ky. Dep’t of Corr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460\n(1989). I also agree with the Majority that Burns does not allege\na deprivation of liberty despite the fact that he was ordered to\nserve 180 days in disciplinary custody as a result of his\n                               31\n\fadministrative conviction. Finally, the Majority properly notes\nthat Burns does not allege a seizure of the funds in his account;\nin fact, no seizure occurred.\n\n        Despite these points of agreement with the Majority, the\nDOC’s mere “assessment” — which has neither been reduced\nto a liquidated sum nor finally adjudicated — does not implicate\na property right recognized under Pennsylvania law.\n\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n        Burns does not challenge the DOC’s decision to place\nhim in disciplinary custody for 180 days. This restriction on\nBurns’s liberty is plainly more significant than the “cloud” over\nhis prison account, but Burns’s strategy to allege a deprivation\nof property rather than liberty is understandable in light of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n486 (1995).\n\n       In Sandin, an inmate serving a 30-year sentence was\nsubjected to an invasive strip search by a prison officer. Id. at\n474-75. After responding with “angry and foul language,” the\ninmate was charged with disciplinary infractions and brought\nbefore an adjustment committee. Id. at 475. Without permitting\nthe inmate to present witnesses in his defense, the adjustment\n                               32\n\fcommittee found him guilty of the alleged misconduct and\nsentenced him to “30 days’ disciplinary segregation in the\nSpecial Holding Unit.” Id. at 475-76. The inmate sued various\nprison officials, claiming that they deprived him of his liberty\nwithout due process of law. Id. at 476.\n\n       The Supreme Court held that the inmate suffered no\ndeprivation actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause his disciplinary segregation “did not present the type of\natypical, significant deprivation in which a State might\nconceivably create a liberty interest.” Id. at 486. Our Court\nfollowed this approach in Torres v. Fauver, where we held that\nan inmate who “was placed in disciplinary detention for 15 days\nand administrative segregation for 120 days” was not “deprived\nof a protected liberty interest.” 292 F.3d 141, 151-52 (3d Cir.\n2002); see also Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 531-32 (3d Cir.\n2003); Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506, 522-23 (3d Cir. 2002);\nShoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 143-44 (3d Cir. 2000); Asquith v.\nDep’t of Corr., 186 F.3d 407, 411-12 (3d Cir. 1999); Griffin v.\nVaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997). Although Sandin\nand its progeny do not control this case, our definition of\nBurns’s property interest should be consistent with their\nteachings.\n\n        Sandin was animated by the Supreme Court’s desire to\nlimit the ability of inmates to derive constitutionally protected\nrights from “prison regulations primarily designed to guide\ncorrectional officials in the administration of a prison.” Sandin,\n515 U.S. at 481-82. In one pre-Sandin case, for example, an\n                               33\n\finmate claimed that pursuant to a prison regulation meant to\nprotect prison officials, he was summarily labeled “incorrigible”\nand deprived of his liberty interest in receiving a tray lunch\nrather than a sack lunch. Burgin v. Nix, 899 F.2d 733, 734 (8th\nCir. 1990); see also Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482-83 (collecting\ncases). Responding to such claims, the Supreme Court sought\nto “afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials\ntrying to manage a volatile environment” and thereby limit “the\ninvolvement of federal courts in the day-to-day management of\nprisons.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482. The Court was also\nconcerned that permitting litigants to derive constitutional rights\nfrom prison regulations ultimately harmed inmates by creating\n“disincentives for States to codify prison management\nprocedures.” Id. To address these concerns, the Court limited\nthe scope of inmates’ liberty interests to situations where the\nstate “imposes atypical and significant hardship . . . in relation\nto the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at 484.\n\n        In light of the substantial narrowing of the inmate’s\nliberty interest in Sandin, the Majority’s decision to broaden the\nscope of inmates’ property interests beyond bounds heretofore\nrecognized by any court of record strikes me as anomalous and\nunwise. By expanding the scope of property rights to include a\nright to “security” in a prison account, the Majority elevates the\npotential future threat of execution on a prison account over the\nactual detriment of spending a significant amount of time in\ndisciplinary custody.\n\n       Moreover, although I accept the Majority’s application of\n                                34\n\fthe Hohfeldian “bundle of rights theory of property” in certain\ncontexts, I disagree that it is an appropriate tool for defining the\nproperty interests at issue here.9 As discussed by Honoré, the\n“bundle of rights” includes eleven incidents of property\nownership: “the right to possess, the right to use, the right to\nmanage, the right to the income of the thing, the right to the\ncapital . . . the rights or incidents of transmissibility and absence\nof term, the prohibition of harmful use, liability to execution,\nand the incident of residuarity.” See Maj. Op. at IV. The\nMajority’s holding suggests that the impairment of any one of\nthese incidents constitutes a deprivation of property sufficient to\ntrigger the procedural protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThis approach is problematic for two reasons.\n\n       First, it permits inmates to circumvent the Supreme\nCourt’s holding that disciplinary segregation does not\nautomatically trigger the procedural protections of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486. A DOC\nregulation prohibits inmates from enjoying the privilege of\npersonal property. See DC-ADM 801 § 6(A)(3) (June 13,\n2008). Under the Majority’s Hohfeldian theory, this regulation\n\n    9\n       I note that the Majority cites only takings cases for the\nproposition that the “bundle of rights theory of property” has\nbeen embraced by the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit\ndespite its observation that “what constitutes the impairment of\na protected property interest for purposes of due process . . . is\na distinct inquiry from determining what constitutes a taking.”\nMaj. Op. at IV.\n                                35\n\fautomatically deprives inmates sentenced to disciplinary\ncustody of personal property by impairing their “right to\npossess” the same during their confinement. By virtue of this\ndeprivation, inmates will always be entitled to due process in\nconjunction with their placement in disciplinary custody, a result\ndirectly contrary to Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484-86.\n\n        Second, the Majority’s approach renders unconstitutional\na host of innocuous DOC regulations that limit, without due\nprocess, inmates’ rights to “use” and “transmit” the funds in\ntheir prison accounts. Although by no means an exhaustive list,\nthe following regulations illustrate the can of worms that I fear\nis opened by today’s decision.\n\n       One policy limits an inmate’s ability to use prison\naccount funds for “outside purchases.” DC-ADM 815 § 2(B)\n(May 12, 2008). Specifically, an inmate is “limited to one\n[outside] order per month” and must submit a written purchase\nrequest for review “by a designated facility official, who will\napprove or disapprove” it pending “[f]inal approval . . . made\nupon inspection when the item is received.” Id. Section\n2(A)(3)(d) limits the over-the-counter medications that an\ninmate is entitled to purchase to those “review[ed] and\napprove[d]” by the “Bureau of Health Care Services.” Id.\nSection 2(A)(7) tasks the “Property Office” with tracking “the\nnumber of shoes and sneakers that are delivered to the inmate,\nfor compliance with the purchasing limitations on these\nproducts.” The foregoing restrictions involve a more direct and\nsubstantial impairment of an inmate’s property rights than the\n                               36\n\f“right to security,” and unlike any impairment suffered by\nBurns, none of these policies affords an inmate an opportunity\nto contest the relevant official’s decision.\n\n        Because these policies impair inmates’ rights to “use”\nand “transmit” funds in their prison accounts — impairments the\nMajority suggests are deprivations of property — inmates would\nbe entitled to due process with respect to every outside purchase,\nevery bottle of aspirin, and every pair of sneakers. This result\nis antithetical to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sandin, which\nrecognized that the “incidents of prison life” involve limitations\non the panoply of rights enjoyed by ordinary citizens. 515 U.S.\nat 485 (citing Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433\nU.S. 119, 125 (1977)) (“Lawful incarceration brings about the\nnecessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and\nrights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our\npenal system.”); Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 510\n(2005) (“[C]ertain privileges and rights must necessarily be\nlimited in the prison context.”).\n\n       Furthermore, the Majority’s holding frustrates the\nSupreme Court's attempt to insulate prison regulations\n“primarily designed to guide correctional officials in the\nadministration of a prison” from constitutional scrutiny and to\n“afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials\ntrying to manage a volatile environment.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at\n481-82. Like the regulation that deprived “incorrigible” inmates\nof potentially-hazardous tray lunches in Burgin, 899 F.2d at 734,\nthe purchasing policies described above are surely not “atypical”\n                                37\n\for “significant” in relation to “the ordinary incidents of prison\nlife.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Accordingly, such regulations\nshould not be interpreted to confer heretofore unrecognized\nrights upon inmates, but such an interpretation is unavoidable\ngiven the Majority’s decision today.\n\n        In light of the foregoing, I would reject the Majority’s\nconclusion that by clouding his prison account with the “threat\nof expropriation,” the DOC deprived Burns of property. Maj.\nOp. at IV. This threat to the “security” of his account — which,\nit should be emphasized, remains to this day an account that\nBurns is free to access and deplete — is simply not an “atypical\nand significant hardship . . . in relation to the ordinary incidents\nof prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n\n                                III.\n\n       This is not to say that inmates have no “property interest\nin funds held in prison accounts,” or that they are not entitled to\n“due process with respect to any deprivation of money” from\ntheir accounts. Maj. Op. at IV (citations omitted). I simply\ncontend that Burns’s property interest is not so broad and\namorphous as the Majority suggests. Given the more limited\nnature of inmates’ property rights vís-a-vís ordinary citizens, see\nPart II, supra, I would hold, as this Court has previously\nsuggested, that an inmate suffers a deprivation of property “at\nthe moment” the prison “employees seize[] the money in [the]\ninmate account.” Higgins v. Beyer, 293 F.3d 683, 694 n.3 (3d\nCir. 2002). This sensible rule comports with a Supreme Court\n                                38\n\fcase not mentioned by the Majority.\n\n        In American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company\nv. Sullivan, a class of employees sued Pennsylvania state\nofficials, claiming that Pennsylvania’s Workers’ Compensation\nAct deprived them of property without due process. 526 U.S. at\n40, 48 (1999). The Act permitted insurance companies to\nwithhold reimbursements for medical treatment from workers\nwho suffered job-related injuries until private “utilization review\norganizations” determined that the treatment was “reasonable or\nnecessary for the medical condition of the employee.” Id. at 46-\n48 (internal citations omitted). Rejecting the employees’ claim\nthat they were entitled to the benefits as soon as the employers’\nliability was established, the Supreme Court held that the\nemployees “do not have a property interest” in the benefits until\nthey “establish that the particular medical treatment . . . [was]\nreasonable and necessary.” Id. at 61.\n\n       As in Sullivan, Burns’s liability for the assault had been\nestablished, but the DOC had not attempted to quantify the\namount of his liability, which is a prerequisite to deducting\nmoney from his account. App’x 33-35. Furthermore, as\nBurns’s counsel admitted at oral argument, the funds in Burns’s\naccount remained freely alienable at all relevant times. See also\nApp’x 35 (indicating that funds in an inmate’s account remain\nfreely alienable until “receipt of a decision imposing an\nassessment against the inmate” by the Business Manager). In\naddition, before the DOC could execute its assessment, Burns\nwas entitled to additional process, including: (1) a “Holloway\n                               39\n\fhearing” to determine “the amount of financial loss or costs, if\nany,”10 and (2) an appeal from this determination. App’x 33-35\n(emphasis added); see Holloway v. Lehman, 671 A.2d 1179,\n1180-82 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1996). Thus, the DOC cannot\ndeprive Burns of funds in his prison account until it establishes\n“the amount of financial loss or cost, if any.” Because it is\nundisputed that the DOC never established (or even attempted\nto establish) this amount, I would hold that Burns has not\nsuffered a deprivation of property.\n\n       For the same reason, I would reject Burns’s argument\nthat the DOC acquired a property interest in his account as a\n“judgment creditor” that diminished the economic value of his\nproperty. Maj. Op. at IV. As the Majority recognizes, a creditor\ncannot execute on a money judgment until it is reduced to a\nliquidated sum. See id. Here, it is undisputed that the DOC\nnever established Burns’s financial liability, if any. The\nMajority dismisses this distinction as “beside the point” because\nthe DOC possessed “unilateral authority to reduce their\nassessment to a specific dollar amount” and to “deduct any\nassessed fees without resort to an intermediary.” Id. (emphasis\nadded). Much like a judgment debtor in state court, however,\nBurns is entitled to notice, a hearing, and an appeal before his\n\n  10\n      Burns argues that once his disciplinary conviction become\nfinal, deduction of medical expenses from this account “was\nrequired by operation of law.” To the contrary, the “if any”\nlanguage in the regulations suggests that the Holloway hearing\ncould result in the assessment of no damages.\n                               40\n\faccount can be debited.11 See Holloway, 671 A.2d at 1180-82;\nApp’x 33-35. If the DOC decides to pursue this course of\naction, Burns will then be entitled to his day in court. As the\nDistrict Court stated:\n\n         Should Defendants or other [Department of\n         Corrections] officials seize any funds from\n         [Burns’s] inmate account for the payment of\n         medical or other expenses resulting from\n         Mobley’s assault, this Court would grant [Burns]\n         leave to re-file his due process challenges to his\n         disciplinary process.\n\nBurns v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., Civ. No. 05-3462, 2007 WL\n442385, at *4 n.2 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 6, 2007).\n\n                                IV.\n\n       In the absence of any authority, the Majority turns to\nscholarly writings to hold that an inmate has a property right in\nthe “security” of his prison account. I cannot abide the\nMajority’s elevation of an inmate’s property rights over his\n\n    11\n        Ironically, the rule established by the Majority confers\nmore process upon an inmate than a private citizen. Under\nPennsylvania law, a judgment creditor may confess judgment\nand begin executing on the judgment debtor’s assets unless and\nuntil the judgment debtor files a petition to open or strike the\nconfessed judgment. See Pa. R.C.P. 2956.1.\n                                41\n\fliberty rights as delineated by the Supreme Court in Sandin.\nLikewise, if the property rights inside the prison walls are\ncoextensive with Honoré’s “incidents of property,” several\nregulations promulgated by the Department of Corrections to\nregulate the daily lives of inmates are constitutionally suspect.\nIn addition to these concerns on the merits, I fear that today’s\ndecision will spawn a new generation of unwarranted due\nprocess challenges akin to those that laid the foundation for\nSandin. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               42\n\f",

At the conclusion of a prison misconduct\n\n\n   1\n    Although neither party cited his work, we view our task as\n“Hohfeldian” because Professor Wesley N. Hohfeld is generally\nregarded as the first modern proponent of a relational\nunderstanding of property rights. See Wesley N. Hohfeld, Some\nFundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial\nReasoning, 23 YALE L.J. 16 (1913). As one legal commentator\nhas put it, “[Hohfeld] develop[ed] the now standard idea that\nproperty comprises a complex aggregate of social and legal\nrelationships made up of rights, privileges, powers, and\nimmunities. . . . The Hohfeldian view moved quickly from legal\ntheory into the 1936 Restatement of Property and from there\ninto mainstream scholarship and judicial decisionmaking.”\nMichael Heller, The Boundaries of Private Property, 108 YALE\nL.J. 1163, 1191–92 (1999). The “bundle of rights” theory of\nproperty, however, may actually date back even further, to the\nlate 1800s. Id. at 1191 n.146 (“The earliest use of the term\n‘bundle of rights’ appears to be from John Lewis, in his 1888\nbook, A Treatise on the Law of Eminent Domain: ‘The dullest\nindividual among the people knows and understands that his\nproperty in anything is a bundle of rights.’”) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                3\n\fproceeding, Hearing Examiner Mary Canino determined that\nBurns had committed the assault in question and ordered him to\nserve 180 days in disciplinary custody and to forfeit his prison\njob. Additionally, and of primary interest on appeal, she\nassessed Burns’ inmate account “for Medical or other Expenses”\nassociated with Mobley’s condition after the assault.\n\n        Burns unsuccessfully appealed the disciplinary decision\nto a three-member Program Review Committee, to the\nSuperintendent of the facility, and finally to the Chief Hearing\nExaminer in the Office of Chief Counsel. On July 6, 2005,\nBurns filed a pro se complaint asserting due process and\nretaliation claims against the Pennsylvania Department of\nCorrections and certain named prison officials (collectively, the\n“Department of Corrections”) arising out of the prison’s\ndisciplinary proceedings. The District Court appointed counsel\nand, on January 5, 2007, the parties filed cross-motions for\nSummary Judgment. On February 6, 2007, the District Court\ndenied Burns’ motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\ngranted the Department of Corrections’ motion for Summary\nJudgment.\n\n       The District Court stressed that it had “serious concerns\nthat Defendants’ actions would not satisfy even those minimal\ndue process requirements [guaranteed to persons in prison].”\nBurns v. PA Dept. of Corrections, No. 05-cv-3462, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">442385</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 n.2 (E.D. Pa. 2007). Nonetheless, the Court held\nthat Burns was not entitled to such due process protections\nbecause he failed to show a deprivation of a cognizable liberty\n                               4\n\for property interest. This timely appeal followed.\n\n       Because we believe that the Department of Corrections’\nassessment of Burns’ inmate account constituted the impairment\nof a cognizable property interest, we will reverse the District\nCourt’s February 6, 2007 order granting summary judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings.2\n\n                                I.\n\n       In February of 2005, Burns was accused of assaulting a\nfellow inmate, Charles Mobley (“Mobley”), by throwing\nscalding water at Mobley’s face. Prison officials did not\nbecome aware of Mobley’s injuries until four days after they\noccurred, when corrections officers noticed that Mobley had\nsustained minor burns to his face. A nurse at the facility treated\n\n\n   2\n    For the sake of clarity, we note that the Supreme Court has\nheld that the impairment of property rights, even absent the\npermanent physical deprivation of property, is often sufficient\nto trigger due process protections. See, e.g.,Connecticut v.\nDoehr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112615\"><a href=\"/opinion/112615/connecticut-v-doehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1991) (“[T]he State correctly points out\nthat these effects do not amount to a complete, physical, or\npermanent deprivation of real property . . . . But the Court has\nnever held that only such extreme deprivations trigger due\nprocess concern. To the contrary, our cases show that even the\ntemporary or partial impairments to property rights that\nattachments, liens, and similar encumbrances entail are\nsufficient to merit due process protection.”).\n                                5\n\fMobley’s injuries, cleaned his burn, applied triple antibiotic\nointment, and administered a Tetanus shot. The record does not\nindicate that Mobley received or requested any additional\nmedical attention.\n\n       After he received treatment for his injuries, Mobley\noriginally identified his assailant as one of the inmates in\nBA-1022, a cell shared by Ricky Holmes and Walter Dixon.\nDuring the investigation that followed, the facility’s Security\nCaptain, Thomas Dohman (“Dohman”), interviewed Holmes\nand placed him in Administrative Custody status while the\ninvestigation continued. Thereafter, the Security Department at\nthe facility received two “hotline” calls regarding the incident\nthrough a special phone line set up to allow trusted inmates to\nrelay sensitive information. Both of these confidential\ninformants stated that Holmes was not responsible for the\nassault and that Burns had thrown hot water on Mobley after\nMobley engaged in shadow-boxing around Burns.\n\n       Dohman indicated that he viewed these reports as\ncredible because (1) he recognized the informants’ voices and\nhad received reliable information from them in the past; and (2)\nLt. Abdul Ansari (“Ansari”) separately told him that other\ninmates had reported to Ansari that Burns was responsible for\nthe assault. After receiving this information, Dohman\ninterviewed Burns and concluded that Mobley—who was\napparently “semi-incoherent” at times—had mixed up Holmes\nand Burns in his original identification. Accordingly, Dohman\nplaced Burns in Administrative Custody and continued the\n                               6\n\finvestigation. At that point, Dohman received an anonymous\nletter saying that he had locked up the “right guy.” The record\ndoes not reflect who wrote the letter, but Dohman believed it\nwas someone other than the two confidential informants who\noriginally identified Burns as the assailant.\n\n       On March 7, 2005, Dohman issued a Misconduct Report\nthat charged Burns with assault in connection with the February\n10, 2005 incident. The Misconduct Report alerted Burns to the\ncharges against him and indicated that they were primarily based\nupon information from confidential informants who witnessed\nhim commit the assault. The Report also stated that other\ninmates had informed Lt. Ansari that Burns had committed the\nassault. Consistent with facility procedure, prison officials\nprovided Burns with blank forms, along with the Misconduct\nReport itself, to allow him to request the presence of up to three\nhearing witnesses (one of whom could be a staff member) and\ndraft his own version of events. Burns submitted a witness\nrequest form asking Mobley to testify.\n\n        On March 10, 2005, Hearing Examiner Mary Canino\nconvened Burns’ misconduct hearing. Burns pleaded not guilty\nto all charges and submitted his written version of events, which\ndenied any involvement in the assault and requested a review of\nthe Day Room videotapes where the assault occurred. Examiner\nCanino adjourned the hearing to obtain the videotapes, which\nshe ultimately discovered did not exist. Canino then spoke with\nDohman, in camera, to determine the reliability of the\nconfidential informants whose information figured in the\n                                7\n\fMisconduct Report. Canino did not request the direct testimony\nof the informants, nor did she review their written statements.\nCanino summoned Mobley to testify, but Mobley indicated he\nwas unwilling to do so, even in camera.\n\n        Canino reconvened the proceedings against Burns and\ninformed him that (1) she was satisfied that the confidential\ninformants’ information referenced in the misconduct report was\ncredible based upon her in camera conversation with Dohman;\n(2) no videotapes existed; and (3) Mobley had refused to testify.\nBurns, who contends that he was in a state of disbelief, did not\noffer any further defense. Canino then issued a four-page\nhandwritten decision, in which she determined—by a\npreponderance of the evidence—that Burns had committed the\nassault in question. Accordingly, she ordered him to serve 180\ndays in Disciplinary Custody and to forfeit his prison job.\nAdditionally, she assessed his inmate account “for [Mobley’s]\nMedical or other Expenses.”\n\n                               II.\n\n        Before we address the merits of Burns’ appeal, we must\nconsider our own jurisdiction. On April 10, 2008, following\noral argument in the case, the Department of Corrections sent a\nletter to Burns purporting to declare that it would not take any\nsteps to deduct any money from his inmate account as a result\nof the Mobley incident. The Department of Corrections thus\ncontends that we lack appellate jurisdiction because any due\nprocess claim was rendered moot after this letter was issued.\n                               8\n\fSuch assurances, they argue, eliminated any “cloud” that\nlingered over Burns’ inmate account, and therefore also\naddressed the “basis for Burns’ argument to this court, regarding\nthe alleged impairment of his right to security in his inmate\naccount.” We cannot agree.\n\n        Article III of the U.S. Constitution provides that the\n“judicial Power shall extend to . . . Cases . . . [and] to\nControversies.” U.S. CONST. ART. III, § 2.

Further, a “court’s ability to grant effective relief lies\nat the heart of the mootness doctrine.

To be sure, “jurisdiction, properly\nacquired, may abate if . . . (1) it can be said with assurance that\n‘there is no reasonable expectation . . .’ that the alleged violation\nwill recur, and (2) interim relief or events that have completely\neradicated the effects of the alleged violation.” Id. However, it\nis only “[w]hen both [these] conditions are satisfied . . . that the\ncase is moot . . . .” Id.\n\n        The Department of Corrections argues that its voluntary\npromise to refrain from the future seizure of funds from Burns’\ninmate account, in a letter submitted more than three years after\nit originally assessed that account for medical and other fees,\nobviates Burns’ interest in the case. Such an argument\nfundamentally misreads the nature of Burns’ due process claims.\n“In procedural due process claims, the deprivation by state\naction of a constitutionally protected interest in ‘life, liberty, or\nproperty’ is not in itself unconstitutional; what is\nunconstitutional is the deprivation of such interest without due\nprocess of law.” Zinermon v. Burch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620710\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620710/zinermon-v-burch/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125 (1990).\nAccordingly, a procedural due process violation is complete at\nthe moment an individual is deprived of a liberty or property\ninterest without being afforded the requisite process. In this\ncase, Burns’ injury was therefore complete at the time that his\naccount was originally assessed if we assume that (1) the\nDepartment of Corrections impaired a cognizable property\ninterest by virtue of the assessment and (2) the disciplinary\nprocess failed to afford him sufficient process.\n\n       On that basis alone, the Department of Corrections’\n                                10\n\fsuggestion of mootness fails. A completed violation, if proven,\nwould entitle Burns to at least an award of nominal damages.\nMoreover, because of the belated nature of the\nassurance—which was offered more than three years after the\noriginal disciplinary hearing and only after oral argument was\nheard in this case—it is possible that Burns is entitled to a more\nthan nominal award as compensation for the time that his inmate\naccount operated under a cloud. At most, the Department of\nCorrections’ April 10, 2008 letter serves to stop the clock on\npotential damages. As such, we see no evidence that the\nAppellees’ assurances “have completely eradicated the effects\nof the alleged violation.” Davis, 440 U.S. at 631.\n\n       Additionally, the timing and content of the\nCommonwealth’s letter give us pause in considering whether\n“‘there is no reasonable expectation . . .’ that the alleged\nviolation will recur . . . .” Id. Again, the Department of\nCorrections’ assurances were provided exceedingly late in the\ngame. This by no means establishes that it would resume\npursuit of the assessment at the conclusion of litigation. But we\nare more skeptical of voluntary changes that have been made\nlong after litigation has commenced. See DeJohn v. Temple\nUniversity, No. 07-cv-2220, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2952777</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (3d Cir.\n2008). That is especially true where, as here, an assertion of\nmootness would serve to preserve a party’s favorable ruling\nbefore the District Court. As the Supreme Court has instructed,\n“[o]ur interest in preventing litigants from attempting to\nmanipulate the Court’s jurisdiction to insulate a favorable\ndecision from review further counsels against a finding of\n                               11\n\fmootness here.” City of Erie v.

The latter point is relevant, in particular,\nbecause Burns argued on appeal that the Department of\nCorrections is required by law to deduct the type of fees at issue\nin this case. Such lack of specificity, along with the fact that the\nDepartment of Corrections urges us to refrain from vacating the\nfavorable decision entered by the District Court, counsels\nagainst the conclusion that the Appellees have met the “‘heavy,’\neven ‘formidable’ burden” that a party alleging mootness must\nbear. United States v. Gov’t of Virgin Islands, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785666\"><a href=\"/opinion/785666/united-states-v-government-of-the-virgin-islands/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n285 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n        Standing alone, Burns’ allegation of a completed\nprocedural due process claim is sufficient to defeat any assertion\nof mootness. The timing and content of the Department of\nCorrections’ assurances similarly counsel in favor of\njurisdiction, given the stringent burden that must be met to\ndemonstrate mootness based upon a party’s voluntary cessation\nof purportedly illegal conduct.

Burns does not allege any liberty\nviolation.

Laitos, LAW OF PROPERTY\nRIGHTS PROTECTION: LIMITATIONS ON GOVERNMENTAL\nPOWER, § 9.04 (Supp. 2001). Five Justices explicitly recognized\nthis distinction in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118239\"><a href=\"/opinion/118239/eastern-enterprises-v-apfel/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1998), which involved both a takings and a due process\nchallenge to a federal statute that sought to impose retroactive\nliability on companies by requiring them to provide retirement\nbenefits for past employees.\n        In Eastern Enterprises, a plurality of the Court, including\nJustices O’Connor, Scalia, Thomas, and then–Chief Justice\nRehnquist, concluded that the statute constituted a taking. The\nfour dissenting Justices—Breyer, Stevens, Ginsburg, and\nSouter—as well as Justice Kennedy, who wrote a separate\nconcurring and dissenting opinion, disagreed and concluded that\nthe statute did not impair an identifiable “property” interest for\npurposes of the Takings Clause. Id. at 539–40. Of greater\nimportance for purposes of this case, however, both Justice\nKennedy and the dissenting Justices recognized that\nnotwithstanding their conclusion that no identifiable property\ninterest had been impaired, the statute might still run afoul of the\nDue Process Clause. Indeed, Justice Kennedy concluded that\nthe Act in question did violate Due Process. As Justice Breyer\n                                14\n\f       “Property interests, of course, are not created by the\nConstitution.

That\n       word appears in the midst of different phrases\n       with somewhat different objectives, thereby\n       permitting differences in the way in which the\n       term is interpreted.\n\nId. at 557.\n        This distinction is particularly important where, as here,\na litigant alleges the impairment of a particular ‘right’ out of\ntheir ‘bundle,’ because “[w]hen courts consider whether\nproperty has been ‘taken,’ the entire bundle of rights must be\nconsidered the applicable ‘property[,]’ [whereas] . . . the\n‘property’ that is protected by due process includes any\nsubsidiary property ‘right’ within the bundle of rights.” Laitos,\nsupra, at § 5.02[B]. “‘Property’ as used in the Takings Clause\nis defined much more narrowly than in the due process clause.\nThus, while certain property interests may not be taken without\ndue process, they may be taken without just compensation.”\nLaitos, supra, at § 9.04.

Instead, he argues that\nthe Department of Corrections’ assessment of his inmate\naccount for “Medical and other Expenses,” even absent any\nattempt to seize the funds, deprived him of his “right to\nsecurity” in that account.\n\n       The Department of Corrections argues that this Court, as\nwell as other courts of appeals, have implicitly rejected this\nargument in a line of cases recognizing that an actual seizure of\nfunds from an inmate’s account is sufficient to establish a\nproperty deprivation. For example, they cite to Higgins v.\nBeyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778009\"><a href=\"/opinion/778009/vincent-m-higgins-v-howard-l-beyer-department-of-corrections-william-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2002), where this Court held that\nthe deprivation of a property interest occurred at the moment\n                               16\n\fprison officials seized money from an inmate’s account. Such\nan argument misreads Higgins and other similar cases, which\ndealt with obvious physical seizures of property from inmates’\naccounts and, as a result, did not require a court to reach the type\nof argument that is advanced here. To be sure, those cases\nestablished that a physical seizure of funds from an inmate’s\naccount is sufficient to constitute the impairment of a property\ninterest, but they did not establish that such a seizure is\nnecessary. As such, no court has either accepted or rejected the\nargument that Burns advances in this case.4 It appears to be an\nissue of first impression across the courts of appeals.\n\n       The right to security has its roots in the “bundle of rights”\ntheory of property, which both the Supreme Court and the Third\nCircuit have embraced in numerous cases over the last seventy\nyears.

Building on the “bundle of\nrights” theory, Burns argues that the Department of Corrections’\nassessment of his institutional account, even absent an attempt\nto deduct funds from it, constitutes an impairment of a right\ngenerally recognized as one of the incidents of ownership\ncontained in the “bundle.” Specifically, Burns contends that the\nAppellees’ actions impaired his right to security in his inmate\naccount, and thereby impaired his protected property interest in\nthe account itself.\n\n       Because we are aware of no precedential authority\naddressing the right to security, we turn to other sources. Legal\nphilosopher A.M. (Tony) Honoré, a professor at the University\nof Oxford, has identified a right to security as one of the eleven\n                               18\n\f“standard incidents” of property ownership, stating in pertinent\npart:\n\n       Ownership comprises the right to possess, the\n       right to use, the right to manage, the right to the\n       income of the thing, the right to the capital, the\n       right to security, the rights or incidents of\n       transmissibility and absence of term, the\n       prohibition of harmful use, liability to execution,\n       and the incident of residuarity: this makes eleven\n       leading incidents.\n\nA.M. Honore, Ownership, in OXFORD ESSAYS IN\nJURISPRUDENCE 107 (A.G. Guest, ed. 1961), reprinted in Tony\nHonoré, MAKING LAW BIND:                ESSAYS LEGAL AND\nPHILOSOPHICAL (1987) (emphasis added). By and large, legal\ncommentators appear to have accepted Honoré’s list of the\nincidents of property ownership as the basis for modern\nownership. See, e.g., Alan Ryan, PROPERTY 54 (1987) (“[a]\nlegal order recognizes ownership in the full modern sense when\n[Honoré's 11 incidents] are assigned to a single person.”);\nAbraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, A Theory of Property,\n90 CORNELL L. REV. 531, 543–46 (2005) (“A.M. Honoré played\na decisive role in advancing the bundle of rights metaphor by\ncataloguing a generally accepted list of the “incidents” of\nproperty or ownership.”); Denise R. Johnson, Reflections on the\nBundle of Rights, 32 VT. L. REV. 247 (Winter 2007) (“In the\nearly 1960s, A. M. Honoré wrote an essay on ownership in\nwhich he attempted to list the incidents of ownership that have\n\n                               19\n\fcome to be known as the bundle of rights.”). Burns focuses on\nHonoré’s sixth incident of property ownership, the right of\nsecurity, which Lawrence Becker has defined as “immunity\nfrom expropriation.” Lawrence C. Becker, PROPERTY RIGHTS:\nPHILOSOPHIC FOUNDATIONS 19 (1977). More specifically,\nHonoré instructs that:\n\n       An important aspect of the owner’s position is\n       that he should be able to look forward to\n       remaining owner indefinitely if he so chooses and\n       if he remains solvent . . . . Legally, this is in\n       effect an immunity from expropriation, based on\n       rules which provide that, apart from bankruptcy\n       and execution for debt, the transmission of\n       ownership is consensual.\n\nHonoré, Ownership, supra at 171.\n\n       Applying that concept here, Burns argues that the\nassessment of his account constituted a threat of expropriation\nand thereby impaired his right to security in his inmate account.\nMoreover, Burns contends that the assessment placed the\nDepartment of Corrections in a position analogous to that of a\nJudgment Creditor and clearly deprived him of a protected\nproperty interest for purposes of his procedural due process\nclaim. The Appellees correctly argue that this analogy is\nimperfect because the amount of the assessment has never been\nfirmly established. We agree with Burns, however, that the\nDepartment of Corrections acquired something similar to a\n\n\n                               20\n\fmoney judgment5 by assessing his inmate account.\n\n         The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has recognized that\na money judgment constitutes property in its own right. In In re\nUpset Sale, Tax Claim Bureau of Berks County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403312\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403312/in-re-upset-sale-tax-cl-bureau-of-berks/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Pa. 1984), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reaffirmed that\n“a judgment is property and that a judgment creditor’s interest\ncannot be deprived without due process of law.” Id. at 944\n(citing Pennsylvania Co. v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1942). In\nreaching that conclusion, the court noted that “judgment\ncreditors are interested in the property of the debtor . . . because\nthey have a right to seize it, sell it, and satisfy the debt from the\nproceeds of the sale.” Id. Indeed, the court instructed further\nthat “[i]t is this very right of execution which gives a judgment\nlien its effectiveness and great value.” Id. We find this decision\nsignificant for two reasons.\n\n       First, the legal right obtained by the Department of\nCorrections through its assessment of Burns’ account mirrors\nthe interest held by a Judgment Creditor under Pennsylvania\nlaw. Again, the Department of Corrections is correct that this\nanalogy is technically imperfect. For example, the amount of\n\n    5\n    The Appellees chose not to directly address the merits of\nBurns’ Judgment Creditor analogy in their Brief. Instead, they\nargued that they do not literally constitute a judgment creditor\nas that term is defined. Significantly, even the Appellees\nconcede in their Brief that the “DOC may have obtained\nsomething akin to a judgment . . . .”\n                                21\n\fthe assessment has never been firmly established, as is required\nfor perfection of a money judgment. But such an argument is\nlargely beside the point. If anything, the differences between\nthe Department of Corrections’ assessment interest and a\ntraditional money judgment demonstrate that the former is\nstronger than the latter.\n\n     With respect to the amount of the assessment, for\nexample, the Department of Corrections—unlike a putative\nJudgment Creditor—controls the process through which the\namount of medical expenses will be determined.6 As such, they\n\n    6\n       The Dissent argues that the interest the Department of\nCorrections acquired through its assessment of Burns’ account\nwas not akin to a money judgment because Burns is entitled to\na “Holloway hearing” before the amount of the assessment can\nbe reduced to a liquidated sum. Dissenting Op. at 10. Where an\ninmate has been found guilty of misconduct and has been\nordered to pay for a financial loss or cost resulting from a\nviolation of written rules governing inmate behavior, the\nfacility’s Business Manager is required by regulation to\ncalculate the amount in question. At that point, the Department\nof Corrections is required to deliver a Notice of Assessment for\nMisconduct to the inmate. The inmate can then challenge the\namount of cost established in the Notice of Assessment for\nMisconduct by requesting a so called “Holloway hearing.” See\nHolloway v. Lehman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1180-82 (Pa. Commw. Ct.\n1996). However, the inmate may not contest his guilt or\ninnocence at such a hearing. See A. 34 (Department of\nCorrections Inmate Discipline Policy). Moreover, in this case,\n                              22\n\fpossess the unilateral authority to reduce their assessment to a\nspecific dollar amount.         Similarly, the Department of\nCorrections need not rely on third party enforcement of their\nassessment interest. Instead, they physically control Burns’\ninstitutional account and can deduct any assessed fees without\nresort to an intermediary. To the extent that the Department of\nCorrections’ assessment interest differs from that of a traditional\nJudgment Creditor, those differences show that the Department\nof Corrections’ interest is actually the stronger and more readily\ncollectable legal right.\n\n       Second, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s recognition\nof a money judgment as “property” is significant because a\ncorollary to a Judgment Creditor’s right of execution is a\nnecessary and inevitable diminution in the economic value of a\ndebtor’s property. The use of economics in legal analysis has\nincreased exponentially over the last three decades, with the\nadvent of the law and economics movement. See Carrie\nMenkel-Meadow, Taking Law and _____Really Seriously:\nBefore, During, and After “The Law,” 60 VAND. L. REV. 555,\n568–70 (2007) (describing the rise of the law and economics\nmovement as a “big bang” in the history of legal studies).\nResort to basic economic theory here is not intended, however,\nto imply that all legal questions should be viewed through a\n“law and economics” lens. See Charles J. Goetz, LAW AND\n\n\n\nneither the fact nor cost of Mobley’s treatment—although not\nyet formally determined—is a disputed issue.\n                                23\n\fECONOMICS: CASES AND MATERIALS 4 (1984) (“Economic\nanalysis is not a single great searchlight that will penetrate and\nilluminate every nook and cranny of the law, but neither is any\nother ‘approach,’ whether it be rooted in ethics, sociology, legal\nhistory, or some other discipline that can be brought to bear on\nlegal problems.”). We do believe, however, that “certain\nconceptual tools created by economists for the analysis of\nexplicitly economic transactions can usefully be adapted to the\nlegal environment.” Id. Moreover, where a legal issue contains\nan explicitly economic component, as does the instant case, the\n“language of economics” is not simply useful but highly\ngermane because it allows us to objectively measure and\ndescribe the economic result of a particular action.\n\n       With both the utility and limitations of applying\neconomic theory to legal analysis clearly in mind, we note that\nthe most basic of economic principles teaches that property\nsubject to seizure—even if the probability and timing of such a\nseizure is unknown—possesses a lesser present day economic\nvalue than property not so encumbered. In economic terms, the\n“expected value” of an account, for example, decreases\ndepending upon the probability that its funds will be seized in\nthe future. See Andreu Mas-Colell et al., MICROECONOMIC\nTHEORY 168–94 (1995) (providing a general discussion of\nexpected value theory); see also Hal R. Varian,\nMICROECONOMIC ANALYSIS 194–95 (3d ed. 1992).\nMathematically, the expected value of an account that is\ncurrently worth V but is subject to seizure would therefore equal\nP*(V) + (1–P)*(V– the amount seized), where ‘P’ equals the\n                               24\n\fprobability that the seizure will not be effectuated. Mas-Colell,\nsupra, at 168–94.\n\n       Similarly, the “expected utility” of Burns’ account is\nalso reduced based upon the probability of seizure.7 The\nexpected utility theory seeks to measure what an asset, such as\nBurns’ institutional account, is “worth,” i.e. what one would pay\nto buy it. As with expected value, the expected utility of an\nasset can also be expressed mathematically. Here, we again\nassume that the value of the account is equal to ‘V’ and the\nprobability of seizure equals ‘P.’ The expected utility (‘U’) then\nequals P*U(V) + (1–P)*U(V–the amount seized). See Lucas,\nsupra note 4, at 1429–45.\n\n       In the context of real property, a simple example of the\nrelationship between an asset’s value or utility and the threat of\nexpropriation can be seen in the divergent market values of an\nestate held in fee simple versus an estate held subject to an\nencumbrance. As with the estate subject to an encumbrance, the\neconomic value of Burns’ institutional account was reduced at\nthe time of the Department of Corrections’ assessment and\nremained impaired for upwards of three years. To borrow from\n\n  7\n    Asset pricing literature suggests that expected utility theory\nis the appropriate way to measure the “value” of an asset. See\nRobert E. Lucas, Jr., Asset Prices in an Exchange Economy, 46\nECONOMETRICA 1429–45 (Nov. 1978); see also Lars Ljungqvist\nand Thomas J. Sargent, RECURSIVE MACROECONOMIC THEORY\n(MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2000).\n                               25\n\fProfessor Honoré, an “important aspect of the owner’s position\nis that he should be able to look forward to remaining owner\nindefinitely if he so chooses . . . .” Honoré, Ownership, supra\nat 171. Burns was denied that aspect of ownership, and was\ntherefore faced with either constantly spending down his\naccount, or potentially losing a portion of his funds through the\nDepartment of Corrections’ discretionary execution of its\nassessment. The existence of such a choice demonstrates how\nBurns’ interest in his institutional account was impaired.8\n\n\n    8\n     The Dissent argues that today’s decision opens a “can of\nworms” by vesting inmates with due process whenever any one\nof Honore’s “incidents” of property are impaired for any length\nof time and for any reason. Dissenting Op. at 6. For example,\nthe Dissent argues that our approach “renders unconstitutional\na host of innocuous DOC regulations that limit, without due\nprocess, inmates’ rights to ‘use’ and ‘transmit’ the fund in their\naccounts” by placing limitations on the number of outside\npurchases an inmate can make or the types of over-the-counter\nmedications they can purchase. Id. at 6-7. Similarly, the\nDissent argues that pursuant to today’s decision, a DOC\nregulation that deprives inmates in disciplinary custody of the\nprivileges of enjoying personal property during the term of such\ncustody would automatically trigger due process protections. As\na result, the Dissent contends that our decision is contrary to the\nSupreme Court’s instruction in Sandin to “‘afford appropriate\ndeference and flexibility to state officials trying to manage a\nvolatile environment’ and thereby limit ‘the involvement of\nfederal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons.’”\nDissenting Op. at 4 (quoting Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                26\n\f482 (1995)). Respectfully, the Dissent misreads the breadth and\nimport of our holding.\n         First, we do not hold that any impairment of one of\nHonoré’s “incidents” of property is sufficient to trigger due\nprocess protections. We hold only that the Department of\nCorrections’ assessment of Burns’ institutional account, which\nthis Court has previously recognized as a cognizable property\ninterest, deprived him of a protected property interest where that\nassessment (1) placed the DOC in a position analogous to that\nof a Judgment Creditor; (2) clouded Burns’s account for a\nperiod of more than three years; and (3) reduced the economic\nvalue and utility of that account. Whether the impairment of\nother so-called “incidents” of property is sufficient to trigger the\nprotections of due process is not before us. If it were, however,\nwe would need to look to state law, as we did here, to determine\nwhether a particular claim of right is sufficient to constitute a\nproperty interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause.\nLogan, 455 U.S. at 430 (“The hallmark of property . . . is an\nindividual entitlement grounded in state law.”). Property rights,\nafter all, are “not created by the Constitution. Rather they are\ncreated and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or\nunderstandings that stem from an independent source such as\nstate law-rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and\nthat support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” Bd. of\nRegents of State Colleges v. Roth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (1972).\n        Second, we disagree with the Dissent’s in terrorem\ncontention that our decision will trigger due process protections\nany time an inmate in disciplinary custody is deprived of access\nto his private property. That a temporary separation of an\ninmate from his personal property is analogous to the\n                                27\n\f                                V.\n\n\n\nassessment at issue here, which placed the DOC in a position\nakin to that of a Judgment Creditor pursuant to state law and\nreduced the economic value of Burns’ account for a period of\nmore than three years is, in our view, too lacking in similitude\nto carry much weight.\n        Finally, we note that even if Due Process protections\nwere triggered by the types of “deprivations” the Dissent\nidentifies, our decision in no way compels a conclusion that\nsuch deprivations are constitutionally infirm. For purposes of\nthis appeal, the only question we need address is whether the\ngovernment has deprived Burns of a property interest; we\nanswer that question in the affirmative. The amount of process\nan inmate is “due” is a distinct inquiry, and we agree that it must\nbe informed by the Supreme Court’s instruction in Sandin to\n“afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials\ntrying to manage a volatile environment” and limit “the\ninvolvement of federal courts in the day-to-day management of\nprisons.” Sandin, 515 U.S at 482. As the Supreme Court\ninstructed in Wolff , “(t)he very nature of due process negates\nany concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to\nevery imaginable situation.” Id. at 560 (quotation omitted). As\nsuch, “consideration of what procedures due process may\nrequire under any given set of circumstances must begin with a\ndetermination of the precise nature of the government function\ninvolved as well as of the private interest that has been affected\nby governmental action.” Id.\n                               28\n\f       In sum, we are satisfied that the Department of\nCorrections’ assessment of Burns’ institutional account\nconstituted the deprivation of a protected property interest for\npurposes of procedural due process. Through its assessment, the\nDepartment of Corrections attained a status akin to that of a\nJudgment Creditor. In doing so, it necessarily reduced the\neconomic value of Burns’ account for a period of more than\nthree years. That deprivation is sufficient to trigger the\nprotections of the Due Process Clause. As such, we will reverse\nthe District Court’s order granting summary judgment in favor\nof the Appellees and remand for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fRodney Burns v. PA Department of Correction, et al.\n\nNo. 07-1678\n\n\n\n\nHARDIMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       Today the Court finds a new property right for purposes\nof 42 U.S.C. § 1983: an inmate’s right to “security” in his\nprison account. As the following colloquy at oral argument\nmakes plain, this Court becomes the first in the Nation to find\nsuch a right:\n\n      JUDGE SMITH: [C]utting to the chase, do you\n      have . . . any authority from this Court or any\n      other Court of Appeals or any other court of\n      record . . . recognizing the right to security that is\n      one of the types of property interests that . . . your\n      arguments suggest[s] are entitled to protection?\n\n      MR. BOERGER: Not a specific reference to the\n      right of security. This is a matter of first\n      impression in this Court.\n\n\n                               30\n\f       JUDGE SMITH: So it is . . . really a creature of\n       academic discussion, not a recognized property\n       interest heretofore by any court?\n\n                               ...\n\n       MR. BOERGER: Yes.\n\n\n\n\nThat no court has previously recognized an inmate’s right to\nsecurity in his prison account does not preclude us from doing\nso today. But the absolute lack of precedent in support of such\na proposition suggests that we should tread cautiously, and I find\nno warrant on the facts presented here to establish a new\nproperty right. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                                I.\n\n       I begin with several points of agreement with the\nMajority’s scholarly opinion. First, the Majority correctly\nrejects the Department of Correction’s (DOC) mootness\nargument. Second, the Majority has properly framed the\nquestion, i.e.: whether Burns has shown that he was deprived of\na property right recognized by Pennsylvania law without due\nprocess. See Ky. Dep’t of Corr. v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112260\"><a href=\"/opinion/112260/kentucky-dept-of-corrections-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460\n(1989). I also agree with the Majority that Burns does not allege\na deprivation of liberty despite the fact that he was ordered to\nserve 180 days in disciplinary custody as a result of his\n                               31\n\fadministrative conviction. Finally, the Majority properly notes\nthat Burns does not allege a seizure of the funds in his account;\nin fact, no seizure occurred.\n\n        Despite these points of agreement with the Majority, the\nDOC’s mere “assessment” — which has neither been reduced\nto a liquidated sum nor finally adjudicated — does not implicate\na property right recognized under Pennsylvania law.\n\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n        Burns does not challenge the DOC’s decision to place\nhim in disciplinary custody for 180 days. This restriction on\nBurns’s liberty is plainly more significant than the “cloud” over\nhis prison account, but Burns’s strategy to allege a deprivation\nof property rather than liberty is understandable in light of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n486 (1995).\n\n       In Sandin, an inmate serving a 30-year sentence was\nsubjected to an invasive strip search by a prison officer. Id. at\n474-75. After responding with “angry and foul language,” the\ninmate was charged with disciplinary infractions and brought\nbefore an adjustment committee. Id. at 475. Without permitting\nthe inmate to present witnesses in his defense, the adjustment\n                               32\n\fcommittee found him guilty of the alleged misconduct and\nsentenced him to “30 days’ disciplinary segregation in the\nSpecial Holding Unit.” Id. at 475-76. The inmate sued various\nprison officials, claiming that they deprived him of his liberty\nwithout due process of law. Id. at 476.\n\n       The Supreme Court held that the inmate suffered no\ndeprivation actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause his disciplinary segregation “did not present the type of\natypical, significant deprivation in which a State might\nconceivably create a liberty interest.” Id. at 486. Our Court\nfollowed this approach in Torres v.

Although Sandin\nand its progeny do not control this case, our definition of\nBurns’s property interest should be consistent with their\nteachings.\n\n        Sandin was animated by the Supreme Court’s desire to\nlimit the ability of inmates to derive constitutionally protected\nrights from “prison regulations primarily designed to guide\ncorrectional officials in the administration of a prison.” Sandin,\n515 U.S. at 481-82. In one pre-Sandin case, for example, an\n                               33\n\finmate claimed that pursuant to a prison regulation meant to\nprotect prison officials, he was summarily labeled “incorrigible”\nand deprived of his liberty interest in receiving a tray lunch\nrather than a sack lunch. Burgin v. Nix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538889\"><a href=\"/opinion/538889/laurence-burgin-v-crispus-nix-warden-isp-john-henry-head-of-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (8th\nCir. 1990); see also Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482-83 (collecting\ncases). Responding to such claims, the Supreme Court sought\nto “afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials\ntrying to manage a volatile environment” and thereby limit “the\ninvolvement of federal courts in the day-to-day management of\nprisons.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482. The Court was also\nconcerned that permitting litigants to derive constitutional rights\nfrom prison regulations ultimately harmed inmates by creating\n“disincentives for States to codify prison management\nprocedures.” Id. To address these concerns, the Court limited\nthe scope of inmates’ liberty interests to situations where the\nstate “imposes atypical and significant hardship . . . in relation\nto the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at 484.\n\n        In light of the substantial narrowing of the inmate’s\nliberty interest in Sandin, the Majority’s decision to broaden the\nscope of inmates’ property interests beyond bounds heretofore\nrecognized by any court of record strikes me as anomalous and\nunwise. By expanding the scope of property rights to include a\nright to “security” in a prison account, the Majority elevates the\npotential future threat of execution on a prison account over the\nactual detriment of spending a significant amount of time in\ndisciplinary custody.\n\n       Moreover, although I accept the Majority’s application of\n                                34\n\fthe Hohfeldian “bundle of rights theory of property” in certain\ncontexts, I disagree that it is an appropriate tool for defining the\nproperty interests at issue here.9 As discussed by Honoré, the\n“bundle of rights” includes eleven incidents of property\nownership: “the right to possess, the right to use, the right to\nmanage, the right to the income of the thing, the right to the\ncapital . . . the rights or incidents of transmissibility and absence\nof term, the prohibition of harmful use, liability to execution,\nand the incident of residuarity.” See Maj. Op. at IV. The\nMajority’s holding suggests that the impairment of any one of\nthese incidents constitutes a deprivation of property sufficient to\ntrigger the procedural protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThis approach is problematic for two reasons.\n\n       First, it permits inmates to circumvent the Supreme\nCourt’s holding that disciplinary segregation does not\nautomatically trigger the procedural protections of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486. A DOC\nregulation prohibits inmates from enjoying the privilege of\npersonal property. See DC-ADM 801 § 6(A)(3) (June 13,\n2008). Under the Majority’s Hohfeldian theory, this regulation\n\n    9\n       I note that the Majority cites only takings cases for the\nproposition that the “bundle of rights theory of property” has\nbeen embraced by the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit\ndespite its observation that “what constitutes the impairment of\na protected property interest for purposes of due process . . . is\na distinct inquiry from determining what constitutes a taking.”\nMaj. Op. at IV.\n                                35\n\fautomatically deprives inmates sentenced to disciplinary\ncustody of personal property by impairing their “right to\npossess” the same during their confinement. By virtue of this\ndeprivation, inmates will always be entitled to due process in\nconjunction with their placement in disciplinary custody, a result\ndirectly contrary to Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484-86.\n\n        Second, the Majority’s approach renders unconstitutional\na host of innocuous DOC regulations that limit, without due\nprocess, inmates’ rights to “use” and “transmit” the funds in\ntheir prison accounts. Although by no means an exhaustive list,\nthe following regulations illustrate the can of worms that I fear\nis opened by today’s decision.\n\n       One policy limits an inmate’s ability to use prison\naccount funds for “outside purchases.” DC-ADM 815 § 2(B)\n(May 12, 2008). Specifically, an inmate is “limited to one\n[outside] order per month” and must submit a written purchase\nrequest for review “by a designated facility official, who will\napprove or disapprove” it pending “[f]inal approval . . . made\nupon inspection when the item is received.” Id. Section\n2(A)(3)(d) limits the over-the-counter medications that an\ninmate is entitled to purchase to those “review[ed] and\napprove[d]” by the “Bureau of Health Care Services.” Id.\nSection 2(A)(7) tasks the “Property Office” with tracking “the\nnumber of shoes and sneakers that are delivered to the inmate,\nfor compliance with the purchasing limitations on these\nproducts.” The foregoing restrictions involve a more direct and\nsubstantial impairment of an inmate’s property rights than the\n                               36\n\f“right to security,” and unlike any impairment suffered by\nBurns, none of these policies affords an inmate an opportunity\nto contest the relevant official’s decision.\n\n        Because these policies impair inmates’ rights to “use”\nand “transmit” funds in their prison accounts — impairments the\nMajority suggests are deprivations of property — inmates would\nbe entitled to due process with respect to every outside purchase,\nevery bottle of aspirin, and every pair of sneakers. This result\nis antithetical to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sandin, which\nrecognized that the “incidents of prison life” involve limitations\non the panoply of rights enjoyed by ordinary citizens. 515 U.S.\nat 485 (citing Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109718\"><a href=\"/opinion/109718/jones-v-north-carolina-prisoners-labor-union-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125 (1977)) (“Lawful incarceration brings about the\nnecessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and\nrights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our\npenal system.”); Johnson v.

Like the regulation that deprived “incorrigible” inmates\nof potentially-hazardous tray lunches in Burgin, 899 F.2d at 734,\nthe purchasing policies described above are surely not “atypical”\n                                37\n\for “significant” in relation to “the ordinary incidents of prison\nlife.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Accordingly, such regulations\nshould not be interpreted to confer heretofore unrecognized\nrights upon inmates, but such an interpretation is unavoidable\ngiven the Majority’s decision today.\n\n        In light of the foregoing, I would reject the Majority’s\nconclusion that by clouding his prison account with the “threat\nof expropriation,” the DOC deprived Burns of property. Maj.\nOp. at IV. This threat to the “security” of his account — which,\nit should be emphasized, remains to this day an account that\nBurns is free to access and deplete — is simply not an “atypical\nand significant hardship . . . in relation to the ordinary incidents\nof prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n\n                                III.\n\n       This is not to say that inmates have no “property interest\nin funds held in prison accounts,” or that they are not entitled to\n“due process with respect to any deprivation of money” from\ntheir accounts. Maj. Op. at IV (citations omitted). I simply\ncontend that Burns’s property interest is not so broad and\namorphous as the Majority suggests. Given the more limited\nnature of inmates’ property rights vís-a-vís ordinary citizens, see\nPart II, supra, I would hold, as this Court has previously\nsuggested, that an inmate suffers a deprivation of property “at\nthe moment” the prison “employees seize[] the money in [the]\ninmate account.” Higgins v. Beyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778009\"><a href=\"/opinion/778009/vincent-m-higgins-v-howard-l-beyer-department-of-corrections-william-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 n.3 (3d\nCir. 2002). This sensible rule comports with a Supreme Court\n                                38\n\fcase not mentioned by the Majority.\n\n        In American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company\nv. Sullivan, a class of employees sued Pennsylvania state\nofficials, claiming that Pennsylvania’s Workers’ Compensation\nAct deprived them of property without due process. 526 U.S. at\n40, 48 (1999). The Act permitted insurance companies to\nwithhold reimbursements for medical treatment from workers\nwho suffered job-related injuries until private “utilization review\norganizations” determined that the treatment was “reasonable or\nnecessary for the medical condition of the employee.” Id. at 46-\n48 (internal citations omitted). Rejecting the employees’ claim\nthat they were entitled to the benefits as soon as the employers’\nliability was established, the Supreme Court held that the\nemployees “do not have a property interest” in the benefits until\nthey “establish that the particular medical treatment . . . [was]\nreasonable and necessary.” Id. at 61.\n\n       As in Sullivan, Burns’s liability for the assault had been\nestablished, but the DOC had not attempted to quantify the\namount of his liability, which is a prerequisite to deducting\nmoney from his account. App’x 33-35. Furthermore, as\nBurns’s counsel admitted at oral argument, the funds in Burns’s\naccount remained freely alienable at all relevant times. See also\nApp’x 35 (indicating that funds in an inmate’s account remain\nfreely alienable until “receipt of a decision imposing an\nassessment against the inmate” by the Business Manager). In\naddition, before the DOC could execute its assessment, Burns\nwas entitled to additional process, including: (1) a “Holloway\n                               39\n\fhearing” to determine “the amount of financial loss or costs, if\nany,”10 and (2) an appeal from this determination. App’x 33-35\n(emphasis added); see Holloway v. Lehman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1180-82 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1996). Thus, the DOC cannot\ndeprive Burns of funds in his prison account until it establishes\n“the amount of financial loss or cost, if any.” Because it is\nundisputed that the DOC never established (or even attempted\nto establish) this amount, I would hold that Burns has not\nsuffered a deprivation of property.\n\n       For the same reason, I would reject Burns’s argument\nthat the DOC acquired a property interest in his account as a\n“judgment creditor” that diminished the economic value of his\nproperty. Maj. Op. at IV. As the Majority recognizes, a creditor\ncannot execute on a money judgment until it is reduced to a\nliquidated sum. See id. Here, it is undisputed that the DOC\nnever established Burns’s financial liability, if any. The\nMajority dismisses this distinction as “beside the point” because\nthe DOC possessed “unilateral authority to reduce their\nassessment to a specific dollar amount” and to “deduct any\nassessed fees without resort to an intermediary.” Id. (emphasis\nadded). Much like a judgment debtor in state court, however,\nBurns is entitled to notice, a hearing, and an appeal before his\n\n  10\n      Burns argues that once his disciplinary conviction become\nfinal, deduction of medical expenses from this account “was\nrequired by operation of law.” To the contrary, the “if any”\nlanguage in the regulations suggests that the Holloway hearing\ncould result in the assessment of no damages.\n                               40\n\faccount can be debited.11 See Holloway, 671 A.2d at 1180-82;\nApp’x 33-35. If the DOC decides to pursue this course of\naction, Burns will then be entitled to his day in court. As the\nDistrict Court stated:\n\n         Should Defendants or other [Department of\n         Corrections] officials seize any funds from\n         [Burns’s] inmate account for the payment of\n         medical or other expenses resulting from\n         Mobley’s assault, this Court would grant [Burns]\n         leave to re-file his due process challenges to his\n         disciplinary process.\n\nBurns v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., Civ. No. 05-3462, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">442385</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 n.2 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 6, 2007).\n\n                                IV.\n\n       In the absence of any authority, the Majority turns to\nscholarly writings to hold that an inmate has a property right in\nthe “security” of his prison account. I cannot abide the\nMajority’s elevation of an inmate’s property rights over his\n\n    11\n        Ironically, the rule established by the Majority confers\nmore process upon an inmate than a private citizen. Under\nPennsylvania law, a judgment creditor may confess judgment\nand begin executing on the judgment debtor’s assets unless and\nuntil the judgment debtor files a petition to open or strike the\nconfessed judgment. See Pa. R.C.P. 2956.1.\n                                41\n\fliberty rights as delineated by the Supreme Court in Sandin.\nLikewise, if the property rights inside the prison walls are\ncoextensive with Honoré’s “incidents of property,” several\nregulations promulgated by the Department of Corrections to\nregulate the daily lives of inmates are constitutionally suspect.\nIn addition to these concerns on the merits, I fear that today’s\ndecision will spawn a new generation of unwarranted due\nprocess challenges akin to those that laid the foundation for\nSandin. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               42\n\f</pre>",
