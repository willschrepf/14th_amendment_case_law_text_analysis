For the reasons stated herein, the motion is GRANTED in\n\npart and DENIED in part. An appropriate order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff, Kemal Patel, filed this lawsuit pro se in 2009. See Dkt. 1. Patel is a citizen of\n\nthe United Kingdom; when he filed suit, he was a legal permanent resident of the United States\n\nand was incarcerated in a facility run by Defendant Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). Id. ¶ 4. The\n\noriginal complaint alleged that Patel was subjected to unfair treatment while incarcerated based\n\non his status as a noncitizen—specifically, he alleged that BOP denied noncitizen inmates the\n\nsame transfer and prison programming opportunities provided to U.S. citizens. Id. ¶¶ 15-38. An\n\namended complaint, filed on June 8, 2009, added Dale Brown as an additional plaintiff and new\n\nclaims under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended\n\nComplaint on September 1, 2009, which added allegations that BOP had wrongfully assigned\n\nnoncitizen inmates to private prisons where they were subjected to “significantly more onerous\n\fconditions of confinement.” Dkt. 13 ¶¶ 53-69.\n\n          Plaintiffs obtained pro bono counsel in 2010. See Dkt. 45. On July 12, 2010, they filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. Dkt. 65. The Third Amended Complaint\n\nincluded eleven counts: challenges to the BOP’s assignment and treatment of noncitizen inmates\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause and Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”); an alleged\n\nviolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”); an Eighth Amendment claim\n\nrelating to exposure to second-hand smoke; a claim under the Equal Protection Clause and the\n\nAPA relating to transfers of noncitizen inmates; a claim under the Privacy Act; and three FOIA\n\nclaims.\n\n          Although Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend was not granted until September 7, 2011,\n\nDkt. 90, the instant motion was originally directed at the Third Amended Complaint. See Dkt.\n\n68 at 1. Subsequently, both Patel and Brown were released from BOP custody. In order to\n\nclarify the scope of the proceedings in light of their release, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to\n\nfile a Fourth Amended Complaint (the “Complaint”). Dkt. 118. In the Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint, Brown no longer appears as a plaintiff and Patel has dropped many of his claims for\n\ninjunctive relief. The Complaint includes damages claims under the Equal Protection Clause and\n\nRFRA (Counts I and II, respectively), a claim for injunctive relief under the Privacy Act (Count\n\nIII), and two FOIA counts (Counts IV and V). The parties have agreed that the arguments in the\n\ninstant motion may be applied to the Fourth Amended Complaint, provided that Defendants will\n\nhave the opportunity to file a supplemental motion raising additional defenses particular to the\n\nFourth Amended Complaint in the event the case is not dismissed in its entirety. See Dkt. 117 at\n\n2 n.1.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                                    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n         On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court must “treat the complaint’s\n\nfactual allegations as true [and] must grant plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be\n\nderived from the facts alleged.” Gilvin v. Fire, 259 F.3d 749, 756 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Although\n\n“detailed factual allegations” are not necessary, Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555\n\n(2007), “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim for\n\nrelief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570). The Court need not accept as true either a “legal conclusion couched\n\nas a factual allegation” or an inference drawn by the plaintiff if such inference is unsupported by\n\nthe facts set out in the complaint. Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations\n\nand quotation marks omitted). The Court may consider “the facts alleged in the complaint,\n\ndocuments attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint, and matters about\n\nwhich the Court may take judicial notice.” Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196\n\n(D.D.C. 2002) (citation omitted).\n\n         If a Court concludes that it is appropriate to consider additional evidence submitted by\n\nthe parties, it must convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(d). Whether to convert a motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion is\n\n“committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Bowe-Connor v. Shinseki, 845 F. Supp. 2d\n\n77, 85 (D.D.C. 2012) (quotation marks omitted). Before deciding to convert a motion to dismiss,\n\nthe “court must assure itself that summary judgment treatment would be fair to both parties,”\n\nTele-Commc’ns of Key West, Inc. v. United States, 757 F.2d 1330, 1334 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and\n\nthat the parties are provided the opportunity to present all relevant materials, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(d).\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f       The Court may grant summary judgment where the evidence submitted by the parties\n\nshows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 247 (1986). The moving party bears the initial burden to identify the portions of the record\n\nthat, in its view, “demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the moving party carries that burden, the opposing party\n\nmust “designate specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. at 324 (quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n                                        III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Equal Protection\n\n       Plaintiff asserts his equal protection claim (Count I) against only Defendant Clark in his\n\nindividual capacity. Dkt 118 at 16. At oral argument in this matter, however, the Court became\n\naware that Clark had not yet been served. Although counsel for the United States has advanced\n\nseveral arguments for dismissal of the equal protection claim, counsel has also expressly stated\n\nthat he lacks authorization to represent Clark. Plaintiff filed a proof of service on Clark after oral\n\nargument (Dkt. 125); however, there is no indication in the record that counsel for the United\n\nStates has yet been authorized to represent him.\n\n       Because the only defendant against whom Plaintiff alleges his equal protection claim is\n\nnot represented by any attorney who has appeared, it would be inappropriate for the Court to rule\n\non the merits of the equal protection claim at this time. After an attorney for Clark notices an\n\nappearance, Clark will have an opportunity to move to dismiss the equal protection claim against\n\nhim and raise any appropriate arguments in support of that motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fB. RFRA\n\n       Plaintiff’s RFRA allegations focus on his treatment at CI Rivers and CI Big Spring, two\n\nprivate prisons at which he was incarcerated in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Dkt. 118 ¶¶ 90-91,\n\n119, 121. At CI Rivers, Plaintiff, who is Muslim, alleges that he was not permitted to pray while\n\non work duty, and that, as a result, he was unable to pray “at the times required by his religious\n\nbeliefs.” Id. ¶ 95. At CI Big Spring, Plaintiff alleges he was not provided halal meals and was\n\nprohibited from choosing kosher meals. Id. at 97. The alternative meals that were offered to\n\nPlaintiff allegedly contained ingredients that “would be inappropriate for an inmate following a\n\nhalal diet.” Id. ¶ 98. Plaintiff also alleges that, contrary to BOP policy, the company operating\n\nCI Big Spring failed to provide menus and nutritional information to inmates before meals. Id.\n\n¶¶ 99-100. Finally, he alleges that he was not allowed to take all of his meals in the evening on\n\ndays on which fasting was required outside of Ramadan. Id. ¶ 101. Plaintiff’s allegations target\n\nDefendant Lappin, the former director of BOP, as well as three John Doe defendants who were\n\nallegedly responsible for enforcing BOP policy at CI Big Spring. Id. ¶¶ 16-17.\n\n       Defendants argue that these allegations fail to state a claim for three reasons. First, they\n\nassert that RFRA does not authorize damages actions against federal officials in their individual\n\ncapacities. Second, they claim that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient personal involvement\n\nby Defendant Lappin for liability to attach to him. Finally, they argue that Plaintiff’s allegations\n\nare substantively insufficient to state a claim under RFRA. The Court will consider each of these\n\narguments in turn.\n\n       1. Individual-Capacity Damages Claims Against Federal Officials\n\n       The parties disagree on the issue whether RFRA authorizes individual-capacity damages\n\nclaims against federal officials. RFRA allows any “person whose religious exercise has been\n\nburdened in violation of [the statute]” to “assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial\n                                                  5\n\fproceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c). A\n\n“government” is defined to “include[] a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official\n\n(or other person acting under color of law) of the United States.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(1).\n\n        Defendants argue that this definition does not authorize individual-capacity suits against\n\ngovernment officials. They assert that the statute’s use of the word “official” refers only to\n\nofficial-capacity suits, and that the interpretive canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\n\nshow that the term “other person acting under color of law” should be read to authorize only\n\nofficial-capacity claims. Dkt. 98 at 6.\n\n        There are significant flaws in Defendants’ position. It is not at all clear why a statutory\n\nterm authorizing suit against “an official” should be presumed to allow only official-capacity\n\nsuits. Courts routinely recognize that “‘government officials may be sued in their individual\n\ncapacities’” under certain circumstances, e.g., Oberwetter v. Hilliard, 639 F.3d 545, 554 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2011) (citation omitted)—indeed, “officials” are the only persons for whom the distinction\n\nbetween individual-capacity and official-capacity suits has any salience. A statutory term\n\nauthorizing suits against “officials” thus sheds little light on whether and when plaintiffs may sue\n\nthose officials in their individual capacities.\n\n        Defendants’ argument that the phrase “other person acting under color of law” authorizes\n\nonly official-capacity suits is even less persuasive. That phrase contemplates that persons\n\n“other” than “officials” may be sued under RFRA, and persons who are not officials may be sued\n\nonly in their individual capacities. See Jama v. INS, 343 F. Supp. 2d 338, 374 (D.N.J. 2004).\n\nDefendants’ interpretation would render the entire phrase surplusage: once Congress authorized\n\nofficial-capacity suits against “officials,” adding another term that allowed only official-capacity\n\nsuits would have had no effect whatsoever. Neither of the interpretive canons on which\n\nDefendants rely can overcome this deficiency in their reading of the statute. Under the canon\n                                                  6\n\fejusdem generis, “when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be\n\nunderstood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.” Ali v. BOP, 552\n\nU.S. 214, 223 (2008) (quotation marks omitted). This canon is inapplicable here. The phrase\n\n“other person acting under color of law” appears in § 2000bb-2 not as a final, “catch-all” item in\n\na list, but instead as a parenthetical modifier that expands upon one item on the list. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-2 (“the term ‘government’ includes a branch, department, agency,\n\ninstrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States\n\n. . . .”) (emphasis added). The phrase “official (or other person acting under color of law)” is\n\nthus very similar to the disjunctive phrase to which ejusdem generis was held inapplicable in Ali.\n\n552 U.S. at 225 (“The structure of the phrase ‘any officer of customs or excise or any other law\n\nenforcement officer’ does not lend itself to application of the canon.”). The phrase at issue is\n\nintended to enlarge the category of “person[s]” subject to suit, not to refer to miscellaneous\n\nthings that are “akin to” “branch[es], department[s], agenc[ies], instrumentalit[ies], and\n\nofficial[s].”\n\n        The argument under noscitur a sociis fares no better. Under that precept, “a word may be\n\nknown by the company it keeps.” Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States ex\n\nrel. Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, 288 (2010). It is “‘not an invariable rule,’” however, “‘for the word\n\nmay have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association.’” Id. (quoting Russell\n\nMotor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, 519 (1923)). Here, that the phrase “or other\n\nperson acting under the color of law” has a “character of its own” is evident on the face of the\n\nstatute. There is no apparent congruity between a “branch, department, agency [or]\n\ninstrumentality” of the government and a “person,” and the statute expressly differentiates\n\n“officials” from “other person[s].” By authorizing suits against “persons” who are not\n\n“officials,” Congress thus envisioned at least some individual-capacity suits under RFRA.\n                                                 7\n\f       The fact that Congress authorized individual-capacity suits against “other persons acting\n\nunder color of law” at least suggests that it also intended to permit individual-capacity suits\n\nagainst “officials,” but it does not conclusively resolve the issue. Congress could have intended\n\nto permit only official-capacity suits against officials while allowing suits against non-officials\n\n“acting under color of law.” This reading of the statute, however, is implausible. First, there is\n\nno affirmative evidence that Congress intended to draw such a distinction. Given the availability\n\nof qualified immunity, it would be anomalous if actual government officials were wholly\n\nimmune from personal liability for even clear RFRA violations while private citizens “acting\n\nunder color of law” were subject to suit—and it would certainly do nothing to further RFRA’s\n\npurpose of “provid[ing] a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially\n\nburdened by government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b).\n\n       Second, similar statutory language in at least one other context has been interpreted to\n\npermit individual-capacity claims against officials. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 permits suits against\n\n“[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage” of a\n\nState or territory deprives a person of constitutional rights, and is uniformly interpreted to permit\n\nindividual-capacity claims against government officials. See, e.g., Wesby v. District of\n\nColumbia, 765 F.3d 13, 18, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (affirming judgment under § 1983 against police\n\nofficers “in their individual capacities”). Under Defendants’ interpretation of RFRA, Congress’s\n\nchoice explicitly to include “official[s]” among the persons and entities that may be sued under\n\nthe statute—a departure from the language of § 1983—would impose an additional limitation on\n\nplaintiffs’ ability to sue officials. This is backwards: by explicitly adding a term permitting suits\n\nagainst officials to language familiar from the § 1983 context, RFRA contemplates, if anything,\n\nthat such suits will be more available. In any event, it is safe to assume that Congress understood\n\nthat it acted against the backdrop of settled § 1983 precedent when it added the similar “under\n                                                  8\n\fcolor of law” language to RFRA. Cf. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 581 (1978) (“where . . .\n\nCongress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be\n\npresumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least\n\ninsofar as it affects the new statute”).\n\n        Defendants have marshalled only minimal case law supporting their position. The two\n\ndecisions from the Western District of Pennsylvania they cite do not analyze the relevant\n\nstatutory provisions. Ellis v. United States, No. 08-160, 2011 WL 3290217, at *12 (W.D. Pa.\n\nJune 17, 2011), simply follows, without elaboration, Jean-Pierre v. BOP, No. 09-266, 2010 WL\n\n3852338, at *6 n.4 (W.D. Pa. July 30, 2010). Jean-Pierre, in turn, stated in a footnote without\n\nanalysis that “neither RFRA nor RLUIPA [the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons\n\nAct] support damages claims against government officials in their individual capacity.” The\n\ncases it cites for that proposition, moreover, uniformly involve RLUIPA, not RFRA. See Nelson\n\nv. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 889 (7th Cir. 2009) (“declin[ing] to read RLUIPA as allowing damages\n\nagainst defendants in their individual capacities”); Rendelman v. Rouse, 569 F.3d 182, 189 (4th\n\nCir. 2009) (“Congress did not signal with sufficient clarity an intent to subject [a state official] to\n\nan individual capacity damages claim under RLUIPA”); Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Texas,\n\n560 F.3d 316, 329 (5th Cir. 2009) (“we decline to read Congress’s permission to seek\n\n‘appropriate relief against a government’ as permitting suits against RLUIPA defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities”), aff'd sub nom. Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651 (2011); Smith v. Allen,\n\n502 F.3d 1255, 1275 (11th Cir. 2007) (“section 3 of RLUIPA . . . cannot be construed as creating\n\na private right of action against individual defendants for monetary damages”); Porter v. Beard,\n\nNo. 09-549, 2010 WL 2573878, at *6 (W.D. Pa. May 12, 2010) (“[RLUIPA] does not support\n\ndamages claims against state officials in their individual capacity”); Logan v. Lockett, No. 07-\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\f1759, 2009 WL 799749, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 25, 2009) (“RLUIPA does not support damage\n\nclaims against state officials in their individual capacity”).\n\n       The distinction between RFRA and RLUIPA is essential to the question raised here.\n\nAlthough RFRA by its terms authorizes lawsuits against both the federal government and the\n\nstates, it was held unconstitutional as applied to the states in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S.\n\n507, 536 (1997) (holding that application of RFRA to states exceeded Congress’s power under\n\nthe Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). In response, Congress enacted RLUIPA\n\nas an exercise of its spending power. See Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651, 1656 (2011).\n\n       Although “RLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA,” including virtually\n\nidentical language creating a private right of action for aggrieved individuals, id., the distinct\n\nconstitutional bases for the two laws affect their breadth. In particular, because RLUIPA was\n\nenacted as an exercise of Congress’s spending power, interpreting that statute to allow damages\n\nactions against state officials in their individual capacities would “raise serious questions\n\nregarding whether Congress had exceeded its [constitutional] authority.” Nelson, 570 F.3d at\n\n889. Restrictions imposed on states pursuant to the Spending Clause are essentially contractual\n\nin nature—states agree to comply with certain conditions in exchange for federal funds. See id.\n\nat 887-88. Applying restrictions created pursuant to the Spending Clause to persons or entities\n\nother than the recipients of the federal funds at issue would have the effect of binding non-parties\n\nto the terms of the spending “contract.” Id. (citing Sossamon, 560 F.3d at 328-29; Smith v. Allen,\n\n502 F.3d 1255, 1275 (11th Cir. 2007)). Courts have thus declined to allow individual-capacity\n\nsuits for damages against state officials under RLUIPA because doing so would subject those\n\nofficials to Spending Clause restrictions that are properly binding only on states that receive\n\nfederal funds. See, e.g., Nelson, 570 F.3d at 889; Smith, 502 F.3d at 1274-75. Other courts have\n\nreached the same conclusion for the related reason that RLUIPA does not “signal with sufficient\n                                                  10\n\fclarity an intent to subject” state officials to individual capacity suits, applying a “clear notice\n\nrequirement” that is specific to Spending Clause enactments. Rendelman, 589 F.3d at 188-89;\n\nsee also Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) (“if Congress\n\nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously”).\n\n        Neither of these rationales applies to interpretation of RFRA. RFRA’s application to\n\nfederal action is not based on the Spending Clause. Rather, Congress may “carve out a religious\n\nexemption from otherwise neutral, generally applicable laws based on its power to enact the\n\nunderlying statute in the first place.” Guam v. Guerrero, 290 F.3d 1210, 1220-21 (9th Cir.\n\n2002). There can be no question, moreover, that Congress possesses the power “to establish and\n\nmaintain an effective regime of criminal law enforcement,” including the power to control “the\n\noperation of federal correctional facilities.” Constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 1120, 24 Op.\n\nO.L.C. 156, 158, 2000 WL 34475733 (2000). This Article I power carries with it the authority to\n\nrequire religious accommodation of federal inmates pursuant to RFRA. See Kikumura v. Hurley,\n\n242 F.3d 950, 959 (10th Cir. 2001); Guerrero, 290 F.3d at 1221.\n\n        Because Congress can create a right of action against an individual to enforce such\n\nstatutory requirements, it need not satisfy the “clear notice” requirement that attaches to\n\nconditions imposed under the Spending Clause. And, as the Seventh Circuit recognized in\n\nNelson, the language of RLUIPA (which closely tracks the relevant language of RFRA) “appears\n\nto authorize suit against [a defendant official] in his individual capacity.” 570 F.3d at 886. In\n\nNelson, that apparent meaning was overcome only by the specific constitutional concerns raised\n\nby the Spending Clause. Construing RFRA, where those concerns do not apply, the Court\n\nconcludes that Congress intended to authorize both official and individual-capacity suits against\n\nfederal officials.\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f       It follows from this conclusion that Congress also intended to permit individual capacity\n\nsuits for damages. It is unlikely that an action for injunctive or declaratory relief under RFRA\n\nwould be treated as an individual-capacity suit. “Regardless of the manner by which a plaintiff\n\ndesignated the action, a suit should be regarded as an official-capacity suit when the judgment\n\nsought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public\n\nadministration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from acting,\n\nor compel it to act.” Hatfill v. Gonzales, 519 F. Supp. 2d 13, 24 (D.D.C. 2007) (citing Dugan v.\n\nRank, 372 U.S. 609, 620 (1963)) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). All or nearly all\n\nRFRA claims for injunctive or declaratory relief against federal officials would likely satisfy\n\nthose criteria. The only significant purpose for an individual-capacity claim, then, would be to\n\nseek damages—damages that are unavailable in RFRA actions against the sovereign. See\n\nWebman v. BOP, 441 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 (holding that RFRA does not waive federal\n\ngovernment’s sovereign immunity from suits for damages).\n\n       The language of the statute substantiates this inference. Faced with “the question of what\n\nremedies are available under a statute that provides a private right of action,” courts “presume\n\nthe availability of all appropriate remedies”—including, at least at times, damages—“unless\n\nCongress has expressly indicated otherwise.” Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60,\n\n66, 76 (1992) (holding that “a damages remedy is available for an action brought to enforce Title\n\nIX” of the Civil Rights Act). RFRA expressly allows plaintiffs to “obtain appropriate relief\n\nagainst a government,” and contains no “express[ ] indicat[ion]” that damages are prohibited. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c); Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66. Thus, under the presumption articulated in\n\nFranklin, RFRA authorizes damages when that form of relief is “appropriate.” 1\n\n\n1\n   A thorough opinion from the District of New Jersey reached the same conclusion even though\nit concluded that the presumption in Franklin was inapplicable to RFRA. See Jama, 343 F.\n                                               12\n\f       The Court of Appeals’ conclusion in Webman that damages are unavailable in RFRA\n\nsuits against the government does not detract from this conclusion. That decision turned on the\n\nprinciple that “courts must ‘strictly construe’ any waiver of sovereign immunity,” allowing relief\n\nagainst the government only when its authorization is “‘unequivocal.’” Webman, 441 F.3d at\n\n1025-26 (alterations omitted) (quoting Lane v. Peña, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 198 (1996)). But\n\nCongress need not waive sovereign immunity to permit an individual-capacity suit against a\n\nfederal official. See Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 686-87\n\n(1949). And a reading RFRA that allows damages claims against officials in their individual\n\ncapacities but not against the federal government itself is not at all self-contradictory. Because\n\nCongress did not expressly waive sovereign immunity from suits for damages, damages are not\n\nan “appropriate” remedy against the government itself. See Webman, 441 F.3d at 1028 (Tatel, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“RFRA nowhere makes clear that damages are ‘appropriate’ (at least against the\n\ngovernment[)]”) (emphasis added). But because it did not expressly prohibit suits for damages,\n\nthey may be an “appropriate” remedy against individual-capacity defendants.\n\n\n\n\nSupp. 2d at 375-76. There, the court reasoned that a damages remedy was available in\nindividual-capacity suits under RFRA because it is plausible that Congress intended that remedy\nto be available, prohibiting damages would conflict with the purpose of RFRA, and other courts\nhave assumed that damages are available under the statute. Id. at 374-75. The Court agrees with\nthis analysis, which further supports the conclusion that damages are available.\n\n        The Jama court also concluded, however, that because RFRA expressly authorizes\n“appropriate relief against a government,” the statute is not “silent” on the issue of remedies and\nthe presumption in Franklin is inapplicable. 343 F. Supp. 2d at 376. This reading of Franklin is\ntoo narrow. The presumption in that case obviously does apply where Congress is entirely silent\non the issue of remedies. But it is also clear that the mere mention of remedies does not rebut the\npresumption—instead, the presumption applies unless “Congress has expressly indicated” that a\nremedy is unavailable. Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66. RFRA provides only that a plaintiff may obtain\n“appropriate relief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c). This language does nothing more than authorize\nwhat courts applying Franklin presume, and it falls far short of an “express[ ] indicat[ion]” that\ndamages are prohibited.\n                                                  13\n\f       2. Defendant Lappin’s Personal Involvement\n\n       Defendants also contend that Harley Lappin—the former director of BOP—was not\n\npersonally involved in any of the deprivations of religious liberty that Plaintiff asserts, and that\n\nhe therefore cannot be liable under RFRA. The first step in their argument is the claim that\n\nindividual-capacity suits under RFRA are “in essence . . . Free Exercise Clause Bivens claim[s],\n\nwhich courts dismiss when based on respondeat superior liability.” Dkt. 98 at 8. If RFRA\n\nfollows Bivens in this respect, then Plaintiff would have to allege that Defendant Lappin was\n\ndirectly, rather than vicariously, liable for the RFRA violations Plaintiff asserts. According to\n\nDefendants, Plaintiff has failed to do so.\n\n       Plaintiff disagrees with both of these contentions. He argues that the relief available\n\nunder RFRA should be “broadly construed to incorporate well-settled theories of vicarious\n\nliability under the common law against which Congress legislated.” Dkt. 100 at 11. But even if\n\nthe limitations developed in Bivens actions apply to RFRA, Plaintiff argues that he has\n\nsufficiently alleged Defendant Lappin’s personal involvement in the asserted violations. In\n\nparticular, he points to the allegation in the Complaint that Defendant Lappin “refus[ed] to\n\nrequire private entities [that operated contract prisons] to follow BOP regulations” that protect\n\ninmates’ religious exercise. Dkt. 118 ¶ 131.\n\n       The parties have identified only minimal authority addressing the viability of vicarious\n\nliability theories under RFRA. Defendants point to two cases in which RFRA counts were\n\ndismissed for failure to allege personal involvement of the individual defendants. See Dkt. 98 at\n\n8-9 (citing Curry v. Gonzales, No. 07-0199, 2007 WL 3275298, at *1 (D.D.C. Nov. 6, 2007) and\n\nWhite v. Sherrod, No. 07-821, 2009 WL 196332, at *1 (S.D. Ill. Jan. 28, 2009)). In Curry, the\n\ncourt considered the plaintiff’s RFRA count alongside his Bivens claim and dismissed both for\n\nfailure to allege the individual defendant’s personal involvement. 2007 WL 3275298, at *1. It\n                                                  14\n\fdid not provide any discussion of the issue raised here. In White, the court dismissed a RFRA\n\nclaim for failure to allege that the named defendant was personally involved in the alleged\n\ndeprivation of religious freedom at issue, but it seems not to have separately considered the\n\nquestion whether the plaintiff could rely on a vicarious liability theory. 2009 WL 196332, at *2.\n\nThus, neither of the cases cited by Defendants provides substantial guidance.\n\n       Plaintiff does only somewhat better. He relies on Pineda-Morales v. De Rosa, No. 03-\n\n4297, 2005 WL 1607276 (D.N.J. July 6, 2005), which declined to dismiss a RFRA count\n\npredicated on a respondeat superior theory simply because the defendants had “present[ed] no\n\nreason why such liability should not attach under a RFRA claim.” Id. at *5 n.5. That conclusion\n\nis of little assistance here. He also cites Agarwal v. Briley, No. 02-6807, 2004 WL 1977581, at\n\n*14 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 25, 2015), in which a court declined to enter judgement for the defendant on\n\na vicarious liability claim under RLUIPA. The plaintiff in that case was an inmate who filed a\n\ngrievance requesting vegetarian meals, which he asserted were required by his Hindu faith. Id. at\n\n*10. A subordinate prison official to whom the warden had delegated responsibility for non-\n\nemergency inmate grievances denied the request. Id. Even though the warden himself had not\n\nbeen involved in the decision to deny the plaintiff vegetarian meals—indeed, the warden\n\nremained unaware of the request until the plaintiff filed suit, id.—the court concluded that he\n\ncould be held liable under RLUIPA. It reasoned that RLUIPA does not incorporate the strict rule\n\nagainst supervisory liability applied in § 1983 actions, noting that RLUIPA (like RFRA)\n\ncomprehends actions against governmental entities as well as persons. Id. at *14. The Agarwal\n\ncourt did not decide, however, whether pure vicarious liability is actionable under RLUIPA. It\n\nfound only that the warden had “deliberate[ly] avoid[ed] any involvement in review of Plaintiff’s\n\ngrievance,” and that this fact established “sufficient ‘fault,’ an adequate causal nexus to\n\nPlaintiff’s injury, to support a finding of liability.” Id. Agarwal thus, at most, stands for the\n                                                 15\n\fproposition that “negligent supervision” might be actionable under RLUIPA, not that a\n\nsupervisor may be held liable for the acts of his subordinates without any independent showing\n\nof fault. Id.; see Palermo v. Libby, No. 11-557, 2012 WL 4929423 (D.N.H. Sept. 12, 2012)\n\n(distinguishing Agarwal and dismissing RLUIPA claim where plaintiff “made no allegation\n\nconcerning an act or failure to act by [the defendant] that caused or failed to prevent any of the\n\nviolations alleged”).\n\n       The Court concludes that pure vicarious liability—that is, liability of supervisors based\n\nsolely on the acts of their subordinates—is not sufficient to state a claim under RFRA. Neither\n\nparty has directed the Court to any case expressly endorsing such a theory, and the Court has\n\nidentified none. Plaintiff’s arguments based on the structure and purpose of RFRA, particularly\n\nabsent any direct support in the case law, are not compelling. Plaintiff assumes that RFRA was\n\nenacted against a background of “traditional common-law principles” embodied in state tort law,\n\nDkt. 100 at 11-12, but cites no legislative history or other evidence suggesting this was so.\n\nInstead, it appears more likely that Congress legislated in relevant respects against the more\n\nrelevant background of constitutional litigation under Bivens and § 1983. Free exercise claims\n\nbefore RFRA would have been brought under these theories, not the common law, and there is\n\nno indication in the statute that Congress intended to adopt common-law theories of liability that\n\nhad previously been unavailable to plaintiffs. It is true that Congress expressly authorized suits\n\nagainst government “branch[es], department[s], [and] agenc[ies]”—entities that cannot act\n\npersonally in a manner that would subject them to liability under Bivens. 48 U.S.C. 2000bb-2(1).\n\nBut Congress did this expressly. RFRA does not by its terms authorize a further step away from\n\nthe background of § 1983 and Bivens precedents to impose vicarious liability, and nothing before\n\nthe Court on this motion suggests that it intended to do so implicitly.\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f       When RFRA was enacted in 1993, see Pub. L. 103-141 (1993), the leading Supreme\n\nCourt case addressing supervisory liability under § 1983 and Bivens was Rizzo v. Good, 423 U.S.\n\n362 (1976). The Court in Rizzo vacated an injunction against municipal officers for failure to\n\nsupervise the activities of a local police force, requiring the plaintiff to prove an “affirmative link\n\nbetween the occurrence of the various incidents of police misconduct [at issue in the case] and\n\nthe adoption of any plan or policy by the petitioners . . . showing their authorization or approval\n\nof such misconduct.” Id. at 371. The Court of Appeals for this Circuit “join[ed] the majority of\n\ncourts” after Rizzo “calling for something more than mere negligence to forge the ‘affirmative\n\nlink’ between the constitutional infringement and the supervisor’s conduct.” Haynesworth v.\n\nMiller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1261 (D.C. Cir. 1987), abrogated in part on other grounds, Hartman v.\n\nMoore, 547 U.S. 250, 266 (2006) (holding that plaintiffs must present evidence of lack of\n\nprobable cause in retaliatory prosecution suits under § 1983 and Bivens). Under that standard, a\n\nplaintiff must show that “absent effective supervision, harm was not merely foreseeable, but was\n\nhighly likely, given the circumstances of the case”—so likely that “it can be said that the\n\nsupervisor acquiesced in the resulting constitutional violation.” Haynesworth, 820 F.2d at 1261.\n\nBecause this showing—or a similar one, see id. at 1261 n.126—was widely required in Bivens\n\nand § 1983 actions at the time RFRA was enacted, the Court concludes that it reflects the\n\nbackground state of the law against which Congress legislated. Thus, to assert a claim for\n\nsupervisory liability under RFRA, Plaintiff must allege that Defendant Lappin’s failure to\n\nsupervise his subordinates was “highly likely, given the circumstances of the case” to give rise to\n\na constitutional violation.\n\n       Plaintiff contends that his allegations satisfy this standard. His complaint alleges that\n\nDefendant Lappin, along with the John Doe defendants, “refus[ed] to require private entities\n\n[that operated private prisons] to follow BOP regulations” and therefore “set in motion the\n                                                  17\n\fconditions that led to the violation of Mr. Patel’s religious rights.” Dkt. 118 ¶ 131. In addition,\n\nPlaintiff directs the Court to two BOP policy statements (including one signed by Defendant\n\nLappin, see Dkt. 100-3 at 23) that include significant protections for inmates’ religious freedom.\n\nDkt. 100-2; Dkt. 100-3. These policies could suggest that Defendant Lappin was aware that\n\nBOP personnel required specific oversight and guidance if they were to avoid infringing on\n\ninmates’ religious liberty, and that it was thus “highly likely” that failure to provide similar\n\noversight and guidance to private prisons would cause RFRA violations like the ones Plaintiff\n\nalleges here.\n\n       Plaintiff’s argument fails to take into account, however, that BOP did maintain a policy\n\nrequiring private prisons to comply with RFRA. In their Statement of Undisputed Facts,\n\nDefendants asserted that “The BOP specifically requires private facilities to comply with\n\n[RFRA], and to ensure the religious services programs are consistent with this Act.” Dkt. 68-2 ¶\n\n25. Plaintiff admitted this fact, although he disputed “that BOP has ensured that Rivers comply\n\nwith RFRA.” Dkt. 72-1 at 7 (Defendant’s Statement of Genuine Issues). Here is the problem:\n\nthe only act that the Complaint alleges Defendant Lappin did that could potentially expose him\n\nto supervisory liability under Rizzo and Haynesworth is his promulgation of a policy requiring\n\nthat BOP facilities take steps to comply with RFRA. Had he done that while leaving private\n\nprisons free, as a matter of policy, to violate RFRA, his failure to provide a policy might suffice\n\nto link him to the harms Plaintiff alleges. But the undisputed evidence shows that BOP\n\n“specifically require[d]” compliance with RFRA in both agency-operated and private facilities.\n\nDkt. 68-2 ¶ 25. There is no showing that differences in policy caused Plaintiff’s harm. If, on the\n\nother hand, differences in enforcement were the cause of that harm, Plaintiff has not alleged that\n\nDefendant Lappin was personally involved in enforcement of BOP policies such as the ones at\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fissue, much less that it was “highly likely” that any deficiency in his personal oversight of policy\n\nenforcement would give rise to the harm he alleges.\n\n       Finding Defendant Lappin liable under these circumstances would appear to authorize\n\nindividual-capacity claims for damages against the BOP director for virtually any RFRA\n\nviolation—if a violation occurred and BOP policies require compliance with RFRA, the BOP\n\ndirector failed to ensure that the agency’s policies were enforced. But that line of reasoning,\n\nbased not on evidence of the defendant’s personal acts but instead on inferences about nothing\n\nmore than his position, see Dkt. 118 ¶ 132, would create precisely the sort of vicarious liability\n\nthat the Court has concluded RFRA does not provide. The evidence and the allegations in this\n\nmatter show that Defendant Lappin was personally responsible for (at most) BOP’s relevant\n\npolicies, and that BOP’s relevant policies prohibited RFRA violations in the prisons in which\n\nPlaintiff asserts they took place. Plaintiff has therefore failed to come forward with evidence of\n\nany personal involvement by Defendant Lappin in the RFRA violations he alleges, and\n\nDefendant Lappin is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. 2\n\n       3.   Sufficiency of Plaintiff’s Allegations under Twombly and Iqbal\n\n       Because Defendant Lappin is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s RFRA count,\n\nthe Court need not consider his argument that Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to state a\n\nclaim under RFRA. If and when Plaintiff serves the Doe defendants—who are not presently\n\nparticipating in this action—those defendants will be afforded an opportunity to request that the\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The Court concludes that it is appropriate to treat BOP’s motion as a motion for summary\njudgment with respect to this claim. Although Plaintiff, in his opposition to BOP’s motion,\nrequested an opportunity for discovery in the event the Court treats the motion as one for\nsummary judgment, that request sought information to “test the accuracy of Defendants’\ntestimony about the purported rational basis for their . . . policies” and did not concern Plaintiff’s\nRFRA claim. Dkt. 72 at 44.\n                                                 19\n\fCourt reconsider Chief Judge Roberts’s conclusion that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded\n\nsubstantive RFRA violations. See Dkt. 90 at 4-7.\n\nC. The Privacy Act\n\n        Plaintiff also alleges that the Bureau of Prisons has violated his rights under the Privacy\n\nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Plaintiff asserts that while he was incarcerated at FCI Big Spring in 2004,\n\nhe wrote a letter to the Dallas Morning News in which he claimed that a fellow inmate, David\n\nDuke, was receiving preferential treatment from BOP staff as a result of his “notoriety.” Dkt.\n\n118 ¶¶ 82, 140. According to Plaintiff, prison officials improperly opened and read Plaintiff’s\n\nletter; they then wrote a memorandum that documented the event and recommended that Plaintiff\n\nbe transferred to a different facility. Id. ¶ 144. Plaintiff contends that BOP retains this\n\nmemorandum in its files, and that doing so violates the Privacy Act’s prohibition against\n\nmaintaining records “‘describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First\n\nAmendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is\n\nmaintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of authorized law enforcement activity.’”\n\nId. ¶ 146 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 522a(e)(7)).\n\n        BOP moves to dismiss this count on three grounds. First, it argues that the memorandum\n\nat issue falls under the “authorized law enforcement activity” exception to the Privacy Act. Dkt.\n\n68-1 at 28-29. Next, it contends that Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim is barred by the doctrine of res\n\njudicata, based on Plaintiff’s effort to litigate the issue in a prior action. Id. at 29-30. Finally, it\n\nargues that the Privacy Act claim is barred by the Act’s two-year statute of limitations because\n\nPlaintiff has known of the existence of the memorandum at issue since at least 2006. Id. at 30-\n\n31. None of these arguments is persuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\f          1. The Law Enforcement Activity Exception\n\n          As the Court of Appeals has noted, although the phrase “law enforcement activity” may\n\n“summon[ ] up images of criminal law, the legislative history of the provision makes it clear that\n\nit does not have that meaning here.” Nagel v. Dep’t of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 725 F.2d 1438,\n\n1441 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Rather, the phrase is “liberally” construed, Maydak v. United States,\n\n363 F.3d 512, 517 (D.C. Cir. 2004), to include “an authorized criminal investigation or . . . and\n\nauthorized intelligence or administrative one,” Nagel, 725 F.2d at 1441 n.3 (quotation marks\n\nomitted). In addition, it applies to “[a]n employer’s determination whether an employee is\n\nperforming his job adequately,” id. at 1441, to an employer’s evaluating or disciplining an\n\nemployee, id., and to BOP activity directed at maintaining “prison security,” Maydak, 363 F.3d\n\nat 517.\n\n          In Maydak, the Court of Appeals concluded that declarations submitted by prison\n\nofficials were sufficient to demonstrate that “examining photographs [of inmates arguably\n\nexercising First Amendment rights] for conduct that may threaten [prison] security is pertinent to\n\nand within the scope of the authorized law enforcement activity.” Id. The Court also noted,\n\nhowever, that certain of the declarations in that case raised questions about other uses of the\n\nphotographs, including what the declarants meant by terms such as “investigative or informative\n\nvalue.” Id. As a result, the Court remanded the case to the district court to determine the nature\n\nof the use of the photographs on a more complete record.\n\n          Maydak is dispositive of BOP’s argument at this stage of the litigation. BOP notes, for\n\nexample, that a memorandum “pertaining [to] the prison staff’s treatment of inmates would fall\n\nunder this exception.” Dkt. 68-1 at 28-29 (emphasis added). But BOP has not submitted any\n\nevidence regarding how the alleged memorandum was actually prepared, maintained, or used.\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fUnder these circumstances, the Court concludes that Defendants cannot, on the present record,\n\nrely upon the law enforcement exception to avoid Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim.\n\n       2. Res Judicata\n\n       BOP next argues that Plaintiff’s claim under the Privacy Act is res judicata. To establish\n\nthat his claim is precluded under this doctrine, BOP must show that Plaintiff previously brought\n\nsuit against the same defendant based on the same cause of action, and that that suit resulted in a\n\nfinal judgment on the merits of the claim he raises here. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439\n\nU.S. 322, 326 n.5 (1979) (“Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior\n\nsuit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of\n\naction.”); Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 393 F.3d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n       The factual basis for this contention is a matter of public record. In 2004, Plaintiff\n\nbrought a lawsuit in this Court that included a Privacy Act claim relating to the memorandum at\n\nissue here. Patel v. United States, No. 08-1168-D, 2009 WL 1377530, at *6 (W.D. Okla. May\n\n14, 2009). The action was promptly transferred to the Eastern District of Arkansas, where the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim without prejudice for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies. Id. at *4-5. The action was subsequently transferred to the Eastern\n\nDistrict of North Carolina and then to the Western District of Oklahoma, where Plaintiff moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the Eastern District of Arkansas’s dismissal of his Privacy Act claim. Id.\n\nat *1. The court rejected that motion, holding that Plaintiff had not shown clear error or any\n\nchange in legal or factual circumstances that would justify reconsideration of the prior dismissal.\n\nThe court also noted that it was “particularly reluctant to reinstate a Privacy Act claim that was\n\ndismissed without prejudice” because Plaintiff had several years in which he “could have\n\nbrought a separate action and presented his additional proof of exhaustion.” Id. at 5. In the\n\ncourt’s view, it was “inconsistent with Congress’[s] purpose in providing civil remedies under\n                                                 22\n\fthe Privacy Act to permit an individual to bring a private action years later under these\n\ncircumstances.” Id. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the “dismissal without prejudice.” Patel v.\n\nUnited States, 399 Fed. App’x 355, 361 (10th Cir. 2010).\n\n       There was no “judgment on the merits” of Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim in the prior\n\nlitigation. As the district court in Oklahoma observed, and the Tenth Circuit explicitly affirmed,\n\nPlaintiff’s claim was dismissed “without prejudice” because he had not exhausted administrative\n\nremedies by petitioning BOP to remove the memorandum at issue from its files. Id.; Patel, 2009\n\nWL 1377530, at *5. The Western District of Oklahoma’s refusal to reconsider that decision did\n\nnothing to change the decision of the transferor court—indeed, the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nrecognized that, because the earlier dismissal had been without prejudice, Plaintiff could have\n\nsimply exhausted his administrative remedies and brought a new action. BOP relies on the\n\nlanguage in that court’s decision suggesting that the court believed Plaintiff had been dilatory in\n\npursuing his claim, but fails to explain how that statement could have transformed the Western\n\nDistrict of Oklahoma’s decision declining to reconsider the decision of the transferor court into a\n\ndecision that actually changed the earlier dismissal “without prejudice” into a disposition on the\n\nmerits. Because Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim has never been adjudicated on the merits, the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata does not bar him from asserting it in this action.\n\n       3. The Statute of Limitations\n\n       BOP’s final argument is that Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim is barred by the applicable\n\nstatute of limitations. Absent material and willful misrepresentation on the part of an agency,\n\nany “action to enforce any liability created under” the Privacy Act must be brought “within two\n\nyears from the date on which the cause of action arises.” 5 U.S.C. § 522a(g)(5). BOP argues\n\nthat because Plaintiff “knew of the existence of the memorandum” at issue by February 9, 2006\n\nat the latest, the statute of limitations began running on that date and expired on February 9,\n                                                 23\n\f2008—more than one year before he first alleged his Privacy Act claim in this action. Dkt. 68-1\n\nat 31.\n\n          BOP misreads the statute. The Privacy Act allows a suit to be brought “[w]henever any\n\nagency makes a determination . . . not to amend an individual’s record in accordance with his\n\nrequest.” 5 U.S.C. § 522a(g)(1)(A). Plaintiff alleges that he petitioned BOP to amend his record\n\non February 20, 2009 and that his request was denied on April 30, 2009—this denial triggered\n\nhis right to bring suit. BOP has identified no case law or other authority for the counterintuitive\n\nproposition that a Privacy Act plaintiff’s “cause of action arises” before the plaintiff can bring a\n\nsuit. Indeed, BOP itself notes that “[t]he statute of limitations [under the Privacy Act]\n\n‘commences at the time that a person knows or has reason to know that his request had been\n\ndenied.’” Dkt. 76 at 13 (quoting Englerius v. Veterans Admin., 837 F.2d 895, 897 (9th Cir.\n\n1988)).\n\n          In its reply, BOP asserts for the first time that Plaintiff in fact “was . . . aware that his\n\nrequest for an amendment had been denied” in 2006. Dkt. 76 at 14. Although BOP does not\n\nexplain this assertion or cite to the record, it appears that the agency is referring to the fact that\n\nPlaintiff submitted documents to the Arkansas and Oklahoma district courts that, in Plaintiff’s\n\nview at the time, established that in 2004 he had requested relief from BOP under the Privacy\n\nAct and that his request had been denied. These documents formed the basis for Plaintiff’s\n\nrequests for reconsideration of the order dismissing his Privacy Act claim. See Patel v. United\n\nStates, No. 08-cv-1168 (W.D. Okla. 2009), Dkt. 269; Patel v. United States, No. 04-cv-00771\n\n(E.D. Ark. 2006) Dkt. 77.\n\n          The Court need not independently determine whether these documents in fact show that\n\nPlaintiff adequately requested and was denied the relief he seeks here, however, because the\n\nUnited States has previously taken the position that they do not. See Response to Plaintiff’s\n                                                     24\n\fMotion to Reconsider, Patel v. United States, No. 04-cv-00771 (E.D. Ark. 2006) Dkt. 78 (“It is\n\nclear that the remedy [request] submitted by the Plaintiff in support of his Motion to Reconsider\n\naddresses not the maintaining of a memo, but rather the opening of special mail and reading\n\nsame outside of Plaintiff’s presence.”). The district court denied Plaintiff’s motion. Having\n\nargued successfully to another district court that Plaintiff’s 2004 request was insufficient to give\n\nrise to a right to sue, BOP cannot now assert the opposite position in order to defeat Plaintiff’s\n\nclaim on timeliness grounds. See, e.g., Comcast Corp. v. FCC, 600 F.3d 642, 647 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010) (“Courts may invoke judicial estoppel where a party assumes a certain position in a legal\n\nproceeding, succeeds in maintaining that position, and then, simply because his interests have\n\nchanged, assumes a contrary position.”) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). And even if\n\nBOP were not estopped from arguing that a claim had accrued based on Patel’s 2004 request and\n\nthe Court concluded that one had, it is not clear that that fact would bar the subsequent accrual of\n\na new claim based on BOP’s denial of the 2009 request. The Privacy Act states that an\n\n“individual may bring a civil action” “whenever any agency . . . makes a determination . . . not\n\nto amend [the] individual’s record in accordance with his request.” 5 U.S.C. § 522a(g)(1).\n\nThere is thus no explicit statutory bar to a Privacy Act claim predicated on a duplicative request\n\nto amend records, and BOP has not identified case law inferring that such a bar exists.\n\n       BOP argues that allowing suits, like this one, triggered by the denial of Privacy Act\n\nrequests that had previously been submitted would allow “an individual . . . to maintain a Privacy\n\nAct amendment claim in perpetuity as long as he continued to submit requests for amendment\n\nand to receive adverse agency determinations.” Dkt. 76 at 14. This argument is not persuasive.\n\nRes judicata and collateral estoppel prevent a plaintiff from pursuing successive lawsuits based\n\non identical Privacy Act requests after an adverse judgment on the merits—there is no specter of\n\nnever ending litigation. BOP’s real objection is to the fact that a plaintiff who knows of the\n                                                 25\n\fexistence of a record that allegedly violates the Privacy Act may wait as long as he pleases\n\nbefore requesting that the agency amend the record—or make repeated requests to the agency—\n\nwithout jeopardizing his right to judicial review. But there is nothing absurd about this result,\n\nwhich, in any event, follows directly from the statutory language. A request for amendment\n\nunder the Privacy Act seeks prospective relief to remedy the government’s ongoing maintenance\n\nof an improper or incorrect record. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2)(B); 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(2)(A) (in\n\nsuit seeking review of denial of amendment, “the court may order the agency to amend the\n\nindividual’s record in accordance with his request or in any such other way as the court may\n\ndirect”). As long as such an injury is ongoing, there is no reason that a plaintiff seeking relief\n\nfrom it should be categorically barred from doing so simply because he could have sought relief\n\nearlier. 3\n\n         Because BOP’s denial of Plaintiff’s 2009 request to amend gave rise to a claim under the\n\nPrivacy Act, Plaintiff’s claim is timely.\n\nD. FOIA Claims\n\n         BOP also moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s FOIA claims. When a plaintiff\n\nalleges that an agency has improperly withheld records, the reviewing court must “determine the\n\nmatter de novo.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). FOIA cases are typically resolved on motions for\n\nsummary judgment, which require that the moving party demonstrate that there are no genuine\n\nissues of material fact and he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477\n\n\n\n3\n  It is possible that laches might apply to bar suits where, for example, a Privacy Act plaintiff’s\ndelay in requesting amendment has allowed the loss of evidence necessary to establish an\nexemption. See generally Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1962 (2014)\n(considering applicability of laches to suit under the Copyright Act). The Court need not decide\nwhether laches or a similar doctrine can apply under the Privacy Act, however, because BOP has\nnot argued or presented evidence showing that it would be entitled to relief under any such\ndoctrine.\n                                                  26\n\fU.S. at 325; Beltranena v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 821 F. Supp. 2d 167, 175 (D.D.C. 2011) (noting\n\nthat FOIA cases are “frequently” decided on motions for summary judgment). To meet its\n\nburden, the government must generally submit “relatively detailed and non-conclusory”\n\naffidavits or declarations establishing the adequacy of its search for responsive documents,\n\nSafeCard Servs. Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991), and an index of the\n\ninformation withheld, see Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 827-28 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Summers,\n\n140 F.3d at 1080 (explaining that to carry its burden, agency that declines to produce a requested\n\ndocument “must submit a Vaughn index to explain why it has withheld information”). Affidavits\n\nprovided by an agency are “accorded a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by\n\npurely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other documents.” Safecard\n\nServs., 926 F.2d at 1200 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       1. Documents Related to Office of Inspector General Report\n\n       Plaintiff’s first FOIA claim arises from a 2004 request that he characterizes as seeking\n\n“documents related to a [Justice Department Office of the Inspector General (‘OIG’)] report.”\n\nDkt. 118 ¶ 152. Plaintiff actually filed this request with the OIG; when OIG determined that 21\n\npages of the records it identified as responsive “originated with” BOP, it referred those\n\ndocuments to BOP to be reviewed and, if appropriate, released. Dkt. 68-6 ¶ 4 & Exh. A.\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that he received all 21 pages of the materials, although six pages\n\ncontained redactions. Dkt. 118 ¶ 153. He objects, however, that “[n]one of the exhibits or\n\nwitness interviews associated with the OIG report . . . were provided, nor was any reason\n\nprovided for their withholding.” Id. BOP’s response is simple and compelling: the agency’s\n\nresponsibility was limited to reviewing and releasing the documents that were referred to it. Dkt.\n\n68-1 at 32. BOP had no obligation to search for or to provide additional information in response\n\nto Plaintiff’s 2004 FOIA request to OIG.\n                                                27\n\f       If the 2004 request to OIG were the only one at issue in this count, BOP would be\n\nentitled to summary judgment. Plaintiff also alleges, however, that he filed three “similar\n\nrequests with the BOP” in 2005. These requests are not clearly identified in the Complaint, but\n\nin his opposition to Defendants’ motion (Dkt. 72 at 36-37), Plaintiff focuses on a March 24,\n\n2005, letter to Plaintiff quoting the contents of his requests (Dkt. 68-6, Exh. G). Among other\n\nthings, Plaintiff sought “[a]ll notes, memoranda, investigative documents, etc. created since\n\nSeptember 1, 2003 and ending on February 1, 2004 pertaining to an investigation conducted into\n\n[Plaintiff’s] alleged misconduct and placement in the SHU at FCI Big Spring, Texas.” Id.\n\nBOP’s declaration states that in responding to these requests the agency produced seven\n\ncomplete pages and three redacted pages to Plaintiff. Dkt. 68-6 ¶ 13.\n\n       Plaintiff contends, however, that BOP’s search must have been inadequate because the\n\nagency did not provide any of the exhibits to the OIG report—exhibits that, in Plaintiff’s view,\n\nwould have been responsive to his request. Dkt. 72 at 37. For example, Plaintiff contends that\n\n“the OIG reviewed photographs, a medical assessment, memoranda, reports, and other\n\ndocuments regarding Mr. Patel’s injuries . . . sustained in an assault at FCI Big Spring,” and he\n\ncites particular exhibits to the OIG report that he believes were likely responsive to his 2005\n\nFOIA requests. Id. at 37-38. It is not clear whether the exhibits Plaintiff identifies are indeed\n\nresponsive. He refers to a document titled “Inmate Injury Assessment and Follow-Up for Kamal\n\nPatel,” for example, and to a “SENTRY printout regarding Inmate Profile and\n\nSecurity/Designation for inmate Patel.” Id. Either of those documents might be “notes,\n\nmemoranda, investigative documents, etc. . . . pertaining to an investigation conducted into\n\n[Plaintiff’s] alleged misconduct and placement in the SHU at FCI Big Spring,” but Plaintiff has\n\npresented no further evidence demonstrating that they actually are. The other document he refers\n\nto that “pertain[s] directly to Mr. Patel”—a “Letter Dated November 15, 2005, from Assistant\n                                                 28\n\fUnited States Attorney Robert McRoberts to Inmate Patel”—post-dates BOP’s response to his\n\n2005 FOIA requests. Dkt. 72 at 38; see Dkt. 68-6 Exh. G. Plaintiff cites other exhibits to the\n\nOIG report that “appear to be responsive as well,” including three affidavits, with the affiants’\n\nnames redacted (dated January 15, 2004), “Photographs documenting inmate Kamal Patel’s\n\ninjuries,” additional “SENTRY printout[s],” a memo “regarding BOP OIA interview” of a\n\nperson, and an incident report regarding an assault on Plaintiff. Dkt. 72 at 38 n.20; see Dkt. 72-7\n\nat 17-19. Once again, some of these documents might be responsive to Plaintiff’s request to\n\nBOP—but his request to BOP was narrower than his request to OIG, and there is no basis in the\n\nrecord to conclude that all of the OIG documents relate to Plaintiff’s “alleged misconduct and\n\nplacement in the SHU” or the other particular topics he identified in requests to BOP.\n\n       For present purposes the critical question for the Court is whether BOP’s declaration\n\nshows that the agency conducted an adequate search for the records Plaintiff requested in 2005.\n\nThe Court concludes that it does not. To prevail on a motion for summary judgment where the\n\nadequacy of its search for records is challenged, BOP must provide a “reasonably detailed\n\naffidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all\n\nfiles likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) were searched.” Oglesby v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Although BOP’s declaration states that\n\nPlaintiff received documents in response to Plaintiff’s 2005 requests, it contains no information\n\nwhatsoever about what record systems the agency searched, what search criteria it used, or\n\nwhether the agency reviewed the potentially responsive documents Plaintiff cites. See Dkt. 68-6\n\n¶ 13. Although it may be the case that BOP has, in fact, produced all documents in its\n\npossession that are responsive to Plaintiff’s 2005 requests, BOP has not carried its burden on\n\nsummary judgment to prove that it has done so. Therefore, in this respect, BOP’s motion must\n\nbe denied.\n                                                 29\n\f       Plaintiff also argues that BOP failed to provide a Vaughn index cataloguing and\n\njustifying its redactions to the three pages he has received in response to his 2005 requests. Dkt.\n\n72 at 38. BOP responds, in a footnote in its reply, that it “does not believe that Patel’s March 24,\n\n2005 FOIA request . . . is at issue in this litigation and [BOP] therefore has not provided a\n\nVaughn index” for the pages disclosed pursuant to that request. Dkt. 76 at 18 n.8. It does appear\n\nfrom the parties’ briefing that there has been uncertainty regarding which of Plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequests are indeed at issue. Some of this uncertainty is attributable to a lack of specificity in\n\nPlaintiff’s Complaint. See Dkt. 118 ¶ 155 (describing 2005 requests as “similar to” 2004 request\n\nto OIG, even though they appear to have sought substantially different—but potentially\n\noverlapping—sets of documents). The Court concludes, however, that, reasonably construed, the\n\nComplaint does place the February 15, 2005 FOIA request at issue in this litigation.\n\nAccordingly, BOP must provide Plaintiff a Vaughn index as to those three pages before it can\n\nobtain summary judgment in its favor.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff contests redactions to the documents referred to BOP by OIG (pursuant\n\nto Plaintiff’s separate OIG request) that were “‘applied to protect the statements of inmates and\n\nstaff who provided information for a BOP investigation.’” Dkt. 72 at 38 (quoting Dkt. 68-6,\n\nExh. C). BOP argues that the statements at issue satisfy the criteria for FOIA exemptions 6 and\n\n7(C). Exemption 6 permits agencies to withhold “personnel and medical files and similar files\n\nthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) covers “records or information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or\n\ninformation . . . could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.”\n\nId. § 552(b)(7)(C). To rely on these exceptions, BOP must do more than merely recite that\n\nstatements were withheld to protect individuals’ privacy. Instead, it must show that the “privacy\n                                                 30\n\finterests that would be compromised by disclosure” outweigh “the public interest in release of\n\nthe requested information.” Davis v. Dep’t of Justice, 968 F.2d 1276, 1281 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n       Here, BOP has not provided a sufficiently detailed explanation of the privacy interests\n\nthat it contends would be compromised by disclosure of the witness statements. It may be that\n\nthe redaction of the names of witnesses and other persons mentioned in the statements is\n\nsufficient to guarantee the anonymity of these individuals—if so, then there is no apparent\n\nprivacy interest protected by withholding the substance of the statements. If, on the other hand,\n\nthe subject matter of the statements is such that its disclosure would facilitate the identification\n\nof witnesses or others even if their names were redacted, it is more likely that BOP will be\n\nentitled to a finding that exemptions 6 and 7(C) apply. To prevail on summary judgment,\n\ntherefore, BOP needs to provide some evidence that the subject matter of the redacted statements\n\nitself is sufficient to identify particular individuals who have a privacy interest in remaining\n\nanonymous. BOP has not met that burden at this juncture.\n\n       Because BOP has not demonstrated that it conducted an adequate search for documents\n\nresponsive to Plaintiff’s 2005 FOIA requests, has not provided a Vaughn index cataloguing its\n\nredactions to the documents produced in response to those requests, and has not shown that\n\nFOIA exemptions 6 and 7(C) cover the content of the relevant statements even though the\n\nspeakers remain anonymous, BOP’s motion for summary judgment on Count IV of the\n\nComplaint is denied.\n\n       2. Documents Related to Plaintiff’s Protective Hearing\n\n       Plaintiff also seeks to compel production of documents related to a protection hearing\n\nthat took place while he was incarcerated at Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. Dkt. 118 ¶\n\n159. Plaintiff alleges that he received 247 pages in their entirety in response to this request, as\n\nwell as 128 pages with redactions. Id. ¶ 160. He also asserts that several documents were\n                                                  31\n\fwithheld in their entirety and that the BOP did not provide a Vaughn index cataloguing its\n\nassertions of FOIA exemptions. 4 Id. When BOP moved for summary judgment, it provided a\n\nVaughn index identifying the sixteen documents withheld in their entirety and the basis for\n\nwithholding each document. Dkt. 68-5, Exh. 5. It also described, in general terms, the bases for\n\nthe redactions made to those documents produced in part, Dkt. 68-5 ¶¶ 10-15, and provided\n\ncopies of the redacted documents with exemption designations indicated for each redaction, Dkt.\n\n76-2 ¶ 5. In his briefing, Plaintiff argues that BOP failed to demonstrate that there was no\n\nreasonably segregable non-exempt information in five of the documents that were withheld in\n\ntheir entirety, and that BOP erroneously asserted the deliberative process privilege to withhold a\n\nmemorandum relating to Plaintiff’s protective custody hearing. Dkt. 72 at 41-43.\n\n       As an initial matter, the Court concludes that BOP’s Vaughn index was adequate for\n\npresent purposes. Taken together, the measures described above allow the Court to “conduct a\n\nmeaningful de novo review of [BOP’s] claim of an exemption.” Brown v. FBI, 675 F. Supp. 2d\n\n122, 130 (D.D.C. 2009); see Gallant v. NLRB, 26 F.3d 168, 173 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (“the materials\n\nprovided by the agency may take any form so long as they give the reviewing court a reasonable\n\nbasis to evaluate the claim of privilege”) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Although\n\ncompiling a traditional Vaughn index would perhaps have allowed less cumbersome review of\n\nthe redactions, the system employed by BOP in this case satisfied the functional requirements of\n\nVaughn and its progeny.\n\n       Plaintiff’s contention that BOP has failed to demonstrate that certain documents withheld\n\nin their entirety do not contain reasonably segregable non-exempt information has more merit.\n\n\n\n4\n  BOP subsequently produced four previously pages with redactions and determined that six of\nthem were non-responsive. Dkt. 68-5 ¶ 3. Thus, to date, 16 pages have been withheld in their\nentirety and 132 pages have been produced with redactions. Id.\n                                             32\n\f“[S]imply . . . showing that [a document] contains some exempt material” is not enough to\n\n“justify withholding [the] entire document.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Air\n\nForce, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Instead, “non-exempt portions of a document must\n\nbe disclosed unless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.” Id. The\n\nrequirement in Mead Data that “an agency should . . . describe what proportion of the\n\ninformation in a document is non-exempt and how that material is dispersed throughout the\n\ndocument,” id. at 261, may have been “relaxed” by “more recent decisions,” Muttit v. Dep’t of\n\nState, 926 F. Supp. 2d 284, 310 (D.D.C. 2013). But it remains the case that the government must\n\ncarry its “burden of demonstrating that no reasonably segregable information exists” within\n\nwithheld documents and that the Court must evaluate the agency’s Vaughn index and\n\ndeclarations to determine whether the requisite showing has been made. Loving v. Dep’t of\n\nDefense, 550 F.3d 32, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Here, BOP’s declaration states that “[e]very effort has been made to provide plaintiff\n\nwith all reasonably segregable portions of the records requested;” that “[n]o reasonably\n\nsegregable non-exempt portions of these records have been withheld from Plaintiff;” and that\n\n“no further information can be segregated without releasing information properly withheld”\n\nunder various exemptions. Dkt. 68-5 ¶ 16. BOP does not explain, however, why any of the\n\nwithheld documents whose segregability Plaintiff contests cannot be further segregated. This\n\nfact distinguishes this case from Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 97 F.3d 575\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996), where the government justified its entire withholding of particular pages with\n\nnon-conclusory, document-by-document explanations. See, e.g., 97 F.3d at 579 (quoting\n\ngovernment’s assertion that note “‘consists of an extensive review of numerous intelligence\n\ncables, revealing one piece of specific intelligence after another’”); id. at 580 (declaration\n\nasserted that specific “sensitive topics ‘are discussed throughout the redacted segment and there\n                                                 33\n\fare no further intelligible segments which can be segregated’”). Likewise, the agency in Soto v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of State, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2015 WL 4692415, at *11 (D.D.C. Aug. 6, 2015),\n\nsubmitted an affidavit explaining that “the information in each responsive document [in that\n\ncase] ‘pertain[ed] exclusively to the issuance or refusal of a visa to enter the United States’” and\n\nwas thus entirely exempt from disclosure under FOIA. BOP has not made a similar showing that\n\nthe documents at issue contain exclusively exempt information here.\n\n       The nature of the exemptions asserted to withhold the relevant documents here also cuts\n\nagainst a finding that BOP has met its burden. For documents 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 on its Vaughn\n\nindex, BOP relies either largely or exclusively on the personal privacy exemptions (b)(6) and\n\n(b)(7)(C)—exemptions that under some circumstances might require only that identified\n\nindividuals’ names or other identifying information be redacted. See, e.g., Paxson v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Justice, 41 F. Supp. 3d 55, 57-58 (D.D.C. 2014) (exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) invoked to\n\nredact “names and other identifying information, like telephone numbers, of FBI Special Agents\n\nand support personnel”). This circumstance makes it particularly important, in this case, for\n\nBOP to provide some level of specific explanation why further segregation is not possible.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff argues that BOP erroneously invoked exemption (b)(5), which protects\n\nmemoranda and letters over which an agency could assert a privilege in litigation (see Coastal\n\nStates Gas Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 862 (D.C. Cir. 1980)), to withhold page 7 of\n\n“Document 1” in its Vaughn index. BOP describes Document 1 as a “[m]emorandum” that was\n\n“created as a result of a hearing conducted for protective custody status.” Dkt. 68-5, Exh. 5. In\n\nPlaintiff’s view, BOP has “failed to establish that this document contains non-segregable pre-\n\ndecisional information,” which is subject to exemption (b)(5), rather than information “reporting\n\na final decision and the reasoning of the decision maker, neither of which are exempt.” Dkt. 72\n\nat 51 (citing Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866). BOP responds that it invoked exemption (b)(5)\n                                                 34\n\fbecause page 7 of Document 1 “reveal[s] pre-decisional information involved in the decision-\n\nmaking process that pertain[s] to protective custody of other inmates and the security of the\n\ninstitution.” Dkt. 76-2 ¶ 6.\n\n       BOP’s current showing is insufficient to establish that the document in question is\n\nprivileged. When asserting the privilege to justify application of FOIA exemption (b)(5), “the\n\nagency has the burden of establishing what deliberative process is involved, and the role played\n\nby the documents in issue in the course of that process.” Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 868. In a\n\nprison, there are presumably many different “decision-making process[es] that pertain to\n\nprotective custody of other inmates” or “the security of the institution,” and each of these\n\nprocesses presumably involves the creation of investigative or decisional memoranda. BOP has\n\nprovided no information regarding the “role played by the” redacted discussions in the process of\n\ndetermining whether to hold inmates in protective custody—or, indeed, any information relating\n\nto the nature of the “deliberation” at issue. Without further detail, the Court is not in a position\n\nto determine whether exemption (b)(5) is applicable.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for\n\nsummary judgment, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the RFRA claim against Defendant Lappin is GRANTED. The Court\n\ndefers ruling as to Plaintiff’s RFRA claims against the John Doe Defendants and his Equal\n\nProtection Clause claim against Defendant Clark until those parties have had an opportunity to\n\nfile dispositive motions. BOP’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim is DENIED.\n\nBOP’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s remaining FOIA claims is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       BOP’s motion for protective order (Dkt. 82), which seeks to stay discovery pending\n\nresolution of BOP’s motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, is DENIED\n\nas moot.\n\n       The parties shall appear for a status conference on September 3, 2015, at 10:30 AM in\n\nCourtroom 21, to discuss the schedule for discovery and any additional anticipated dispositive\n\nmotions.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n                                                    /s/ Randolph D.

For the reasons stated herein, the motion is GRANTED in\n\npart and DENIED in part. An appropriate order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff, Kemal Patel, filed this lawsuit pro se in 2009. See Dkt. 1. Patel is a citizen of\n\nthe United Kingdom; when he filed suit, he was a legal permanent resident of the United States\n\nand was incarcerated in a facility run by Defendant Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). Id. ¶ 4. The\n\noriginal complaint alleged that Patel was subjected to unfair treatment while incarcerated based\n\non his status as a noncitizen—specifically, he alleged that BOP denied noncitizen inmates the\n\nsame transfer and prison programming opportunities provided to U.S. citizens. Id. ¶¶ 15-38. An\n\namended complaint, filed on June 8, 2009, added Dale Brown as an additional plaintiff and new\n\nclaims under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended\n\nComplaint on September 1, 2009, which added allegations that BOP had wrongfully assigned\n\nnoncitizen inmates to private prisons where they were subjected to “significantly more onerous\n\fconditions of confinement.” Dkt. 13 ¶¶ 53-69.\n\n          Plaintiffs obtained pro bono counsel in 2010. See Dkt. 45. On July 12, 2010, they filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. Dkt. 65. The Third Amended Complaint\n\nincluded eleven counts: challenges to the BOP’s assignment and treatment of noncitizen inmates\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause and Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”); an alleged\n\nviolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”); an Eighth Amendment claim\n\nrelating to exposure to second-hand smoke; a claim under the Equal Protection Clause and the\n\nAPA relating to transfers of noncitizen inmates; a claim under the Privacy Act; and three FOIA\n\nclaims.\n\n          Although Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend was not granted until September 7, 2011,\n\nDkt. 90, the instant motion was originally directed at the Third Amended Complaint. See Dkt.\n\n68 at 1. Subsequently, both Patel and Brown were released from BOP custody. In order to\n\nclarify the scope of the proceedings in light of their release, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to\n\nfile a Fourth Amended Complaint (the “Complaint”). Dkt. 118. In the Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint, Brown no longer appears as a plaintiff and Patel has dropped many of his claims for\n\ninjunctive relief. The Complaint includes damages claims under the Equal Protection Clause and\n\nRFRA (Counts I and II, respectively), a claim for injunctive relief under the Privacy Act (Count\n\nIII), and two FOIA counts (Counts IV and V). The parties have agreed that the arguments in the\n\ninstant motion may be applied to the Fourth Amended Complaint, provided that Defendants will\n\nhave the opportunity to file a supplemental motion raising additional defenses particular to the\n\nFourth Amended Complaint in the event the case is not dismissed in its entirety. See Dkt. 117 at\n\n2 n.1.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                                    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n         On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court must “treat the complaint’s\n\nfactual allegations as true [and] must grant plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be\n\nderived from the facts alleged.” Gilvin v.

DISCUSSION\n\nA. Equal Protection\n\n       Plaintiff asserts his equal protection claim (Count I) against only Defendant Clark in his\n\nindividual capacity. Dkt 118 at 16. At oral argument in this matter, however, the Court became\n\naware that Clark had not yet been served. Although counsel for the United States has advanced\n\nseveral arguments for dismissal of the equal protection claim, counsel has also expressly stated\n\nthat he lacks authorization to represent Clark. Plaintiff filed a proof of service on Clark after oral\n\nargument (Dkt. 125); however, there is no indication in the record that counsel for the United\n\nStates has yet been authorized to represent him.\n\n       Because the only defendant against whom Plaintiff alleges his equal protection claim is\n\nnot represented by any attorney who has appeared, it would be inappropriate for the Court to rule\n\non the merits of the equal protection claim at this time. After an attorney for Clark notices an\n\nappearance, Clark will have an opportunity to move to dismiss the equal protection claim against\n\nhim and raise any appropriate arguments in support of that motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fB. RFRA\n\n       Plaintiff’s RFRA allegations focus on his treatment at CI Rivers and CI Big Spring, two\n\nprivate prisons at which he was incarcerated in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Dkt. 118 ¶¶ 90-91,\n\n119, 121. At CI Rivers, Plaintiff, who is Muslim, alleges that he was not permitted to pray while\n\non work duty, and that, as a result, he was unable to pray “at the times required by his religious\n\nbeliefs.” Id. ¶ 95. At CI Big Spring, Plaintiff alleges he was not provided halal meals and was\n\nprohibited from choosing kosher meals. Id. at 97. The alternative meals that were offered to\n\nPlaintiff allegedly contained ingredients that “would be inappropriate for an inmate following a\n\nhalal diet.” Id. ¶ 98. Plaintiff also alleges that, contrary to BOP policy, the company operating\n\nCI Big Spring failed to provide menus and nutritional information to inmates before meals. Id.\n\n¶¶ 99-100. Finally, he alleges that he was not allowed to take all of his meals in the evening on\n\ndays on which fasting was required outside of Ramadan. Id. ¶ 101. Plaintiff’s allegations target\n\nDefendant Lappin, the former director of BOP, as well as three John Doe defendants who were\n\nallegedly responsible for enforcing BOP policy at CI Big Spring. Id. ¶¶ 16-17.\n\n       Defendants argue that these allegations fail to state a claim for three reasons. First, they\n\nassert that RFRA does not authorize damages actions against federal officials in their individual\n\ncapacities. Second, they claim that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient personal involvement\n\nby Defendant Lappin for liability to attach to him. Finally, they argue that Plaintiff’s allegations\n\nare substantively insufficient to state a claim under RFRA. The Court will consider each of these\n\narguments in turn.\n\n       1. Individual-Capacity Damages Claims Against Federal Officials\n\n       The parties disagree on the issue whether RFRA authorizes individual-capacity damages\n\nclaims against federal officials. RFRA allows any “person whose religious exercise has been\n\nburdened in violation of [the statute]” to “assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial\n                                                  5\n\fproceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c). A\n\n“government” is defined to “include[] a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official\n\n(or other person acting under color of law) of the United States.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(1).\n\n        Defendants argue that this definition does not authorize individual-capacity suits against\n\ngovernment officials. They assert that the statute’s use of the word “official” refers only to\n\nofficial-capacity suits, and that the interpretive canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\n\nshow that the term “other person acting under color of law” should be read to authorize only\n\nofficial-capacity claims. Dkt. 98 at 6.\n\n        There are significant flaws in Defendants’ position. It is not at all clear why a statutory\n\nterm authorizing suit against “an official” should be presumed to allow only official-capacity\n\nsuits. Courts routinely recognize that “‘government officials may be sued in their individual\n\ncapacities’” under certain circumstances, e.g., Oberwetter v. Hilliard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216818\"><a href=\"/opinion/216818/oberwetter-v-hilliard/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2011) (citation omitted)—indeed, “officials” are the only persons for whom the distinction\n\nbetween individual-capacity and official-capacity suits has any salience. A statutory term\n\nauthorizing suits against “officials” thus sheds little light on whether and when plaintiffs may sue\n\nthose officials in their individual capacities.\n\n        Defendants’ argument that the phrase “other person acting under color of law” authorizes\n\nonly official-capacity suits is even less persuasive. That phrase contemplates that persons\n\n“other” than “officials” may be sued under RFRA, and persons who are not officials may be sued\n\nonly in their individual capacities. See Jama v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518180\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518180/jama-v-usins/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (D.N.J. 2004).\n\nDefendants’ interpretation would render the entire phrase surplusage: once Congress authorized\n\nofficial-capacity suits against “officials,” adding another term that allowed only official-capacity\n\nsuits would have had no effect whatsoever. Neither of the interpretive canons on which\n\nDefendants rely can overcome this deficiency in their reading of the statute. Under the canon\n                                                  6\n\fejusdem generis, “when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be\n\nunderstood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.” Ali v. BOP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145834\"><a href=\"/opinion/145834/ali-v-federal-bureau-of-prisons/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (2008) (quotation marks omitted). This canon is inapplicable here. The phrase\n\n“other person acting under color of law” appears in § 2000bb-2 not as a final, “catch-all” item in\n\na list, but instead as a parenthetical modifier that expands upon one item on the list. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-2 (“the term ‘government’ includes a branch, department, agency,\n\ninstrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States\n\n. . . .”) (emphasis added). The phrase “official (or other person acting under color of law)” is\n\nthus very similar to the disjunctive phrase to which ejusdem generis was held inapplicable in Ali.\n\n552 U.S. at 225 (“The structure of the phrase ‘any officer of customs or excise or any other law\n\nenforcement officer’ does not lend itself to application of the canon.”). The phrase at issue is\n\nintended to enlarge the category of “person[s]” subject to suit, not to refer to miscellaneous\n\nthings that are “akin to” “branch[es], department[s], agenc[ies], instrumentalit[ies], and\n\nofficial[s].”\n\n        The argument under noscitur a sociis fares no better. Under that precept, “a word may be\n\nknown by the company it keeps.” Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States ex\n\nrel. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1726\"><a href=\"/opinion/1726/graham-county-soil-and-water-conservation-dist-v-united-states-ex-rel/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (2010). It is “‘not an invariable rule,’” however, “‘for the word\n\nmay have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association.’” Id. (quoting Russell\n\nMotor Car Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100180\"><a href=\"/opinion/100180/russell-motor-car-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (1923)). Here, that the phrase “or other\n\nperson acting under the color of law” has a “character of its own” is evident on the face of the\n\nstatute. There is no apparent congruity between a “branch, department, agency [or]\n\ninstrumentality” of the government and a “person,” and the statute expressly differentiates\n\n“officials” from “other person[s].” By authorizing suits against “persons” who are not\n\n“officials,” Congress thus envisioned at least some individual-capacity suits under RFRA.\n                                                 7\n\f       The fact that Congress authorized individual-capacity suits against “other persons acting\n\nunder color of law” at least suggests that it also intended to permit individual-capacity suits\n\nagainst “officials,” but it does not conclusively resolve the issue. Congress could have intended\n\nto permit only official-capacity suits against officials while allowing suits against non-officials\n\n“acting under color of law.” This reading of the statute, however, is implausible. First, there is\n\nno affirmative evidence that Congress intended to draw such a distinction. Given the availability\n\nof qualified immunity, it would be anomalous if actual government officials were wholly\n\nimmune from personal liability for even clear RFRA violations while private citizens “acting\n\nunder color of law” were subject to suit—and it would certainly do nothing to further RFRA’s\n\npurpose of “provid[ing] a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially\n\nburdened by government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b).\n\n       Second, similar statutory language in at least one other context has been interpreted to\n\npermit individual-capacity claims against officials. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 permits suits against\n\n“[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage” of a\n\nState or territory deprives a person of constitutional rights, and is uniformly interpreted to permit\n\nindividual-capacity claims against government officials. See, e.g., Wesby v. District of\n\nColumbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (affirming judgment under § 1983 against police\n\nofficers “in their individual capacities”). Under Defendants’ interpretation of RFRA, Congress’s\n\nchoice explicitly to include “official[s]” among the persons and entities that may be sued under\n\nthe statute—a departure from the language of § 1983—would impose an additional limitation on\n\nplaintiffs’ ability to sue officials. This is backwards: by explicitly adding a term permitting suits\n\nagainst officials to language familiar from the § 1983 context, RFRA contemplates, if anything,\n\nthat such suits will be more available. In any event, it is safe to assume that Congress understood\n\nthat it acted against the backdrop of settled § 1983 precedent when it added the similar “under\n                                                  8\n\fcolor of law” language to RFRA.

In particular, because RLUIPA was\n\nenacted as an exercise of Congress’s spending power, interpreting that statute to allow damages\n\nactions against state officials in their individual capacities would “raise serious questions\n\nregarding whether Congress had exceeded its [constitutional] authority.” Nelson, 570 F.3d at\n\n889. Restrictions imposed on states pursuant to the Spending Clause are essentially contractual\n\nin nature—states agree to comply with certain conditions in exchange for federal funds. See id.\n\nat 887-88. Applying restrictions created pursuant to the Spending Clause to persons or entities\n\nother than the recipients of the federal funds at issue would have the effect of binding non-parties\n\nto the terms of the spending “contract.” Id. (citing Sossamon, 560 F.3d at 328-29; Smith v.

Courts have thus declined to allow individual-capacity\n\nsuits for damages against state officials under RLUIPA because doing so would subject those\n\nofficials to Spending Clause restrictions that are properly binding only on states that receive\n\nfederal funds. See, e.g., Nelson, 570 F.3d at 889; Smith, 502 F.3d at 1274-75. Other courts have\n\nreached the same conclusion for the related reason that RLUIPA does not “signal with sufficient\n                                                  10\n\fclarity an intent to subject” state officials to individual capacity suits, applying a “clear notice\n\nrequirement” that is specific to Spending Clause enactments.

RFRA’s application to\n\nfederal action is not based on the Spending Clause. Rather, Congress may “carve out a religious\n\nexemption from otherwise neutral, generally applicable laws based on its power to enact the\n\nunderlying statute in the first place.” Guam v.

There can be no question, moreover, that Congress possesses the power “to establish and\n\nmaintain an effective regime of criminal law enforcement,” including the power to control “the\n\noperation of federal correctional facilities.” Constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 1120, 24 Op.\n\nO.L.C. 156, 158, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">34475733</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).

And, as the Seventh Circuit recognized in\n\nNelson, the language of RLUIPA (which closely tracks the relevant language of RFRA) “appears\n\nto authorize suit against [a defendant official] in his individual capacity.” 570 F.3d at 886. In\n\nNelson, that apparent meaning was overcome only by the specific constitutional concerns raised\n\nby the Spending Clause. Construing RFRA, where those concerns do not apply, the Court\n\nconcludes that Congress intended to authorize both official and individual-capacity suits against\n\nfederal officials.\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f       It follows from this conclusion that Congress also intended to permit individual capacity\n\nsuits for damages. It is unlikely that an action for injunctive or declaratory relief under RFRA\n\nwould be treated as an individual-capacity suit. “Regardless of the manner by which a plaintiff\n\ndesignated the action, a suit should be regarded as an official-capacity suit when the judgment\n\nsought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public\n\nadministration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from acting,\n\nor compel it to act.” Hatfill v.

All or nearly all\n\nRFRA claims for injunctive or declaratory relief against federal officials would likely satisfy\n\nthose criteria. The only significant purpose for an individual-capacity claim, then, would be to\n\nseek damages—damages that are unavailable in RFRA actions against the sovereign. See\n\nWebman v.

Faced with “the question of what\n\nremedies are available under a statute that provides a private right of action,” courts “presume\n\nthe availability of all appropriate remedies”—including, at least at times, damages—“unless\n\nCongress has expressly indicated otherwise.” Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112696\"><a href=\"/opinion/112696/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n66, 76 (1992) (holding that “a damages remedy is available for an action brought to enforce Title\n\nIX” of the Civil Rights Act). RFRA expressly allows plaintiffs to “obtain appropriate relief\n\nagainst a government,” and contains no “express[ ] indicat[ion]” that damages are prohibited. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c); Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66. Thus, under the presumption articulated in\n\nFranklin, RFRA authorizes damages when that form of relief is “appropriate.” 1\n\n\n1\n   A thorough opinion from the District of New Jersey reached the same conclusion even though\nit concluded that the presumption in Franklin was inapplicable to RFRA. See Jama, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span>\n                                               <span class=\"page\">12</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f       The Court of Appeals’ conclusion in Webman that damages are unavailable in RFRA\n\nsuits against the government does not detract from this conclusion. That decision turned on the\n\nprinciple that “courts must ‘strictly construe’ any waiver of sovereign immunity,” allowing relief\n\nagainst the government only when its authorization is “‘unequivocal.’” Webman, 441 F.3d at\n\n1025-26 (alterations omitted) (quoting Lane v. Peña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118049\"><a href=\"/opinion/118049/lane-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192, 198 (1996)). But\n\nCongress need not waive sovereign immunity to permit an individual-capacity suit against a\n\nfederal official. See Larson v.

And a reading RFRA that allows damages claims against officials in their individual\n\ncapacities but not against the federal government itself is not at all self-contradictory. Because\n\nCongress did not expressly waive sovereign immunity from suits for damages, damages are not\n\nan “appropriate” remedy against the government itself. See Webman, 441 F.3d at 1028 (Tatel, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“RFRA nowhere makes clear that damages are ‘appropriate’ (at least against the\n\ngovernment[)]”) (emphasis added). But because it did not expressly prohibit suits for damages,\n\nthey may be an “appropriate” remedy against individual-capacity defendants.\n\n\n\n\nSupp. 2d at 375-76. There, the court reasoned that a damages remedy was available in\nindividual-capacity suits under RFRA because it is plausible that Congress intended that remedy\nto be available, prohibiting damages would conflict with the purpose of RFRA, and other courts\nhave assumed that damages are available under the statute. Id. at 374-75. The Court agrees with\nthis analysis, which further supports the conclusion that damages are available.\n\n        The Jama court also concluded, however, that because RFRA expressly authorizes\n“appropriate relief against a government,” the statute is not “silent” on the issue of remedies and\nthe presumption in Franklin is inapplicable. 343 F. Supp. 2d at 376. This reading of Franklin is\ntoo narrow. The presumption in that case obviously does apply where Congress is entirely silent\non the issue of remedies. But it is also clear that the mere mention of remedies does not rebut the\npresumption—instead, the presumption applies unless “Congress has expressly indicated” that a\nremedy is unavailable. Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66. RFRA provides only that a plaintiff may obtain\n“appropriate relief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c). This language does nothing more than authorize\nwhat courts applying Franklin presume, and it falls far short of an “express[ ] indicat[ion]” that\ndamages are prohibited.\n                                                  13\n\f       2. Defendant Lappin’s Personal Involvement\n\n       Defendants also contend that Harley Lappin—the former director of BOP—was not\n\npersonally involved in any of the deprivations of religious liberty that Plaintiff asserts, and that\n\nhe therefore cannot be liable under RFRA. The first step in their argument is the claim that\n\nindividual-capacity suits under RFRA are “in essence . . . Free Exercise Clause Bivens claim[s],\n\nwhich courts dismiss when based on respondeat superior liability.” Dkt. 98 at 8. If RFRA\n\nfollows Bivens in this respect, then Plaintiff would have to allege that Defendant Lappin was\n\ndirectly, rather than vicariously, liable for the RFRA violations Plaintiff asserts. According to\n\nDefendants, Plaintiff has failed to do so.\n\n       Plaintiff disagrees with both of these contentions. He argues that the relief available\n\nunder RFRA should be “broadly construed to incorporate well-settled theories of vicarious\n\nliability under the common law against which Congress legislated.” Dkt. 100 at 11. But even if\n\nthe limitations developed in Bivens actions apply to RFRA, Plaintiff argues that he has\n\nsufficiently alleged Defendant Lappin’s personal involvement in the asserted violations. In\n\nparticular, he points to the allegation in the Complaint that Defendant Lappin “refus[ed] to\n\nrequire private entities [that operated contract prisons] to follow BOP regulations” that protect\n\ninmates’ religious exercise. Dkt. 118 ¶ 131.\n\n       The parties have identified only minimal authority addressing the viability of vicarious\n\nliability theories under RFRA. Defendants point to two cases in which RFRA counts were\n\ndismissed for failure to allege personal involvement of the individual defendants. See Dkt. 98 at\n\n8-9 (citing Curry v.

In White, the court dismissed a RFRA\n\nclaim for failure to allege that the named defendant was personally involved in the alleged\n\ndeprivation of religious freedom at issue, but it seems not to have separately considered the\n\nquestion whether the plaintiff could rely on a vicarious liability theory. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">196332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n\nThus, neither of the cases cited by Defendants provides substantial guidance.\n\n       Plaintiff does only somewhat better. He relies on Pineda-Morales v. De Rosa, No. 03-\n\n4297, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1607276</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.N.J.

That conclusion\n\nis of little assistance here. He also cites Agarwal v. Briley, No. 02-6807, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1977581</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*14 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 25, 2015), in which a court declined to enter judgement for the defendant on\n\na vicarious liability claim under RLUIPA. The plaintiff in that case was an inmate who filed a\n\ngrievance requesting vegetarian meals, which he asserted were required by his Hindu faith. Id. at\n\n*10. A subordinate prison official to whom the warden had delegated responsibility for non-\n\nemergency inmate grievances denied the request. Id. Even though the warden himself had not\n\nbeen involved in the decision to deny the plaintiff vegetarian meals—indeed, the warden\n\nremained unaware of the request until the plaintiff filed suit, id.—the court concluded that he\n\ncould be held liable under RLUIPA. It reasoned that RLUIPA does not incorporate the strict rule\n\nagainst supervisory liability applied in § 1983 actions, noting that RLUIPA (like RFRA)\n\ncomprehends actions against governmental entities as well as persons. Id. at *14. The Agarwal\n\ncourt did not decide, however, whether pure vicarious liability is actionable under RLUIPA. It\n\nfound only that the warden had “deliberate[ly] avoid[ed] any involvement in review of Plaintiff’s\n\ngrievance,” and that this fact established “sufficient ‘fault,’ an adequate causal nexus to\n\nPlaintiff’s injury, to support a finding of liability.” Id. Agarwal thus, at most, stands for the\n                                                 15\n\fproposition that “negligent supervision” might be actionable under RLUIPA, not that a\n\nsupervisor may be held liable for the acts of his subordinates without any independent showing\n\nof fault.

Neither\n\nparty has directed the Court to any case expressly endorsing such a theory, and the Court has\n\nidentified none. Plaintiff’s arguments based on the structure and purpose of RFRA, particularly\n\nabsent any direct support in the case law, are not compelling. Plaintiff assumes that RFRA was\n\nenacted against a background of “traditional common-law principles” embodied in state tort law,\n\nDkt. 100 at 11-12, but cites no legislative history or other evidence suggesting this was so.\n\nInstead, it appears more likely that Congress legislated in relevant respects against the more\n\nrelevant background of constitutional litigation under Bivens and § 1983. Free exercise claims\n\nbefore RFRA would have been brought under these theories, not the common law, and there is\n\nno indication in the statute that Congress intended to adopt common-law theories of liability that\n\nhad previously been unavailable to plaintiffs. It is true that Congress expressly authorized suits\n\nagainst government “branch[es], department[s], [and] agenc[ies]”—entities that cannot act\n\npersonally in a manner that would subject them to liability under Bivens. 48 U.S.C. 2000bb-2(1).\n\nBut Congress did this expressly. RFRA does not by its terms authorize a further step away from\n\nthe background of § 1983 and Bivens precedents to impose vicarious liability, and nothing before\n\nthe Court on this motion suggests that it intended to do so implicitly.\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f       When RFRA was enacted in 1993, see Pub. L. 103-141 (1993), the leading Supreme\n\nCourt case addressing supervisory liability under § 1983 and Bivens was Rizzo v. Good, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109349\"><a href=\"/opinion/109349/rizzo-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). The Court in Rizzo vacated an injunction against municipal officers for failure to\n\nsupervise the activities of a local police force, requiring the plaintiff to prove an “affirmative link\n\nbetween the occurrence of the various incidents of police misconduct [at issue in the case] and\n\nthe adoption of any plan or policy by the petitioners . . . showing their authorization or approval\n\nof such misconduct.” Id. at 371. The Court of Appeals for this Circuit “join[ed] the majority of\n\ncourts” after Rizzo “calling for something more than mere negligence to forge the ‘affirmative\n\nlink’ between the constitutional infringement and the supervisor’s conduct.” Haynesworth v.\n\nMiller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489887\"><a href=\"/opinion/489887/josiah-haynesworth-and-fred-hancock-v-frank-p-miller-chief-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261 (D.C. Cir. 1987), abrogated in part on other grounds, Hartman v.\n\nMoore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145662\"><a href=\"/opinion/145662/hartman-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (2006) (holding that plaintiffs must present evidence of lack of\n\nprobable cause in retaliatory prosecution suits under § 1983 and Bivens). Under that standard, a\n\nplaintiff must show that “absent effective supervision, harm was not merely foreseeable, but was\n\nhighly likely, given the circumstances of the case”—so likely that “it can be said that the\n\nsupervisor acquiesced in the resulting constitutional violation.” Haynesworth, 820 F.2d at 1261.\n\nBecause this showing—or a similar one, see id. at 1261 n.126—was widely required in Bivens\n\nand § 1983 actions at the time RFRA was enacted, the Court concludes that it reflects the\n\nbackground state of the law against which Congress legislated. Thus, to assert a claim for\n\nsupervisory liability under RFRA, Plaintiff must allege that Defendant Lappin’s failure to\n\nsupervise his subordinates was “highly likely, given the circumstances of the case” to give rise to\n\na constitutional violation.\n\n       Plaintiff contends that his allegations satisfy this standard. His complaint alleges that\n\nDefendant Lappin, along with the John Doe defendants, “refus[ed] to require private entities\n\n[that operated private prisons] to follow BOP regulations” and therefore “set in motion the\n                                                  17\n\fconditions that led to the violation of Mr. Patel’s religious rights.” Dkt. 118 ¶ 131. In addition,\n\nPlaintiff directs the Court to two BOP policy statements (including one signed by Defendant\n\nLappin, see Dkt. 100-3 at 23) that include significant protections for inmates’ religious freedom.\n\nDkt. 100-2; Dkt. 100-3. These policies could suggest that Defendant Lappin was aware that\n\nBOP personnel required specific oversight and guidance if they were to avoid infringing on\n\ninmates’ religious liberty, and that it was thus “highly likely” that failure to provide similar\n\noversight and guidance to private prisons would cause RFRA violations like the ones Plaintiff\n\nalleges here.\n\n       Plaintiff’s argument fails to take into account, however, that BOP did maintain a policy\n\nrequiring private prisons to comply with RFRA. In their Statement of Undisputed Facts,\n\nDefendants asserted that “The BOP specifically requires private facilities to comply with\n\n[RFRA], and to ensure the religious services programs are consistent with this Act.” Dkt. 68-2 ¶\n\n25. Plaintiff admitted this fact, although he disputed “that BOP has ensured that Rivers comply\n\nwith RFRA.” Dkt. 72-1 at 7 (Defendant’s Statement of Genuine Issues). Here is the problem:\n\nthe only act that the Complaint alleges Defendant Lappin did that could potentially expose him\n\nto supervisory liability under Rizzo and Haynesworth is his promulgation of a policy requiring\n\nthat BOP facilities take steps to comply with RFRA. Had he done that while leaving private\n\nprisons free, as a matter of policy, to violate RFRA, his failure to provide a policy might suffice\n\nto link him to the harms Plaintiff alleges. But the undisputed evidence shows that BOP\n\n“specifically require[d]” compliance with RFRA in both agency-operated and private facilities.\n\nDkt. 68-2 ¶ 25. There is no showing that differences in policy caused Plaintiff’s harm. If, on the\n\nother hand, differences in enforcement were the cause of that harm, Plaintiff has not alleged that\n\nDefendant Lappin was personally involved in enforcement of BOP policies such as the ones at\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fissue, much less that it was “highly likely” that any deficiency in his personal oversight of policy\n\nenforcement would give rise to the harm he alleges.\n\n       Finding Defendant Lappin liable under these circumstances would appear to authorize\n\nindividual-capacity claims for damages against the BOP director for virtually any RFRA\n\nviolation—if a violation occurred and BOP policies require compliance with RFRA, the BOP\n\ndirector failed to ensure that the agency’s policies were enforced. But that line of reasoning,\n\nbased not on evidence of the defendant’s personal acts but instead on inferences about nothing\n\nmore than his position, see Dkt. 118 ¶ 132, would create precisely the sort of vicarious liability\n\nthat the Court has concluded RFRA does not provide. The evidence and the allegations in this\n\nmatter show that Defendant Lappin was personally responsible for (at most) BOP’s relevant\n\npolicies, and that BOP’s relevant policies prohibited RFRA violations in the prisons in which\n\nPlaintiff asserts they took place. Plaintiff has therefore failed to come forward with evidence of\n\nany personal involvement by Defendant Lappin in the RFRA violations he alleges, and\n\nDefendant Lappin is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. 2\n\n       3.   Sufficiency of Plaintiff’s Allegations under Twombly and Iqbal\n\n       Because Defendant Lappin is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s RFRA count,\n\nthe Court need not consider his argument that Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to state a\n\nclaim under RFRA. If and when Plaintiff serves the Doe defendants—who are not presently\n\nparticipating in this action—those defendants will be afforded an opportunity to request that the\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The Court concludes that it is appropriate to treat BOP’s motion as a motion for summary\njudgment with respect to this claim. Although Plaintiff, in his opposition to BOP’s motion,\nrequested an opportunity for discovery in the event the Court treats the motion as one for\nsummary judgment, that request sought information to “test the accuracy of Defendants’\ntestimony about the purported rational basis for their . . . policies” and did not concern Plaintiff’s\nRFRA claim. Dkt. 72 at 44.\n                                                 19\n\fCourt reconsider Chief Judge Roberts’s conclusion that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded\n\nsubstantive RFRA violations. See Dkt. 90 at 4-7.\n\nC. The Privacy Act\n\n        Plaintiff also alleges that the Bureau of Prisons has violated his rights under the Privacy\n\nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Plaintiff asserts that while he was incarcerated at FCI Big Spring in 2004,\n\nhe wrote a letter to the Dallas Morning News in which he claimed that a fellow inmate, David\n\nDuke, was receiving preferential treatment from BOP staff as a result of his “notoriety.” Dkt.\n\n118 ¶¶ 82, 140. According to Plaintiff, prison officials improperly opened and read Plaintiff’s\n\nletter; they then wrote a memorandum that documented the event and recommended that Plaintiff\n\nbe transferred to a different facility. Id. ¶ 144. Plaintiff contends that BOP retains this\n\nmemorandum in its files, and that doing so violates the Privacy Act’s prohibition against\n\nmaintaining records “‘describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First\n\nAmendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is\n\nmaintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of authorized law enforcement activity.’”\n\nId. ¶ 146 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 522a(e)(7)).\n\n        BOP moves to dismiss this count on three grounds. First, it argues that the memorandum\n\nat issue falls under the “authorized law enforcement activity” exception to the Privacy Act. Dkt.\n\n68-1 at 28-29. Next, it contends that Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim is barred by the doctrine of res\n\njudicata, based on Plaintiff’s effort to litigate the issue in a prior action. Id. at 29-30. Finally, it\n\nargues that the Privacy Act claim is barred by the Act’s two-year statute of limitations because\n\nPlaintiff has known of the existence of the memorandum at issue since at least 2006. Id. at 30-\n\n31. None of these arguments is persuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\f          1. The Law Enforcement Activity Exception\n\n          As the Court of Appeals has noted, although the phrase “law enforcement activity” may\n\n“summon[ ] up images of criminal law, the legislative history of the provision makes it clear that\n\nit does not have that meaning here.” Nagel v. Dep’t of Health, Educ. & Welfare, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430598\"><a href=\"/opinion/430598/james-b-nagel-v-us-department-of-health-education-and-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1441 n.3 (D.C.

Cir. 2004), to include “an authorized criminal investigation or . . . and\n\nauthorized intelligence or administrative one,” Nagel, 725 F.2d at 1441 n.3 (quotation marks\n\nomitted). In addition, it applies to “[a]n employer’s determination whether an employee is\n\nperforming his job adequately,” id. at 1441, to an employer’s evaluating or disciplining an\n\nemployee, id., and to BOP activity directed at maintaining “prison security,” Maydak, 363 F.3d\n\nat 517.\n\n          In Maydak, the Court of Appeals concluded that declarations submitted by prison\n\nofficials were sufficient to demonstrate that “examining photographs [of inmates arguably\n\nexercising First Amendment rights] for conduct that may threaten [prison] security is pertinent to\n\nand within the scope of the authorized law enforcement activity.” Id. The Court also noted,\n\nhowever, that certain of the declarations in that case raised questions about other uses of the\n\nphotographs, including what the declarants meant by terms such as “investigative or informative\n\nvalue.” Id. As a result, the Court remanded the case to the district court to determine the nature\n\nof the use of the photographs on a more complete record.\n\n          Maydak is dispositive of BOP’s argument at this stage of the litigation. BOP notes, for\n\nexample, that a memorandum “pertaining [to] the prison staff’s treatment of inmates would fall\n\nunder this exception.” Dkt. 68-1 at 28-29 (emphasis added). But BOP has not submitted any\n\nevidence regarding how the alleged memorandum was actually prepared, maintained, or used.\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fUnder these circumstances, the Court concludes that Defendants cannot, on the present record,\n\nrely upon the law enforcement exception to avoid Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim.\n\n       2. Res Judicata\n\n       BOP next argues that Plaintiff’s claim under the Privacy Act is res judicata. To establish\n\nthat his claim is precluded under this doctrine, BOP must show that Plaintiff previously brought\n\nsuit against the same defendant based on the same cause of action, and that that suit resulted in a\n\nfinal judgment on the merits of the claim he raises here. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109964\"><a href=\"/opinion/109964/parklane-hosiery-co-v-shore/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326 n.5 (1979) (“Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior\n\nsuit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of\n\naction.”); Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186337\"><a href=\"/opinion/186337/apotex-inc-v-fda/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n       The factual basis for this contention is a matter of public record. In 2004, Plaintiff\n\nbrought a lawsuit in this Court that included a Privacy Act claim relating to the memorandum at\n\nissue here. Patel v. United States, No. 08-1168-D, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1377530</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (W.D. Okla. May\n\n14, 2009). The action was promptly transferred to the Eastern District of Arkansas, where the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim without prejudice for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies. Id. at *4-5. The action was subsequently transferred to the Eastern\n\nDistrict of North Carolina and then to the Western District of Oklahoma, where Plaintiff moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the Eastern District of Arkansas’s dismissal of his Privacy Act claim. Id.\n\nat *1. The court rejected that motion, holding that Plaintiff had not shown clear error or any\n\nchange in legal or factual circumstances that would justify reconsideration of the prior dismissal.\n\nThe court also noted that it was “particularly reluctant to reinstate a Privacy Act claim that was\n\ndismissed without prejudice” because Plaintiff had several years in which he “could have\n\nbrought a separate action and presented his additional proof of exhaustion.” Id. at 5. In the\n\ncourt’s view, it was “inconsistent with Congress’[s] purpose in providing civil remedies under\n                                                 22\n\fthe Privacy Act to permit an individual to bring a private action years later under these\n\ncircumstances.” Id. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the “dismissal without prejudice.” Patel v.\n\nUnited States, 399 Fed. App’x 355, 361 (10th Cir. 2010).\n\n       There was no “judgment on the merits” of Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim in the prior\n\nlitigation. As the district court in Oklahoma observed, and the Tenth Circuit explicitly affirmed,\n\nPlaintiff’s claim was dismissed “without prejudice” because he had not exhausted administrative\n\nremedies by petitioning BOP to remove the memorandum at issue from its files. Id.; Patel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1377530</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. The Western District of Oklahoma’s refusal to reconsider that decision did\n\nnothing to change the decision of the transferor court—indeed, the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nrecognized that, because the earlier dismissal had been without prejudice, Plaintiff could have\n\nsimply exhausted his administrative remedies and brought a new action. BOP relies on the\n\nlanguage in that court’s decision suggesting that the court believed Plaintiff had been dilatory in\n\npursuing his claim, but fails to explain how that statement could have transformed the Western\n\nDistrict of Oklahoma’s decision declining to reconsider the decision of the transferor court into a\n\ndecision that actually changed the earlier dismissal “without prejudice” into a disposition on the\n\nmerits. Because Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim has never been adjudicated on the merits, the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata does not bar him from asserting it in this action.\n\n       3. The Statute of Limitations\n\n       BOP’s final argument is that Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claim is barred by the applicable\n\nstatute of limitations. Absent material and willful misrepresentation on the part of an agency,\n\nany “action to enforce any liability created under” the Privacy Act must be brought “within two\n\nyears from the date on which the cause of action arises.” 5 U.S.C. § 522a(g)(5). BOP argues\n\nthat because Plaintiff “knew of the existence of the memorandum” at issue by February 9, 2006\n\nat the latest, the statute of limitations began running on that date and expired on February 9,\n                                                 23\n\f2008—more than one year before he first alleged his Privacy Act claim in this action. Dkt. 68-1\n\nat 31.\n\n          BOP misreads the statute. The Privacy Act allows a suit to be brought “[w]henever any\n\nagency makes a determination . . . not to amend an individual’s record in accordance with his\n\nrequest.” 5 U.S.C. § 522a(g)(1)(A). Plaintiff alleges that he petitioned BOP to amend his record\n\non February 20, 2009 and that his request was denied on April 30, 2009—this denial triggered\n\nhis right to bring suit. BOP has identified no case law or other authority for the counterintuitive\n\nproposition that a Privacy Act plaintiff’s “cause of action arises” before the plaintiff can bring a\n\nsuit. Indeed, BOP itself notes that “[t]he statute of limitations [under the Privacy Act]\n\n‘commences at the time that a person knows or has reason to know that his request had been\n\ndenied.’” Dkt. 76 at 13 (quoting Englerius v. Veterans Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500407\"><a href=\"/opinion/500407/maximus-t-englerius-and-the-fraternal-order-of-the-deer-inc-plaintiffs/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897 (9th Cir.\n\n1988)).\n\n          In its reply, BOP asserts for the first time that Plaintiff in fact “was . . . aware that his\n\nrequest for an amendment had been denied” in 2006. Dkt. 76 at 14. Although BOP does not\n\nexplain this assertion or cite to the record, it appears that the agency is referring to the fact that\n\nPlaintiff submitted documents to the Arkansas and Oklahoma district courts that, in Plaintiff’s\n\nview at the time, established that in 2004 he had requested relief from BOP under the Privacy\n\nAct and that his request had been denied. These documents formed the basis for Plaintiff’s\n\nrequests for reconsideration of the order dismissing his Privacy Act claim. See Patel v. United\n\nStates, No. 08-cv-1168 (W.D. Okla. 2009), Dkt. 269; Patel v. United States, No. 04-cv-00771\n\n(E.D. Ark. 2006) Dkt. 77.\n\n          The Court need not independently determine whether these documents in fact show that\n\nPlaintiff adequately requested and was denied the relief he seeks here, however, because the\n\nUnited States has previously taken the position that they do not. See Response to Plaintiff’s\n                                                     24\n\fMotion to Reconsider, Patel v. United States, No. 04-cv-00771 (E.D. Ark. 2006) Dkt. 78 (“It is\n\nclear that the remedy [request] submitted by the Plaintiff in support of his Motion to Reconsider\n\naddresses not the maintaining of a memo, but rather the opening of special mail and reading\n\nsame outside of Plaintiff’s presence.”). The district court denied Plaintiff’s motion. Having\n\nargued successfully to another district court that Plaintiff’s 2004 request was insufficient to give\n\nrise to a right to sue, BOP cannot now assert the opposite position in order to defeat Plaintiff’s\n\nclaim on timeliness grounds. See, e.g., Comcast Corp. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1325\"><a href=\"/opinion/1325/comcast-corp-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010) (“Courts may invoke judicial estoppel where a party assumes a certain position in a legal\n\nproceeding, succeeds in maintaining that position, and then, simply because his interests have\n\nchanged, assumes a contrary position.”) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). And even if\n\nBOP were not estopped from arguing that a claim had accrued based on Patel’s 2004 request and\n\nthe Court concluded that one had, it is not clear that that fact would bar the subsequent accrual of\n\na new claim based on BOP’s denial of the 2009 request. The Privacy Act states that an\n\n“individual may bring a civil action” “whenever any agency . . . makes a determination . . . not\n\nto amend [the] individual’s record in accordance with his request.” 5 U.S.C. § 522a(g)(1).\n\nThere is thus no explicit statutory bar to a Privacy Act claim predicated on a duplicative request\n\nto amend records, and BOP has not identified case law inferring that such a bar exists.\n\n       BOP argues that allowing suits, like this one, triggered by the denial of Privacy Act\n\nrequests that had previously been submitted would allow “an individual . . . to maintain a Privacy\n\nAct amendment claim in perpetuity as long as he continued to submit requests for amendment\n\nand to receive adverse agency determinations.” Dkt. 76 at 14. This argument is not persuasive.\n\nRes judicata and collateral estoppel prevent a plaintiff from pursuing successive lawsuits based\n\non identical Privacy Act requests after an adverse judgment on the merits—there is no specter of\n\nnever ending litigation. BOP’s real objection is to the fact that a plaintiff who knows of the\n                                                 25\n\fexistence of a record that allegedly violates the Privacy Act may wait as long as he pleases\n\nbefore requesting that the agency amend the record—or make repeated requests to the agency—\n\nwithout jeopardizing his right to judicial review. But there is nothing absurd about this result,\n\nwhich, in any event, follows directly from the statutory language. A request for amendment\n\nunder the Privacy Act seeks prospective relief to remedy the government’s ongoing maintenance\n\nof an improper or incorrect record. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2)(B); 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(2)(A) (in\n\nsuit seeking review of denial of amendment, “the court may order the agency to amend the\n\nindividual’s record in accordance with his request or in any such other way as the court may\n\ndirect”). As long as such an injury is ongoing, there is no reason that a plaintiff seeking relief\n\nfrom it should be categorically barred from doing so simply because he could have sought relief\n\nearlier. 3\n\n         Because BOP’s denial of Plaintiff’s 2009 request to amend gave rise to a claim under the\n\nPrivacy Act, Plaintiff’s claim is timely.\n\nD. FOIA Claims\n\n         BOP also moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s FOIA claims. When a plaintiff\n\nalleges that an agency has improperly withheld records, the reviewing court must “determine the\n\nmatter de novo.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). FOIA cases are typically resolved on motions for\n\nsummary judgment, which require that the moving party demonstrate that there are no genuine\n\nissues of material fact and he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477\n\n\n\n3\n  It is possible that laches might apply to bar suits where, for example, a Privacy Act plaintiff’s\ndelay in requesting amendment has allowed the loss of evidence necessary to establish an\nexemption.

Documents Related to Office of Inspector General Report\n\n       Plaintiff’s first FOIA claim arises from a 2004 request that he characterizes as seeking\n\n“documents related to a [Justice Department Office of the Inspector General (‘OIG’)] report.”\n\nDkt. 118 ¶ 152. Plaintiff actually filed this request with the OIG; when OIG determined that 21\n\npages of the records it identified as responsive “originated with” BOP, it referred those\n\ndocuments to BOP to be reviewed and, if appropriate, released. Dkt. 68-6 ¶ 4 & Exh. A.\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that he received all 21 pages of the materials, although six pages\n\ncontained redactions. Dkt. 118 ¶ 153. He objects, however, that “[n]one of the exhibits or\n\nwitness interviews associated with the OIG report . . . were provided, nor was any reason\n\nprovided for their withholding.” Id. BOP’s response is simple and compelling: the agency’s\n\nresponsibility was limited to reviewing and releasing the documents that were referred to it. Dkt.\n\n68-1 at 32. BOP had no obligation to search for or to provide additional information in response\n\nto Plaintiff’s 2004 FOIA request to OIG.\n                                                27\n\f       If the 2004 request to OIG were the only one at issue in this count, BOP would be\n\nentitled to summary judgment. Plaintiff also alleges, however, that he filed three “similar\n\nrequests with the BOP” in 2005. These requests are not clearly identified in the Complaint, but\n\nin his opposition to Defendants’ motion (Dkt. 72 at 36-37), Plaintiff focuses on a March 24,\n\n2005, letter to Plaintiff quoting the contents of his requests (Dkt. 68-6, Exh. G). Among other\n\nthings, Plaintiff sought “[a]ll notes, memoranda, investigative documents, etc. created since\n\nSeptember 1, 2003 and ending on February 1, 2004 pertaining to an investigation conducted into\n\n[Plaintiff’s] alleged misconduct and placement in the SHU at FCI Big Spring, Texas.” Id.\n\nBOP’s declaration states that in responding to these requests the agency produced seven\n\ncomplete pages and three redacted pages to Plaintiff. Dkt. 68-6 ¶ 13.\n\n       Plaintiff contends, however, that BOP’s search must have been inadequate because the\n\nagency did not provide any of the exhibits to the OIG report—exhibits that, in Plaintiff’s view,\n\nwould have been responsive to his request. Dkt. 72 at 37. For example, Plaintiff contends that\n\n“the OIG reviewed photographs, a medical assessment, memoranda, reports, and other\n\ndocuments regarding Mr. Patel’s injuries . . . sustained in an assault at FCI Big Spring,” and he\n\ncites particular exhibits to the OIG report that he believes were likely responsive to his 2005\n\nFOIA requests. Id. at 37-38. It is not clear whether the exhibits Plaintiff identifies are indeed\n\nresponsive. He refers to a document titled “Inmate Injury Assessment and Follow-Up for Kamal\n\nPatel,” for example, and to a “SENTRY printout regarding Inmate Profile and\n\nSecurity/Designation for inmate Patel.” Id. Either of those documents might be “notes,\n\nmemoranda, investigative documents, etc. . . . pertaining to an investigation conducted into\n\n[Plaintiff’s] alleged misconduct and placement in the SHU at FCI Big Spring,” but Plaintiff has\n\npresented no further evidence demonstrating that they actually are. The other document he refers\n\nto that “pertain[s] directly to Mr. Patel”—a “Letter Dated November 15, 2005, from Assistant\n                                                 28\n\fUnited States Attorney Robert McRoberts to Inmate Patel”—post-dates BOP’s response to his\n\n2005 FOIA requests. Dkt. 72 at 38; see Dkt. 68-6 Exh. G. Plaintiff cites other exhibits to the\n\nOIG report that “appear to be responsive as well,” including three affidavits, with the affiants’\n\nnames redacted (dated January 15, 2004), “Photographs documenting inmate Kamal Patel’s\n\ninjuries,” additional “SENTRY printout[s],” a memo “regarding BOP OIA interview” of a\n\nperson, and an incident report regarding an assault on Plaintiff. Dkt. 72 at 38 n.20; see Dkt. 72-7\n\nat 17-19. Once again, some of these documents might be responsive to Plaintiff’s request to\n\nBOP—but his request to BOP was narrower than his request to OIG, and there is no basis in the\n\nrecord to conclude that all of the OIG documents relate to Plaintiff’s “alleged misconduct and\n\nplacement in the SHU” or the other particular topics he identified in requests to BOP.\n\n       For present purposes the critical question for the Court is whether BOP’s declaration\n\nshows that the agency conducted an adequate search for the records Plaintiff requested in 2005.\n\nThe Court concludes that it does not. To prevail on a motion for summary judgment where the\n\nadequacy of its search for records is challenged, BOP must provide a “reasonably detailed\n\naffidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all\n\nfiles likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) were searched.” Oglesby v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Army, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552329\"><a href=\"/opinion/552329/carl-oglesby-v-the-united-states-department-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Although BOP’s declaration states that\n\nPlaintiff received documents in response to Plaintiff’s 2005 requests, it contains no information\n\nwhatsoever about what record systems the agency searched, what search criteria it used, or\n\nwhether the agency reviewed the potentially responsive documents Plaintiff cites. See Dkt. 68-6\n\n¶ 13. Although it may be the case that BOP has, in fact, produced all documents in its\n\npossession that are responsive to Plaintiff’s 2005 requests, BOP has not carried its burden on\n\nsummary judgment to prove that it has done so. Therefore, in this respect, BOP’s motion must\n\nbe denied.\n                                                 29\n\f       Plaintiff also argues that BOP failed to provide a Vaughn index cataloguing and\n\njustifying its redactions to the three pages he has received in response to his 2005 requests. Dkt.\n\n72 at 38. BOP responds, in a footnote in its reply, that it “does not believe that Patel’s March 24,\n\n2005 FOIA request . . . is at issue in this litigation and [BOP] therefore has not provided a\n\nVaughn index” for the pages disclosed pursuant to that request. Dkt. 76 at 18 n.8. It does appear\n\nfrom the parties’ briefing that there has been uncertainty regarding which of Plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequests are indeed at issue. Some of this uncertainty is attributable to a lack of specificity in\n\nPlaintiff’s Complaint. See Dkt. 118 ¶ 155 (describing 2005 requests as “similar to” 2004 request\n\nto OIG, even though they appear to have sought substantially different—but potentially\n\noverlapping—sets of documents). The Court concludes, however, that, reasonably construed, the\n\nComplaint does place the February 15, 2005 FOIA request at issue in this litigation.\n\nAccordingly, BOP must provide Plaintiff a Vaughn index as to those three pages before it can\n\nobtain summary judgment in its favor.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff contests redactions to the documents referred to BOP by OIG (pursuant\n\nto Plaintiff’s separate OIG request) that were “‘applied to protect the statements of inmates and\n\nstaff who provided information for a BOP investigation.’” Dkt. 72 at 38 (quoting Dkt. 68-6,\n\nExh. C). BOP argues that the statements at issue satisfy the criteria for FOIA exemptions 6 and\n\n7(C). Exemption 6 permits agencies to withhold “personnel and medical files and similar files\n\nthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) covers “records or information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or\n\ninformation . . . could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.”\n\nId. § 552(b)(7)(C). To rely on these exceptions, BOP must do more than merely recite that\n\nstatements were withheld to protect individuals’ privacy. Instead, it must show that the “privacy\n                                                 30\n\finterests that would be compromised by disclosure” outweigh “the public interest in release of\n\nthe requested information.” Davis v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586798\"><a href=\"/opinion/586798/john-davis-v-united-states-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1281 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n       Here, BOP has not provided a sufficiently detailed explanation of the privacy interests\n\nthat it contends would be compromised by disclosure of the witness statements. It may be that\n\nthe redaction of the names of witnesses and other persons mentioned in the statements is\n\nsufficient to guarantee the anonymity of these individuals—if so, then there is no apparent\n\nprivacy interest protected by withholding the substance of the statements. If, on the other hand,\n\nthe subject matter of the statements is such that its disclosure would facilitate the identification\n\nof witnesses or others even if their names were redacted, it is more likely that BOP will be\n\nentitled to a finding that exemptions 6 and 7(C) apply. To prevail on summary judgment,\n\ntherefore, BOP needs to provide some evidence that the subject matter of the redacted statements\n\nitself is sufficient to identify particular individuals who have a privacy interest in remaining\n\nanonymous. BOP has not met that burden at this juncture.\n\n       Because BOP has not demonstrated that it conducted an adequate search for documents\n\nresponsive to Plaintiff’s 2005 FOIA requests, has not provided a Vaughn index cataloguing its\n\nredactions to the documents produced in response to those requests, and has not shown that\n\nFOIA exemptions 6 and 7(C) cover the content of the relevant statements even though the\n\nspeakers remain anonymous, BOP’s motion for summary judgment on Count IV of the\n\nComplaint is denied.\n\n       2. Documents Related to Plaintiff’s Protective Hearing\n\n       Plaintiff also seeks to compel production of documents related to a protection hearing\n\nthat took place while he was incarcerated at Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. Dkt. 118 ¶\n\n159. Plaintiff alleges that he received 247 pages in their entirety in response to this request, as\n\nwell as 128 pages with redactions. Id. ¶ 160. He also asserts that several documents were\n                                                  31\n\fwithheld in their entirety and that the BOP did not provide a Vaughn index cataloguing its\n\nassertions of FOIA exemptions. 4 Id. When BOP moved for summary judgment, it provided a\n\nVaughn index identifying the sixteen documents withheld in their entirety and the basis for\n\nwithholding each document. Dkt. 68-5, Exh. 5. It also described, in general terms, the bases for\n\nthe redactions made to those documents produced in part, Dkt. 68-5 ¶¶ 10-15, and provided\n\ncopies of the redacted documents with exemption designations indicated for each redaction, Dkt.\n\n76-2 ¶ 5. In his briefing, Plaintiff argues that BOP failed to demonstrate that there was no\n\nreasonably segregable non-exempt information in five of the documents that were withheld in\n\ntheir entirety, and that BOP erroneously asserted the deliberative process privilege to withhold a\n\nmemorandum relating to Plaintiff’s protective custody hearing. Dkt. 72 at 41-43.\n\n       As an initial matter, the Court concludes that BOP’s Vaughn index was adequate for\n\npresent purposes. Taken together, the measures described above allow the Court to “conduct a\n\nmeaningful de novo review of [BOP’s] claim of an exemption.” Brown v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1638133\"><a href=\"/opinion/1638133/brown-v-fbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Cir. 1994) (“the materials\n\nprovided by the agency may take any form so long as they give the reviewing court a reasonable\n\nbasis to evaluate the claim of privilege”) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Although\n\ncompiling a traditional Vaughn index would perhaps have allowed less cumbersome review of\n\nthe redactions, the system employed by BOP in this case satisfied the functional requirements of\n\nVaughn and its progeny.\n\n       Plaintiff’s contention that BOP has failed to demonstrate that certain documents withheld\n\nin their entirety do not contain reasonably segregable non-exempt information has more merit.\n\n\n\n4\n  BOP subsequently produced four previously pages with redactions and determined that six of\nthem were non-responsive. Dkt. 68-5 ¶ 3. Thus, to date, 16 pages have been withheld in their\nentirety and 132 pages have been produced with redactions. Id.\n                                             32\n\f“[S]imply . . . showing that [a document] contains some exempt material” is not enough to\n\n“justify withholding [the] entire document.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.

The\n\nrequirement in Mead Data that “an agency should . . . describe what proportion of the\n\ninformation in a document is non-exempt and how that material is dispersed throughout the\n\ndocument,” id. at 261, may have been “relaxed” by “more recent decisions,” Muttit v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (D.D.C. 2013). But it remains the case that the government must\n\ncarry its “burden of demonstrating that no reasonably segregable information exists” within\n\nwithheld documents and that the Court must evaluate the agency’s Vaughn index and\n\ndeclarations to determine whether the requisite showing has been made. Loving v.

Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Here, BOP’s declaration states that “[e]very effort has been made to provide plaintiff\n\nwith all reasonably segregable portions of the records requested;” that “[n]o reasonably\n\nsegregable non-exempt portions of these records have been withheld from Plaintiff;” and that\n\n“no further information can be segregated without releasing information properly withheld”\n\nunder various exemptions. Dkt. 68-5 ¶ 16. BOP does not explain, however, why any of the\n\nwithheld documents whose segregability Plaintiff contests cannot be further segregated. This\n\nfact distinguishes this case from Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727298\"><a href=\"/opinion/727298/scott-armstrong-v-executive-office-of-the-president/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996), where the government justified its entire withholding of particular pages with\n\nnon-conclusory, document-by-document explanations. See, e.g., 97 F.3d at 579 (quoting\n\ngovernment’s assertion that note “‘consists of an extensive review of numerous intelligence\n\ncables, revealing one piece of specific intelligence after another’”); id. at 580 (declaration\n\nasserted that specific “sensitive topics ‘are discussed throughout the redacted segment and there\n                                                 33\n\fare no further intelligible segments which can be segregated’”). Likewise, the agency in Soto v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of State, ___ F.

Aug. 6, 2015),\n\nsubmitted an affidavit explaining that “the information in each responsive document [in that\n\ncase] ‘pertain[ed] exclusively to the issuance or refusal of a visa to enter the United States’” and\n\nwas thus entirely exempt from disclosure under FOIA. BOP has not made a similar showing that\n\nthe documents at issue contain exclusively exempt information here.\n\n       The nature of the exemptions asserted to withhold the relevant documents here also cuts\n\nagainst a finding that BOP has met its burden. For documents 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 on its Vaughn\n\nindex, BOP relies either largely or exclusively on the personal privacy exemptions (b)(6) and\n\n(b)(7)(C)—exemptions that under some circumstances might require only that identified\n\nindividuals’ names or other identifying information be redacted. See, e.g., Paxson v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57-58 (D.D.C. 2014) (exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) invoked to\n\nredact “names and other identifying information, like telephone numbers, of FBI Special Agents\n\nand support personnel”). This circumstance makes it particularly important, in this case, for\n\nBOP to provide some level of specific explanation why further segregation is not possible.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff argues that BOP erroneously invoked exemption (b)(5), which protects\n\nmemoranda and letters over which an agency could assert a privilege in litigation (see Coastal\n\nStates Gas Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375896\"><a href=\"/opinion/375896/coastal-states-gas-corporation-v-department-of-energy/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (D.C. Cir. 1980)), to withhold page 7 of\n\n“Document 1” in its Vaughn index. BOP describes Document 1 as a “[m]emorandum” that was\n\n“created as a result of a hearing conducted for protective custody status.” Dkt. 68-5, Exh. 5. In\n\nPlaintiff’s view, BOP has “failed to establish that this document contains non-segregable pre-\n\ndecisional information,” which is subject to exemption (b)(5), rather than information “reporting\n\na final decision and the reasoning of the decision maker, neither of which are exempt.” Dkt. 72\n\nat 51 (citing Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866). BOP responds that it invoked exemption (b)(5)\n                                                 34\n\fbecause page 7 of Document 1 “reveal[s] pre-decisional information involved in the decision-\n\nmaking process that pertain[s] to protective custody of other inmates and the security of the\n\ninstitution.” Dkt. 76-2 ¶ 6.\n\n       BOP’s current showing is insufficient to establish that the document in question is\n\nprivileged. When asserting the privilege to justify application of FOIA exemption (b)(5), “the\n\nagency has the burden of establishing what deliberative process is involved, and the role played\n\nby the documents in issue in the course of that process.” Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 868. In a\n\nprison, there are presumably many different “decision-making process[es] that pertain to\n\nprotective custody of other inmates” or “the security of the institution,” and each of these\n\nprocesses presumably involves the creation of investigative or decisional memoranda. BOP has\n\nprovided no information regarding the “role played by the” redacted discussions in the process of\n\ndetermining whether to hold inmates in protective custody—or, indeed, any information relating\n\nto the nature of the “deliberation” at issue. Without further detail, the Court is not in a position\n\nto determine whether exemption (b)(5) is applicable.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for\n\nsummary judgment, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the RFRA claim against Defendant Lappin is GRANTED.
