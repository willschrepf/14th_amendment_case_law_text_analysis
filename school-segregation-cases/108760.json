Bennett appeals from a judgment entry and decree of\n\f                                                                                               2\n\ndivorce of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, which\n\nawarded custody of the Bennett children to Jill Bennett, determined that there was no\n\nseparate property traceable to personal injury settlements several years earlier, and divided\n\nthe parties’ assets equally, with the exception of a son’s medical bill, which Mrs. Bennett\n\nwas ordered to pay. Mrs. Bennett cross-appeals.\n\n       {¶ 2}     On appeal, Mr. Bennett challenges the trial court’s decision to reject his\n\nshared parenting plans in favor of awarding custody to Mrs. Bennett. He also objects to the\n\ntrial court’s decision to equally divide funds in a particular account, some of which he claims\n\noriginated from a personal injury claim, rather than treating those funds as his separate\n\nproperty. Mrs. Bennett claims that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that a\n\nmedical debt related to their son’s treatment for a dog bite was “non-marital” and in ordering\n\nher to pay the debt in its entirety. For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the trial court\n\nwill be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n                                                I\n\n       {¶ 3}     The Bennetts were married in 1999 and filed for divorce in 2011. Two\n\nchildren were born of the marriage, who were ages 10 and 8 at the time of the divorce. In\n\n2003, Mr. Bennett was injured in a car accident during the course of his employment with\n\nthe Clark County Sheriff’s Department. As a result of the accident, he sustained back\n\ninjuries and a brain aneurism. The parties received payments from several sources in\n\nconnection with Mr. Bennett’s injuries. While the parties were separated, one of their sons\n\nwas bitten by Mrs. Bennett’s dog, requiring surgery and incurring medical bills.\n\n       {¶ 4}     After the parties filed for divorce, the disputed matters were heard by a\n\f                                                                                              3\n\nmagistrate.    The magistrate issued a 51-page decision, which recounted the evidence\n\npresented and provided detailed explanations for most of the magistrate’s findings and legal\n\nconclusions. Both parties filed objections to the magistrate’s decision. The trial court\n\noverruled all of the objections and adopted the magistrate’s order. Because the trial court\n\nadopted the magistrate’s conclusions with a less detailed discussion of the evidence than that\n\ncontained in the magistrate’s decision, we will refer to and rely on many of the magistrate’s\n\nfindings – which the trial court approved – in reviewing the trial court’s judgment.\n\n       {¶ 5}     Mr. Bennett appeals, raising two assignments of error, and Mrs. Bennett\n\nraises one assignment of error on cross-appeal.\n\n                                               II\n\n       {¶ 6}     In his first assignment of error, Mr. Bennett contends that the trial court’s\n\ndecision to designate Mrs. Bennett as the residential parent for the parties’ two minor\n\nchildren, rather than to adopt one of the shared parenting plans he proposed, was against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence and was not in the best interest of the children.\n\n       {¶ 7}     Pursuant to R.C. 3109.04, the factors that a court is to consider in allocating\n\nparental rights and responsibilities include: (a) the wishes of the parents; (b) if interviewed,\n\nthe child’s wishes and concerns; (c) the child’s interaction and interrelationship with parents,\n\nsiblings, and other significant people; (d) the child’s adjustment to home, school, and\n\ncommunity; (e) the mental and physical health of all persons involved; (f) which parent is\n\nmore likely to abide by court orders regarding parenting time rights; and (g) whether under a\n\nshared-parenting plan one parent has interfered with the other’s parenting rights.\n\n       {¶ 8}      A reviewing court may not reverse a custody determination unless the trial\n\f                                                                                           4\n\ncourt has abused its discretion. Pater v. Pater, 63 Ohio St.3d 393, 588 N.E.2d 794 (1992).\n\nThe approval or rejection of a shared parenting plan lies within the court’s discretion. R.C.\n\n3109.04(D)(1)(b). An abuse of discretion implies an attitude of the trial court that is\n\nunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217,\n\n218, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\n       {¶ 9}     We defer to the trial court on findings of fact because “[t]he knowledge a\n\ntrial court gains through observing the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding\n\ncannot be conveyed to a reviewing court by a printed record.” Beismann v. Beismann, 2d\n\nDist. Montgomery No. 22323, 2008-Ohio-984, ¶ 20, citing Miller v. Miller, 37 Ohio St.3d\n\n71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846 (1988).\n\n       {¶ 10}    At the hearing, it was undisputed that there were hard feelings between the\n\nparties because Mr. Bennett had an affair, which, at least in part, eventually led to the end\n\nof their marriage. It was also undisputed that Mrs. Bennett had been the primary caregiver\n\nand that Mr. Bennett was a good father to the children. However, Mrs. Bennett described\n\nher relationship with Mr. Bennett during the separation as “a roller coaster,” stating that\n\nsometimes Mr. Bennett was nice and sometimes he was manipulative. She testified that\n\ntheir communication was not good and that they had difficulty reaching agreement on issues\n\nrelated to the boys.\n\n       {¶ 11}    Mrs. Bennett also described incidents where Mr. Bennett intentionally\n\nmade physical contact with her, threw her phone against a wall and broke it, and hid her car\n\nkeys. She recounted instances in which he had locked himself in a room with the children\n\nat their home to “hav[e] his time” with them and had not allowed her to have contact with\n\f                                                                                              5\n\nthe boys while they were with him for a visit. She stated that there was no trust between\n\nthem because of his affair and other lies she had discovered after the affair. She also\n\ntestified that, as a teacher, she had seen kids from shared parenting homes who were “a royal\n\nmess,” forgetting clothes and homework, etc., as they went back and forth from house to\n\nhouse.     Because of her communication problems with Mr. Bennett and her other\n\nexperiences with shared parenting, she did not think such an arrangement was in the boys’\n\nbest interest.\n\n         {¶ 12}   Mr. Bennett presented the testimony of several friends and relatives who\n\nstated that he was a good father, that he put his children first among his priorities, and that,\n\nin their opinions, a shared parenting plan or Mr. Bennett’s extensive involvement with the\n\nchildren after the divorce was in the children’s best interest.\n\n         {¶ 13}   A psychologist who evaluated the parents and the guardian ad litem each\n\nrecommended to the court that a sole-custody arrangement would serve the best interest of\n\nthe children and that Mrs. Bennett be designated the custodial and residential parent.\n\n         {¶ 14}   In a very thorough decision, the magistrate discussed the factors set forth at\n\nR.C. 3109.04 for determining the best interests of children in making a custody\n\ndetermination.    The evidence showed that both parties were capable parents. But the\n\nmagistrate noted that they had complained of and provided examples of communication and\n\ncooperation failures, and he noted that there was “little substantive communication between\n\n[Mrs. Bennett] and [Mr. Bennett] about important matters concerning the raising of their\n\nchildren. Overall, it is fair to say that [the parties] do not trust each other and cannot now\n\nwork with each other for the benefit of their children.” The magistrate concluded that the\n\f                                                                                                 6\n\nparents could not jointly share in the decision-making process regarding the best interests of\n\nthe children and that they had demonstrated little ability or desire to encourage a loving\n\nrelationship with the other parent. Thus, the magistrate found that shared parenting was not\n\nin the best interest of the children, and the trial court agreed with this conclusion.\n\n        {¶ 15}         Mr. Bennett contends on appeal, as he did in the trial court, that the trial\n\ncourt should have recognized Mrs. Bennett’s “proven anger, resentment, and desire to find\n\nrevenge” for his affair as a motivation in her opposition to shared parenting. He does not\n\ndeny that friction exists between them. But he expresses confidence that cooperation will\n\n“usually quickly redevelop[ ] between two formerly rational and nurturing parents,” that the\n\nstrain between Mrs. Bennett and him will abate over time, and that shared parenting is in the\n\nboys’ best interest.\n\n        {¶ 16}    Although there was evidence to support Mr. Bennett’s assertion that both\n\nparents have a “loving, caring, and nurturing relationship” with the children, the decision to\n\naward shared custody focuses as much on the parents’ ability and willingness to work with\n\none another as on their relationships with the children. Based on the evidence presented in\n\nthis case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that shared parenting was\n\nnot a viable option.\n\n        {¶ 17}    The first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                  III\n\n        {¶ 18}     In his second assignment of error, Mr. Bennett contends that the trial court\n\nerred in concluding that funds in a particular joint account were not traceable to the\n\npayments from his personal injury claims related to the 2003 accident, in concluding that the\n\f                                                                                               7\n\nfunds in the account were marital assets, and in dividing those assets in the divorce.\n\n       {¶ 19}    Upon the application of either party in an action for divorce, the trial court\n\nmust determine what constitutes marital property and what constitutes separate property,\n\ndivide the marital property equitably between the parties, and “disburse a spouse’s separate\n\nproperty to that spouse.” R.C. 3105.171(D). The definition of separate property includes\n\n“all real and personal property and any interest in real or personal property that is found by\n\nthe court to be * * * [c]ompensation to a spouse for the spouse’s personal injury, except for\n\nloss of marital earnings and compensation for expenses paid from marital assets.” R.C.\n\n3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vi). However, if any portion of a personal injury award or settlement is\n\nattributable to the “uninjured” spouse’s loss of consortium claim, then that portion of the\n\naward is the separate property of the “uninjured” spouse. Mayer v. Mayer, 5th Dist. Stark\n\nNo. 2010-CA-277, 2011-Ohio-1884, ¶ 8, citing Lust v. Lust, 3d Dist. Wyandot No.\n\n16-02-07, 2002-Ohio-3629.\n\n       {¶ 20}    Where an award is linked to a personal injury, “[t]he starting point is to\n\npresume the benefits are separate [property] pursuant to [R.C. 3105.171(A)], and then it is\n\nthe burden of the party seeking to establish the property is marital to rebut the statutory\n\npresumption.”    Mayer at ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶ 21}    The factual findings of a trial court relating to its classification of property\n\nas marital or separate are reviewed to determine whether they are against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence, and will not be reversed if they are supported by some competent and\n\ncredible evidence. Kovacs v. Kovacs, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-09-039, 2011-Ohio-154, ¶\n\n13.\n\f                                                                                           8\n\n       The Disputed Property\n\n       {¶ 22}    During the Bennetts’ marriage, they each maintained a separate checking\n\naccount into which their respective paychecks were deposited, although both spouses were\n\nnamed on the accounts for estate planning purposes. The parties also had an account which\n\nthey treated as a “joint” account, and their sons had accounts into which the parties\n\noccasionally transferred funds.\n\n       {¶ 23}    The evidence offered at the hearing established that the Bennetts received\n\nthe following amounts related to Mr. Bennett’s accident: $29,000 from the insurer of the\n\ndriver who was at fault (USAA), $112,000 from Clark County’s insurance pool (CORSA),\n\nand $12,880 from the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation. These payments resulted\n\nfrom negotiations in which the Bennetts were represented by counsel, but not from litigation,\n\nand represent the amount received by the Bennetts after the payment of attorney fees. It\n\ndoes not appear that any complaint was ever filed. The exact nature of the Bennetts’ claims\n\nand of the payments they received, i.e., the amount or proportion attributable to loss of\n\nconsortium, lost wages, medical bills, etc., was not specified in the settlement documents\n\nprovided in the current action.\n\n       {¶ 24}    In 2004, both parties signed the settlement agreement with USAA; the\n\ncheck for $29,000, which came through the Bennetts’ attorney’s office, was made out to and\n\nendorsed only by Mr. Bennett. No evidence was presented as to where that check was\n\ndeposited but, at around that time, $24,000 was deposited into Mr. Bennett’s checking\n\naccount.   Mr. Bennett testified that an additional $4,000 was split between the sons’\n\naccounts at that time.\n\f                                                                                           9\n\n       {¶ 25}    The Bennetts received the payment of $112,000 from the CORSA\n\nsettlement in 2005. The funds from CORSA, which also came through the attorney’s\n\noffice, were distributed in a check made out only to Mr. Bennett.         No evidence was\n\npresented as to where this check was initially deposited, but Mr. Bennett testified that\n\n$94,000 was transferred into the account of one of his sons, temporarily, while Mr. Bennett\n\ndecided where to deposit it more permanently. Later, $80,000 was transferred from the\n\nson’s account to the parties’ joint account.\n\n       {¶ 26}    In 2007, Mr. Bennett received $12,880 from the Bureau of Workers’\n\nCompensation. These funds were deposited into the joint account.\n\n       {¶ 27}    Over the years, money from the joint account was used to make several\n\nlarge purchases, often in combination with marital funds. These purchases included a hot\n\ntub, a camper, an all-terrain vehicle, a car for Mrs. Bennett, and a down payment and some\n\nimprovements on an investment property. Some documentation was presented as to the\n\npurchases in question, but the exact sources of the monies used and their amounts was not\n\nclear with respect to all the purchases.\n\n       {¶ 28}    In Mr. Bennett’s testimony, he admitted that, in addition to the settlement\n\nmonies, other deposits had been made into the joint account at various times; he could not\n\nstate with certainty what the sources of those funds had been. He allowed for the possibility\n\nthat some of those funds had come from Mrs. Bennett’s income. A number of smaller\n\nwithdrawals were also made for which Mr. Bennett could provide no explanation.\n\n       {¶ 29} Mrs. Bennett testified that some of the money that was paid in the\n\nsettlements was in compensation for her loss of consortium as a result of the accident, as\n\f                                                                                            10\n\nwell as Mr. Bennett’s injuries, pain, and suffering.       In support of this argument, she\n\nproduced a letter that she had written to USAA during the negotiations, which recounted\n\nhow the accident had affected their family life.       Mr. Bennett claimed that all of the\n\npayments, including workers’ compensation, were attributable to his injuries, pain, and\n\nsuffering. He denied that the funds were compensation for lost wages and, in fact, he\n\ndenied that he had lost any wages.\n\n       {¶ 30}     Mrs. Bennett described the joint account into which some of the settlement\n\nfunds had been deposited as a savings account; she stated that the couple had agreed to try to\n\nmaintain about $90,000 in the account, and that when the account balance dropped below\n\nthis amount because of purchases, they built the balance back up by depositing investment\n\nincome and income tax refunds. Mrs. Bennett claimed that all of the money remaining in\n\nthe joint account at the end of the marriage was marital property; Mr. Bennett admitted that\n\nthe funds had been kept in a joint account, but he claimed that the funds were traceable to his\n\npersonal injury settlement and thus that the entire amount was his separate property.\n\n       {¶ 31}     Approximately $90,000 remained in the joint account near the time of the\n\nparties’ separation.   Mrs. Bennett withdrew $45,090 in April 2008; the next day, Mr.\n\nBennett withdraw the remaining balance of $44,732.           Mrs. Bennett testified that she\n\nwithdrew half of the money and placed it in a certificate of deposit only in her name because\n\nshe was fearful that Mr. Bennett was preparing to leave her, and she wanted to provide for\n\nher financial security in the event that he did.\n\n       {¶ 32}     Amounts that had previously been spent on joint purchases or had been\n\ndeposited into other accounts were not in dispute at the time of the divorce; those funds, or\n\f                                                                                             11\n\nthe purchases made with those funds, were treated as marital assets.\n\n       The Burden of Proof\n\n       {¶ 33}    In its judgment, the trial court correctly observed that any payment to a\n\nspouse for personal injury that was traceable to “pain, suffering, and disfigurement” was the\n\nseparate property of that spouse, but that any portion attributable to “lost wages, lost earning\n\ncapacity, and medical and hospital expenses” paid during the marriage was marital property\n\nsubject to division in a divorce.   The trial court stated, however, that Mr. Bennett had the\n\nburden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, because “[m]oney acquired during the\n\nmarriage is presumed to be marital unless proven to be separate property,” and Mr. Bennett\n\nwas the party seeking to have the property declared separate property.\n\n       {¶ 34}    We disagree with the trial court’s statement that all money acquired during\n\nmarriage is presumed to be marital property, regardless of the source, thereby placing the\n\nburden of proof on the party asserting a right to separate property. R.C. 3105.171 clearly\n\nstates that assets traceable to personal injury awards, inheritances, and other enumerated\n\nsources are separate property. The fact that such assets are acquired during a marriage does\n\nnot automatically negate the character of those assets. However, it is correct that where\n\nseparate and marital assets have been commingled, the party asserting the existence of\n\nseparate property has the burden to establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, the\n\ntraceability of the assets to separate property. Maloney v. Maloney, 160 Ohio App.3d 209,\n\n2005-Ohio-1368, 826 N.E.2d 864, ¶ 23 (2d Dist.), citing Peck v. Peck, 96 Ohio App.3d 731,\n\n645 N.E.2d 1300 (12th Dist.1994); Fisher v. Fisher, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20398,\n\n2004-Ohio-7255, ¶ 16.\n\f                                                                                             12\n\n        The Trial Court’s Determination Regarding the Nature of the Property\n\n        {¶ 35}    The trial court made several findings with respect to Mr. Bennett’s\n\nassertion that all of the settlement monies were his separate property and that the funds in the\n\nparties’ joint account were traceable to those settlements. The trial court concluded that Mr.\n\nBennett’s workers’ compensation award might have been for permanent partial disability,\n\nwhich compensates for “permanent residual problems stemming from the injury,” or\n\ntemporary total disability, which replaces lost wages while an injured worker is unable to\n\nwork. The trial court found that “[t]here is no evidence that the Bureau [of Workers’\n\nCompensation] pays for pain and suffering” and that there is no “loss of consortium” claim\n\navailable to a spouse through Workers’ Compensation. Because no evidence was offered at\n\nthe hearing, other than Mr. Bennett’s testimony, as to how his workers’ compensation award\n\nwas determined or how it was “apportioned [between] his personal injury, future earnings or\n\neconomic losses,” the trial court determined that this portion of the settlement was “all\n\ncommingled from the start” and could not be traced to separate property. The trial court\n\ntreated it as marital property.\n\n        {¶ 36}    The trial court concluded that the Bennetts’ claims against USAA and\n\nCORSA encompassed claims for both Mr. Bennett’s injuries and Mrs. Bennett’s loss of\n\nconsortium. The settlements, however, did not apportion the damages between these two\n\ntypes of claims. The court found that the inability to determine how the settlements were\n\napportioned between the parties’ claims was “fatal to proving any claim of separate\n\nproperty.” Further, the court determined that “there was a lot of commingling” of the\n\nsettlement monies with marital monies from 2005 until the parties’ separation, “which\n\f                                                                                          13\n\nfurther made the tracing of the settlement monies with any confidence impossible.”\n\n       {¶ 37}    Based on the foregoing conclusions, the trial court found that there was no\n\nseparate property and ordered that the marital property, including the approximately $90,000\n\nbalance in the joint account near the time of their separation, be divided equally. This\n\ndivision was accomplished through the division of the parties’ assets and a short-term plan\n\nby which Mr. Bennett would make monthly payments to Mrs. Bennett.\n\n       {¶ 38}    Although the evidence supported Mr. Bennett’s assertion that he had\n\nreceived a personal injury award that, were it traceable, would have constituted his separate\n\nproperty, the evidence also supported the trial court’s inference that Mrs. Bennett had\n\nreceived funds in payment of her loss of consortium claim, which would have constituted\n\nher separate funds, if traceable. Because the apportionment of the USAA and CORSA\n\nawards between payments for Mr. Bennett’s pain and suffering, lost wages (if any), and Mrs.\n\nBennett’s loss of consortium was never delineated, and because the parties had commingled\n\ntheir separate property with marital assets for many years following the awards, the trial\n\ncourt reasonably concluded that the assets could not be traced. Under these circumstances,\n\nan equal division of the account into which separate and marital funds had been deposited\n\nwas equitable.\n\n       {¶ 39}    The second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                             IV\n\n       {¶ 40}    In her cross-assignment of error, Mrs. Bennett argues that the trial court\n\nimproperly ordered her to pay the entire debt on medical bills related to an injury to one of\n\nthe children, based on the court’s conclusion that her poor judgment had caused or\n\f                                                                                               14\n\ncontributed to the injury.\n\n       {¶ 41} The evidence established that Mrs. Bennett acquired a Great Dane, which\n\nshe named Thor, during the parties’ separation. Mr. Bennett also owned a Great Dane.\n\nAfter observing the dogs together, Mr. Bennett expressed concern to Mrs. Bennett about\n\nThor’s aggressiveness, although he admitted that some aggressiveness among dogs was “not\n\nuncommon” and that it abated after the dogs had been together for a little while. Mr.\n\nBennett testified, without objection, that he had heard about several other incidents\n\ninvolving Thor that caused him concern, including an incident in which Thor cornered a\n\nneighbor inside Mrs. Bennett’s house. Mr. Bennett discussed these concerns with Mrs.\n\nBennett, and she agreed to get rid of the dog.          Although Mrs. Bennett found a new\n\nplacement for Thor, she failed to follow through. A short time later, the dog bit one of the\n\nBennetts’ sons on the face.\n\n       {¶ 42}    Because the son had lacerations on his face, the Bennetts met at the hospital\n\nand agreed to use a plastic surgeon for his treatment, even if the surgeon were not in the\n\nparties’ insurance network. The Bennetts did not discuss before the surgery who would be\n\nresponsible for paying any associated out-of-pocket expenses. Those expenses totaled over\n\n$7,800.\n\n       {¶ 43}    In its decision, the trial court stated that the “acquisition of this dog and the\n\nfailure to segregate it from the children after it became aggressive was an example of poor\n\njudgment” by Mrs. Bennett. The court found the debt related to the surgery to be “the\n\nseparate non-marital debt of [Mrs. Bennett] because it was [her] unilateral decision to obtain\n\nthe dog” and her “error in judgment” that led to the injury.\n\f                                                                                           15\n\n{¶ 44}   A marital debt is any debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the\n\nparties or for a valid marital purpose.

Jefferson\n\nNo. 05JE52, 2007-Ohio-1395, ¶ 12; Kehoe v. Kehoe, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97357,\n\n2012-Ohio-3357, ¶ 14. The party seeking to establish a debt is separate rather than marital\n\nbears the burden of proof in the trial court. Lucas at ¶ 33; Hurte v. Hurte, 164 Ohio App.3d\n\n446, 2005–Ohio–5967, 842 N.E.2d 1058, ¶ 21 (4th Dist.).            As discussed above, the\n\nclassification of property is reviewed to determine whether it is against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence and will not be reversed if supported by some competent and credible\n\nevidence. Kovacs, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-09-039, 2011-Ohio-154, ¶ 13.\n\n{¶ 45}   Although, especially in hindsight, Mrs. Bennett might have acted with more\n\ncaution or more decisively in removing Thor from her home, the trial court’s conclusion that\n\nthe debt incurred in treating the son’s injury was “non-marital” is unsubstantiated by the\n\nrecord. Because the debt was incurred during the marriage, it was presumed to be marital\n\ndebt. Moreover, the medical treatment of their child was for their joint benefit and was for\n\na valid marital purpose.\n\n{¶ 46}   Mr. Bennett’s assertion, based on his observations under unexplained\n\ncircumstances, that Thor had been “aggressive” with another dog was of questionable value\n\nin predicting the dog’s future behavior toward children; Mr. Bennett admitted that aggressive\n\nbehavior was “not uncommon” between dogs and that the dogs settled down after some time\n\f                                                                                               16\n\ntogether. Mr. Bennett’s claims that Thor had acted aggressively toward other people were\n\nnon-specific as to time, place, and circumstances and were based on hearsay. Although the\n\nmagistrate’s decision stated that the dog was a pit bull, the testimony at the hearing\n\nestablished that Thor was a Great Dane and that Mr. Bennett owned a dog of the same breed.\n\n Further, the circumstances surrounding the incident during which the Bennetts’ son was\n\nbitten were not developed at the hearing.\n\n{¶ 47}    The trial court’s treatment of the debt implied that Mrs. Bennett should have\n\nanticipated and prevented their son’s injury and that her actions removed the costs associated\n\nwith the son’s treatment from being a marital debt. This conclusion is not supported by\n\ncompetent and credible evidence. The debt for the son’s medical treatment was a marital\n\ndebt because it was “incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties or for a\n\nvalid marital purpose.” Lucas, 7th Dist. Noble No. 11NO382, 2011-Ohio-6411, ¶ 33, citing\n\nKetchum, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 2001 CO60, 2003-Ohio-2559. Moreover, Mr. Bennett\n\nfully participated in the decision to use a non-network plastic surgeon, a decision which\n\nbenefitted the child, not Mrs. Bennett. The alleged used of “poor judgment” by a spouse is\n\nnot a basis for concluding that debts incurred during the marriage are nonmarital debts. The\n\ntrial court should have divided the debt equitably, as it did the parties’ other assets and debts.\n\n{¶ 48}    The cross-assignment of error is sustained.\n\nV\n\n{¶ 49} The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed in part and reversed in part. The\n\nmatter will be remanded for the trial court to address the equitable division of the medical\n\ndebt.\n\f                                                 17\n\n                                    ..........\n\nFAIN, J. and DONOVAN, J., concur.\n\nCopies mailed to:\n\nDouglas W.

Bennett appeals from a judgment entry and decree of\n\f                                                                                               2\n\ndivorce of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, which\n\nawarded custody of the Bennett children to Jill Bennett, determined that there was no\n\nseparate property traceable to personal injury settlements several years earlier, and divided\n\nthe parties’ assets equally, with the exception of a son’s medical bill, which Mrs. Bennett\n\nwas ordered to pay. Mrs. Bennett cross-appeals.\n\n       {¶ 2}     On appeal, Mr. Bennett challenges the trial court’s decision to reject his\n\nshared parenting plans in favor of awarding custody to Mrs. Bennett. He also objects to the\n\ntrial court’s decision to equally divide funds in a particular account, some of which he claims\n\noriginated from a personal injury claim, rather than treating those funds as his separate\n\nproperty. Mrs. Bennett claims that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that a\n\nmedical debt related to their son’s treatment for a dog bite was “non-marital” and in ordering\n\nher to pay the debt in its entirety. For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the trial court\n\nwill be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n                                                I\n\n       {¶ 3}     The Bennetts were married in 1999 and filed for divorce in 2011. Two\n\nchildren were born of the marriage, who were ages 10 and 8 at the time of the divorce. In\n\n2003, Mr. Bennett was injured in a car accident during the course of his employment with\n\nthe Clark County Sheriff’s Department. As a result of the accident, he sustained back\n\ninjuries and a brain aneurism. The parties received payments from several sources in\n\nconnection with Mr. Bennett’s injuries. While the parties were separated, one of their sons\n\nwas bitten by Mrs. Bennett’s dog, requiring surgery and incurring medical bills.\n\n       {¶ 4}     After the parties filed for divorce, the disputed matters were heard by a\n\f                                                                                              3\n\nmagistrate.    The magistrate issued a 51-page decision, which recounted the evidence\n\npresented and provided detailed explanations for most of the magistrate’s findings and legal\n\nconclusions. Both parties filed objections to the magistrate’s decision. The trial court\n\noverruled all of the objections and adopted the magistrate’s order. Because the trial court\n\nadopted the magistrate’s conclusions with a less detailed discussion of the evidence than that\n\ncontained in the magistrate’s decision, we will refer to and rely on many of the magistrate’s\n\nfindings – which the trial court approved – in reviewing the trial court’s judgment.\n\n       {¶ 5}     Mr. Bennett appeals, raising two assignments of error, and Mrs. Bennett\n\nraises one assignment of error on cross-appeal.\n\n                                               II\n\n       {¶ 6}     In his first assignment of error, Mr. Bennett contends that the trial court’s\n\ndecision to designate Mrs. Bennett as the residential parent for the parties’ two minor\n\nchildren, rather than to adopt one of the shared parenting plans he proposed, was against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence and was not in the best interest of the children.\n\n       {¶ 7}     Pursuant to R.C. 3109.04, the factors that a court is to consider in allocating\n\nparental rights and responsibilities include: (a) the wishes of the parents; (b) if interviewed,\n\nthe child’s wishes and concerns; (c) the child’s interaction and interrelationship with parents,\n\nsiblings, and other significant people; (d) the child’s adjustment to home, school, and\n\ncommunity; (e) the mental and physical health of all persons involved; (f) which parent is\n\nmore likely to abide by court orders regarding parenting time rights; and (g) whether under a\n\nshared-parenting plan one parent has interfered with the other’s parenting rights.\n\n       {¶ 8}      A reviewing court may not reverse a custody determination unless the trial\n\f                                                                                           4\n\ncourt has abused its discretion.

It was also undisputed that Mrs. Bennett had been the primary caregiver\n\nand that Mr. Bennett was a good father to the children. However, Mrs. Bennett described\n\nher relationship with Mr. Bennett during the separation as “a roller coaster,” stating that\n\nsometimes Mr. Bennett was nice and sometimes he was manipulative. She testified that\n\ntheir communication was not good and that they had difficulty reaching agreement on issues\n\nrelated to the boys.\n\n       {¶ 11}    Mrs. Bennett also described incidents where Mr. Bennett intentionally\n\nmade physical contact with her, threw her phone against a wall and broke it, and hid her car\n\nkeys. She recounted instances in which he had locked himself in a room with the children\n\nat their home to “hav[e] his time” with them and had not allowed her to have contact with\n\f                                                                                              5\n\nthe boys while they were with him for a visit. She stated that there was no trust between\n\nthem because of his affair and other lies she had discovered after the affair. She also\n\ntestified that, as a teacher, she had seen kids from shared parenting homes who were “a royal\n\nmess,” forgetting clothes and homework, etc., as they went back and forth from house to\n\nhouse.     Because of her communication problems with Mr. Bennett and her other\n\nexperiences with shared parenting, she did not think such an arrangement was in the boys’\n\nbest interest.\n\n         {¶ 12}   Mr. Bennett presented the testimony of several friends and relatives who\n\nstated that he was a good father, that he put his children first among his priorities, and that,\n\nin their opinions, a shared parenting plan or Mr. Bennett’s extensive involvement with the\n\nchildren after the divorce was in the children’s best interest.\n\n         {¶ 13}   A psychologist who evaluated the parents and the guardian ad litem each\n\nrecommended to the court that a sole-custody arrangement would serve the best interest of\n\nthe children and that Mrs. Bennett be designated the custodial and residential parent.\n\n         {¶ 14}   In a very thorough decision, the magistrate discussed the factors set forth at\n\nR.C. 3109.04 for determining the best interests of children in making a custody\n\ndetermination.    The evidence showed that both parties were capable parents. But the\n\nmagistrate noted that they had complained of and provided examples of communication and\n\ncooperation failures, and he noted that there was “little substantive communication between\n\n[Mrs. Bennett] and [Mr. Bennett] about important matters concerning the raising of their\n\nchildren. Overall, it is fair to say that [the parties] do not trust each other and cannot now\n\nwork with each other for the benefit of their children.” The magistrate concluded that the\n\f                                                                                                 6\n\nparents could not jointly share in the decision-making process regarding the best interests of\n\nthe children and that they had demonstrated little ability or desire to encourage a loving\n\nrelationship with the other parent. Thus, the magistrate found that shared parenting was not\n\nin the best interest of the children, and the trial court agreed with this conclusion.\n\n        {¶ 15}         Mr. Bennett contends on appeal, as he did in the trial court, that the trial\n\ncourt should have recognized Mrs. Bennett’s “proven anger, resentment, and desire to find\n\nrevenge” for his affair as a motivation in her opposition to shared parenting. He does not\n\ndeny that friction exists between them. But he expresses confidence that cooperation will\n\n“usually quickly redevelop[ ] between two formerly rational and nurturing parents,” that the\n\nstrain between Mrs. Bennett and him will abate over time, and that shared parenting is in the\n\nboys’ best interest.\n\n        {¶ 16}    Although there was evidence to support Mr. Bennett’s assertion that both\n\nparents have a “loving, caring, and nurturing relationship” with the children, the decision to\n\naward shared custody focuses as much on the parents’ ability and willingness to work with\n\none another as on their relationships with the children. Based on the evidence presented in\n\nthis case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that shared parenting was\n\nnot a viable option.\n\n        {¶ 17}    The first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                  III\n\n        {¶ 18}     In his second assignment of error, Mr. Bennett contends that the trial court\n\nerred in concluding that funds in a particular joint account were not traceable to the\n\npayments from his personal injury claims related to the 2003 accident, in concluding that the\n\f                                                                                               7\n\nfunds in the account were marital assets, and in dividing those assets in the divorce.\n\n       {¶ 19}    Upon the application of either party in an action for divorce, the trial court\n\nmust determine what constitutes marital property and what constitutes separate property,\n\ndivide the marital property equitably between the parties, and “disburse a spouse’s separate\n\nproperty to that spouse.” R.C. 3105.171(D). The definition of separate property includes\n\n“all real and personal property and any interest in real or personal property that is found by\n\nthe court to be * * * [c]ompensation to a spouse for the spouse’s personal injury, except for\n\nloss of marital earnings and compensation for expenses paid from marital assets.” R.C.\n\n3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vi). However, if any portion of a personal injury award or settlement is\n\nattributable to the “uninjured” spouse’s loss of consortium claim, then that portion of the\n\naward is the separate property of the “uninjured” spouse.

Kovacs v. Kovacs, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-09-039, 2011-Ohio-154, ¶\n\n13.\n\f                                                                                           8\n\n       The Disputed Property\n\n       {¶ 22}    During the Bennetts’ marriage, they each maintained a separate checking\n\naccount into which their respective paychecks were deposited, although both spouses were\n\nnamed on the accounts for estate planning purposes. The parties also had an account which\n\nthey treated as a “joint” account, and their sons had accounts into which the parties\n\noccasionally transferred funds.\n\n       {¶ 23}    The evidence offered at the hearing established that the Bennetts received\n\nthe following amounts related to Mr. Bennett’s accident: $29,000 from the insurer of the\n\ndriver who was at fault (USAA), $112,000 from Clark County’s insurance pool (CORSA),\n\nand $12,880 from the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation. These payments resulted\n\nfrom negotiations in which the Bennetts were represented by counsel, but not from litigation,\n\nand represent the amount received by the Bennetts after the payment of attorney fees. It\n\ndoes not appear that any complaint was ever filed. The exact nature of the Bennetts’ claims\n\nand of the payments they received, i.e., the amount or proportion attributable to loss of\n\nconsortium, lost wages, medical bills, etc., was not specified in the settlement documents\n\nprovided in the current action.\n\n       {¶ 24}    In 2004, both parties signed the settlement agreement with USAA; the\n\ncheck for $29,000, which came through the Bennetts’ attorney’s office, was made out to and\n\nendorsed only by Mr. Bennett. No evidence was presented as to where that check was\n\ndeposited but, at around that time, $24,000 was deposited into Mr. Bennett’s checking\n\naccount.   Mr. Bennett testified that an additional $4,000 was split between the sons’\n\naccounts at that time.\n\f                                                                                           9\n\n       {¶ 25}    The Bennetts received the payment of $112,000 from the CORSA\n\nsettlement in 2005. The funds from CORSA, which also came through the attorney’s\n\noffice, were distributed in a check made out only to Mr. Bennett.         No evidence was\n\npresented as to where this check was initially deposited, but Mr. Bennett testified that\n\n$94,000 was transferred into the account of one of his sons, temporarily, while Mr. Bennett\n\ndecided where to deposit it more permanently. Later, $80,000 was transferred from the\n\nson’s account to the parties’ joint account.\n\n       {¶ 26}    In 2007, Mr. Bennett received $12,880 from the Bureau of Workers’\n\nCompensation. These funds were deposited into the joint account.\n\n       {¶ 27}    Over the years, money from the joint account was used to make several\n\nlarge purchases, often in combination with marital funds. These purchases included a hot\n\ntub, a camper, an all-terrain vehicle, a car for Mrs. Bennett, and a down payment and some\n\nimprovements on an investment property. Some documentation was presented as to the\n\npurchases in question, but the exact sources of the monies used and their amounts was not\n\nclear with respect to all the purchases.\n\n       {¶ 28}    In Mr. Bennett’s testimony, he admitted that, in addition to the settlement\n\nmonies, other deposits had been made into the joint account at various times; he could not\n\nstate with certainty what the sources of those funds had been. He allowed for the possibility\n\nthat some of those funds had come from Mrs. Bennett’s income. A number of smaller\n\nwithdrawals were also made for which Mr. Bennett could provide no explanation.\n\n       {¶ 29} Mrs. Bennett testified that some of the money that was paid in the\n\nsettlements was in compensation for her loss of consortium as a result of the accident, as\n\f                                                                                            10\n\nwell as Mr. Bennett’s injuries, pain, and suffering.       In support of this argument, she\n\nproduced a letter that she had written to USAA during the negotiations, which recounted\n\nhow the accident had affected their family life.       Mr. Bennett claimed that all of the\n\npayments, including workers’ compensation, were attributable to his injuries, pain, and\n\nsuffering. He denied that the funds were compensation for lost wages and, in fact, he\n\ndenied that he had lost any wages.\n\n       {¶ 30}     Mrs. Bennett described the joint account into which some of the settlement\n\nfunds had been deposited as a savings account; she stated that the couple had agreed to try to\n\nmaintain about $90,000 in the account, and that when the account balance dropped below\n\nthis amount because of purchases, they built the balance back up by depositing investment\n\nincome and income tax refunds. Mrs. Bennett claimed that all of the money remaining in\n\nthe joint account at the end of the marriage was marital property; Mr. Bennett admitted that\n\nthe funds had been kept in a joint account, but he claimed that the funds were traceable to his\n\npersonal injury settlement and thus that the entire amount was his separate property.\n\n       {¶ 31}     Approximately $90,000 remained in the joint account near the time of the\n\nparties’ separation.   Mrs. Bennett withdrew $45,090 in April 2008; the next day, Mr.\n\nBennett withdraw the remaining balance of $44,732.           Mrs. Bennett testified that she\n\nwithdrew half of the money and placed it in a certificate of deposit only in her name because\n\nshe was fearful that Mr. Bennett was preparing to leave her, and she wanted to provide for\n\nher financial security in the event that he did.\n\n       {¶ 32}     Amounts that had previously been spent on joint purchases or had been\n\ndeposited into other accounts were not in dispute at the time of the divorce; those funds, or\n\f                                                                                             11\n\nthe purchases made with those funds, were treated as marital assets.\n\n       The Burden of Proof\n\n       {¶ 33}    In its judgment, the trial court correctly observed that any payment to a\n\nspouse for personal injury that was traceable to “pain, suffering, and disfigurement” was the\n\nseparate property of that spouse, but that any portion attributable to “lost wages, lost earning\n\ncapacity, and medical and hospital expenses” paid during the marriage was marital property\n\nsubject to division in a divorce.   The trial court stated, however, that Mr. Bennett had the\n\nburden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, because “[m]oney acquired during the\n\nmarriage is presumed to be marital unless proven to be separate property,” and Mr. Bennett\n\nwas the party seeking to have the property declared separate property.\n\n       {¶ 34}    We disagree with the trial court’s statement that all money acquired during\n\nmarriage is presumed to be marital property, regardless of the source, thereby placing the\n\nburden of proof on the party asserting a right to separate property. R.C. 3105.171 clearly\n\nstates that assets traceable to personal injury awards, inheritances, and other enumerated\n\nsources are separate property. The fact that such assets are acquired during a marriage does\n\nnot automatically negate the character of those assets. However, it is correct that where\n\nseparate and marital assets have been commingled, the party asserting the existence of\n\nseparate property has the burden to establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, the\n\ntraceability of the assets to separate property.

Fisher, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20398,\n\n2004-Ohio-7255, ¶ 16.\n\f                                                                                             12\n\n        The Trial Court’s Determination Regarding the Nature of the Property\n\n        {¶ 35}    The trial court made several findings with respect to Mr. Bennett’s\n\nassertion that all of the settlement monies were his separate property and that the funds in the\n\nparties’ joint account were traceable to those settlements. The trial court concluded that Mr.\n\nBennett’s workers’ compensation award might have been for permanent partial disability,\n\nwhich compensates for “permanent residual problems stemming from the injury,” or\n\ntemporary total disability, which replaces lost wages while an injured worker is unable to\n\nwork. The trial court found that “[t]here is no evidence that the Bureau [of Workers’\n\nCompensation] pays for pain and suffering” and that there is no “loss of consortium” claim\n\navailable to a spouse through Workers’ Compensation. Because no evidence was offered at\n\nthe hearing, other than Mr. Bennett’s testimony, as to how his workers’ compensation award\n\nwas determined or how it was “apportioned [between] his personal injury, future earnings or\n\neconomic losses,” the trial court determined that this portion of the settlement was “all\n\ncommingled from the start” and could not be traced to separate property. The trial court\n\ntreated it as marital property.\n\n        {¶ 36}    The trial court concluded that the Bennetts’ claims against USAA and\n\nCORSA encompassed claims for both Mr. Bennett’s injuries and Mrs. Bennett’s loss of\n\nconsortium. The settlements, however, did not apportion the damages between these two\n\ntypes of claims. The court found that the inability to determine how the settlements were\n\napportioned between the parties’ claims was “fatal to proving any claim of separate\n\nproperty.” Further, the court determined that “there was a lot of commingling” of the\n\nsettlement monies with marital monies from 2005 until the parties’ separation, “which\n\f                                                                                          13\n\nfurther made the tracing of the settlement monies with any confidence impossible.”\n\n       {¶ 37}    Based on the foregoing conclusions, the trial court found that there was no\n\nseparate property and ordered that the marital property, including the approximately $90,000\n\nbalance in the joint account near the time of their separation, be divided equally. This\n\ndivision was accomplished through the division of the parties’ assets and a short-term plan\n\nby which Mr. Bennett would make monthly payments to Mrs. Bennett.\n\n       {¶ 38}    Although the evidence supported Mr. Bennett’s assertion that he had\n\nreceived a personal injury award that, were it traceable, would have constituted his separate\n\nproperty, the evidence also supported the trial court’s inference that Mrs. Bennett had\n\nreceived funds in payment of her loss of consortium claim, which would have constituted\n\nher separate funds, if traceable. Because the apportionment of the USAA and CORSA\n\nawards between payments for Mr. Bennett’s pain and suffering, lost wages (if any), and Mrs.\n\nBennett’s loss of consortium was never delineated, and because the parties had commingled\n\ntheir separate property with marital assets for many years following the awards, the trial\n\ncourt reasonably concluded that the assets could not be traced. Under these circumstances,\n\nan equal division of the account into which separate and marital funds had been deposited\n\nwas equitable.\n\n       {¶ 39}    The second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                             IV\n\n       {¶ 40}    In her cross-assignment of error, Mrs. Bennett argues that the trial court\n\nimproperly ordered her to pay the entire debt on medical bills related to an injury to one of\n\nthe children, based on the court’s conclusion that her poor judgment had caused or\n\f                                                                                               14\n\ncontributed to the injury.\n\n       {¶ 41} The evidence established that Mrs. Bennett acquired a Great Dane, which\n\nshe named Thor, during the parties’ separation. Mr. Bennett also owned a Great Dane.\n\nAfter observing the dogs together, Mr. Bennett expressed concern to Mrs. Bennett about\n\nThor’s aggressiveness, although he admitted that some aggressiveness among dogs was “not\n\nuncommon” and that it abated after the dogs had been together for a little while. Mr.\n\nBennett testified, without objection, that he had heard about several other incidents\n\ninvolving Thor that caused him concern, including an incident in which Thor cornered a\n\nneighbor inside Mrs. Bennett’s house. Mr. Bennett discussed these concerns with Mrs.\n\nBennett, and she agreed to get rid of the dog.          Although Mrs. Bennett found a new\n\nplacement for Thor, she failed to follow through. A short time later, the dog bit one of the\n\nBennetts’ sons on the face.\n\n       {¶ 42}    Because the son had lacerations on his face, the Bennetts met at the hospital\n\nand agreed to use a plastic surgeon for his treatment, even if the surgeon were not in the\n\nparties’ insurance network. The Bennetts did not discuss before the surgery who would be\n\nresponsible for paying any associated out-of-pocket expenses. Those expenses totaled over\n\n$7,800.\n\n       {¶ 43}    In its decision, the trial court stated that the “acquisition of this dog and the\n\nfailure to segregate it from the children after it became aggressive was an example of poor\n\njudgment” by Mrs. Bennett. The court found the debt related to the surgery to be “the\n\nseparate non-marital debt of [Mrs. Bennett] because it was [her] unilateral decision to obtain\n\nthe dog” and her “error in judgment” that led to the injury.\n\f                                                                                           15\n\n{¶ 44}   A marital debt is any debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the\n\nparties or for a valid marital purpose.

As discussed above, the\n\nclassification of property is reviewed to determine whether it is against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence and will not be reversed if supported by some competent and credible\n\nevidence. Kovacs, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-09-039, 2011-Ohio-154, ¶ 13.\n\n{¶ 45}   Although, especially in hindsight, Mrs. Bennett might have acted with more\n\ncaution or more decisively in removing Thor from her home, the trial court’s conclusion that\n\nthe debt incurred in treating the son’s injury was “non-marital” is unsubstantiated by the\n\nrecord. Because the debt was incurred during the marriage, it was presumed to be marital\n\ndebt. Moreover, the medical treatment of their child was for their joint benefit and was for\n\na valid marital purpose.\n\n{¶ 46}   Mr. Bennett’s assertion, based on his observations under unexplained\n\ncircumstances, that Thor had been “aggressive” with another dog was of questionable value\n\nin predicting the dog’s future behavior toward children; Mr. Bennett admitted that aggressive\n\nbehavior was “not uncommon” between dogs and that the dogs settled down after some time\n\f                                                                                               16\n\ntogether. Mr. Bennett’s claims that Thor had acted aggressively toward other people were\n\nnon-specific as to time, place, and circumstances and were based on hearsay. Although the\n\nmagistrate’s decision stated that the dog was a pit bull, the testimony at the hearing\n\nestablished that Thor was a Great Dane and that Mr. Bennett owned a dog of the same breed.\n\n Further, the circumstances surrounding the incident during which the Bennetts’ son was\n\nbitten were not developed at the hearing.\n\n{¶ 47}    The trial court’s treatment of the debt implied that Mrs. Bennett should have\n\nanticipated and prevented their son’s injury and that her actions removed the costs associated\n\nwith the son’s treatment from being a marital debt. This conclusion is not supported by\n\ncompetent and credible evidence. The debt for the son’s medical treatment was a marital\n\ndebt because it was “incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties or for a\n\nvalid marital purpose.” Lucas, 7th Dist. Noble No. 11NO382, 2011-Ohio-6411, ¶ 33, citing\n\nKetchum, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 2001 CO60, 2003-Ohio-2559. Moreover, Mr. Bennett\n\nfully participated in the decision to use a non-network plastic surgeon, a decision which\n\nbenefitted the child, not Mrs. Bennett. The alleged used of “poor judgment” by a spouse is\n\nnot a basis for concluding that debts incurred during the marriage are nonmarital debts. The\n\ntrial court should have divided the debt equitably, as it did the parties’ other assets and debts.\n\n{¶ 48}    The cross-assignment of error is sustained.\n\nV\n\n{¶ 49} The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed in part and reversed in part. The\n\nmatter will be remanded for the trial court to address the equitable division of the medical\n\ndebt.\n\f                                                 17\n\n                                    ..........\n\nFAIN, J. and DONOVAN, J., concur.\n\nCopies mailed to:\n\nDouglas W.
