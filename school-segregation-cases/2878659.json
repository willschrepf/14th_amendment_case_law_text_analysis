He sued the\ndepartment and several of its officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Ark. Code Ann. §\n16-123-105 (Michie 1997), alleging that he had been transferred because of his\ncriticisms in violation of his free speech and due process rights. A jury found in favor\nof Campbell and awarded him $94,000 in damages, and the district court2 ordered\nequitable relief in the form of reinstatement or $74,000 in front pay and elimination of\nhis one year probation. The defendants appeal from the judgment, and we affirm\nexcept as to the equitable part of the award.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       On appeal from a jury verdict, the facts must be stated in the light most favorable\nto the prevailing party and he must receive the benefit of all reasonable inferences from\nthe evidence at trial. See Ryther v. KARE 11, 108 F.3d 832, 844 (8th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 117 S.Ct. 2510 (1997).\n\n       Terry Campbell was employed in the Arkansas state prison system for seventeen\nyears prior to his appointment as warden of the Tucker Maximum Security Unit on\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri, sitting by designation.\n      2\n        The Honorable Henry Woods, United States District Judge for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fSeptember 20, 1994. The prison system had a number of separate correctional\ninstitutions, and the Tucker Unit contained the system’s death row, as well as inmates\nwho had been placed in administrative segregation due to violent behavior. Campbell\nhad begun his career as a correctional sergeant and had worked his way up to be\nwarden of the Varner Unit by 1993. The Varner Unit housed a younger population and\nsome maximum security inmates and featured education and vocational programs. The\nDirector of the Arkansas Department of Correction (ADC) was Larry Norris. Assistant\nDirector G. David Guntharp reported directly to Norris, and he was the official who\nappointed Campbell warden at Tucker.\n\n      Guntharp had consistently given Campbell high annual performance evaluation\nratings, and part of the reason he offered him the Tucker position was because he\nbelieved Campbell was strong on policy. Campbell was regarded by others in the\nsystem as meticulous in his implementation of ADC policies and procedures. The\nprevious warden at Tucker had been demoted for leaving the institution to gamble while\non duty, and the prison had been run in the interim by Tom Pitts, the assistant warden.\nGuntharp encouraged Campbell to accept the appointment as an opportunity to broaden\nhis warden experience. From the time of his appointment in September, Campbell\nspent one day a week at Tucker and moved there from Varner full time in January\n1995.\n\n        When Campbell arrived at Tucker he was faced with morale and turnover\nproblems and numerous vacant staff positions. He saw that changes needed to be\nmade, and he set about interviewing Tucker personnel, reviewing existing policies and\nprocedures, and investigating how money came to be missing from the Employee\nCorporation Fund. Illegal contraband was moving into and within the prison so he\ninstituted policies to search all staff, including himself, upon entry to death row and to\nconduct random searches of inmate cells. He also updated the orders and duties\nassociated with each officer’s post. Through his investigation he learned there were\nsecurity breaches at Tucker, including unlocked cell doors, overheated control panels\n\n                                           -3-\n\ffor cell door operation, and cell doors which had been altered so that inmates were able\nto open them. He reported these conditions, and the steps he had taken in response, to\nGuntharp and Norris. He also submitted recommendations on how to correct the\nproblems with cell doors and sought a hazardous pay increase for Tucker employees\nand additional security equipment.\n\n      Campbell ordered a “shakedown” for February 14, 1995, which is a\ncomprehensive search of inmate cells. The shakedown revealed there was contraband\non the death row complex at Tucker. The contraband included hammers, chisels,\nshanks, gunpowder, hacksaw blades, wire cutters, glass jars, exacto knives, civilian\nclothes, marijuana, syringes, paint thinner, and photographs of inmates cohabitating.\nThe search also discovered cell windows which were being enlarged to permit escape\nand a missing cinder block adjoining two cells. It was undisputed at trial that the\ncontraband had been introduced before Campbell took over full time as warden of the\nmaximum security unit.\n\n        Intense media attention followed the discovery of the death row contraband.\nCampbell believed that Guntharp and Norris blamed him for the attention, but he\ntestified at trial that he had not initiated any media contact. On one occasion Guntharp\ncriticized Campbell for the way the contraband had been displayed and photographed\nbefore it was disposed of, commenting that the display looked like it was intended for\na media photo opportunity. Norris was subsequently asked to testify before a\nsubcommittee of the state legislature about the contraband discovered in the unit.\n\n        Several months later, on June 9, 1995, Campbell terminated assistant warden\nPitts for breaches of security, falsification of information, and unsatisfactory work\nperformance. During the time the position of warden was vacant, Pitts had been the top\nofficial at Tucker and much of the contraband could have been introduced during this\nperiod. Pitts filed a grievance challenging his termination, and Campbell testified at the\nPitts hearing on November 1, 1995 that the action had been taken on the\n\n                                           -4-\n\frecommendation of ADC Assistant Director Guntharp and Director Norris. During a\nmeeting in October 1995 with Guntharp, Norris, and an ADC attorney, Campbell had\ncommented that Guntharp and Norris had instructed him to fire Pitts while they were\ntogether in a June 6 meeting about contraband and an alleged rape of a death row\ninmate. He testified at the trial in this case that Norris and Guntharp had objected to\nthis comment and that Norris had become very angry. Sometime after the Pitts hearing,\nCampbell learned that Guntharp and Norris had both testified there that they had not\nauthorized Pitts’ termination.         Campbell became concerned about possible\nrepercussions due to the conflict in their testimony and to their reactions at the October\nmeeting.\n\n        Shortly before his demotion in January of 1996, Campbell was appointed to a\nCritical Incident Review Committee (CIRC) which had been established to conduct an\ninternal review of the November 15, 1995 murder of Scott Grimes, a guard in the\nadministrative segregation barracks at Tucker. Grimes had been fatally stabbed by an\ninmate who had escaped from his cell after tampering with the cell door. Long before\nthe killing of Grimes, Campbell had brought the problem with cell doors to the attention\nof Guntharp and Norris. One instance was after another inmate had escaped in the\nsame manner in January of 1995. Guntharp did not proceed with a program to alter the\ndoors to prevent escape until after Grimes’ murder, however. At the first CIRC\nmeeting Campbell announced his intention to discuss his concerns about the cell doors\nand other security issues at Tucker. Campbell was unable to do so, however, because\nhe was demoted and transferred on the day that the next CIRC meeting was scheduled\nto take place. The CIRC never made a recommendation to management concerning\ndefective cell doors, although it did look into cell door maintenance at Tucker as part\nof its review.\n\n       On several occasions before Campbell’s demotion and transfer, Guntharp and\nNorris complained to him about the amount of media attention the maximum security\nunit was receiving and the pressure on them from the governor’s office and the state\n\n                                           -5-\n\flegislature to do something about it. After the contraband was discovered, Campbell\nwas sought out for interviews. He referred the requests to the ADC public information\nofficer, and one interview was approved. Guntharp instructed him “to be pretty\ngoddamned careful” about what he said to the media, not to “volunteer anything,” and\n“to keep it simple” because he and Norris did not want “any of this coming out right\nnow.” Both Guntharp and Norris told Campbell on several occasions that the ADC\nwas getting negative publicity and that they wanted him to keep the media out of\nTucker while the unit was being cleaned up. During the time that the media attention\nwas especially intense, Norris and Guntharp regularly discussed the public scrutiny and\nnegative publicity at management team meetings. Campbell testified that he was afraid\nhe would be fired if he ever spoke to a member of the press. When he discovered a jar\nof flammable liquid in one of the cells on death row in December 1995, he notified\nGuntharp about it and said that he was trying to find the source. Guntharp called\nCampbell into his office and told him he was overreacting to the discovery. He also\ntold him that he needed to get the media out of Tucker and that “the director and myself\nare catching a lot of media flak and the governor’s office is on us also.”\n\n        On January 17, 1996, Guntharp called Campbell into his office and notified him\nthat he was being reassigned to be assistant warden of the Varner Unit. Campbell had\npreviously been warden at Varner, and Guntharp explained that a management decision\nhad been made to demote him and cut his salary by eight percent. Guntharp stated that\nthe action was not a disciplinary matter arising under the ADC Administrative\nRegulation 225 (AR 225). This regulation contains employee conduct standards for the\nADC and progressive disciplinary steps that can be taken if the standards are violated.\nCampbell testified at trial that he had never heard of a demotion at the ADC unless it\ninvolved AR 225. Guntharp admitted at trial that no progressive action had been taken\nagainst Campbell before he was demoted. A transcript of the meeting at which\nGuntharp informed Campbell of his demotion and transfer reveals that Guntharp\ncriticized him at this meeting for being unable to keep the media out of Tucker. After\nthe meeting, however, Guntharp sent Campbell a memo stating that he had “lost the\n\n                                          -6-\n\frapport and support of the staff” necessary for the successful operation of Tucker and\nthat he was being transferred for his “own health and safety and the health and safety\nof the staff.”\n\n       Campbell filed a grievance in February challenging his demotion and transfer as\na “form of retaliation” and alleging that he should have been disciplined under AR 225\nbefore being demoted. He was informed by Jane Manning, the ADC Grievance\nOfficer, that the same grievance procedure available in AR 225 cases would apply to\nhim. Nine days after the grievance was filed, Guntharp sent a memorandum to Norris,\noutlining a history of problems Guntharp claimed he had had with Campbell’s\nmanagement skills in various positions with the ADC beginning in 1990. Norris\nadmitted at trial that he had been informed in advance about Guntharp’s decision to\ntransfer Campbell and that he had given his approval. Campbell did not receive a copy\nof Guntharp’s February memorandum until the grievance hearing on May 15, 1996.\nGuntharp had never mentioned to him any of the complaints listed in the memo, and\nneither the memo nor Guntharp’s related notes were ever placed in Campbell’s\npersonnel file.\n\n        Campbell’s grievance hearing on May 15 was conducted by Director Norris even\nthough he had been actively involved in some of the underlying events. He had\nfirsthand knowledge of Campbell’s actions as warden of Tucker, had himself expressed\nconcerns about negative publicity concerning the conditions at Tucker, had exhibited\na difference with Campbell over testimony at the Pitts hearing, and had been informed\nabout and approved Guntharp’s demotion decision in advance. Campbell objected to\nNorris acting as hearing officer and requested a panel hearing instead, but his request\nwas denied. Campbell testified that he then told Jane Manning that he might call Norris\nas a witness. She said she would look into whether Norris would be able to testify as\nwell as hear the grievance, but she never got back to Campbell. Campbell notified\nNorris at the outset of the hearing that he wanted to call him as a witness, but Norris\nsaid he could not testify since he was presiding.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       At the hearing Campbell claimed that there had been no appropriate basis for his\ndemotion, that the action taken against him did not conform to AR 225, and that he was\nbeing unfairly blamed for the conditions at Tucker and retaliated against for calling\nattention to them and for his testimony at the Pitts hearing. He sought reinstatement\nand back pay. Campbell was represented by counsel, and the hearing lasted\napproximately two hours. Campbell and Guntharp both testified,3 but the transcript\ndoes not show that they were sworn to tell the truth. Campbell was unable to subpoena\nadditional witnesses. Five exhibits were introduced, including Guntharp’s February\nmemo. Norris did not state any decision at the hearing, but he wrote a four paragraph\nletter to Campbell six days later on May 21. In the letter Norris stated that he\nunderstood Campbell’s claim to be that he had been demoted in retaliation for\nuncovering contraband evidence and other security lapses while he was warden at\nTucker. Norris said he had seen no evidence of retaliation and was “compelled to\nuphold Mr. Guntharp’s decision” which he believed was “correct.”\n\n        After Campbell was demoted to assistant warden of the Varner Unit, warden\nRick Toney gave him a performance evaluation of 300 for 1996. Campbell questioned\nit, and Toney raised it by ninety four points, which was still six points below the rating\nneeded for a one and a half percent pay increase. Two employees were featured\nanonymously on the local news in March 1997 after a gang riot at Varner. They were\ncritical of the ADC administration, and Guntharp asked Toney to find out who they\nwere. Meanwhile, Campbell arranged a meeting with Norris and an ADC attorney to\ndiscuss concerns he had about security at Varner. When Toney learned in August 1997\nthat Campbell had criticized him at the meeting, he placed Campbell on one year\nprobation for not following the chain of command even though Campbell had given\nToney advance notice of the meeting. Toney also commented that Campbell’s\n\n      3\n        Manning also testified briefly, but she declined to comment on the underlying\nfacts. According to ADC policy the grievance officer could only be called to testify if\nshe had “caused the action, ha[d] direct first party knowledge of the action, or\nwitnesse[d] the action which [was] the subject of the matter being grieved.”\n\n                                           -8-\n\fcriticisms were similar to those that had been expressed anonymously on the local\nnews.\n\n\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Campbell brought this action, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Ark. Code Ann. § 16-\n123-105,4 approximately one month after Norris wrote the letter denying his grievance.\nCampbell sued the ADC, Norris, Guntharp, and Manning, alleging that his demotion\nand transfer violated his constitutional rights to freedom of expression and due process\nand entitled him to compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.5 The\ndefendants moved for summary judgment on the merits of the claims and asserted\nabsolute immunity under the eleventh amendment. Norris, Guntharp, and Manning also\nclaimed qualified immunity in their individual capacities. The district court did not\ngrant qualified immunity because of a disputed issue of material fact as to whether\nCampbell had been demoted in retaliation for commenting on issues of public concern,\nbut it did grant eleventh amendment immunity to the ADC. Eleventh amendment\nimmunity was denied on the claims for injunctive relief against the individual\ndefendants in their official capacities.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        Arkansas Code § 16-123-105 is modeled on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and is to be\nconstrued consistently with the federal statute. See Ark. Code Ann. § 16-123-105(c).\nIt permits suits for violations under color of state or local law of “any rights, privileges,\nor immunities secured by the Arkansas Constitution.” Id. § 16-123-105(a).\n       5\n       Campbell also pled a constructive discharge claim, alleging that he had been\nwrongfully discharged from his position as warden of the Tucker Unit when he was\ndemoted and that the defendants’ actions were intended to force him to resign from the\nADC. The district court did not instruct the jury on the constructive or wrongful\ndischarge claim or submit a claim for punitive damages.\n\n                                            -9-\n\f        The case went to trial, and at the close of Campbell’s evidence the remaining\ndefendants moved for judgment as a matter of law as to all claims and reasserted their\nqualified immunity defense. The district court dismissed the claims against Manning\non the ground that Campbell had not shown that any of her actions rose to the level of\na constitutional violation. The court indicated it would continue to consider the legal\nobjections to the due process claim, but that it would submit the claim to the jury in the\nmeantime.6 The motion for judgment was denied as to Campbell’s free speech claim\nand the qualified immunity defenses. The defense motions were renewed at the close\nof all the evidence, and the court ruled similarly again.\n\n       The jury returned a verdict in Campbell’s favor on the free speech and due\nprocess claims and awarded him $94,000 for back pay and compensation for mental\nand emotional distress, humiliation, and loss of reputation. A hearing was held on the\npetition for injunctive relief, and the court ordered the defendants to reinstate Campbell\nto his former position as warden at Tucker with the same salary level, to remove him\nfrom probationary status, to remove derogatory letters from warden Toney that were\nin his personnel file, and to conduct an evaluation of Campbell’s work for 1995.\nJudgment was entered, and eleven days later it was amended to add an award of\n$74,000 in front pay as an alternative to reinstatement. Norris and Guntharp, the only\nremaining defendants, filed a post trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or for\na new trial. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that they were not entitled\nto qualified immunity and that there was “ample evidence that the defendants were\nunhappy with the ‘bad press’ resulting from [Campbell’s] public exposure of the lax\nconditions he found upon his arrival as warden” at Tucker and that the purported reason\nfor the demotion, poor job performance, was pretextual.\n\n\n\n      6\n        In its comments the court suggested that Campbell had a property interest in the\nwarden position and may have been denied due process by not receiving proper notice\nof the asserted basis for the decision to demote him.\n\n                                          -10-\n\f       Norris and Guntharp appeal from the amended judgment of the district court and\nfrom the denial of their post trial motion. They again seek entry of judgment in their\nfavor or a new trial. They argue that Campbell’s speech did not address matters of\npublic concern because it was directed to internal panels of ADC employees and that\nthere was no evidence that Norris and Guntharp knew about his intended statements\nto the CIRC. They also argue that his free speech claim is precluded by Norris’\nstatement after the grievance hearing that no evidence of retaliation had been shown.\nThey argue that he cannot succeed with his due process claim because he was an at will\nemployee and had no property interest in the warden position and no liberty interest\naffected by his transfer. Even if he had any protected interest, he was provided all the\nprocess to which he was due and any such interest was not clearly established at the\ntime of his transfer. They also claim they are entitled to eleventh amendment and\nqualified immunity and that front pay is not available because it would only serve to\nredress a past injury. If they are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, they\nshould receive a new trial because the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\ngive their business judgment instruction to the jury and committed plain error by\nreferring to some defense evidence as “farfetched.”\n\n       Campbell did not appeal the decisions adverse to him dismissing some of his\nclaims and two of the defendants, and he argues that the appeal of Norris and Guntharp\nis without merit. He says that his speech about inadequate security conditions and\ncorruption at Tucker clearly addressed matters of public concern and there was\nsufficient evidence that he was demoted in retaliation for it. He contends that the\nunlawfulness of a retaliatory demotion under such circumstances was clearly\nestablished so there can be no qualified immunity on this claim. Campbell also argues\nthat he had a property interest in the warden position created by AR 225 and that his\nefforts to clean up the Tucker Unit affected the public good and thus fit the public\npolicy exception to the Arkansas at will doctrine. He says that the decision not to use\nthe business judgment instruction was within the court’s discretion, that it was\nunsupported by the evidence, and that the instructions adequately reflected the\n\n                                          -11-\n\fapplicable law. Finally, Campbell contends that the denial of eleventh amendment\nimmunity to appellants was proper, that the front pay award was an appropriate\nalternative remedy, and that the court’s comment on the evidence was in response to\na relevance objection and not plain error.\n\n\n\n\n                                          III.\n\n      Denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo. See\nCurtis v. Electronics & Space Corp., 113 F.3d 1498, 1502 (8th Cir. 1997). It is\nassumed that the jury resolved all conflicts in the evidence in favor of its verdict and\nthat all facts were proved which the nonmoving party’s evidence tended to show. See\nRyther, 108 F.3d at 844. Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when there\nis a complete absence of probative facts to support the verdict such that no reasonable\njuror could have found for the prevailing party. See Curtis, 113 F.3d at 1502.\n\n                                          A.\n\n      To establish a retaliatory demotion in violation of the first amendment a public\nemployee must show that his speech was protected and that it was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in the adverse employment action taken against him. See Mt. Healthy\nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977). A public employee’s\nexpression is protected when it addresses a matter of public concern, and this is\n“determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the\nwhole record.” Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147-48 (1983). From the time he\narrived at the Tucker Unit, Campbell reported breaches in security and unsafe\nconditions to Guntharp and Norris. He sought adjustments to cell doors, hazardous pay\nfor his workers, and other measures to improve security. He had difficulty getting\ncooperation from his superiors.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f        The proper functioning of a maximum security prison with death sentenced\nprisoners is a matter of significant concern to the larger community, as are the existence\nof corruption and dangerous working conditions in a prison and inmate access to tools,\nweapons, and flammable substances that could facilitate violence and escape. See\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 146 (protected expression is that which can be “fairly considered\nas relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community”). There\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Norris and Guntharp demoted Campbell\nbecause they blamed him for publicizing these kinds of problems at Tucker. There was\nevidence of their unhappiness about media attention to the prison conditions and the\nresulting pressure on them from the governor’s office and legislature. In their\ninteraction with Campbell and other staff, they emphasized keeping the media away in\norder to avoid negative publicity about the prison and its administration. Guntharp and\nNorris reprimanded Campbell for the way he called attention to policy violations and\nsecurity breaches, particularly the flow of dangerous contraband into the prison. Much\nof the evidence appellants now rely on concerning Campbell’s alleged performance\nproblems may have been manufactured after the fact. Campbell had previously received\nhigh performance ratings from Guntharp while serving as warden of a different prison,\nand no criticisms of his managerial skills appeared in his personnel file. Defendants\nrelied heavily on criticisms first stated in writing in a memorandum Guntharp wrote after\nCampbell had filed the grievance challenging his demotion. All of this evidence tended\n“to undermine the . . . proffered reason for” demoting Campbell, “and thus to establish\nthat it was a pretext.” Stemmons v. Missouri Dept. of Corrections, 82 F.3d 817, 821\n(8th Cir. 1996).\n\n       Appellants argue that activities Campbell characterized as protected conduct,\nparticularly his testimony at the Pitts grievance hearing, involved the internal affairs of\nthe ADC and that he was acting as an employee on “matters only of personal interest.”\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 147 (“absent the most unusual circumstances,” federal court will\nnot review personnel decision when public employee speaks as “an employee upon\nmatters only of personal interest”). Campbell’s communications addressed the safety\n\n                                          -13-\n\fof prison employees and the surrounding community, however, as well as the overall\neffectiveness of the prison unit. These are all matters well beyond the procedural\ntechnicalities of prison administration or personnel matters of particular concern to him\nas an individual. Cf. id. at 148-49 (individual employee complaints over internal office\naffairs and her transfer not matters of public concern). Campbell brought to the\nattention of Guntharp a problem with cell doors in the unit that went uncorrected and\nultimately led to the escape of an inmate who fatally stabbed a prison guard. He was\nalso responsible for the discovery and disclosure of an unprecedented amount of\ndangerous contraband.\n\n        Campbell’s efforts to bring these conditions to light, particularly after his\nsupervisors failed to respond to the problems and treated him as overreacting to the\nsituation, were relevant to whether the ADC and its administrators were “discharging\n[their] governmental responsibilities” and whether department employees were engaged\nin “actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust.” Connick, 461 U.S. at 148\n(showing circumstances when internal events within a public office are a matter of\npublic concern).7 Campbell’s testimony that Norris and Guntharp sought to influence\nwhat he would say at the Pitts grievance hearing could have been considered by the jury\nas additional evidence that the defendants wished to limit his speech concerning these\ntopics. That hearing involved Campbell’s termination of an employee whose\nmismanagement was believed to be partly responsible for the conditions at Tucker.\n\n\n\n      7\n        Appellants do not attempt to argue that their interest in promoting the efficiency\nof the prison system outweighs any interest of Campbell in commenting on prison\nsecurity and corruption. See Pickering v. Board of Educ. Township High Sch. Dist.\n205, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968). They argue instead that his speech did not fit within\nthe definition of public concern. The Pickering balancing test would not work to their\nadvantage since Campbell’s criticisms actually addressed the ADC interest in running\nthe prison in an effective and safe manner, and there was no evidence that the media\nattention created unrest or any other security risks at Tucker.\n\n                                          -14-\n\f       Norris and Guntharp also contend that Campbell’s first amendment claim should\nfail because he made no effort to communicate his speech to the public, and they point\nout that he says he never initiated any contact with the press. Contacting the media is\nnot necessary for a public employee’s comments to be on matters of public concern,\nhowever. See id. at 146. Complaints to superiors or private communications with an\nemployer about matters of public concern are also protected under the first amendment.\nSee Givhan v. Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist., 439 U.S. 410, 415-16 (1979); see also\nPowell v. Basham, 921 F.2d 165, 167 (8th Cir. 1990) (deputy sheriff’s comments to\nsuperiors about concerns that touched on department operations and efficiency involved\nmatters of public concern). Moreover, Campbell was interviewed by the news media\nconcerning the conditions at the Tucker Unit, and Norris and Guntharp criticized him\non more than one occasion for permitting the intense media coverage of the unit to\ncontinue. The jury could have relied on these facts to find that his speech was directed\nboth to his employer and to the public.\n\n        Norris and Guntharp also assert that there was no evidence that they knew that\nCampbell intended to criticize their response to dangerous conditions in the maximum\nsecurity unit when he was involved in the CIRC. The CIRC had been created to look\ninto the Grimes murder, and there was evidence that Norris and Guntharp were aware\nat the time that Campbell had spoken out about the cell door defect that made Grimes’\nmurder possible and that they believed Campbell called too much attention to such\nsecurity problems. The jury could have inferred from this evidence that they suspected\nCampbell would bring these matters up before the committee or knew that he had\nannounced at the first meeting that he intended to discuss these topics. His transfer on\nthe very day that the CIRC was next scheduled to meet would support such an\ninference. In any event Campbell did not need to show that they knew what he intended\nto report to the CIRC in order to succeed on his first amendment claim. There was\nsufficient evidence that they believed that his general outspokenness on security and\ncorruption encouraged media criticism of ADC management. When Guntharp notified\nCampbell of his demotion, he specifically criticized him for not being able to\n\n                                         -15-\n\fkeep the media out of his unit. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, a reasonable fact finder could infer that the decision to demote Campbell was\nmotivated by his speech on security problems. See Engle v. Townsley, 49 F.3d 1321,\n1324 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Norris and Guntharp argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the first\namendment claim. Government officials are immune from personal liability for civil\ndamages “insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Appellants do not contest that the law prohibiting\nadverse employment actions in retaliation for a public employee’s free speech was\nclearly established at the time. See Connick, 461 U.S. at 142; Pickering, 391 U.S. at\n574. They do argue that it was not clearly established that Campbell’s particular type\nof communication was protected as dealing with matters of public concern. This\nargument turns on whether a reasonable person would have known that Campbell’s\ndemotion and transfer violated a clearly established right if it was in retaliation for his\nspeech about prison conditions. See Engle, 49 F.3d at 1323 (citing Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987)). The verdict shows that the jury found Campbell\nspoke out on such matters as security breaches, contraband, malfunctioning cell doors,\nand corruption and that this speech caused the defendants to transfer and demote him.\nIt was clearly established at the time that prison security and prison operations are\nmatters of public concern, and Campbell’s right to bring these problems to light, both\nwithin the department and in a manner that attracted media attention, was also clearly\nestablished. See Powell, 921 F.2d at 167 (criticism to sheriff of department operations\nwas clearly established free speech right). A reasonable person would have known that\nretaliating against Campbell for exercising his free speech rights on such matters of\npublic concern would clearly violate his constitutional rights. Norris and Guntharp are\nnot entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f        Norris and Guntharp also argue that Campbell is precluded by collateral estoppel\nfrom proving retaliation in this case because Norris said he found no evidence of\nretaliation after the ADC grievance hearing.8 The findings of fact from a state\nadministrative proceeding are entitled to preclusive effect “provided that the [state]\nagency was acting in a judicial capacity, the questions litigated were properly before the\nagency judge, and the parties had an adequate opportunity to litigate them.” Alexander\nv. Pathfinder, Inc., 91 F.3d 59, 62 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing University of Tennessee v.\nElliott, 478 U.S. 788, 797-99 (1986). Issue preclusion does not apply with equal force\nto all administrative proceedings, however. See Hamilton v. Arkansas Pollution Control\n& Ecology Comm’n, 969 S.W.2d 653, 656 (Ark. 1998) (citing Arkansas Memorial\nGardens, Inc. v. Simpson, 381 S.W.2d 462, 464 (Ark. 1964)).\n\n       Campbell’s grievance hearing was not sufficiently like a judicial proceeding for\nNorris’ statement about the evidence to be given preclusive effect in this case. The\nhearing was held before Norris and took place in his office. Norris was Director of the\nDepartment of Corrections and the individual to whom Campbell’s supervisor reported,\nand he had been personally involved with some of the underlying events. He had\nfirsthand knowledge of much of the background prior to the hearing, yet was\nunavailable for Campbell to produce as a witness. He had given advance approval to\nthe decision to demote Campbell, and the key issue was the appropriateness of this\ndecision. He was not in a similar position to a typical administrative law judge, and the\ndepartment hearing also did not provide an adequate opportunity to develop the\nevidence. Campbell was unable to subpoena witnesses, and he and Guntharp were not\nsworn. The hearing lasted only two hours. In his letter finding the demotion decision\nto have been correct, Norris stated that Guntharp had demoted Campbell because of\n\n      8\n         In his letter giving his decision rejecting Campbell’s appeal of his transfer,\nNorris stated that he found “no evidence that your demotion was pretextual or done in\nretaliation.” In his previous sentence he had described Campbell’s grievance as being\nthat his demotion was “pretextual and in retaliation for the uncovering of contraband\nevidence and other security lapses.”\n\n                                          -17-\n\fa deteriorating situation at Tucker rather than in retaliation for uncovering security\nlapses, but he did not mention the argument Campbell made at the hearing that\nGuntharp had demoted him for generating media attention even though Guntharp spoke\nat the hearing about his unhappiness with the contraband display. His brief decision\nletter did not refer to this part of the grievance and did not make detailed findings of fact\nand conclusions of law. The situation here is completely unlike the cases cited by\nappellants on the issue of preclusion. See Elliott, 478 U.S. at 791 n.2; Alexander, 91\nF.3d at 62.\n\n       There was sufficient evidence to support liability against both Norris and\nGuntharp on Campbell’s first amendment claim, and for the reasons discussed they are\nnot entitled to judgment as a matter of law on it. They do not challenge the amount of\ncompensatory damages awarded by the jury or claim they are not recoverable under the\nfirst amendment. The case was submitted on verdict forms which first asked the jury\nto indicate its ultimate findings on the first amendment claim and on the due process\nclaim. The jury was then instructed that it should find the amount of plaintiff’s damages\nin accordance with Instruction 9 if it found in favor of the plaintiff on either claim.\nInstruction 9 provided that damages could include any back pay, mental and emotional\ndistress, humiliation, and loss of reputation suffered by Campbell as a result of his\ndemotion and transfer. Since the verdict in favor of Campbell and the damages awarded\nare supported by the evidence and the law as to his first amendment claim, it is not\nnecessary to discuss his due process claim.9 See Hinkle v. Christensen, 733 F.2d 74,\n76 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\n                                             B.\n\n\n       9\n       We note that Campbell has not pointed to any express provision that an ADC\nwarden can only be demoted or dismissed for cause so it is questionable that he can\nmake out a property interest in the position. See Black v. Barnett, 999 F.2d 1295, 1296\n(8th Cir. 1993); Drake v. Scott, 823 F.2d 239, 241-42 (8th Cir. 1987).\n\n                                           -18-\n\f       In support of their alternate request for a new trial appellants contend that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by refusing to include their business judgment\ninstruction in its explanation of the law on the retaliation claim. The court instructed the\njury that its verdict would have to be for the defendants if it found that they would have\ndemoted Campbell regardless of his free speech activities, but it declined to add the\nrequested instruction that the jury could not decide for Campbell just because it “might\ndisagree with [defendants’] decision or believe it to be harsh or unreasonable.” A\nbusiness judgment instruction has been recognized as sometimes appropriate for a first\namendment retaliation claim. See Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions\n(Civil) § 5.71 notes on use (1998). A district court has broad discretion in instructing\nthe jury, however. See Gray v. Bicknell, 86 F.3d 1472, 1485 (8th Cir. 1996). The\ninstructions must be considered as a whole in considering any challenge. See Slathar\nv. Sather Trucking Corp., 78 F.3d 415, 418 (8th Cir. 1996); Resolution Trust Corp. v.\nEason, 17 F.3d 1126, 1132 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n       Given the evidence and the instructions viewed as a whole, we find the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in declining to give the particular instruction requested\nby the defendants. The substance of defendants’ business judgment theory was covered\nby the court’s instructions and argued by counsel in opening and closing, and defendants\nhad the opportunity to present evidence supporting their asserted reasons for the\ndemotion. See Stemmons, 82 F.3d at 821 (no abuse of discretion when defendant able\nto argue and present evidence on its business judgment theory). The defendants have\nnot shown they were prejudiced by the refusal to give their business judgment\ninstruction and any error was harmless in light of the ample evidence that Campbell was\ndemoted for exercising his free speech rights. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\f        Appellants also argue that the district court committed plain error by its comment\nduring the testimony of a defense witness.10 The witness was called at the start of the\nlast day of trial and testified that he had heard Campbell make an inappropriate\ncomment in 1990 about the Arkansas Parole Board and that he once had trouble getting\nhim to send a file for a parolee transfer. The witness began a lengthy description of the\ncontext in which he needed the file, and Campbell’s counsel raised a relevance\nobjection. The court initially sustained it, but opposing counsel argued that the\nexplanation was relevant because the witness ultimately had to contact Guntharp to get\nthe file. The court then allowed the testimony to go forward, saying: “Well, go ahead\nand let’s see where it leads, but this seems awful farfetched. In fact, all this testimony\nseems to me to be pretty farfetched, but go ahead.”\n\n        Appellants argue that this comment undermined their entire defense concerning\nCampbell’s history of performance problems. The court made the comment in the\ncourse of reconsidering an evidentiary ruling, and it does not appear to have been\n“intended or calculated to disparage [a party] in the eyes of the jury and to prevent the\njury from exercising an impartial judgment upon the merits.” La Barge Water Well\nSupply Co. v. United States, 325 F.2d 798, 802 (8th Cir. 1963). Under plain error\nreview it would be “grounds for reversal only if [it] prejudices the substantial rights of\na party and would result in a miscarriage of justice if left uncorrected.” Rush v. Smith,\n56 F.3d 918, 922 (8th Cir. 1995) (en banc). The comment addressed the relevance of\nthe testimony and warned counsel that it was on the borderline of admissibility. It was\nquite clearly directed at the particular witness who was testifying, rather than to the\ndefense case in general, and the entire testimony of the witness, including the argument\nof counsel, covered only six pages of transcript. Appellants have not shown they are\nentitled to a new trial on this basis.\n\n\n\n      10\n       Appellants concede that the comment can only be reviewed for plain error\nbecause they failed to object to it at the time.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f                                           C.\n\n       Norris and Guntharp challenge certain aspects of the equitable relief on eleventh\namendment grounds. They assert a right in their official capacities to the same absolute\nimmunity from injunctive relief under § 1983 to which the ADC was entitled as a\nsovereign state agency. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66\n(1989). The district court correctly ruled, however, that they may be sued in their\nofficial capacities for prospective, injunctive relief. See Blanciak v. Allegheny Ludlum\nCorp., 77 F.3d 690, 697 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 166-68\n(1908)); Freeman V. Michigan Dept. of State, 808 F.2d 1174, 1179 (6th Cir. 1987)\n(same). They also contend that the alternative award of front pay against them in their\nofficial capacities would violate the eleventh amendment. When reinstatement is not\npossible, front pay is generally an appropriate alternative equitable remedy. See\nStandley v. Chilhowee R-IV Sch. Dist., 5 F.3d 319, 322 (8th Cir. 1993). For purposes\nof the eleventh amendment, however, front pay is not analogous to the prospective relief\npermitted under Ex parte Young because it “must be paid from public funds in the state\ntreasury.” Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974). The alternative front pay\naward is therefore barred by the eleventh amendment. See Blanciak, 77 F.3d at 697;\nFreeman, 808 F.2d at 1179; see also Grantham v. Trickey, 21 F.3d 289, 296 n.5 (8th\nCir. 1994).\n\n       For other reasons it is unclear whether the remaining injunctive relief ordered by\nthe district court is still appropriate. The judgment contains orders to reinstate\nCampbell as warden at Tucker with the same salary level, to remove him from his one\nyear probation, to remove certain letters from his personnel file, and to perform an\nevaluation of his work for 1995. Subsequent to oral argument appellants’ counsel\ninformed this court that Campbell has given formal written notice that he would resign\nfrom the ADC on August 3, 1998 and that his physician would release him from care\non that date. A copy of Campbell’s short letter of resignation has also been submitted;\nit does not give his reasons. At this time we can only speculate whether his\n\n                                         -21-\n\fcircumstances have changed in such a way that future employment with the ADC or as\nwarden of Tucker may no longer be a viable remedy. It is also unclear whether portions\nof the order relating to his probation and evaluation may now be moot. The case must\ntherefore be remanded for further consideration of these issues relating to the injunctive\nrelief originally ordered by the court.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n       After reviewing the record we affirm all aspects of the judgment except for the\naward of equitable relief. As to that portion of the judgment, we reverse the award of\nfront pay and remand the other portions of the order for injunctive relief for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             ATTEST:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f",

The prison system had a number of separate correctional\ninstitutions, and the Tucker Unit contained the system’s death row, as well as inmates\nwho had been placed in administrative segregation due to violent behavior. Campbell\nhad begun his career as a correctional sergeant and had worked his way up to be\nwarden of the Varner Unit by 1993. The Varner Unit housed a younger population and\nsome maximum security inmates and featured education and vocational programs. The\nDirector of the Arkansas Department of Correction (ADC) was Larry Norris. Assistant\nDirector G. David Guntharp reported directly to Norris, and he was the official who\nappointed Campbell warden at Tucker.\n\n      Guntharp had consistently given Campbell high annual performance evaluation\nratings, and part of the reason he offered him the Tucker position was because he\nbelieved Campbell was strong on policy. Campbell was regarded by others in the\nsystem as meticulous in his implementation of ADC policies and procedures. The\nprevious warden at Tucker had been demoted for leaving the institution to gamble while\non duty, and the prison had been run in the interim by Tom Pitts, the assistant warden.\nGuntharp encouraged Campbell to accept the appointment as an opportunity to broaden\nhis warden experience. From the time of his appointment in September, Campbell\nspent one day a week at Tucker and moved there from Varner full time in January\n1995.\n\n        When Campbell arrived at Tucker he was faced with morale and turnover\nproblems and numerous vacant staff positions. He saw that changes needed to be\nmade, and he set about interviewing Tucker personnel, reviewing existing policies and\nprocedures, and investigating how money came to be missing from the Employee\nCorporation Fund. Illegal contraband was moving into and within the prison so he\ninstituted policies to search all staff, including himself, upon entry to death row and to\nconduct random searches of inmate cells. He also updated the orders and duties\nassociated with each officer’s post. Through his investigation he learned there were\nsecurity breaches at Tucker, including unlocked cell doors, overheated control panels\n\n                                           -3-\n\ffor cell door operation, and cell doors which had been altered so that inmates were able\nto open them. He reported these conditions, and the steps he had taken in response, to\nGuntharp and Norris. He also submitted recommendations on how to correct the\nproblems with cell doors and sought a hazardous pay increase for Tucker employees\nand additional security equipment.\n\n      Campbell ordered a “shakedown” for February 14, 1995, which is a\ncomprehensive search of inmate cells. The shakedown revealed there was contraband\non the death row complex at Tucker. The contraband included hammers, chisels,\nshanks, gunpowder, hacksaw blades, wire cutters, glass jars, exacto knives, civilian\nclothes, marijuana, syringes, paint thinner, and photographs of inmates cohabitating.\nThe search also discovered cell windows which were being enlarged to permit escape\nand a missing cinder block adjoining two cells. It was undisputed at trial that the\ncontraband had been introduced before Campbell took over full time as warden of the\nmaximum security unit.\n\n        Intense media attention followed the discovery of the death row contraband.\nCampbell believed that Guntharp and Norris blamed him for the attention, but he\ntestified at trial that he had not initiated any media contact. On one occasion Guntharp\ncriticized Campbell for the way the contraband had been displayed and photographed\nbefore it was disposed of, commenting that the display looked like it was intended for\na media photo opportunity. Norris was subsequently asked to testify before a\nsubcommittee of the state legislature about the contraband discovered in the unit.\n\n        Several months later, on June 9, 1995, Campbell terminated assistant warden\nPitts for breaches of security, falsification of information, and unsatisfactory work\nperformance. During the time the position of warden was vacant, Pitts had been the top\nofficial at Tucker and much of the contraband could have been introduced during this\nperiod. Pitts filed a grievance challenging his termination, and Campbell testified at the\nPitts hearing on November 1, 1995 that the action had been taken on the\n\n                                           -4-\n\frecommendation of ADC Assistant Director Guntharp and Director Norris. During a\nmeeting in October 1995 with Guntharp, Norris, and an ADC attorney, Campbell had\ncommented that Guntharp and Norris had instructed him to fire Pitts while they were\ntogether in a June 6 meeting about contraband and an alleged rape of a death row\ninmate. He testified at the trial in this case that Norris and Guntharp had objected to\nthis comment and that Norris had become very angry. Sometime after the Pitts hearing,\nCampbell learned that Guntharp and Norris had both testified there that they had not\nauthorized Pitts’ termination.         Campbell became concerned about possible\nrepercussions due to the conflict in their testimony and to their reactions at the October\nmeeting.\n\n        Shortly before his demotion in January of 1996, Campbell was appointed to a\nCritical Incident Review Committee (CIRC) which had been established to conduct an\ninternal review of the November 15, 1995 murder of Scott Grimes, a guard in the\nadministrative segregation barracks at Tucker. Grimes had been fatally stabbed by an\ninmate who had escaped from his cell after tampering with the cell door. Long before\nthe killing of Grimes, Campbell had brought the problem with cell doors to the attention\nof Guntharp and Norris. One instance was after another inmate had escaped in the\nsame manner in January of 1995. Guntharp did not proceed with a program to alter the\ndoors to prevent escape until after Grimes’ murder, however. At the first CIRC\nmeeting Campbell announced his intention to discuss his concerns about the cell doors\nand other security issues at Tucker. Campbell was unable to do so, however, because\nhe was demoted and transferred on the day that the next CIRC meeting was scheduled\nto take place. The CIRC never made a recommendation to management concerning\ndefective cell doors, although it did look into cell door maintenance at Tucker as part\nof its review.\n\n       On several occasions before Campbell’s demotion and transfer, Guntharp and\nNorris complained to him about the amount of media attention the maximum security\nunit was receiving and the pressure on them from the governor’s office and the state\n\n                                           -5-\n\flegislature to do something about it. After the contraband was discovered, Campbell\nwas sought out for interviews. He referred the requests to the ADC public information\nofficer, and one interview was approved. Guntharp instructed him “to be pretty\ngoddamned careful” about what he said to the media, not to “volunteer anything,” and\n“to keep it simple” because he and Norris did not want “any of this coming out right\nnow.” Both Guntharp and Norris told Campbell on several occasions that the ADC\nwas getting negative publicity and that they wanted him to keep the media out of\nTucker while the unit was being cleaned up. During the time that the media attention\nwas especially intense, Norris and Guntharp regularly discussed the public scrutiny and\nnegative publicity at management team meetings. Campbell testified that he was afraid\nhe would be fired if he ever spoke to a member of the press. When he discovered a jar\nof flammable liquid in one of the cells on death row in December 1995, he notified\nGuntharp about it and said that he was trying to find the source. Guntharp called\nCampbell into his office and told him he was overreacting to the discovery. He also\ntold him that he needed to get the media out of Tucker and that “the director and myself\nare catching a lot of media flak and the governor’s office is on us also.”\n\n        On January 17, 1996, Guntharp called Campbell into his office and notified him\nthat he was being reassigned to be assistant warden of the Varner Unit. Campbell had\npreviously been warden at Varner, and Guntharp explained that a management decision\nhad been made to demote him and cut his salary by eight percent. Guntharp stated that\nthe action was not a disciplinary matter arising under the ADC Administrative\nRegulation 225 (AR 225). This regulation contains employee conduct standards for the\nADC and progressive disciplinary steps that can be taken if the standards are violated.\nCampbell testified at trial that he had never heard of a demotion at the ADC unless it\ninvolved AR 225. Guntharp admitted at trial that no progressive action had been taken\nagainst Campbell before he was demoted. A transcript of the meeting at which\nGuntharp informed Campbell of his demotion and transfer reveals that Guntharp\ncriticized him at this meeting for being unable to keep the media out of Tucker. After\nthe meeting, however, Guntharp sent Campbell a memo stating that he had “lost the\n\n                                          -6-\n\frapport and support of the staff” necessary for the successful operation of Tucker and\nthat he was being transferred for his “own health and safety and the health and safety\nof the staff.”\n\n       Campbell filed a grievance in February challenging his demotion and transfer as\na “form of retaliation” and alleging that he should have been disciplined under AR 225\nbefore being demoted. He was informed by Jane Manning, the ADC Grievance\nOfficer, that the same grievance procedure available in AR 225 cases would apply to\nhim. Nine days after the grievance was filed, Guntharp sent a memorandum to Norris,\noutlining a history of problems Guntharp claimed he had had with Campbell’s\nmanagement skills in various positions with the ADC beginning in 1990. Norris\nadmitted at trial that he had been informed in advance about Guntharp’s decision to\ntransfer Campbell and that he had given his approval. Campbell did not receive a copy\nof Guntharp’s February memorandum until the grievance hearing on May 15, 1996.\nGuntharp had never mentioned to him any of the complaints listed in the memo, and\nneither the memo nor Guntharp’s related notes were ever placed in Campbell’s\npersonnel file.\n\n        Campbell’s grievance hearing on May 15 was conducted by Director Norris even\nthough he had been actively involved in some of the underlying events. He had\nfirsthand knowledge of Campbell’s actions as warden of Tucker, had himself expressed\nconcerns about negative publicity concerning the conditions at Tucker, had exhibited\na difference with Campbell over testimony at the Pitts hearing, and had been informed\nabout and approved Guntharp’s demotion decision in advance. Campbell objected to\nNorris acting as hearing officer and requested a panel hearing instead, but his request\nwas denied. Campbell testified that he then told Jane Manning that he might call Norris\nas a witness. She said she would look into whether Norris would be able to testify as\nwell as hear the grievance, but she never got back to Campbell. Campbell notified\nNorris at the outset of the hearing that he wanted to call him as a witness, but Norris\nsaid he could not testify since he was presiding.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       At the hearing Campbell claimed that there had been no appropriate basis for his\ndemotion, that the action taken against him did not conform to AR 225, and that he was\nbeing unfairly blamed for the conditions at Tucker and retaliated against for calling\nattention to them and for his testimony at the Pitts hearing. He sought reinstatement\nand back pay. Campbell was represented by counsel, and the hearing lasted\napproximately two hours. Campbell and Guntharp both testified,3 but the transcript\ndoes not show that they were sworn to tell the truth. Campbell was unable to subpoena\nadditional witnesses. Five exhibits were introduced, including Guntharp’s February\nmemo. Norris did not state any decision at the hearing, but he wrote a four paragraph\nletter to Campbell six days later on May 21. In the letter Norris stated that he\nunderstood Campbell’s claim to be that he had been demoted in retaliation for\nuncovering contraband evidence and other security lapses while he was warden at\nTucker. Norris said he had seen no evidence of retaliation and was “compelled to\nuphold Mr. Guntharp’s decision” which he believed was “correct.”\n\n        After Campbell was demoted to assistant warden of the Varner Unit, warden\nRick Toney gave him a performance evaluation of 300 for 1996. Campbell questioned\nit, and Toney raised it by ninety four points, which was still six points below the rating\nneeded for a one and a half percent pay increase. Two employees were featured\nanonymously on the local news in March 1997 after a gang riot at Varner. They were\ncritical of the ADC administration, and Guntharp asked Toney to find out who they\nwere. Meanwhile, Campbell arranged a meeting with Norris and an ADC attorney to\ndiscuss concerns he had about security at Varner. When Toney learned in August 1997\nthat Campbell had criticized him at the meeting, he placed Campbell on one year\nprobation for not following the chain of command even though Campbell had given\nToney advance notice of the meeting. Toney also commented that Campbell’s\n\n      3\n        Manning also testified briefly, but she declined to comment on the underlying\nfacts. According to ADC policy the grievance officer could only be called to testify if\nshe had “caused the action, ha[d] direct first party knowledge of the action, or\nwitnesse[d] the action which [was] the subject of the matter being grieved.”\n\n                                           -8-\n\fcriticisms were similar to those that had been expressed anonymously on the local\nnews.\n\n\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Campbell brought this action, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Ark. Code Ann. § 16-\n123-105,4 approximately one month after Norris wrote the letter denying his grievance.\nCampbell sued the ADC, Norris, Guntharp, and Manning, alleging that his demotion\nand transfer violated his constitutional rights to freedom of expression and due process\nand entitled him to compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.5 The\ndefendants moved for summary judgment on the merits of the claims and asserted\nabsolute immunity under the eleventh amendment. Norris, Guntharp, and Manning also\nclaimed qualified immunity in their individual capacities. The district court did not\ngrant qualified immunity because of a disputed issue of material fact as to whether\nCampbell had been demoted in retaliation for commenting on issues of public concern,\nbut it did grant eleventh amendment immunity to the ADC. Eleventh amendment\nimmunity was denied on the claims for injunctive relief against the individual\ndefendants in their official capacities.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        Arkansas Code § 16-123-105 is modeled on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and is to be\nconstrued consistently with the federal statute. See Ark. Code Ann. § 16-123-105(c).\nIt permits suits for violations under color of state or local law of “any rights, privileges,\nor immunities secured by the Arkansas Constitution.” Id. § 16-123-105(a).\n       5\n       Campbell also pled a constructive discharge claim, alleging that he had been\nwrongfully discharged from his position as warden of the Tucker Unit when he was\ndemoted and that the defendants’ actions were intended to force him to resign from the\nADC. The district court did not instruct the jury on the constructive or wrongful\ndischarge claim or submit a claim for punitive damages.\n\n                                            -9-\n\f        The case went to trial, and at the close of Campbell’s evidence the remaining\ndefendants moved for judgment as a matter of law as to all claims and reasserted their\nqualified immunity defense. The district court dismissed the claims against Manning\non the ground that Campbell had not shown that any of her actions rose to the level of\na constitutional violation. The court indicated it would continue to consider the legal\nobjections to the due process claim, but that it would submit the claim to the jury in the\nmeantime.6 The motion for judgment was denied as to Campbell’s free speech claim\nand the qualified immunity defenses. The defense motions were renewed at the close\nof all the evidence, and the court ruled similarly again.\n\n       The jury returned a verdict in Campbell’s favor on the free speech and due\nprocess claims and awarded him $94,000 for back pay and compensation for mental\nand emotional distress, humiliation, and loss of reputation. A hearing was held on the\npetition for injunctive relief, and the court ordered the defendants to reinstate Campbell\nto his former position as warden at Tucker with the same salary level, to remove him\nfrom probationary status, to remove derogatory letters from warden Toney that were\nin his personnel file, and to conduct an evaluation of Campbell’s work for 1995.\nJudgment was entered, and eleven days later it was amended to add an award of\n$74,000 in front pay as an alternative to reinstatement. Norris and Guntharp, the only\nremaining defendants, filed a post trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or for\na new trial. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that they were not entitled\nto qualified immunity and that there was “ample evidence that the defendants were\nunhappy with the ‘bad press’ resulting from [Campbell’s] public exposure of the lax\nconditions he found upon his arrival as warden” at Tucker and that the purported reason\nfor the demotion, poor job performance, was pretextual.\n\n\n\n      6\n        In its comments the court suggested that Campbell had a property interest in the\nwarden position and may have been denied due process by not receiving proper notice\nof the asserted basis for the decision to demote him.\n\n                                          -10-\n\f       Norris and Guntharp appeal from the amended judgment of the district court and\nfrom the denial of their post trial motion. They again seek entry of judgment in their\nfavor or a new trial. They argue that Campbell’s speech did not address matters of\npublic concern because it was directed to internal panels of ADC employees and that\nthere was no evidence that Norris and Guntharp knew about his intended statements\nto the CIRC. They also argue that his free speech claim is precluded by Norris’\nstatement after the grievance hearing that no evidence of retaliation had been shown.\nThey argue that he cannot succeed with his due process claim because he was an at will\nemployee and had no property interest in the warden position and no liberty interest\naffected by his transfer. Even if he had any protected interest, he was provided all the\nprocess to which he was due and any such interest was not clearly established at the\ntime of his transfer. They also claim they are entitled to eleventh amendment and\nqualified immunity and that front pay is not available because it would only serve to\nredress a past injury. If they are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, they\nshould receive a new trial because the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\ngive their business judgment instruction to the jury and committed plain error by\nreferring to some defense evidence as “farfetched.”\n\n       Campbell did not appeal the decisions adverse to him dismissing some of his\nclaims and two of the defendants, and he argues that the appeal of Norris and Guntharp\nis without merit. He says that his speech about inadequate security conditions and\ncorruption at Tucker clearly addressed matters of public concern and there was\nsufficient evidence that he was demoted in retaliation for it. He contends that the\nunlawfulness of a retaliatory demotion under such circumstances was clearly\nestablished so there can be no qualified immunity on this claim. Campbell also argues\nthat he had a property interest in the warden position created by AR 225 and that his\nefforts to clean up the Tucker Unit affected the public good and thus fit the public\npolicy exception to the Arkansas at will doctrine. He says that the decision not to use\nthe business judgment instruction was within the court’s discretion, that it was\nunsupported by the evidence, and that the instructions adequately reflected the\n\n                                          -11-\n\fapplicable law. Finally, Campbell contends that the denial of eleventh amendment\nimmunity to appellants was proper, that the front pay award was an appropriate\nalternative remedy, and that the court’s comment on the evidence was in response to\na relevance objection and not plain error.\n\n\n\n\n                                          III.\n\n      Denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo.

A public employee’s\nexpression is protected when it addresses a matter of public concern, and this is\n“determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the\nwhole record.” Connick v.

From the time he\narrived at the Tucker Unit, Campbell reported breaches in security and unsafe\nconditions to Guntharp and Norris. He sought adjustments to cell doors, hazardous pay\nfor his workers, and other measures to improve security. He had difficulty getting\ncooperation from his superiors.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f        The proper functioning of a maximum security prison with death sentenced\nprisoners is a matter of significant concern to the larger community, as are the existence\nof corruption and dangerous working conditions in a prison and inmate access to tools,\nweapons, and flammable substances that could facilitate violence and escape. See\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 146 (protected expression is that which can be “fairly considered\nas relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community”). There\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Norris and Guntharp demoted Campbell\nbecause they blamed him for publicizing these kinds of problems at Tucker. There was\nevidence of their unhappiness about media attention to the prison conditions and the\nresulting pressure on them from the governor’s office and legislature. In their\ninteraction with Campbell and other staff, they emphasized keeping the media away in\norder to avoid negative publicity about the prison and its administration. Guntharp and\nNorris reprimanded Campbell for the way he called attention to policy violations and\nsecurity breaches, particularly the flow of dangerous contraband into the prison. Much\nof the evidence appellants now rely on concerning Campbell’s alleged performance\nproblems may have been manufactured after the fact. Campbell had previously received\nhigh performance ratings from Guntharp while serving as warden of a different prison,\nand no criticisms of his managerial skills appeared in his personnel file. Defendants\nrelied heavily on criticisms first stated in writing in a memorandum Guntharp wrote after\nCampbell had filed the grievance challenging his demotion. All of this evidence tended\n“to undermine the . . . proffered reason for” demoting Campbell, “and thus to establish\nthat it was a pretext.” Stemmons v. Missouri Dept. of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717509\"><a href=\"/opinion/717509/virginia-l-stemmons-v-missouri-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 821\n(8th Cir. 1996).\n\n       Appellants argue that activities Campbell characterized as protected conduct,\nparticularly his testimony at the Pitts grievance hearing, involved the internal affairs of\nthe ADC and that he was acting as an employee on “matters only of personal interest.”\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 147 (“absent the most unusual circumstances,” federal court will\nnot review personnel decision when public employee speaks as “an employee upon\nmatters only of personal interest”). Campbell’s communications addressed the safety\n\n                                          -13-\n\fof prison employees and the surrounding community, however, as well as the overall\neffectiveness of the prison unit. These are all matters well beyond the procedural\ntechnicalities of prison administration or personnel matters of particular concern to him\nas an individual. Cf. id. at 148-49 (individual employee complaints over internal office\naffairs and her transfer not matters of public concern). Campbell brought to the\nattention of Guntharp a problem with cell doors in the unit that went uncorrected and\nultimately led to the escape of an inmate who fatally stabbed a prison guard. He was\nalso responsible for the discovery and disclosure of an unprecedented amount of\ndangerous contraband.\n\n        Campbell’s efforts to bring these conditions to light, particularly after his\nsupervisors failed to respond to the problems and treated him as overreacting to the\nsituation, were relevant to whether the ADC and its administrators were “discharging\n[their] governmental responsibilities” and whether department employees were engaged\nin “actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust.” Connick, 461 U.S. at 148\n(showing circumstances when internal events within a public office are a matter of\npublic concern).7 Campbell’s testimony that Norris and Guntharp sought to influence\nwhat he would say at the Pitts grievance hearing could have been considered by the jury\nas additional evidence that the defendants wished to limit his speech concerning these\ntopics. That hearing involved Campbell’s termination of an employee whose\nmismanagement was believed to be partly responsible for the conditions at Tucker.\n\n\n\n      7\n        Appellants do not attempt to argue that their interest in promoting the efficiency\nof the prison system outweighs any interest of Campbell in commenting on prison\nsecurity and corruption. See Pickering v. Board of Educ. Township High Sch. Dist.\n205, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (1968). They argue instead that his speech did not fit within\nthe definition of public concern. The Pickering balancing test would not work to their\nadvantage since Campbell’s criticisms actually addressed the ADC interest in running\nthe prison in an effective and safe manner, and there was no evidence that the media\nattention created unrest or any other security risks at Tucker.\n\n                                          -14-\n\f       Norris and Guntharp also contend that Campbell’s first amendment claim should\nfail because he made no effort to communicate his speech to the public, and they point\nout that he says he never initiated any contact with the press. Contacting the media is\nnot necessary for a public employee’s comments to be on matters of public concern,\nhowever. See id. at 146.

Moreover, Campbell was interviewed by the news media\nconcerning the conditions at the Tucker Unit, and Norris and Guntharp criticized him\non more than one occasion for permitting the intense media coverage of the unit to\ncontinue. The jury could have relied on these facts to find that his speech was directed\nboth to his employer and to the public.\n\n        Norris and Guntharp also assert that there was no evidence that they knew that\nCampbell intended to criticize their response to dangerous conditions in the maximum\nsecurity unit when he was involved in the CIRC. The CIRC had been created to look\ninto the Grimes murder, and there was evidence that Norris and Guntharp were aware\nat the time that Campbell had spoken out about the cell door defect that made Grimes’\nmurder possible and that they believed Campbell called too much attention to such\nsecurity problems. The jury could have inferred from this evidence that they suspected\nCampbell would bring these matters up before the committee or knew that he had\nannounced at the first meeting that he intended to discuss these topics. His transfer on\nthe very day that the CIRC was next scheduled to meet would support such an\ninference. In any event Campbell did not need to show that they knew what he intended\nto report to the CIRC in order to succeed on his first amendment claim. There was\nsufficient evidence that they believed that his general outspokenness on security and\ncorruption encouraged media criticism of ADC management. When Guntharp notified\nCampbell of his demotion, he specifically criticized him for not being able to\n\n                                         -15-\n\fkeep the media out of his unit. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, a reasonable fact finder could infer that the decision to demote Campbell was\nmotivated by his speech on security problems.

Appellants do not contest that the law prohibiting\nadverse employment actions in retaliation for a public employee’s free speech was\nclearly established at the time. See Connick, 461 U.S. at 142; Pickering, 391 U.S. at\n574. They do argue that it was not clearly established that Campbell’s particular type\nof communication was protected as dealing with matters of public concern. This\nargument turns on whether a reasonable person would have known that Campbell’s\ndemotion and transfer violated a clearly established right if it was in retaliation for his\nspeech about prison conditions. See Engle, 49 F.3d at 1323 (citing Anderson v.\nCreighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (1987)). The verdict shows that the jury found Campbell\nspoke out on such matters as security breaches, contraband, malfunctioning cell doors,\nand corruption and that this speech caused the defendants to transfer and demote him.\nIt was clearly established at the time that prison security and prison operations are\nmatters of public concern, and Campbell’s right to bring these problems to light, both\nwithin the department and in a manner that attracted media attention, was also clearly\nestablished. See Powell, 921 F.2d at 167 (criticism to sheriff of department operations\nwas clearly established free speech right). A reasonable person would have known that\nretaliating against Campbell for exercising his free speech rights on such matters of\npublic concern would clearly violate his constitutional rights. Norris and Guntharp are\nnot entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f        Norris and Guntharp also argue that Campbell is precluded by collateral estoppel\nfrom proving retaliation in this case because Norris said he found no evidence of\nretaliation after the ADC grievance hearing.8 The findings of fact from a state\nadministrative proceeding are entitled to preclusive effect “provided that the [state]\nagency was acting in a judicial capacity, the questions litigated were properly before the\nagency judge, and the parties had an adequate opportunity to litigate them.” Alexander\nv.

The\nhearing was held before Norris and took place in his office. Norris was Director of the\nDepartment of Corrections and the individual to whom Campbell’s supervisor reported,\nand he had been personally involved with some of the underlying events. He had\nfirsthand knowledge of much of the background prior to the hearing, yet was\nunavailable for Campbell to produce as a witness. He had given advance approval to\nthe decision to demote Campbell, and the key issue was the appropriateness of this\ndecision. He was not in a similar position to a typical administrative law judge, and the\ndepartment hearing also did not provide an adequate opportunity to develop the\nevidence. Campbell was unable to subpoena witnesses, and he and Guntharp were not\nsworn. The hearing lasted only two hours. In his letter finding the demotion decision\nto have been correct, Norris stated that Guntharp had demoted Campbell because of\n\n      8\n         In his letter giving his decision rejecting Campbell’s appeal of his transfer,\nNorris stated that he found “no evidence that your demotion was pretextual or done in\nretaliation.” In his previous sentence he had described Campbell’s grievance as being\nthat his demotion was “pretextual and in retaliation for the uncovering of contraband\nevidence and other security lapses.”\n\n                                          -17-\n\fa deteriorating situation at Tucker rather than in retaliation for uncovering security\nlapses, but he did not mention the argument Campbell made at the hearing that\nGuntharp had demoted him for generating media attention even though Guntharp spoke\nat the hearing about his unhappiness with the contraband display. His brief decision\nletter did not refer to this part of the grievance and did not make detailed findings of fact\nand conclusions of law. The situation here is completely unlike the cases cited by\nappellants on the issue of preclusion. See Elliott, 478 U.S. at 791 n.2; Alexander, 91\nF.3d at 62.\n\n       There was sufficient evidence to support liability against both Norris and\nGuntharp on Campbell’s first amendment claim, and for the reasons discussed they are\nnot entitled to judgment as a matter of law on it. They do not challenge the amount of\ncompensatory damages awarded by the jury or claim they are not recoverable under the\nfirst amendment. The case was submitted on verdict forms which first asked the jury\nto indicate its ultimate findings on the first amendment claim and on the due process\nclaim. The jury was then instructed that it should find the amount of plaintiff’s damages\nin accordance with Instruction 9 if it found in favor of the plaintiff on either claim.\nInstruction 9 provided that damages could include any back pay, mental and emotional\ndistress, humiliation, and loss of reputation suffered by Campbell as a result of his\ndemotion and transfer. Since the verdict in favor of Campbell and the damages awarded\nare supported by the evidence and the law as to his first amendment claim, it is not\nnecessary to discuss his due process claim.9 See Hinkle v. Christensen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434990\"><a href=\"/opinion/434990/patti-hinkle-v-eugene-christensen-individually-and-as-a-member-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n76 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\n                                             B.\n\n\n       9\n       We note that Campbell has not pointed to any express provision that an ADC\nwarden can only be demoted or dismissed for cause so it is questionable that he can\nmake out a property interest in the position.

The court instructed the\njury that its verdict would have to be for the defendants if it found that they would have\ndemoted Campbell regardless of his free speech activities, but it declined to add the\nrequested instruction that the jury could not decide for Campbell just because it “might\ndisagree with [defendants’] decision or believe it to be harsh or unreasonable.” A\nbusiness judgment instruction has been recognized as sometimes appropriate for a first\namendment retaliation claim. See Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions\n(Civil) § 5.71 notes on use (1998). A district court has broad discretion in instructing\nthe jury, however. See Gray v.

The substance of defendants’ business judgment theory was covered\nby the court’s instructions and argued by counsel in opening and closing, and defendants\nhad the opportunity to present evidence supporting their asserted reasons for the\ndemotion. See Stemmons, 82 F.3d at 821 (no abuse of discretion when defendant able\nto argue and present evidence on its business judgment theory). The defendants have\nnot shown they were prejudiced by the refusal to give their business judgment\ninstruction and any error was harmless in light of the ample evidence that Campbell was\ndemoted for exercising his free speech rights. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\f        Appellants also argue that the district court committed plain error by its comment\nduring the testimony of a defense witness.10 The witness was called at the start of the\nlast day of trial and testified that he had heard Campbell make an inappropriate\ncomment in 1990 about the Arkansas Parole Board and that he once had trouble getting\nhim to send a file for a parolee transfer. The witness began a lengthy description of the\ncontext in which he needed the file, and Campbell’s counsel raised a relevance\nobjection. The court initially sustained it, but opposing counsel argued that the\nexplanation was relevant because the witness ultimately had to contact Guntharp to get\nthe file. The court then allowed the testimony to go forward, saying: “Well, go ahead\nand let’s see where it leads, but this seems awful farfetched. In fact, all this testimony\nseems to me to be pretty farfetched, but go ahead.”\n\n        Appellants argue that this comment undermined their entire defense concerning\nCampbell’s history of performance problems. The court made the comment in the\ncourse of reconsidering an evidentiary ruling, and it does not appear to have been\n“intended or calculated to disparage [a party] in the eyes of the jury and to prevent the\njury from exercising an impartial judgment upon the merits.” La Barge Water Well\nSupply Co. v.

The comment addressed the relevance of\nthe testimony and warned counsel that it was on the borderline of admissibility. It was\nquite clearly directed at the particular witness who was testifying, rather than to the\ndefense case in general, and the entire testimony of the witness, including the argument\nof counsel, covered only six pages of transcript. Appellants have not shown they are\nentitled to a new trial on this basis.\n\n\n\n      10\n       Appellants concede that the comment can only be reviewed for plain error\nbecause they failed to object to it at the time.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f                                           C.\n\n       Norris and Guntharp challenge certain aspects of the equitable relief on eleventh\namendment grounds.

The judgment contains orders to reinstate\nCampbell as warden at Tucker with the same salary level, to remove him from his one\nyear probation, to remove certain letters from his personnel file, and to perform an\nevaluation of his work for 1995. Subsequent to oral argument appellants’ counsel\ninformed this court that Campbell has given formal written notice that he would resign\nfrom the ADC on August 3, 1998 and that his physician would release him from care\non that date.
