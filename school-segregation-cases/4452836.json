LAW OF OIL & GAS (2d ed. 2014)\n  volume 1 § 2.4[B][1] ............................................................................................9\n  volume 1 § 2.49[A] ...............................................................................................8\n\n\n\n\n                                                          6\n\f                                   Introduction\n\n      The Quinn siblings originally shared an undivided interest in the mineral\n\nestate of the Rose Teal Quinn Ranch. When they later partitioned the mineral\n\nestate, they expressly pooled their royalty interests. Sam Quinn then conveyed his\n\nestate to House, together with all rights and appurtenances. Sam’s pooled royalty\n\ninterest in the entire ranch necessarily passed to House. At this point, Sam had\n\nnothing left to give — as such, his subsequent deed to Hoskins conveyed nothing.\n\n      Hoskins argues that, by cross-conveyance, the Quinns did not pool their\n\nroyalty interests but instead splintered their interests into distinct parts for each\n\nsibling’s tract that could not be appurtenant to the tract committed to the pool\n\n(despite admitting that each tract is burdened by all of the other siblings’ royalty\n\ninterests). Hoskins’ argument ignores not only the Quinns’ express intent to pool,\n\nbut also the plain terms of their agreement to cross-convey only as “necessary to\n\neffectuate the pooling.” Hoskins overlooks the fundamental nature of pooling as a\n\nform of joint ownership involving both contract and real property law.\n\n      As Hoskins concedes, Sam’s tract was burdened by the pooled royalty\n\ninterest, making that interest an appurtenance as a matter of law. Respected cases\n\nand commentators agree that pooled royalty interests are both rights and\n\nappurtenances. Because Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House and not to\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fHoskins, the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and judgment rendered in\n\nfavor of House and Aery.\n\n                                    Argument\n\n      Appellees filed eight briefs, which generally join the arguments of Clifton\n\nHoskins. For the sake of brevity, the appellees are addressed collectively as\n\n“Hoskins” unless noted otherwise. This term explicitly includes the oil and gas\n\nproducers, whose summary judgments are entirely derivative of the motion granted\n\nin favor of Clifton. See Appellants’ Brief at 25; CR5:1631-32.\n\nI.    Hoskins confuses semantics with substance by labeling the Quinns’\n      pooled royalty interest as “NPIR/NPRI.”\n\n      Clifton Hoskins insists on using the novel term “non-participating interest in\n\nroyalty” (NPIR) to describe the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest in the entire Rose\n\nTeal Quinn Ranch. See, e.g., Clifton’s Brief at vii. Other appellees use the\n\ntraditional term “non-participating royalty interest” (NPRI). See, e.g., Jane’s Brief\n\nat 4 n.1. Either term is a red herring. See ERNEST E. SMITH & JACQUELINE LANG\n\nWEAVER, 1 TEX. LAW OF OIL & GAS § 2.49[A] (2d ed. 2014) (defining “royalty” as\n\na “chameleon-hued” term).\n\n      The dispute here is not whether the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest is non-\n\nparticipatory in the costs of production. Instead, the dispute is whether the Quinns\n\ncreated a pooled royalty interest that, by contract and property law, was conveyed\n\nto House.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      While Hoskins contends that the sole issue in this appeal is the construction\n\nof the deed from Sam to House, he ultimately recognizes that the scope of Sam’s\n\nownership interest depends on his prior agreement with his siblings — an\n\nagreement to, in their own words, “pool their interests in the royalties from the\n\nproduction of oil, gas and any other mineral, produced and saved from any part of\n\nthe 2,471.8 acres of land, more or less, known as the Rose Teal Quinn Ranch.”\n\nClifton’s Brief at viii, 17; CR2:416. Hoskins’ label (either NPIR or NPRI)\n\ncompletely ignores any concept of pooling. See, e.g., Clifton’s Brief at 3-4.\n\n      Additionally, Hoskins’ label does not affect the law governing the Quinns’\n\npooled royalty interest, despite Hoskins’ suggestion to the contrary. Compare\n\nBlake’s Brief at 3-4 (arguing that cases involving lease royalty interests cannot be\n\napplied to cases involving NPRIs) with SMITH, 1 TEX. LAW            OF   OIL & GAS\n\n§ 2.4[B][1] (“In analyzing rights of royalty owners, Texas courts have tended to\n\nignore distinctions between types of royalties”) & Merrill Eng’g Co. v. Capital\n\nNat’l Bank of Jackson, 5 So. 2d 666, 671 (Miss. 1942) (“We are unable to conceive\n\nof any sound basis for a distinction …”); see also JOSEPH SHADE & BONNIE\n\nBLACKWELL, PRIMER       ON THE   TEXAS LAW      OF   OIL & GAS 20 (5th ed. 2013)\n\n(“[S]imilarities among the different types of royalties far outweigh their\n\ndifferences”). Hoskins’ label should be set aside as irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fII.    Pooling is subject to both property and contract law.\n\n       Not only does Hoskins attempt to use irrelevant labels to divert the Court’s\n\nattention from the key documents, Hoskins also attempts to draw a sharp\n\ndistinction between contract and real property law. See, e.g., Clifton’s Brief at 15,\n\n30. Texas, however, applies both contract and property law in the oil and gas\n\ncontext.\n\n       For example:\n\n       •     Pooling is a real property interest. MCEN 1996 P’ship v.

Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House as a contract right.\n\n       Significantly, Hoskins agrees that if pooled royalty interests are contractual,\n\nthen they pass whether explicitly described in a deed or not. Clifton’s Brief at 26\n\n(conceding that “contract-theory jurisdictions treat pooled interests as appurtenant”\n\nbut arguing that Texas does not recognize pooling as contractual); Aurora’s Brief\n\nat 5 (conceding the Quinns’ pooling agreement is contractual). In an attempt to\n\navoid this concession, Hoskins claims that House and Aery waived any reliance on\n\ncontract. Clifton’s Brief at 26.\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      House and Aery have consistently applied both contract and property law.\n\nSee, e.g., Appellants’ Brief 27 (noting that review should be de novo under\n\nproperty and contract law); id. at 28 (citing multiple cases for property and contract\n\nprinciples); id. at 28 (quoting Professor Bruce Kramer, Hoskins’ expert in the trial\n\ncourt, for the proposition that pooling agreements are contracts that grow out of\n\nproperty law); id. at 29 (explaining that Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to\n\nHouse under “contract and property law”); id. at 35 (highlighting Sam’s transfer of\n\nall rights to House); CR2:394-96 (describing the express contract language in the\n\nQuinns’ pooling agreement).\n\n      Likewise, House and Aery have consistently relied on Wagner & Brown,\n\nLtd. v. Sheppard, 282 S.W.3d 419, 424 (Tex. 2008) — a case not mentioned or\n\nacknowledged by Hoskins — for the rule that pooling is contractual. Compare\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 28 & CR2:395 with Clifton’s Brief at v.\n\n      In this case, the pooling agreement signed by all of the Quinns was a valid\n\ncontract that gave Sam rights in the pooled royalty interest in the entire Rose Teal\n\nQuinn Ranch. CR2:408-19; Wagner, 282 S.W.3d at 424. There can be no doubt\n\nthat Sam, in his deed to House, explicitly transferred his contract right to House.\n\nCR2:432 (transferring to House “all and singular the rights … in anywise\n\nbelonging”); Coolbaugh v. Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., 67 A. 615, 615 (Pa.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f1907) (illustrating that a deed’s reference to rights passes pooled contractual\n\nrights). The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\nIV.   Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House pursuant to the greatest\n      estate rule.\n\n      Falling back on real property law, Hoskins insists that Sam’s pooled royalty\n\ninterest must be particularly described in a deed before it can be conveyed.\n\nClifton’s Brief at 10-11 (citing Gage v. Owen, 435 S.W.2d 559, 562 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1968, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Neither Gage nor any of the cases it\n\ncites have been used to overrule the long-standing principle that a deed confers\n\nupon the grantee the greatest estate owned by the grantor, whether particularly\n\ndescribed or not. See, e.g., Lott v. Lott, 370 S.W.2d 463, 465 (Tex. 1963); Eastin v.\n\nDial, 288 S.W.3d 491, 500 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2009, pet. denied).\n\n      Sam’s deed to House broadly conveys all rights and appurtenances.\n\nCR2:432. Moreover, Sam’s deed to House actually describes the entire Rose Teal\n\nQuinn Ranch. CR2:431 (identifying “623.93 acres … being a part of the Rose Teal\n\nQuinn Ranch consisting of 2471.8 acres, more or less, and being described in a\n\ncertain Deed of Trust”). Finally, Sam’s deed to House expressly reserves only one\n\nthing: his mother’s life estate described in the pooling agreement. CR2:431-32;\n\nSharp v. Fowler, 252 S.W.2d 153, 154 (Tex. 1952) (holding that a warranty deed\n\npasses the entire estate absent a reservation to the contrary). By application of the\n\ngreatest estate rule, Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House.\n\n\n                                         12\n\fV.    Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House as an appurtenance.\n\n      Hoskins denies that a pooled royalty interest is an “appurtenance,” but\n\nHoskins is wrong. See Clifton’s Brief at 17. The Quinns’ pooled royalty interest in\n\nthe entire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch is directly appurtenant to Sam’s own land.\n\n      A.    Hoskins’ cross-conveyance theory is not dispositive.\n\n      Hoskins argues that the Quinns’ pooling agreement, as a cross-conveyance,\n\n“resolves this case.” Id. at 17 & n.8 (citing NANCY SAINT-PAUL, 4 SUMMERS OIL &\n\nGAS § 54.3 (3d ed. 2014)). Ironically, after criticizing House and Aery for relying\n\non secondary sources, Hoskins does the same. Compare id. at 28. Hoskins’\n\nreliance on SUMMERS, however, is inconsistent with Texas law.\n\n      According to Hoskins’ reading of SUMMERS, a contract state characterizes\n\npooling as a contract right, while a cross-conveyance state characterizes pooling as\n\na property interest that is not appurtenant to any unit committed to the pool.\n\nClifton’s Brief at 17 (citing SAINT-PAUL, 4 SUMMERS OIL & GAS § 54.3). While\n\nSUMMERS is actually addressing a community lease, a community lease is a type of\n\nvoluntary pooling agreement where a single oil and gas lease covers two or more\n\ntracts executed by the separate owners as if they were joint owners. BRUCE M.\n\nKRAMER & PATRICK H. MARTIN, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS OIL & GAS LAW § 904\n\n(2014).\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f      Hoskins then characterizes Texas as a cross-conveyance state. Clifton’s\n\nBrief at 17. Whether Texas is a cross-conveyance state is a nonstarter, in part\n\nbecause Texas does not sharply distinguish contract and property law in the oil and\n\ngas context. As Professor Kramer further explains, the adoption or rejection of the\n\ncross-conveyance theory has no effect on whether the interest in a pooled unit is\n\nappurtenant (passes with the land) or in gross (does not pass with the land).\n\nKRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6).\n\n      For example, both California and Mississippi are cross-conveyance states,\n\nbut Mississippi considers a pooled royalty interest to be appurtenant, while\n\nCalifornia does not. Id. § 930.1, § 930.4; Merrill, 5 So. 2d at 672 (holding that “in\n\nthe absence of a reservation to the contrary[,] a subsequent grantee of any part of\n\nthe pooled area would be entitled to the benefits”); Tanner v. Title Ins. & Trust\n\nCo., 129 P.2d 383, 386 (Cal. 1942) (holding that the pooled royalty interest is “an\n\nincorporeal    hereditament   in   gross”).   Thus,   SUMMERS’ position        is   an\n\noversimplification, and Hoskins’ reliance on it is misplaced.\n\n      B.      The Quinns’ express intent is dispositive.\n\n      Consistent with Texas principles of contract and deed construction, Kramer\n\nconcentrates on the “intent of the parties, not whether pooling or unitization effects\n\ncross-conveyances.” KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6); see also\n\nWagner, 282 S.W.3d at 424 (construing a Texas pooling agreement based on the\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fintent reflected in the agreement). Even Tanner, the leading “in gross” case cited\n\nabove from California, is consistent with this basic tenant of document\n\nconstruction. Tanner, 129 P.2d at 389 (concurring that the intention of the parties\n\nas expressed in their agreement controls).\n\n      Kramer further notes that if the parties did not adequately manifest their\n\nintent, “the courts should usually take the position that the grantor’s interest in unit\n\nproduction is included in a conveyance of the premises he has committed to the\n\nunit.” KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6). “In other words, the interest of\n\na party in unit production should ordinarily be viewed as appurtenant to his interest\n\nin premises committed to the unit rather than ‘in gross.’ ” Id.\n\n      Here, although it leads to the same result in favor of House and Aery, the\n\nCourt need not resort to Kramer’s default position because the Quinns fully\n\nmanifested their intent. The Quinn siblings pooled all of their royalty interests.\n\nCR2:416 (expressing the Quinns’ “desire to and do hereby pool their interests in\n\nthe royalties from the production of oil, gas and any other mineral, produced and\n\nsaved from any part of the 2,471.8 acres of land, more or less, known as the Rose\n\nTeal Quinn Ranch”).\n\n      Furthermore, the Quinns evidenced their intent to cross-convey only to the\n\nextent “necessary to effectuate” their pooling agreement. CR1:231; see also\n\nKRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 919.2 (pooling language may negate any\n\n\n                                          15\n\fundesirable consequences of cross-conveyance by agreement of the parties). If the\n\nQuinns had intended to create the separate and distinct royalty interests in each\n\nsibling’s tract that Hoskins advocates, then they would have used a simple\n\nconveyance to reach that result without implicating pooling at all.\n\n      In their pooling agreement, the Quinns bound their heirs and assigns, further\n\nevidencing their intent to pass their pooled royalty interest with the tracts\n\ncommitted to the pool. CR2:409. This intent is further underscored by the\n\nrecitations regarding the siblings’ prior undivided interests in the mineral estate of\n\nthe entire ranch and by the inclusion of their mother as a party to the agreement\n\nand holder of a life estate in the ranch’s mineral estate. CR2:408, 418-49.\n\n      Later, when Sam conveyed his rights and appurtenances to House, he\n\nevidenced his intent to convey his pooled royalty interest in the entire ranch.\n\nCR2:432. Not only did Sam mention all “rights and appurtenances,” but he also\n\ndescribed the entire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch by name and cross-reference to other\n\nfiled documents. CR2:431-32. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nin favor of Hoskins rather than House and Aery.\n\n      C.     Precedent from this Court and the Supreme Court controls.\n\n      Hoskins contends that Sam’s pooled royalty interest cannot be an\n\nappurtenance because is not necessary to the enjoyment of Sam’s tract, but\n\nHoskins’ contention focuses only on Sam’s surface tract. Clifton’s Brief at 19.\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fThat narrow focus is misplaced and is inconsistent with Hoskins’ admission that\n\nSam’s tract was “burdened” with an obligation to share royalties. Id. at 25 (row\n\nthree of Hoskins’ chart).\n\n      “A burden that obligates the owner or occupier of a particular unit or parcel\n\nin that person’s capacity as owner or occupier is an appurtenant burden.” Killam\n\nRanch Properties, Ltd. v. Webb County, 376 S.W.3d 146, 156 n.4 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2012, pet. denied) (en banc) (citing RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF PROPERTY\n\n(SERVITUDES) § 1.5 (2000), which defines “appurtenances”). An appurtenance\n\nmay also be a beneficial right essential to the proper enjoyment of the premises.\n\nCox v. Campbell, 143 S.W.2d 361, 364 (Tex. 1940).\n\n      Pursuant to the Quinns’ pooling agreement, if oil and gas were ever\n\nproduced on Sam’s acres, then he would be required to share royalty with his\n\nsiblings. As Hoskins conceded, Sam’s tract was “burdened” by the pooled royalty\n\ninterest in the entire ranch. Clifton’s Brief at 25; see also CR3:852 & 861 n.13.\n\nThus, Sam’s pooled royalty interest is an appurtenance. Killam, 376 S.W.3d at 156\n\nn.4; see also Landgrebe v. Rock Hill Oil Co., 273 S.W.2d 636, 638 & 640 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—San Antonio 1954, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (holding that parties to a pooled\n\nlease continued to receive their proportionate share even when their subsequent\n\npartition deeds did not mention the prior pooled royalty interest).\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      Additionally, under the pooling agreement, if oil and gas were ever produced\n\non the tracts of Sam’s siblings, they would be required to share royalty with Sam,\n\nconferring on him a beneficial right essential to the proper enjoyment of his own\n\ntract. See Cox, 143 S.W.2d at 364. In this sense, a pooled royalty interest is not\n\nunlike an appurtenant easement, which “inheres in the land, concerns the premises,\n\nand pertains to its enjoyment.” Forister v. Coleman, 418 S.W.2d 550, 559 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—Austin 1967), writ ref’d n.r.e., 431 S.W.2d 2 (Tex. 1968).\n\n      The Quinns’ pooled royalty interest in the entire ranch certainly “affected\n\nthe nature and value” of their respective tracts. See Westland Oil Dev. Corp. v.\n\nGulf Oil Corp., 637 S.W.2d 903, 911 (Tex. 1982) (defining an agreement to share\n\nleases in a geographic area as an appurtenance). Hoskins discounts Westland\n\nbecause “the interest at issue was one created by contract.” Clifton’s Brief at 27.\n\nWestland, however, is controlling here because the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest\n\nis contractual. See Wagner, 282 S.W.3d at 424.\n\n      Furthermore, Hoskins’ attempt to divorce contract law from property law\n\nonce again fails. See Westland, 637 S.W.2d at 905 (describing the agreement as a\n\ncontract to convey real property interests); see also Thomas v. Fin & Feather Club,\n\n171 S.W. 698, 700 (Tex. 1914) (holding that Bateman’s fishing contract with the\n\nclub, recorded in the real property records, was an appurtenance to land Bateman\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fconveyed to Thomas). Because Sam’s royalty interest in the pool was appurtenant\n\nto the tract he committed to the pool, that pooled royalty interest passed to House.\n\n      D.     Commentators agree pooled royalty interests are appurtenances.\n\n      For Professor Kramer, the pooled royalty interest “should ordinarily be\n\nviewed as appurtenant to [the] interest in premises committed to the unit rather\n\nthan ‘in gross.’ ” KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6); see also\n\n3 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 660. Under Kramer’s analysis, even if the Quinn siblings\n\nowned fractional royalty interests in each other’s tracts as Hoskins claims (when\n\nthey did not), those interests would still be appurtenant to the tract committed to\n\nthe unit. Id.; see also William O. Huie, Apportionment of Oil & Gas Royalties, 78\n\nHARV. L. REV. 1113, 1145 n.65 (1965) (characterizing pooled royalty interests as\n\nappurtenances).\n\n      This outcome makes sense given Supreme Court authority holding that\n\nproduction anywhere on a pooled unit is considered production on every tract in\n\nthe unit. See, e.g., Key Operating & Equip., Inc. v. Hegar, 435 S.W.3d 794, 798-99\n\n(Tex. 2014) (citing Southland Royalty Co. v. Humble Oil & Ref. Co., 249 S.W.2d\n\n914, 916 (Tex. 1952)). “Under such reasoning, the right to receive royalty from\n\nproduction which is realized from wells located on other land covered by the\n\ncommunity lease would necessarily follow the ownership of each tract of land\n\ncontributed to the community lease.” OWEN ANDERSON,              ET AL.,   KUNTZ, 3\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fA TREATISE ON THE LAW OF OIL & GAS § 42.6 (1989) (citing Southland, 249\n\nS.W.2d at 916).\n\n      E.       Avery and McCall are not binding on this Court.\n\n      In rejecting pooled royalty interests as appurtenances, Hoskins relies heavily\n\non McCall and the West Virginia case it cites. Clifton’s Brief at 20-25 (discussing\n\nMcCall v. McCall, 24 S.W.3d 508 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet.\n\ndenied) and Avery v. Moore, 144 S.E.2d 434 (W. Va. 1965)). Neither case is\n\ncontrolling.\n\n      Avery arises in a contract theory state, which under Hoskins’ analysis, would\n\nnot apply in Texas. See KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 930.4. Regardless, as\n\nHoskins admits, Avery does not explicitly discuss appurtenances (nor does it even\n\ndiscuss contractual rights); it simply draws a conclusion without relating enough\n\nfacts to make a comparison here. See Clifton’s Brief at 21.\n\n      As for McCall, the “facts as stated in the court’s opinion are not entirely\n\nclear.” See Edwin P. Horner, McCall v. McCall Discussion Notes, 145 OIL & GAS\n\nREP. 415, 419 (2001). Nonetheless, there was no pooling of the royalty interest\n\nconcurrent with the partition of the remaining mineral estate. For that simple\n\nreason, McCall has no bearing on the Quinns’ pooling agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f      Moreover, Professor Horner criticized McCall for reaching the wrong result.\n\nFirst, the opinion defined the term “appurtenance” too narrowly in the royalty\n\ncontext. Horner, 145 OIL & GAS REP. at 420.\n\n      Second, the opinion disregarded Harris v. Currie, 176 S.W.2d 302 (Tex.\n\n1943), and Day & Co., Inc. v. Texland Petroleum, Inc., 786 S.W.2d 667 (Tex.\n\n1990), which provide that a grantor conveys the greatest estate owned absent a\n\nreservation to the contrary. Horner, 145 OIL & GAS REP. at 418-19. According to\n\nProfessor Horner, “where the owner of a tract included in a pooled unit sells his\n\ntract, then his conveyance also includes his interest in the production from the\n\npooled unit, which production may come from another tract in the unit.” Id. at 418-\n\n19.\n\n      While Hoskins discounts Professor Horner and the other Texas\n\ncommentators, their observations offer valuable insight into Texas law. Regardless,\n\nHoskins himself proves why McCall has no precedential value here. When\n\ndiscussing McCall, Hoskins concedes that Sam’s tract was “burdened by a royalty\n\ninterest in favor of the owners of the other tracts.” See Clifton’s Brief at 25\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      McCall rejects burdens as appurtenances, which conflicts with this Court’s\n\nrecognition of burdens as appurtenances. Killam Ranch, 376 S.W.3d at 156 n.4.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\fMoreover, McCall is narrowly focused on appurtenances and fails to address the\n\ncontractual rights reflected in the Quinns’ pooling agreement.\n\nVI.   Recitations in the House and Aery chain of title have no effect.\n\n      In his factual statement, Hoskins mentions the “subject to” language in the\n\nHouse and Aery chain of title. Clifton’s Brief at 6-8. This language acknowledges\n\nthe recording of Sam’s deed to L.R. Hoskins (dated after Sam’s deed to House),\n\nbut the reference does not acknowledge the validity of the second deed. See Teal\n\nTrading & Dev., LP v. Champee Springs Ranches Prop. Owners Ass’n, 432\n\nS.W.3d 381, 391 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2014, pet. denied). In light of this\n\nauthority, Hoskins makes no argument based on his factual recitation.\n\nVII. Hoskins’ position is not logical.\n\n      Although Hoskins insists his position is logical, it is not. See Clifton’s Brief\n\nat 15, 17. In Texas, if a landowner enters an ordinary oil and gas lease and\n\nsubsequently conveys the land by warranty deed without reserving any mineral\n\ninterests, then the grantee takes the land and any royalty due under the lease. Bibb\n\nv. Nolan, 6 S.W.2d 156, 157 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1928, writ ref’d). The same\n\nresult must occur if the land is subject to a pooled lease — all the more so in this\n\ncase, where the grantors expressly pooled their royalty interests by agreement\n\nbefore entering any oil and gas leases.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n         This case illustrates the blending of contract and property law. The Quinns\n\nagreed to partition their jointly owned mineral estate, but for their royalty interests,\n\nwhich they expressly agreed to pool in perpetuity. Whether Hoskins characterizes\n\nthe Quinns’ pooled royalty interest as an NPIR or NPRI or a cross-conveyance is\n\nirrelevant. Nor does it really matter whether the pooled royalty interest can be\n\nspatially divided as Hoskins wrongly asserts.\n\n         The bottom line is that the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest was both a\n\ncontractual right and interest in real property. The pooled royalty interest in the\n\nentire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch also necessarily (and admittedly) burdened all of the\n\ntracts committed to the pool and affected their value. As a result, the pooled\n\nroyalty interest in the entire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch was appurtenant to Sam’s\n\ntract.\n\n         When Sam transferred and conveyed the “described premises, together with\n\nall and singular the rights and appurtenances thereto in anywise belonging” to\n\nHouse, Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House (and subsequently to Aery).\n\nThe trial court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\n         As outlined in more detail in the prayer of their opening brief, Aery and\n\nHouse ask the Court to reverse the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of\n\nClifton Hoskins, as well as the other summary judgments and final judgment upon\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fwhich it is based.

Thus,\neach owner may retain an undivided royalty interest in tracts allocated to other cotenants while taking ownership of all other\nincidents of mineral ownership, including the power of leasing his own partitioned tract. A subsequent conveyance by the\nowner of such a partitioned tract will carry with it all mineral rights in that tract, subject to the outstanding royalty interests, but\nit will not convey any of the grantor’s royalty interest in the other tracts.13\n\nWhere two cotenants own the surface estate and a third cotenant owns an interest in the minerals, a partition deed by the two\nsurface owners partitioning the land on the basis of the surface ownership will be construed to partition the\n\n1See generally, American Law of Property (1952), §§ 6.19, 6.20; Powell, The Law of Real Property (1954), P610; Tiffany, The Law of Real\nProperty (3rd ed. 1939), §§ 468–472.\n2   See § 5.5.\n3   Griffin v.

This result and the underlying reasons are clearly described in the following concise statement by Justice Smith:\n\n        “This case is controlled by our decision in Hutchinson v. Sheppard, supra. There we held that where the parties to a\n        partition deed owned two estates in the land, one in common and in the same ratio as the division and the other not\n        in common and therefore not in that ratio, the deed should be construed as a conveyance only of the estate held in\n        common. And that conclusion was reached even though the deed purported to convey all the grantor’s ‘right, title,\n        interest and claim’ in and to the land. The governing rule is obviously both sensible and just, for it prevents either\n        party from gaining an advantage at the other’s expense.”14\n\nWhether or not the voluntary partition was intended to partition the mineral as well as the surface interest raises a problem of\nconstruction of the partition deeds. In the case of deeds not involving a partition, it is uniformly held that upon a conveyance of\nland, the ownership of or the rights to oil and gas pass to the grantee unless they are expressly reserved or excepted.15 Partition\ndeeds are not subject to all of the formalities required of other conveyances, but the usual rules of construction apply, and it\nmay be found that it was intended to partition the minerals as well as the surface, although the minerals are not specially\nmentioned.16 Partition deeds which cover both mineral and surface interests by mistake can, because of the mutual mistake, be\nreformed to cover only the surface and not the mineral interest.17\n\nIf an oil and gas lease is outstanding on the entire tract owned by the cotenants at the time of the voluntary partition of the\nsurface and mineral estates, it is not necessary that the oil and gas lessee be a party to the partition,18 but such partition can not\nimpair the rights of the lessee who is entitled to develop the entire tract as a unit and not as separate tracts.19\n\nA voluntary partition may be rescinded for mutual mistake, but it cannot be rescinded for a unilateral mistake unless the other\nparty knew of the mistake or induced it.

App.—San Antonio 1987,\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.).\n\nIn Louisiana, natural gas produced from a compulsory unit is subject to partition, and the Conservation Commissioner is\nauthorized to order a partition.

Because of the authority to partition gas produced from a unit, the commissioner also has\nthe authority to direct balancing and to order an accounting either in cash or in kind.

App.—Texarkana 2010), provides a good example of a partition in which each owner\nretained a royalty interest in the tracts allocated to the other cotenants, but acquired all other incidents of mineral ownership. The court\nrejected the claims of two of the original three cotenants that they were entitled to share in all rights in the mineral estate under the third tract,\nwhich had been leased. The court ruled that the provision in their father’s will that left land to his three sons and that stipulated that they\nwere to “share and share alike production royalty” clearly referred only to royalty and the effect of the sons’ voluntary partition was to give\neach son all the other incidents of the mineral estate in the tract that he received.\n14   Johnson v.

He is entitled to all of the royalty payments for production from his portion of the partitioned\ntract and is not entitled to a share of royalties for oil or gas produced elsewhere on the larger tract under the lease.20 Under the\nrule applied in a minority of the jurisdictions having decisions on the point, royalties and payments under the lease would be\napportioned, that is, royalties payable for oil or gas produced at any point on the larger tract would be divided among the\nvarious owners of the tracts into which it was partitioned. This result has been explained on the basis that oil and gas are\nfugitive in nature and that production must be apportioned among the partitioned owners because it is being drained from the\nentire tract.21 In Kentucky, if nothing is said about the outstanding lease and royalties payable thereunder, the rule of\napportionment applies on the theory that the royalties and other payments under a lease are not only payment for oil extracted\nbut also serve as rentals by which the entire tract is held under the terms of the lease.22 Such cotenants may, however, partition\nthe minerals and rights under the lease so as to prevent such apportionment.23\n\nThe effect of a partition of land that is subject to an oil and gas lease may depend upon the provisions of the oil and gas lease.\nThus, in Texas, where the nonapportionment rule is followed and it is held that royalty payable under an outstanding lease will\nnot be apportioned after a partition of the mineral rights of the lessors, a federal court has concluded that a different result\nshould be reached if the outstanding lease is a community lease. In reaching the conclusion that royalty payable under the\ncommunity lease should continue to be apportioned after a voluntary partition of the mineral rights by the lessors, the court\nmade a careful analysis of Japhet (applying the nonapportionment doctrine) and Parker (applying apportionment under the\ncommunity lease concept), and made the following perceptive comment:\n\n        “As we pointed out previously, Japhet and Parker have been distinguished on two grounds. First, a purchaser of a\n        subdivided section of land under a lease is deemed to have purchased with ‘his eyes wide open to the rights of the\n        various parties.’ Second, a single lessor is different from joint lessors because he cannot form a community with\n        himself. Strict adherence to the second distinction perhaps even compels continuance of the apportionment\n        presumption in a partition after unitization. Before the partition the parties have formed the community which was\n        lacking in Japhet. The first distinction requires that no presumption be placed either for or against apportionment.\n        With their eyes wide open, the parties joined a community and allowed one lessee to treat the lands as a unit. Their\n        act of cooperation was based on a profit incentive, and each expected to reap benefits. Can it be said that each\n        party to the partition then abandoned his assurance of royalties in favor of a gamble that the lessee would drill on\n        his contributed land? At least no presumption to that effect can be defended when the instruments do not so\n        provide.

One such facet involves the\nrespective rights of the lessor and the grantee as between themselves. The other fact involves the respective rights of the lessor\nand grantee as against the lessee. An analysis of both facets of the problem is aided by a consideration of certain fundamentals.\n\nThe right to receive royalties under an oil and gas lease is one of the separately alienable incidents of ownership of the\nminerals.1 Although such right is capable of being alienated separately, the right to receive royalties will pass with a\nconveyance of the minerals, unless such right is expressly reserved or excepted.2 Further, although the right to receive royalty\nbears some resemblance to the right to receive rent and there have been instances where the law relating to rent has controlled\nthe results reached with respect to the right to receive royalty,3 there is an important difference which must be recognized.\nOrdinarily, rent is not apportionable as to time and does not accrue from day to day but is payable to the owner of the reversion\non the date that the rent becomes payable. Oil and gas royalties, on the other hand, ordinarily accrue from day to day and are\nregarded as being apportionable as to time even though provision may be made in the lease for an accounting period.\n\nIn the instance of the royalty which is payable as the result of oil production, the oil and gas lease commonly provides that the\nlessee shall deliver, to the lessor or to the lessor’s credit in a pipeline, a portion of the oil produced and saved.4 In the instance\nof the royalty which is payable as the result of gas production, the lease commonly provides that the lessee shall pay to the\nlessor an amount to be determined either by the value of gas produced or by the proceeds of the sale of such gas.5 In both such\ninstances, the payment of royalty is not made on the basis of the passage of time. The payment is made to compensate the\nlessor for the lessor’s share of a substance that has been removed, and except in the rare instance where a fixed periodic gas\nrental might be used,6 the amount of the royalty bears no relation to the passage of time. Provision is occasionally made for the\nlessee to make payments or to account periodically, but such a provision does not change the nature of the payment. Such a\nprovision is obviously designed to solve a mechanical problem incident to payment and is not designed to alter substantive\nrights.\n\nAccordingly, although the analysis suggested above has not necessarily been applied in the cases as a basis for decision, it has\nbeen uniformly held or assumed in connection with a related holding that, if after an oil and gas lease has been granted, the\nlessor should convey the minerals without exception or reservation or should otherwise make a complete disposition of the\nright to receive royalty payments, such lessor is entitled to receive those royalty payments which have accrued to the date of\nthe conveyance.7 With very rare exception,8 it has likewise been held or assumed that the right to receive royalty passes with a\ndevise or conveyance or inheritance of the mineral interest\n\n1   See § 15.1.\n2   See § 14.1.\n3See, e.g., Handlan v.

Gormley, 184 Pa 354, 39 Atl 57 (1898), in which the court regarded the right to receive royalty\nunder an oil and gas lease as a personal right of the lessor which did not pass with a devise of the land upon the death of the lessor.\n\f                                                  3-42 Kuntz, Law of Oil and Gas § 42.6\n\n\nand that royalty which accrues after the date of passage of title properly belongs to the grantee, devisee, or heir of the lessor, as\nbeing incident to the interest which was acquired by virtue of the conveyance, devise, or inheritance.9\n\nThe problem of determining which parties are entitled to receive royalty after the lessor has made a conveyance has a different\nappearance when considered from the standpoint of the lessee. From the standpoint of the lessee, the problem is one of\ndetermining what is required to discharge a liability. The lessee must pay the royalty to the party entitled to receive it, and a\npayment to the wrong party is no defense in an action by the party who is entitled to receive the royalty.10 Consequently, it is\nof considerable importance to the lessee to be able to establish the effective date of a change in the parties entitled to receive\nroyalty.\n\nAlthough the effective date of the passage of title will control the right to receive royalty as between the lessor and the person\nto whom the mineral interest was conveyed, such date may or may not be the controlling date for purposes of determining the\nlessee’s liability. Such date may be controlled by statutory provisions for notice. More likely, such date will be controlled by\nthe presence of a provision in the oil and gas lease which provides that no change of ownership of the lessor’s interest is\nbinding on the lessee until a prescribed form of notice is given to such lessee.11\n\nAccording to the operation of the change of ownership clause, the lessee is not required to recognize any change in ownership\nof the lessor’s right to receive royalty until after receipt of the notice prescribed by such clause. Accordingly, until there is\ncompliance with such charge of ownership clause, the lessee may discharge the liability to pay royalty by making payment in\naccordance with the status of title prior to any such change.12\n\n           [b] Conveyance of undivided interest by lessor.\n\nSimilar to the situation where the lessor conveys the entire interest after having granted an oil and gas lease,13 if the lessor\nconveys an undivided interest in the minerals after having granted an oil and gas lease, the resulting problem has two facets.\nOne facet involves the respective rights of the lessor and the grantee toward one another. The other facet involves the\nrespective rights of the lessor and the grantee as against the lessee.\n\nWith respect to the first facet of the problem, the principles which are applicable to a conveyance by the lessor of the entire\ninterest may be applied with equal validity to the situation where the lessor conveys an undivided interest after having granted\nan oil and gas lease. With respect to the undivided interest conveyed, the grantor is entitled to all royalties attributable to such\ninterest which have accrued up to the date of passage of title, and the grantee is entitled to all royalties attributable to such\ninterest which are payable as the result of production on and after such date. The parties are cotenants after title has passed to\nan undivided interest in the minerals, and the remedies incident to such cotenancy are available to each cotenant if the other\ncotenant has received and retained more than a proper share of the royalty payable under the lease.14 A cotenant is not,\nhowever, limited to such remedies against another cotenant but is entitled to proceed directly against the lessee.\n\n9 See Osborn v.

The special problem which is\nintroduced when an undivided interest is conveyed is the problem of whether the lessee is required to pay each cotenant\nseparately, is entitled to pay them jointly, or is entitled to discharge the liability by paying the entire amount to one of them as\njoint obligee.\n\nIn a very early case, the right to receive royalty was treated as the right to receive rent, and it was recognized that if a single\nlessor should grant an oil and gas lease and subsequently convey an undivided interest, an apportionment is necessary. It was\nheld, however, that if cotenants grant a single lease they become joint obligees and if one of the cotenants conveys an interest,\nthere is no apportionment and the lessee may pay the entire royalty to any one of the lessor’s as a joint obligee, either before or\nafter the conveyance.16 Under the principles applied in such case, if a sole lessor conveyed an undivided interest in the\nminerals after having granted an oil and gas lease, each cotenant lessor would be entitled to a share of royalty, and a payment\nby the lessee to one of them as a joint obligee or to their joint account as joint obligees would not discharge the lessee’s\nobligation. If, however, the oil and gas lease were granted by joint lessors, then they would be joint obligees, and a payment of\nroyalty to any one of the lessors or to all lessors jointly would satisfy the lessee’s obligation. Further, a conveyance by any one\nof such joint obligees would not change the lessee’s right to discharge the liability to the lessors as joint obligees.\n\nEven though the principles just described would otherwise apply, it must be assumed that the modern oil and gas lease, with its\nprovisions for assignments and notice of change of ownership, and the common practices used in the delivery and sale of\nroyalty oil17 and royalty gas18 demonstrate an intention that each owner of an undivided interest in the minerals is entitled to\nthe receipt of such owner’s share of the royalty, even though the lease was originally granted by joint lessors. If, after an oil\nand gas lease has been granted, the lessor or one of the lessors should convey an undivided interest in the minerals or otherwise\ndisposes of the right to receive a part of the royalties payable under such lease, the lessee is required to make future royalty\npayments in the correct proportions to the new owners, after having received proper notice of such change in ownership.19\n\n         [c] Conveyance of interest in subdivided part of leased premises by lessor.20\n\nIf, after having granted an oil and gas lease, the lessor should convey an interest in a subdivided part of the leased premises, a\nquestion may arise with respect to the rights of such grantee to share in production realized under such lease. Specifically, the\nquestion which may arise is whether the grantee of such subdivided interest should share proportionately in the royalty on all\nproduction under the lease regardless of the locations of the wells or whether such grantee is entitled to participate only in the\nroyalty on production which is realized from wells drilled on the subdivided part in which an interest is owned. Stated as\ngeneral matter, the problem is whether or not royalties are apportioned among the owners of mineral interests in subdivided\nparts of the leased premises if the subdivision occurred after the lease was granted. If, for example, the owner of an eighty-acre\ntract of land should grant an oil and gas lease and then convey to another the entire interest in a forty-acre portion of the leased\npremises, will such grantee be entitled to one-half of the royalty on production from any well on the eighty acres, or will such\ngrantee\n\n15   See § 42.6(a).\n16   Swint v.

It was held\nthat the non-apportionment could not be changed retroactively. Burtner-Morgan-Stephens Co. v. Wilson Co., 586 N.E.2d 1062,\n118 O&GR 484 (Ohio 1992).

Such an intention may be found expressed in a provision in the lease or in a\nprovision of the deed or other instrument by which the subdivision was accomplished. A division order may serve as a\nmemorandum of a prior oral agreement for apportioning royalty and render such agreement enforceable.33\n\nThe provision which is deliberately placed in an oil and gas lease to overcome the non-apportionment rule and to provide for\nan apportionment of royalty in the event of a subdivision of the lessor’s interest is the entirety clause. The effect of such clause\nis discussed elsewhere herein.34 A provision which is not placed deliberately in the lease to overcome the non-apportionment\nrule but which might have such effect is the lesser interest clause. The effect of such clause is also discussed elsewhere\nherein.35\n\nIn the instance where the intention to apportion royalties is found in the deed or other instrument by which the subdivision is\naccomplished, the grantor may convey the mineral interest in a specified tract and also convey a royalty interest in the entire\nleased premises. Thus, if an owner of an eighty-acre tract of land grants an oil and gas lease and then subsequently conveys a\none-half interest in a forty-acre tract but also provides that the interest is subject to a described outstanding lease and further\nstates that the grantee is to be entitled to receive one-half of the royalty payable under such lease, the grantee of such deed will\nreceive a conveyance of a one-half mineral interest in forty acres subject to a lease covering eighty acres and also a royalty\ninterest in the entire eighty acres for the duration of such lease. The following quoted provision was construed to have such an\neffect:\n\n“It is understood and agreed that this sale is made subject to said lease, but covers and includes one-half of all the oil royalty\nand gas rental or royalty due to be paid under the terms of said lease …”36\n\nA similar provision appeared in the deed which was involved in another reported case, but the point was not discussed.37\n\nA mere mention of the outstanding oil and gas lease should not be sufficient to have the effect of a conveyance of a royalty\ninterest in the entire leased premises. Such a provision is easily accounted for as a protective measure to\n\n29See Stratton v. Kentucky & West Virginia Gas Co., 298 Ky 651, 183 SW(2d) 817 (1944). See also Collins v. Inland Gas Corp.

Thus, the language which is quoted\nbelow and which was contained in a deed was held not to require an apportionment of royalties under the outstanding lease\nmentioned.\n\n“It is expressly understood and agreed that there is an oil, gas and mineral lease now in effect covering the above described\ntract together with other acreage, and the Grantors hereby convey and assign unto Grantees all their right, title and interest as\nLessors under said lease so far as it applied to the above described tract of land, save and except the one-sixteenth (1/16th)\nroyalty interest hereinabove provided … to have and to hold the above described premises together with all and singular the\nrights and appurtenances thereto in anywise belonging subject, however, to the royalty reservation hereinabove provided.”38\n\nSpecifically, the court held that the use of the term “appurtenances” in the habendum clause of the deed did not reveal an\nintention to convey a royalty interest in the entire tract covered by the lease. Similarly, it has been observed that such an\nintention may or may not be expressed in the following language:\n\n“This sale is made subject to the above mentioned oil and gas lease and to the above mentioned royalty deed but covers and\nincludes the above described land in fee simple together with all rentals and royalties due under said lease together with all\nreversionary rights and other rights of every kind and character owned by grantor.”39\n\nIf the oil and gas lease or related agreement make provision for payments other than the conventional delay rental and royalty\npayments, problems might be encountered in determining whether such payments should be treated as delay rentals and\napportioned as to acreage or should be treated as royalty and not apportioned. It is to be expected that the degree to which the\npayment in question resembles either a delay rental or a royalty payment will govern the decision. Thus, in one instance\npayments which, according to an agreement, were made in lieu of further development after an initial producing well had been\ndrilled were regarded as bearing more resemblance to a delay rental than a royalty and hence were apportioned among the\nmineral owners of subdivisions of the land under lease.40 On the other hand, in another instance, payments to be made under a\nminimum production covenant were regarded as bearing more resemblance to royalty payments and hence were not subject to\napportionment.41\n\nAfter a lessor has conveyed interests so that there are separate owners of subdivided portions of the land subject to the lease,\nthere is nothing to prevent such owners from entering into any arrangement among themselves for pooling their interests or\napportioning the royalty payable under such lease. There is no reason why they cannot make cross-conveyances of royalty\ninterests with the duration of such interests limited to the duration of the lease. Further, upon termination of the existing lease,\nthere is no reason why the parties cannot then enter into a community lease and provide for an apportionment of the royalty\npayable under such a lease.42 Difficulties might arise, however, when the parties enter into a transaction after they have\nacquired their subdivided interest and do not make their intentions clear.\n\nIf, after the existing lease terminates, the owners of interests in the subdivided tracts were to join in the granting of a common\noil and gas lease covering all of such tracts, such conduct would be regarded as revealing an intention to enter into a\ncommunity lease in many jurisdictions.43 It is doubtful, however, that a ratification or extension of an existing oil and gas lease\nby the owners of the subdivided tracts would be similarly regarded.

The principle circumstance\nwhich distinguishes such transactions is the matter of timing. The parties may pool their interests by entering into a community\nlease, or they may grant the leases and thereafter accomplish the same objective by subsequent agreement. There has been no\ndemonstrated tendency on the part of the courts to treat such circumstance of timing as a significant factor. The view has been\nexpressed that the situation where the lessors join in a community lease is not distinguishable from the situation where the\nlessors subsequently enter into a pooling or unitization agreement after granting separate leases.47\n\nIf, after having joined in a community lease or in a pooling or unitization agreement, a lessor should convey all or part of the\nmineral interest subject to such lease or agreement, a question is likely to arise with respect to the right of the grantee to\nparticipate in the royalty on production which is realized from wells drilled on other land covered by the transaction. The\nanswer to such question will depend upon the theory entertained with respect to the effect of entering into a community lease\nor pooling agreement, and if the theory is entertained that the parties exchange conveyances, the answer will also depend upon\nthe further theory as to the nature of the interests which are acquired by the cross-conveyances.\n\nIn those jurisdictions inclined toward the theory that community leases or pooling or unitization agreements do not result in\ncross-conveyances but create contractual rights among the parties, it is helpful in analyzing their rights and duties to identify\nthe contractual provision involved. The contractual provision under consideration is the royalty clause in the lease granted, as\nit may be modified by a pooling or unitization agreement. Regardless of any such modification, such clause remains the source\nof the rights and duties. Accordingly, a lessor who conveys an interest in the minerals will, to the extent of the interest granted,\npart with the right to participate in royalty from production on the land covered by the agreement. The grantor parts with the\nright to participate in royalty produced from the owned land because such right follows the title.\n\nSuch grantor also parts with the right to royalty on production from the other land covered by the community lease or\nunitization agreement because the right to such royalty stems from the covenant in the lease that runs with the land or mineral\ninterest conveyed.\n\nIt may also be reasoned that the grantor parts with the right to participate in royalty from the other land because such right\narises by virtue of the contribution of land to the community of interest, and a lessor who disposes of an interest in land that\nwas contributed to such community is no longer making the contribution required for participation. The successor in interest is\nthe one making the contribution and should receive the compensating benefits.48\n\n44   See Seal v. Banes, 183 Okla 203, 80 P(2d) 657 (1938).\n45   See Raley v.

There are reasons to believe, however, that the cross-conveyance theory will not be applied\nrigidly. It has been held that production from one tract covered by a community lease will prevent the termination of a\nterminable mineral interest in another tract covered by such community lease. In so holding, the court made the explanation\nwhich is set forth below and which reveals an attitude that each lessor enjoys a share of royalty on production from another\ntract because it is agreed that production shall be treated as coming from all parts of the leased premises. Under such\nreasoning, the right to receive royalty from production which is realized from wells located on other land covered by the\ncommunity lease would necessarily follow the ownership of each tract of land contributed to the community lease.\n\n“As between the lessors themselves, each relinquishes his right to have his own tract separately developed, his right to receive\nall of the royalties from production from wells on his own tract, and his right to have wells drilled on his tract off-setting other\nwells on the leased premises, and each gains the right to share proportionately in royalties from wells on the other included\ntracts. In short, the parties by the execution of a unitized lease agree that production\n\n49   Thomas v. Ley, 177 Okla 150, 57 P(2d) 1186 (1936).\n50 “By executing the community lease, the respondents and each of the other lessors assigned or conveyed to his colessors a percentage\ninterest in all oil produced on his land by the lessee during the continuance of the lease. The consideration for that transfer was the similar\nmutual assignments of the other lessors. The royalty interest thus transferred by each landowner to his colessors is an incorporeal\nhereditament in gross … and the grantee’s interest in the oil produced upon the property of one of the colessors is entirely separate and\ndistinct from the royalty interest retained by him in oil which might be produced from his own premises.” Tanner v.

By joining in the lease they\nnecessarily agreed to the legal consequences that production from any of the tracts would be regarded as production from all\nother included tracts.

Effect of Subsequent Conveyances\n     One of the legal problems which is particularly crea ted\n  by the doct rine that the act of pooling or unitization\n  effec ts a cross -con veya nce of the real prop erty inter ests\n  {royalty or working interest} in the various tract s com-\n  prising the unit is that of dealing with conv eyan ces of\n  the sepa rate tract s mad e after the form ation of the\n  unit. This prob lem generally arises where the conv ey-\n ance of the sepa rate tract , or of some inter est in the\n sepa rate tract , is acco mpli shed by a deed or othe r form\n of conv eyan ce which makes no rrent ion of the unit or\n of the statu s of the tract in the unit. It is part of the\n very natu re of the prob lem that it will ordinarily relat e\n to the ownership of the unit royalty interests, since if\n there is a multiple working inter est ownership and a con-\n veya nce is mad e of working inter est in a segr egat ed\ntract the parti es to such a trans actio n will generally pro-\nvide expr es.sly and in sufficient detai l for the inten ded\neffec t of the conv eyan ce with resp ect to the unit. As\ntime goes on an increasing num ber of roya lty trans ac-\ntions are hand led in the same manner. But it is inherent\nthat roya lty trans fers will not always be tend ed with\ncare, and it is also inhere~+ that even after a unit is\nform ed the parti es are naturally inclined to rega rd their\nlegal titles as occu pyin g the same statu s as their statu s\n\f170        VOLUNTA RY POOLING AND UNITIZA TION\n\n\nprior to pooling or unitization, burdene d · only with the\naddition al contrac t covenan t. of sharing of product ion.\nThus many subsequ ent conveya nces inevitab ly are pre-\npared on an individual tract basis, without mention of the\nprior pooling or unitization of the particul ar tract with\nother tracts. In a produci ng unit this type of convey-\nance imposes a substan tial burden upon the purchas er\nof the product ion or other party paying the royalties\nsince he must determi ne, if he can, the legal effect of the\npurport ed c.o nveyan ce of an entire tract, or of some speci-\nfied interest in the tract, represen ting only a portion of\nthe unit area.\n\n\nIllustration of the Problem\n   In this instance again the problem is perhaps best illus-\ntrated by simplified hypothe tical facts. It may be as-\nsumed that A , B, C, and D each leases his separate ly-\nowned I 0-acre tract to the same lessee, X. Subsequ ently\nA, B, C, and. D enter into a pooling agreem ent with X in\nwhich the four tracts are pooled to form the 40-acre\ndrilling unit required by the spacing rules for the field\nfor the drilling of one well. X then drills a well on the\ntract contrib uted to the unit by A and it is an oil pro-\nducer. Subsequ ently B conveys his I 0-acre tract to E\nunder the usual form of warr_a nty deed which describ es\nonly that tract and makes no referenc e to the pooling\nagreem ent. This, of course, represen ts the most sim-\nplified version of the problem , but it is typical of trans-\nactions occurrin g constan tly within the boundar ies of\noil and gas units and involving fieldwide units as well as\nsingle-well drilling units.\n\f               SEPARATE POOLING AGREEMENT                171\n\nApplication of the Cross-Conveyance Theory\n    The most pressing question in the situation illustrated\nabove is that of what royalty interest, if any. E has ac-\nquired in the productio n from the well on A's tract by\nvirtue of the simple warranty deed describin g B's tract.\n If the cross-con veyance doctrine of pooling is applied\nwithout modificat ion, as it seemingly should be in juris-\ndictions which purport to follow the theory of the Veal\nand Belt cases, the act of pooling resulted in the owner-\nship by each A, B. C. and D of ! of the royalty interest\nin each of the four tracts. Since B could convey to E\nno more than he owned in the tract described in the\ndeed he. may have conv.eyed to E at most the surface,\nthe reversion ary interest, and only *of the royalty interest\nin that tract. Such an analysis leaves B. even after the\nconveyan ce, with ownership of ! of the royalty in eoch\nof the tracts contribut ed to the unit by A , C. and D.\nThis results, then, in the continued ownership by B of ! of\nthe royalty on the productio n from A's tract, while E.\nthe grantee, 9oes not participa te in such productio n ot\nall. It is probably . although not necessarily, true that\nB and E did not at all contempl ate such a result. They\nno doubt intended that with the unconditional convey-\nance of B's tract would go all interest in the unit produc-\ntion which was initially derived from the ownership of\nthat tract. But in the light of such doctrine as that of\nthe Veal and Belt cases are they defeated in their pur-\npose by the failure of the deed expressly to convey, not\nonly the ·t ract described , but all of B's royalty interest\nin the entire unit? Moreover , can the latter conveyan ce\nbe accompH shed by anything less than an adequate legal\ndescriptio n, by reference or otherwise, of all of the land\n\f172         VOLUNTARY POOLING A~'l> UNITIZATION\n\n\n  comprising the unit? Or, on the other hand, . without all\n  this, does all\" of B's parti.cipation in the unit follow the\n ownership of his tract?                 .\n     It is apparent that a strict application of the Veal and\n  Belt decisions to the situation illustrated above results in\n the acquisition by the grantee of no participation in the\n royalty on the unit production while the grantor, having\n conveyed his entire ownership in the tract which consti-\n tuted his sole initial contribution to the unit, nevertheless\n retains · as great a royalty participation in the unit pro-\n duction as he had absent the conveyance. The situa-\n tion is, of course, aggravated by the location of the unit\n well on a tract other than that conveyed. Were the\n unit well located on the tract conveyed the grantee, by\n virtue of his having acquired by the deed all of B's ~ of\n the royalty in that tract, would have no immediate ground\nfor complaint, since at best he is entitled to only ~ of\nthe royalty production. However, the legal question ex-\n ists to the same degree in either case. It is only by a\n coincidence of circumstances that the grantee sustains\n no actual loss in the latter case on account of the seem-\ningly defective deed so long as the unit production is\nfrom the tract conveyed to him.                             .\n    There are infinite variations of the situation illustrated\nabove. The conveyance to E might have been of a\nfractional undivided interest in the tract or in the miner-\nals or royalties in the tract. \"Such variations serve to\ncomplicate the facts but the basic issue remains the same.\nIn other circumstances the tract conveyed may represent\nonly a small part of a fieldwide unit, complicating the\nmatter still further. But still the fundamental problem\n~s the same.\n\f               SEPARATE POOLING AGREEMENT                173\nAvailable Interpretations\n    Even in the situation illustrated above there is a pos-\n sible interpret ation beyond those stated-i .e., the in-\n                                                   *\n terpretat ion, on the one hand, which gives E of the\n royalty in the tract conveyed with no royalty interest in\nthe ref!1aining tracts in the unit and the interpret ation,\non the other hand, which gives E all of B's participa tion\nin the unit which was initially derived from the tract con-\nveyed as an incident of the ownership in such tract.\nThe third interpret ation is a comprom ise, perhaps one of\nmerit. This interpret ation would recognize that by vir-\ntue of the cross-assignment theory of pooling B owned\n     *\nonly of the royalty in the tract conveyed and that only\nsuch royalty interest in only such tract is conveyed to\nE under the deed-bu t subject immediat ely to the pool-\ning agreemen t, so that the ! interest of E in the single\ntract is pooled with the retained ~ interest of B in the\nremaining tracts. If this interpreta tion were applied and\nthe pooling had been in proportio n to acreage as illus-\ntrated, E would become the owner of I I 16 of the roy-\nalty on the productio n from the unit well, while B would\nretain 3/16 of such royalty. It !s not likely that this third\nsuggeste d interpret ation is actua.lly within the contem-\nplation of the grantor and grantee, but this interpret a-\ntion is perhaps as reasonab le as i-he interpret ation which\ndenies the grantee practicall y all of the royalty owner-\nship in the unit which was initially attributa ble to the\ntract presently conveyed .\n\f 174           VOLU NTAR Y POOL ING AND UNIT IZAT ION\n\n\n California Decisions\n     Wit h this back grou nd it is well to cons ider the deci ded\n   case s relating to the effe ct of the conv eyan ce of a\n                                                              seg-\n   rega ted trac t afte r pooling or unitization has been\n                                                                ac-\n  complished.

Since the trust deed did not purpor t\n  to convey specifically the granto r's incorp oreal heredi-\n  tamen t in gross in the produc ing tracts of the commu-\n  nity lease these interes ts did not pass to the purcha ser at\n  the trustee 's sale. 46\n\n   4&   I 29 P. 2d 383, 387 ( 1942).\n   48   Several more recent California decisions have confirmed\n and applied this rule of the Tanner cas~. See Howard v. General\n Petroleum Corp., 108 Cal. App. 2d 25, 238 P. 2d 145, 148 (1951),\n on second appeal. I I 4 Cal. App. 2d 91, 249 P. 2d 585: Brown v.\nCopp, 105 Cal.

Cali-\nfornia Petroleum & Asphalt Co., 109 Cal. 304, 41 P. 1087, 1088\n(I 895). There orie of the community lessors had conveye d his\nseparat e tract to the lessee. Since the only product ion was\nfrom the tract conveye d and the lessor-grantor was not a party\nto the suit the point involved in the cases cited above was not\nactually in issue. But in noteworthy dictum the court seemed\nto constru e the effect of the conveya nce of the separat e tract in\nthe same manner as if the grantor had been a tenant in common\nin both tracts covered by the community lease and had conveye d\nall of her interest in the whole to the lessee. The courts in the\nlater cases obviously did not choose +o follow th is analysis.\n\f 1'76         VOLUNT A.R Y POOLIN G AND UNITIZA TION\n\n\nDecision of Federal Court - Oklahoma\n     Perhap s in accord with the result of the Tanner de-\n  cision, but employing an entirely differe nt means of ar-\n  riving at such result, is the decision of the Federa l court\n  in Oklaho ma in Boren v. Burgess. 47 There an undivided\n mineral interest in a segreg ated tract was convey ed after\n the tract had been included with other land in a community\n lease. Production was secure d by· the lessee only on the\n land in the community lease which was not descri bed in\n the convey ance. The grante e of the mineral interes t in\n the segreg ated tract asserte d his right to partici pate on\n a pro rata acreag e basis in the royalty on the produc -\n tion elsewhere on the community lease. The court re-\n jected this claime d partici pation, reasoning that the ques-\n tion presen ted was whethe r the owner of an interes t in\n a subdivision of a tract of land covere d by a single\n lease has a right to partici pate in the royalty from oil\n produc ed on other subdivisions and holding that under\n Oklahoma law the royalty belongs solely to the owners\nof the land on which the well is locate d. It is not\nclearly appare nt from the opinion whethe r the court\nheld that the community lease did not effect a pooling\nof the tracts for royalty purposes in the first instanc e or\nthat the initial pooling was accom plished . but that the\ncc;:mveyance of an interes t in a separa te tract subseql:Jent\nto the pooling comple tely segreg ated that interes t.\nHowev er, the author ities cited by the court have no\nrelatio n to the first propos ition of no pooling in the first\ninstance, but suppor t only the propos ition that when\nthe land covere d by. the ordina ry lease is later subdiv ided\n\n  47    97 F.

It requi res a\n much lesser mental burde n to arrive at this conclusion\n wher e the found ation rule of cross -conv eyanc es of real\n prope rty intere sts as effec ted by pooli ng or unitization\n is avoid ed in the first instan ce. If this rule of law be\n avoid ed then the effec t of pooling or unitization is to\nleave the estat es in real prope rty as they exist prior to\n pooling or unitization but to impo se upon each such\nestat e the propo rtion ate burde n and benef it of the shar-\ning of unit produ ction after produ ction is achie ved.\nThus the pooli ng or unitization agree ment creat es a shar-\ning cove nant which runs with the land and other intere sts\nin real prope rty. Any conv eyanc e of any such intere st,\nwhet her expre ssly state d or not, would then be subje ct\nto the terms of the pooling or unitization agree ment\n(assuming actua l or const ructiv e notic e to the grant ee\nof the existe nce of such agree ment ) and would carry\nwith it the propo rtion ate benef its and burde ns of the\nsharin g arran geme nt speci fied in the agree ment .

Proportion-\nately smaller interests in the royalty in the other unit\ntracts would pass with a smaller interest conveyed in\nthe tract described. The description of the other tracts\nin the unit would necessarily be implied from the unit\nagreement of which the grantee will almost invariably\nhave actual or constructive notice. Such reasoning as\nthis conflicts with the ruling of the California court that\nthe royalty interest of the lessor in the land of his co-\nlessors in the unit is a right or interest in gross and is,\ntherefore, not transferred unless specifically conveyed.\nHowever, it is believed that such interest in land of the\ncolessors is better treated as a right or interest appur-\ntenant, rather than in gross.\n   The principal objective, where overriding considera-\ntions of public policy are not involved, is to give effect\nto the probable intention of the parties in the transac-\ntion.

H<;>wever, the case of the con-\nveyance after pooling will ordinarily provide even a\nstronger case in logic for the continued enforcement of\nthe apportionment under the pooling agreement since\nthe pqoling agreement in this situ\"ation is obviously in-\ntended as a covenant which will run with the land and bind\nall future purchasers and is just as .obviously a reasonable\nrestraint on the future alienation of the lands comprising\nthe unit.\n\nProcedure for Purchaser\n   From what has been said it is apparent that this prob-\nlem has not yet been fully developed and decided by\nthe courts in most of the oil and gas jurisdictions. It is\nlikewise apparent that the problem will furnish the basis\nfor future litigation and that the purchasers or other\nparties charged with the duty of making payment for unit\nproduction meanwhile can not feel wholly secure in mak-\ning such payments to the grantor or grantee in the type\nof situation envisaged here in those jurisdictions in which\nthe matter has not been fully dealt with in the appellate\ncourts. It would behoove such parties charged with pay-\ning for unit production to suspend payments attributable\nto the interests involved in such situation until the grantor\nand grantee have both agreed more fully with respect to\nthe effect of their transaction, preferably by a further\ninstrument in recordable form so that the title question\nmay be permanently cleared for all purposes.

The Nonco nsentin g Mineral or\n                     Royalty Owner\n   One of the import ant catego ries of legal proble ms\nin the field of voluntary pooling and unitization is the\ncatego ry which center s on the position of the mineral or\nroyalty owner who refuses to join in the pooling or uni-\ntizatio n agreem ent. The proble m of nonjoinder is a\ntrouble some one for the nonjoining party himself, since he\nmay feel sincerely that his individual interes t and rights\nwill be seriously jeopar dized by his partici pation in the\npooling or unitization arrang ement, yet he must recogn ize\nat the same time that in many instances his interes t will\nbe affecte d by the operat ion of the unit even though he\ndoes not partici pate. In the case of the operat or or\nlessee in the unit, on the other hand, the proble m create d\nby the refusal of mineral or royalty owners to join can\nbe even more trouble some. The nonjoinder create s the\nnecess ity in many instances for a separa te accoun ting for\nproduc tion--o ne accoun ting to the pooled interes ts and\nyet anothe r type of accoun ting to the unpool ed interes ts.\nMoreover, the metho d of operat ion of the unit may be\nsubstantially affecte d by the existen ce of unpool ed in-\nterests , and may give rise to the necess ity for drilling\ninterio r offset wells, one of the very things the pooling\nor unitization is design ed to eliminate.

It is stated in the facts\n       that the 3,296-acre tract was common ly owned by Taub,\n       Dwyer, and Mrs. McCall before its partition into sixteen\n       sep<lfate tracts. The land was under three oil and gas leases\n       at the time of partition. When a tract is portitioned, the\n       minerals and the surface usually remain together. In the\n       principal agreement, it was provided that each continued to\n       own a stipulated interest as ex.isted in the tracts prior to parti-\n       tion and that in future leases, each would continue to own\n       a stipulated royalty interest in the tracts of others. ln other\n       words, each became a nonparticipating royalty owner of the\n       agreed fraction in the other tracts. Their agreement was unlike\n       that involved in Garza v. Montalvo, 1 where the siblings\n       pm1itioned their jointly owned I ,100 acres, which tract was\n       under tense. No mention was made in the partition of the oil\n       and gas Iealie or the minerals. The subsequent production was\n       held to belong solely to the owner of the tract on which the\n       producing well was located.\n             No mention was made of any production from Mrs.\n       McCall's tract during the period of time involved in the\n\n   12L7 S.W. 2d 988 (Tex.

McCALL                              417\n\n        principal case. The production at issue was from the eight\n        new wells drilled on tbe Taub and Dwyer tracts.\n              The question arises as to the creation of Mrs. McCall's\n        interest in production from the others' tracts. One possibility\n        is that her interest was similar in principle to that set forth\n        in Veal v. Thomason, 2 in which owners of separate minerals\n        in separate tracts committed them to a unit agreement under\n        which each tract would share in the production from the other\n        tracts, and Parker v. Parker, 3 where owners of separate tracts\n        signed a single lease combining their tracts, with it being held\n        that each tract shared in subsequent production from the\n        others. Such transactions are frequently refen·ed to as cross-\n        conveyances; the interest being conveyed is a royalty, an\n        interest in real property.\n              The facts in the opinion state that the pat1ition agreement\n        provided that each was to continue to own the existing interest\n        at the time of partition \"in each of the tracts granted to the\n        other parties.\" If this existing interest was a continuation of\n        the jointly owned interest in the other tracts and each tract\n        partitioned was burdened with the existing lease and royalty\n        ownership, then it would appear, as stated above, that each\n        would continue to own a nonparticipating royalty interest in\n        all of the tracts. Mrs. McCall would then own a royalty inter-\n        est in each of the producing tracts on the Taub and Dwyer\n        land. But if the ownership in each other's land had been a\n        result of a cross-conveyance, then the issue would be con-\n        trolled by Veal and related cases.\n              In any event, there was no problem as to whether Mrs.\n        McCall and her assignees would share in the production on\n        the other tracts. T he case turned on whether Mrs. McCall\n        assigned an interest in the disputed production to Lila under\n        the deed in which she was a grantee or conveyed this royalty\n        in the deed executed in the 1997 conveyance to her three\n        children, excluding Lila.\n              The following analysis of the deed under which Lila\n        claimed an interest in production of the eight new wells on\n        the Taub and Dwyer tracts is in contrast and conflict with\n\n   2   159 S.W. 2d 472 (Tex.

If\n        Exhibit A described the 3,298-acre transaction, then the roy-\n        alty interest owned by Mrs. McCall in the tracts of the others\n        would be included in the description, but if Exhibit A included\n        only those tracts partitioned by Mrs. McCall, then the ques-\n        tion would involve the conveyance of royalty in tracts not\n        desc'r ibed in the deed, but which would be included as an\n        appurtenance to Mrs. McCall's royalty in the tracts of the\n        others under the cross-conveyance theory.\n               In Harris v. Currie, 5 it is stated: \"When the owner of\n        the entire estate in land conveys it by an ordinary form of\n        deed containing no exception or reservation, hls grantee\n        acquires the same title whlch the grantor had and such title\n        includes all minerals.\" The case held that delay rentals under\n        an oil and gas lease are a part of the mineral eslate, and that\n        unaccrued delay rentals, although not mentioned in the deed,\n        pass as a patt of the mineral estate to the grantee. This rule\n       ·has been cited as authority that a deed conveys the grantor's\n        interest in the tract, including the minerals, less those ex-\n        cepted or reserved. 6 If Mrs. McCall had expressly stated in\n        her conveyance that she conveyed only the trac ts that she\n        owned after the partition, she would have also, under 1he rule\n        stated in Harris, conveyed her royally interest in the Taub\n        and Dwyer tracts. This is the rule that where 1he owner of\n        a tract included in a pooled unit sells his tract, then his con-\n        veyance also includes his interest in the production from the\n\n   4 Supra at     p. 404.\n   5 176 S.W. 2d  302, 304 (Tex.

The royalty interest that Mrs. McCall owned both\n       in her tracts and in the other tracts is a part of her mineral\n       estate, and although unmentioned in a conveyance of the\n       ordinary deed form, would pass under Harris.\n             Day & Co., Inc. v. Texland Petroleum Co., Inc., 7 was\n       cited by Lila for the rule from Harris and Cockrell. The court\n       distinguished Day by stating that the deed in that case only\n       purported to convey ten acres of the ninety-acre tract. The\n       principal issue in Day was the court's holding that the\n       executive right is neither a power nor akin to a power, but\n       is an attribute of the complete mineral estate, i.e., a \"stick\"\n       that can be separately owned and conveyed. As an interest\n       in the mineral estate, it passed under the warranty deed\n       involved. It is submitted that the royalty interest owed by Mrs.\n       McCall in others' tracts, being an interest in realty, passed\n       under the rule stated by the Texas Supreme Court in Harris,\n       Cockrell, and Day. The application of the rule is a matter of\n       law. If a party contends that by the application of the rule,\n       it does not reach a result intended by the parties, then there\n       is a case for reformation of a mutual mistake. The reasoning\n       that the Day case was not applicable because it applied only\n       to ten acres and not to the entire ninety-acre tract is difficult\n       to follow. Harris and Cockrell were not cited in the opinion.\n             In Harris, the court defined \"appurtenant\" consistently\n       with the definition given in Note 8 of the principal case. 8\n       The comt stated, \"[T]he grant or reservation carries with it,\n       as a necessary appurtenance thereto, the right to use . . . the\n       surface . ... \" 9\n             Lila argued that the word \"appurtenance\" in the war-\n       ranty deed caused the royalty interest in the Taub and Dwyer\n       tracts to pass under the warranty deed. The court rejected this\n       argument, defining \"appurtenance\" in the footnote as limited\n       to that which is necessary to the enjoyment of the principal\n       thing granted or indispensable to the proper use of the\n       premises demised.

This section focuses on\nthe two major approaches to resolving the question of the characterization of what is the post-pooled or unitized title.\n\nIn reviewing the cases and the doctrines it is crucial to remember the context in which the court is deciding whether to\nopt for the contract or cross-conveyance theory. A decision relating to joinder issues, such as what constitutes a\nnecessary or indispensable party, may have different considerations than a decision relating to whether the Rule Against\nPerpetuities has been violated. Likewise, the plaintiff's views as to the continued validity of the pooled or unitized entity\nmight also impact the court's choice. Finally, in looking at these competing theories or doctrines, most courts are\nsearching for the intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument that created the pooled or unitized title. Many of the\nproblems and differences between jurisdictions are caused by the court's varying interpretations of standard provisions\nin community leases or pooling or unitization agreements. In most of these cases, there is no express statement of intent\nto create contractual rights or property rights. It is that lacunae that these decisions attempt to fill. The emphasis on the\nintent of the parties suggests that when the parties expressly state their preference, the courts will follow that language\nand not resort to the choice made by that state when the parties have left the issue undecided. Two different theories\nhave been developed to describe the nature of the unitized title where the parties to a voluntary pooling and unitization\nagreement have not specified if they intended to convey property rights in the pooled or unitized area. These two\ntheories have been labeled the cross-conveyance (cross-assignment) theory and the contract theory. These theories do\nnot exist in the abstract but in the context of the following issues: who may effect a pooling of interests; who will be\nindispensable parties to litigation regarding the pooled unit; and what is the appropriate venue for litigation. Yet as these\nproblems get resolved by reference to the two theories they mask the underlying issues that are not resolvable by the\nchoice of a cross-conveyance or contract theory.\n\nThe only real issues that could be affected by the adoption of either theory have not been the subject of much litigation.\nFor example, an important issue relates to whether or not the terms of a pooling or unitization agreement are binding on\nassignees. Whether the original agreement was a contract or a cross-conveyance would affect the outcome of that issue.\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 2\n                               2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.01\n\n\n\nThe descendability or inheritability of pooled or unitized interests would also be affected by the choice of doctrine.\nOther issues such as the affect of recordation of instruments, third party rights and/or liabilities, and the impact of lien\nand other security interest statutes would also be impacted by the characterization decision as a contract or a\ncross-conveyance of property interests.\n\nWhatever the context of the dispute, the choice between the two doctrines may be outcome determinative. That is, the\nchoice of which doctrine to apply will necessarily lead to a single result. Therefore, it becomes important to have sound\nand easily understood rules that can be applied in an evenhanded manner.\n\nThe two theories develop naturally from the purposes and nature of a pooling or unitization agreement that purports to\ncombine various interests for the purpose of joint operations. In essence, the internal property lines within a pooled unit\nand a unitized area have been erased pursuant to the express terms of the agreement. The two theories attempt to explain\nwhether that combination is property-based or contractually-based. The courts have been trying to deal with oil and gas\nproduction and development that had no counterpart in the traditional estate system developed in medieval England.\nTrying to fit the oil and gas property system in general and the nature of the pooled or unitized title into classical\nproperty theory has led to substantial doctrinal uncertainty. That uncertainty is present in many court decisions relating\nto the two doctrines. The soundest approach to the underlying issue is to treat pooling and unitization agreements as a\nspecial area of contract law, but clearly note that these contracts grow out of, and affect, property rights. Rather than\ntrying to fit these issues into the old bottle of estates-in-land and classic property doctrine, it would be better if a new\nbottle was created that recognizes the interrelationship between contract and property rights and makes a suitable\naccommodation between those rights in order to carry out the intent of the parties without undue interference or\nconfusion from the courts.\n\n     [2] Effects of the Classification Scheme\n\nPerhaps in no other area than the determination of who are indispensable parties has the choice between the contract and\ncross-conveyance theory led to the greatest doctrinal conflict. n2 It is important, however, to place in context many of\nthe cases that were decided in an era in which there was still a substantial distinction between in rem and in personam\njurisdiction. That distinction affected the ability to join parties if the contract or cross-conveyance theory was adopted.\nIn today's world of long-arm statutes, where personal jurisdiction is available on a \"minimum contacts\" theory, one\ncould get jurisdiction over any party who is part of a pooling or unitization agreement, since it is clear that a party to\nthose agreements has sufficient minimum contacts with the jurisdiction regardless of the label attached. The question of\nproceeding with litigation affecting a pooling or unitization agreement, with or without the joinder of all the parties,\nshould not turn on the question of whether the agreement was a contract or cross-conveyance of property interests. The\nunderlying issue should be the impact of the litigation on the rights of the parties, however one classifies those rights.\n\nIt is clear, however, that under most definitions of indispensable parties, if the court applies the cross-conveyance theory\nthe other pooled or unitized owners will be indispensable. However, the converse is not true. A choice of the contract\ntheory does not necessarily lead to a result that the pooled and unitized owners are not indispensable. Whatever its exact\nnature, whether an ordinary contract provision that provides for a changed manner of operation and of calculating\nroyalties or a real covenant that runs with the land, it still cannot be denied that in a title suit involving the title to a tract\nof land committed to the unit that all participants in the unit have an interest in the tract involved. Treating the\nagreement as a contract affecting property interests would more accurately describe what the pooling or unitization\nagreement concerns. Not allowing the contract/cross-conveyance theory to decide issues of indispensable parties is the\nbetter approach. By requiring a more ad hoc exploration of the nature and the agreement of the lawsuit, in order to\nanswer the question of whether the non-joined interests are indispensable, will allow the court to consider such\nimportant and diverse issues as where are the producing well or wells located, what is the allocation formula, and what\nare the minimum or maximum size requirements, if any, that will be affected by a change in ownership on one of the\ntracts.\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                   1 of 1 DOCUMENT\n\n                                     The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition\n\n                Copyright 2014, Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., a member of the LexisNexis Group.\n\n                                     CHAPTER 19 The Nature of the Unitized Title\n\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n§ 19.02 State Analysis\n\n\n\n     [1] Contract Theory States\n\n     [a] Kansas\n\nTwo cases clearly suggest in dictum that Kansas has rejected the cross-conveyance theory and has adopted the contract\ntheory for pooled or unitized titles. The first case, Hover v. Cleveland Oil Co., n101 is typical of court decisions that\nstruggle with the concept of what a unitized title should be but never directly answer the question. Adjacent lessors had\nentered into an agreement whereby they would share certain economic benefits, including oil runs, bonuses, and rentals,\non a surface acreage basis until they mutually agreed otherwise. One of the lessors then conveyed his interests to a third\nparty through the use of a warranty deed. The issue before the court was whether the sale of one of the interests\nterminated the sharing or pooling agreement even when the other parties had not joined in the conveyance. The\napplication of one theory would produce different consequences than the application of the other theory. Under\ncross-conveyance theory, the lessors would each own an undivided interest in the others' interest, and each would\nthereby have conveyed to the others a similar interest in the premises originally owned. Undoubtedly the warranty deed\ndid not mention a reduced share of the described premises, nor did it include the vendor's share of the other premises\nthat were the subject of the pooling agreement. However, if the lessor had merely given contractual rights to the other\nlessors, those could be terminated unilaterally under the provisions of the agreement, and the warranty deed would be\nsatisfied insofar as it transferred all of the vendor's interest in the described premises. Under a contract theory the deed\nwould be effective to transfer a non-pooled interest and, in effect, terminate the pooling agreement.\n\nThe holding of the court would support the contract theory, although the language of the opinion is somewhat\nambiguous. The court found that the pooling agreement had terminated by the sale by one of the parties to the\nagreement. After the sale the seller no longer had anything to contribute to the pooling agreement and the court was\nunwilling to substitute the purchaser for the seller as being bound by the terms of the pooling agreement. n102 If there\nhad been a cross-conveyance of interests, unilateral termination would arguably be impossible unless expressly\nprovided for in the agreement. The pooling agreement would have cross-conveyed interests that would remain with the\nparties until the agreement terminated by its own provisions or until there were later conveyances of the cross-conveyed\ninterests. Thus, the result and the reasoning are consistent with the contract doctrine; all that was created was a\ncontractual right to share, which would terminate upon the transfer of the contributed mineral or royalty interest even in\nthe absence of a formal provision.\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 2\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n\nFurther support for the contract doctrine in Kansas can be inferred from the holding and analysis in Kenoyer v.\nMagnolia Petroleum Co. n103 Kenoyer involved an exercise of a pooling power that was alleged to be in violation of\nthe common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. n104 In ruling that the rule was not applicable to an exercise of the pooling\npower, the court found that the pooling power was not a traditional property-based power but merely a means of\neffecting a contractual change in the way that royalties were to be paid and the leasehold estate operated. Again, if the\ncourt were to have adopted a cross-conveyance theory it would have been much more difficult to dismiss the rule\nchallenge, although states such as Texas that have adopted the cross-conveyance theory also find that the rule is not\nviolated by the exercise of the pooling power. The Kansas court said:\n\n            we fail to see how the provision in question violates the rule against perpetuities. The lease does not\n       create any future estates ... . It granted to lessee the right to operate the lands covered by it separately or\n       as a part of a consolidated unit. The royalty provisions fit either operation and provide a formula by\n       which the amount of royalties payable to the lessor is capable of accurate and definite ascertainment.\n       These rights were vested ... .\n\n            ... .\n\n           In our opinion the rule against perpetuities simply has no application to the provision of the lease\n       under consideration. n105\n\nNo further light has been shed on the problem in Kansas, but the clear indication from Hover and Kenoyer is that\nKansas treats a voluntary pooling and unitization agreement as merely involving the transfer of contractual rights.\n\n     [b] Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma appears to have shifted ground in the cross-conveyance/contract controversy. The early case of Lusk v. Green\nn106 involved whether the signing of a single lease covering two non-contiguous parcels, each owned separately by a\nhusband and wife, constituted a community lease and a pooling of royalty interests. The court eventually concluded that\nthe signing of the single lease with the two parcels described therein did not create a community lease, and, therefore,\nthere was no effective pooling of the separate interests. In reaching that conclusion the court said:\n\n            under the state of facts disclosed by the record in this case, we are not willing to say that, because\n       the lessors executed a lease covering their respective tracts of land, which were not contiguous but\n       several miles apart, on the same piece of paper, that they thereby each intended to convey to the other a\n       half interest in the royalties. n107\n\nOne can infer that if the parties had shown an intent to enter into a community lease or, for that matter, a pooling or\nunitization agreement, they would have in effect cross-conveyed to each other a one half interest in their respective\ntracts. n108\n\nAlthough Lusk received some support in dictum in Amis v. Bryan Petroleum Corp., n109 there were some early signs\nthat there was not widespread support for the cross-conveyance theory. In at least two instances the Oklahoma Supreme\nCourt found that the Statute of Frauds would not be applicable to agreements to pool or apportion royalties. n110 Since\nthe Statute of Frauds requires a writing for conveyances, with a few irrelevant exceptions, it would have been\ninconsistent to state that a pooling agreement amounted to a cross-conveyance of the royalty interests and to find\nsimultaneously that the Statute of Frauds is not applicable. n111\n\nThe death knell for the cross-conveyance theory in Oklahoma began tolling with Sinclair Crude Oil Co. v. Oklahoma\nTax Commission. n112 Oklahoma was seeking to apply the state's gross production and proration tax to royalty oil that\nwas payable to several Indian allottees. The allottees had entered into several unitization agreements that provided them\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 3\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\na proportional share of royalties from production located anywhere on the unit. The basis for the liability was the Tax\nCommission's conclusion that the Indian allottees had conveyed their otherwise tax exempt interest to the other parties\nwho had signed the unit agreement. In exchange they received a cross-conveyance from the other unit members of a\nproportional share of their royalty interests in the entire unit. n113 This newly created interest, according to the Tax\nCommission, did not fall under any of the tax exemption provisions of the otherwise applicable Cherokee Allotment\nAct.\n\nThe unitization agreement did not contain any specific provision relating to the issue of whether the parties intended to\napply a cross-conveyancing or contract theory. Without citing Lusk or Amis the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined\nthat the language of the unitization agreement did not evince an intent to cross-convey the various unitized interests. It\nemphasized the lack of specific words of grant that it concluded were vital to treating a document as a conveyance of a\nproperty interest. It did ignore, however, one provision of the unitization agreement that provided that the agreement\nwould constitute a real covenant running with the land. n114 Under the normal requirements of privity of estate, a real\ncovenant can only be created when there is a transfer of a property interest or a tenurial relationship between the parties,\nsuch as landlord and tenant. In this case there was neither; the language suggesting that the promises contained in the\nagreement were to be construed as real covenants does evince an intent to cross-convey interests that would provide the\nprivity requirement for real covenants. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the absence of words of grant was critical.\nIt said:\n\n            ...in order for the communitization agreements to constitute and effect an exchange, conveyance or\n       cross transfer between the royalty owners of title and ownership to an undivided fractional share and\n       interest in the oil ..., it was essential that the agreements contain adequate operative words such as grant,\n       bargain, convey, or others of like import, sufficient to effect a conveyance of title to the minerals\n       underlying the land ... . n115\n\nThe court emphasized the contractual nature of the agreements when it concluded:\n\n           The communitization agreements here in question constitute a valid form of private contract ... .\n       From a consideration of the agreements as a whole we fail to agree with the findings and holdings of the\n       Tax Commission wherein it holds that the agreements constitute and effect an exchange of title to the\n       mineral or royalty interests ... .\" n116\n\nWhile not citing Lusk, the court was aware of the contrary position on this issue that had been taken in Texas. It clearly\nchose to follow the contract doctrine largely on the basis that the weight of \"persuasive\" authority treated the contract\ndoctrine as the one that more closely reflected the true intent of parties to pooling and unitization agreements not to\neffect a cross-conveyance of their interests. n117\n\nIf further evidence was needed that the Oklahoma Supreme Court had adopted the contract theory, it was provided in\nGarvin v. Pettigrew. n118 In Garvin, some ten owners of both unleased mineral and royalty interests entered into an\nagreement whereby they would share in the royalties that would accrue to each separate tract in proportion to the\nacreage that each contributed to the agreement. Specific language contained in the agreement evinced an intent not to\nconvey or transfer any interest in the lands themselves. n119 The defendant's predecessors had conveyed to that\nplaintiff's predecessors all of the acreage committed to the unit. The plaintiff was seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe defendant was not entitled to share in the benefits of off-unit production. The jury found for the defendant, but the\ntrial court ordered a new trial, concluding that the pooling agreement violated the Rule Against Perpetuities and was\ntherefore void. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's granting of the motion for a new trial but differed as to the\nreason for overturning the jury verdict. Principally relying on the Hover case, the court found that a pooling agreement,\nsuch as the one used in this case, does not result in a cross-conveyance of any royalty or mineral interests. This was\nespecially evident from the specific language of the agreement denying a transfer of any mineral or royalty interests.\nn120 The court could have decided this case on narrower grounds, such as a specific lack of intent to transfer interests\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 4\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nor that the rights to share in unit production were attached to the lands that were contractually contributed and once\nthose lands were no longer owned by a party, the contractual right to shared royalties also expired. n121\n\nThe court's language, however, goes beyond the narrow interpretation of the specific terms and broadly rejects the\ncross-conveyance doctrine. The court stated:\n\n            The contract here involved constituted a pooling agreement. It was so referred to in the record and in\n       the briefs of the parties. It could not have been a conveyance of a mineral interest. Nowhere does it\n       appear therein a granting clause of any kind. Nor was it an assignment of royalties in perpetuity. n122\n\nNonetheless, this broad language must be read in the context of the express disclaimer of interest in the\n\"lands-of-others\" provision of the agreement which was emphasized by the court.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this decision followed Sinclair Crude Oil by about six weeks, yet Sinclair 's clear language\nrejecting a cross-conveyance theory is not cited. This is particularly n123 troublesome since there was a vigorous\ndissenting opinion that clearly preferred an express approval of the cross-conveyance theory for pooling and unitization\nagreements. The majority's emphasis on typical language in the pooling agreement and its failure to overrule Lusk and\ncite Sinclair, muddied the waters of Oklahoma oil and gas jurisprudence until 1970.\n\nIn Tenneco Oil Co. v. District Court n124 the Oklahoma Supreme Court again rejected the cross-conveyance theory for\npooling agreements. The plaintiffs were the lessees of certain lands that were voluntarily unitized; the defendant was\ndeclared the operator of the unit under the unit agreement. The unit was approved by the Corporation Commission. The\nplaintiffs were seeking a partition of the interests committed to the voluntary unitization order. They also sought an\ninjunction prohibiting an expansion of a secondary recovery operation that was being proposed by the unit operator. A\nrequirement before a party can seek partition is the existence of a cotenancy between the parties. If the\ncross-conveyance theory for voluntary unit agreements is followed then, by necessity, a cotenancy is created. However,\nif the contract theory is followed, there have been no property interests transferred and therefore no cotenancy. n125\n\nThus, the issue was squarely before the court. The court rejected the cross-conveyance theory and adopted the contract\ntheory as it applies to the typical unitization or pooling agreement. No special terms or disclaimers need to be placed in\nthose agreements for a court to find that only contractual rights are created. In the absence of provisions to the contrary,\nit will be presumed that the parties to the pooling and unitization agreement do not intend to cross-convey any property\ninterests. n126 In answering the question of whether or not a cotenancy had been established the court definitively\nstated:\n\n            co-tenancy has never been established or created. The parties have title and ownership to separate\n       tracts. No party has been conveyed an interest in the property of the other. The plan of unitization is not a\n       cross conveyance of interest, but rather a plan to unitize their several tracts ... . Neither the plan of\n       unitization nor the statutes which authorized the Corporation Commission to approve and regulate the\n       same intended to convey an interest between the parties. The Plan of Unitization has no operative words\n       of conveyance and it is apparent from the instrument itself that none was intended. n127\n\nIt is clear that Oklahoma has rejected the cross-conveyance theory for the typical pooling and unitization agreement\nbecause the typical agreements normally disclaim any intent to cross-convey property interests. Where the partners are\nsilent on the issue, the court would also find no cross-conveyance because there would be no operative words of\nconveyance. If parties want to cross-convey property interests they need to amend the standard forms and put in explicit\ngranting or conveying language evincing such an intent. n128 Thus, Oklahoma has finally planted its feet firmly in the\ncamp of contract theory states, notwithstanding an initial decision opting for the cross-conveyance theory.\n\nOklahoma's compulsory pooling system also raises issues over the nature of the unitized title. n129 Non-operating\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 5\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nworking-interest owners sometimes are given an option not to participate in well production expenses and instead\nreceive a bonus payment and/or some overriding royalties. Is an assignment of the working interest so that the\nnon-operator is divested of all of his or her interests within the pooled unit? In Ranola Oil Co. v. Corporation\nCommission, n130 the court concluded that when the non-operator accepted a bonus payment in lieu of participation,\nthe entire working interest was deemed transferred to the operator. That precluded the non-operator from participating\nas a matter of right in increased-density wells approved later. The pooling order when accepted by the non-operator\nterminated the non-operator's working interest in the minerals within the pooled unit.\n\n Ranola Oil is perhaps inconsistent with an earlier decision of the Oklahoma Court of Appeals, Southern Union\nProduction Co. v. Eason Oil Co. n131 This decision of the Court of Appeals is not binding as precedent because it was\nnot ordered released for publication by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. In Southern Union, Eason as a working-interest\nowner had opted by default for the bonus payment alternative to participation in production expenses. Eason never\nformally assigned its working interest to Southern Union, the operator. A dry hole was drilled and the Corporation\nCommission eventually deleted the Eason acreage from the pooled unit. Eason then drilled a producing well on a\nre-spaced 80-acre unit, and Southern Union claimed a conversion of its working interest had occurred. That claim was\nbased on the prior assignment of Eason's working interest that was ordered in the creation of the 640-acre unit. The\nCourt of Appeals disagreed that Eason had conveyed a fee interest in its working interest. It concluded that no\nassignment had taken place or, alternatively, if an assignment had occurred it had been extinguished with the\ntermination of the 640-acre unit. Ranola Oil clearly would have found that Eason had conveyed its interest when it\nchose the bonus alternative. But the termination of the unit was a factor that the Ranola Oil court did not face. The\nCorporation Commission never provided whether the assignment was a full fee simple absolute assignment or a\ndefeasible fee assignment that automatically terminated upon the termination of the unit. The Southern Union court\nconcluded that it was the equivalent of a defeasible fee assignment, if any assignment of an interest took place at all.\n\nIn Unit Petroleum Co. v. Mobil Exploration & Production North America, Inc., n131.1 the court explored in the\ncontext of a gas balancing dispute the relationship between working interest owners who have executed a joint\noperating agreement. n131.2 Relying on Harrell v. Samson Resources Co., n131.3 the court described the relationship\nbetween the parties to the JOA as \"cotenant-like.\" This labeling affected the outcome of the suit because the court found\nthat the JOA did not provide for immediate cash balancing but said that Mobil's sale, if it derogated Unit's rights as a\ncotenant and \"beneficiary of the trust relationship,\" might trigger an immediate right to cash balancing. In addition, if\nthe sale by Mobil caused it to deny further liability for the overproduction then Unit could be entitled to immediate cash\nbalancing. The use of the term trust relationship is somewhat troubling because the parties to a JOA normally are not\ntreated as being in such a relationship. In many JOAs the parties can protect themselves against the sale of working\ninterests by including a preferential right to purchase provision or other type of clause that gives them the right to\napprove of a transfer of a working interest. In order to determine whether or not there is a derogation of the trust\nrelationship or a denial of future liability, an ad hoc determination of the facts of each case must be made by the trial\ncourt.\n\n     [c] Utah\n\nWhile no state court decision has adopted either theory, an opinion of the Tenth Circuit applying Utah law apparently\nassumes that Utah would adopt a contract theory rather than a cross-conveyance theory. In Phillips Petroleum Co. v.\nPeterson, n132 the Rule Against Perpetuities was again at the center of the controversy. The lessors claimed that the\nleasehold pooling clause was invalid because it violated the rule, and, therefore, the placement of their acreage into\nvarious units was likewise invalid. The Tenth Circuit concluded that the rule was only applicable if the pooling or\nunitization agreements constituted a conveyance of interests in realty. n133 The court held that the pooling clause in the\nlease and the terms of the unitization agreement did not evince a clear intent to cross-convey the respective royalty\ninterests. It adopted the view suggested by Leo Hoffman that pooling and unitization agreements generally use\ncontractual terms rather than language typical of conveyances. There was no special provision in the agreement stating\nthat no cross-conveyance was intended. Instead the general language regarding allocation of production costs and\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 6\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nroyalty payments was deemed to evince an intent not to cross-convey. n134 The court also followed what it believed to\nbe the more persuasive case authority that adopts the contract doctrine. n135\n\n     [d] West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia is here classified as adopting the contract theory, but the cases upon which this classification are based\nare unclear and perhaps contradictory. The first case that suggested that the court was opting for the contract doctrine\nwas Lynch v. Davis. n136 Lynch involved a community lease whereby several separate owners of mineral estates joined\nin one lease of their respective tracts. n137 The ultimate issue related to whether or not there should be an\napportionment of royalties based on a surface acreage allocation formula. The court rejected an argument that finding\nfor apportioned royalties is the equivalent of finding that the parties cross-conveyed their interests; it ruled that the\ncommunity lease was not a conveyance of an interest in the minerals. If it was a conveyance, the court would have to\nfind that the non-apportionment rule would apply. n138 While not a model of clarity, the opinion suggests that a\ncommunity lease does not entail a conveyance of interests in real property unless it undertakes to do so through specific\nlanguage of grant. n139\n\nWhile Lynch standing alone would cause us to place West Virginia in the ambiguous category, the case of Boggess v.\nMilam n140 would support a conclusion that West Virginia has embraced the contract doctrine. Boggess involved the\nright to share in royalties where there had been a pooling of less than all of the interests in the pooled tracts. Boggess\nowned an undivided interest in a tract of land. He was given an opportunity to join in a pooling or unitization\nagreement, but he refused. The agreement was executed by the other owners, including those who owned fractional\nshares in the same tract as Boggess. The unit well was drilled off of the Boggess acreage. He nonetheless claimed a\nshare of the royalty from the unit well's production. Under either a contract or cross-conveyance theory Boggess had to\nlose because he had refused to execute the agreement. His argument was based on a cross-conveyance theory, asserting\nthat he was a cotenant of the royalty interests of those owners who had joined the agreement. While that argument\nwould be persuasive had he executed the agreement, his failure to join gave him no rights whatsoever in the off-tract\npooled production. While not critical to its holding, the court discussed the contract and cross-conveyance theories and\nconcluded that a unitization agreement merely involves the merging of contractual rights. n141 By stating that the\nunitization agreement did not effectuate a merger of title the court was in essence rejecting a cross-conveyance theory,\nwhich if adopted would cause a merger of title between the parties to the agreement. While not a solid member of the\ncontract theory group, the combination of Boggess and Lynch clearly indicate a judicial predilection for treating pooling\nand unitization agreements as merely entailing contractual relationships.\n\n     [2] Cross-Conveyance Theory States\n\n     [a] California\n\nAlthough California is now considered a state firmly committed to the cross-conveyance theory, some of its early\nopinions suggested that the contract theory was the preferable approach. In Bayside Land Co. v. Dabney, n142 the\nlessor entered into a lease with the defendant that contained a form of pooling clause that gave the lessee the power to\nenter into subsequent leases with other parties. The lessee could then jointly develop the separate leasehold estates as\nlong as there was a sharing of the royalties. The court concluded that the lessee had properly signed leases with other\nparties, which provided for a sharing of royalties. In describing the relationship between the plaintiff and the other\nlessors the court clearly distinguished this case from an earlier case n143 on the basis that in this case there was no\ntenancy in common formed by the lessee's exercise of the pooling clause, even when there was a pooling of the\nroyalties. n144 If there was no tenancy in common there could be no conveyance of royalty interests. The court\nemphasized the fact that only contractual rights were involved so that no cotenancy situation would exist. n145\n\nThe adoption of the cross-conveyance theory occurred in 1946 with Tanner v. Title Insurance & Trust Co. n146 A\ncommunity lease was the subject of the litigation in Tanner. In resolving the dispute between transferees of the original\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 7\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nlessors and the lessee regarding the right to pooled or apportioned royalties, the court made the following statement\nabout the nature of the pooled title that ensued from the signing of the community lease:\n\n           By executing the community lease, the respondents and each of the other lessors assigned or\n       conveyed to his colessors a percentage interest in all oil produced on his land by the lessee during the\n       continuance of the lease. The consideration for that transfer was the similar mutual assignments of the\n       other lessors. n147\n\nThe interest that was transferred to each of the colessors was distinct from the royalty interest that may have been\nretained by the lessor in production on his own premises. This view was followed in other cases that reiterated the\nconclusion that community leases or other forms of pooling or unitization agreements constitute a cross-conveyance of\nroyalty interests. n148\n\nThe Tanner rule was followed in another community lease case, Southern California Title Clearing Co. v. Laws. n149\nIn this case, the legal issue was whether all of the community lessors were indispensable parties to a lawsuit seeking\npartition of the lessors' interest. n150 The original community lease combined thirteen different tracts with thirteen\ndifferent owners. The partition suit was solely directed at the divided ownership of one of the lots. The owners of the\ntwelve remaining tracts were not joined. The court used the Tanner rationale to find that the act of executing a\ncommunity lease cross-conveyed royalty interests between the lessors. As such, a partition action seeking to terminate\nthe lease as to one of the tracts would also affect the other lessors who were owners of a fractional share of the royalty\ninterest in the tract where the partition was being sought. Under the California test for indispensable parties, they were\nindispensable because their ownership rights were being affected. n151\n\nDoubts about the commitment of the California courts to the cross-conveyance theory was raised by the case of LeBard\nv. Richfield Oil Corp., n152 although the facts of the case are unique. LeBard involved the very limited statutory\ncompulsory pooling laws that exist in California. n153 Under the statute at issue, when one acre or smaller parcels are\nlocated adjacent to existing leased parcels and certain other requirements are met these smaller parcels are deemed\nincluded within the lease, and the owner of the minerals is entitled to a proportionate share of the royalty payments.\nAfter the plaintiff's interest had been committed to the pooled unit, she sold her entire estate to the defendants or their\npredecessors in interest. She then claimed that the pooled royalties she was entitled to by virtue of the statutory\nforced-pooling were interests in gross and were not therefore transferred with the mineral estate conveyance. The court\nrejected that reading of the rights created by the statutory pooling procedure. Then the plaintiff argued that the statute in\neffect made her the equivalent of a community lessor, which, under the Tanner rule, would constitute a\ncross-conveyance of the royalty interests in the pooled unit. n154 While agreeing that the Tanner court adopted a\ncross-conveyance doctrine, this court attempted to limit the application of the doctrine by stating that it did \"not fit the\npattern established by Section 3608 for compensating owners who have been deprived of the right to recover oil and gas\nfrom their lands.\" n155 The court was correct in not making equivalent a voluntary community lease or pooling\nagreement and a compulsory pooling statute. In dealing with voluntary agreements, the courts are interpreting the\nlanguage of the agreements to ascertain the intent of the parties. Where the choice of contract or cross-conveyance\ntheories is expressly stated the court will enforce the language as written. n156 The Tanner rule merely states that where\nthe community lease or pooling or unitization agreement does not contain express language indicating a choice of\ntheories, the courts will find that a cross-conveyance of property interests has occurred. The Laws decision recognized\nthat the parties are free to make that choice but if they do not the Tanner rule will apply when the court said: \"Whether\nin any given agreement for unit development the Tanner rules will be applicable between the parties will depend on the\nterms of the agreement.\" n157\n\nBut in this case we are not dealing with voluntary agreements and the intent of the parties but with a question of\nstatutory interpretation. Here the court looked at the provisions of the compulsory pooling statute and determined that\nthe legislature had not intended to effect a cross-conveyance of property interests whenever the compulsory pooling\nprocess was used. This would be consistent with the general rule that actions of state conservation agencies, while\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 8\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\naffecting property interests, cannot convey or affect the title to property interests held by those who have been brought\ninto the regulatory process.\n\n     [b] Illinois\n\nIllinois has shown some support for the cross-conveyance theory in a case involving the joinder of indispensable parties.\nIn Ragsdale v. Superior Oil Co., n158 the plaintiffs claimed that the operator of a pooled unit that had included the\nplaintiffs' lands had committed tortious acts including trespass, wrongful entry, and conversion. The unit contained 37\nworking-interest owners and 140 royalty-interest owners. None but the unit operator was named in the suit. The\nintermediate appellate court had found that those parties were not indispensable without opting for the contract theory.\nn159 The Illinois Supreme Court reversed and found that the action should be dismissed for failure to join indispensable\nparties. The rationale for that result is not as clear as it could have been had the court simply adopted the\ncross-conveyance theory as the one applicable in Illinois. After describing the usual effects of unitization, the court\nsimply concluded that a judgment for the plaintiff in this case would by definition adversely impact all of the other\nowners. The court concluded:\n\n            The oil produced is pooled, regardless of the separate tracts upon which the wells are located and\n       from which the oil is produced. They all share in the oil produced, saved and sold in the proportion\n       which each owner's tract bears to the entire unitized tract. For all practical purposes the same situation\n       exists as though there was a single owner-lessor and a single lessee ... . Assuming that the well, or even\n       one of several, is on the tract in question and title failed. The production would belong to the successful\n       litigant rather than to the record owners. The unitized tract would be broken and every party owning an\n       interest in it would be adversely affected. n160\n\nWhile consistent with the cross-conveyance theory, the Illinois court properly refused to allow the choice of theory to\naffect the determination of who are indispensable parties. Under either theory it could be argued that the non-joined\nparties' interests would be substantially affected by the removal of the Ragsdale tract from the unit. If the lessee would\nlose this case and be forced off of the tract, other interests might be terminated or otherwise affected. The analysis\ncorrectly focused on the legal and practical impacts of the litigation and not on the choice of theory.\n\n     [c] Mississippi\n\nMississippi, as a general matter, follows fairly closely the oil and gas jurisprudence of the Texas courts. It would thus\nnot be surprising if Mississippi followed the lead of Texas and adopted the cross-conveyance theory. The limited case\nlaw does suggest that result, although there is no clear indication in any Mississippi case that it has opted for the\ncross-conveyance doctrine. n161 In Merrill Engineering Co. v. Capital National Bank, n162 the main issue was\nwhether a royalty interest was realty or personalty such that when the owner of a royalty transferred his realty his\nroyalty interest was also conveyed. The answer was clearly yes, but the answer was made more difficult because the\nlessor's interest had been pooled with adjacent tract owners pursuant to a pooling agreement. While only tangentially\ninvolving a cross-conveyance or contract issue, the court's repeated emphasis that both the pre-pooling and post-pooling\nroyalty interests were realty lends support to the idea that those interests were conveyed to the parties who executed the\npooling agreement.\n\nA federal case applying Mississippi law, Hudson v. Newell, n163 found that Mississippi would follow the\ncross-conveyance theory. Again, the issue related to indispensable parties to litigation involving interests which had\nbeen committed to a unitization agreement. The plaintiffs sought to quiet title in themselves because certain transfers\nhad been executed by a life tenant without the joinder of the remaindermen. After one of those transfers, a lease of the\nminerals had taken place and a unitization agreement was executed pursuant to the lease. The court saw the issue quite\nplainly. If the unitization agreement constituted a cross-conveyance of royalty interests, no litigation could occur unless\nall royalty owners within the unit were joined, since their interests would be affected. Noting the close ties between\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 9\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nTexas and Mississippi oil and gas law the Fifth Circuit resolved the issue as follows:\n\n            The district judge held that in Mississippi the oil in place is, as in Texas, conveyed by oil leases,\n       royalty sales, and other formal recorded contracts, and that a unitization contract vests joint ownership\n       jointly in all the unitized reserves in place and in the royalty oil produced from the well, citing Veal v.\n       Thomason, 138 Tex. 341, 159 S.W.2d 472 . While no Mississippi authorities on point are cited, we\n       believe this to be correct, so that all these owners must be parties, or the unitized lands must be excluded\n       from any decree. n164\n\nThe finding that a cross-conveyance occurs requires the conclusion that the other royalty owners are indispensable\nparties to a lawsuit relating to the title of one of the royalty owners. As was discussed earlier in § 19.01[2][a][ii], on\nrehearing, the Fifth Circuit eventually held that the non-joined royalty owners were not indispensable after the plaintiffs\nfiled affidavits disclaiming any intent to interfere with the unitization agreements executed by the defendants to the\nlitigation. n165\n\n     [d] Texas\n\nTexas has been the state where the choice of the cross conveyance theory has had the most influence. While not the first\ncase to adopt the cross conveyance theory, Veal v. Thomason n166 is perhaps the most oft-cited and important decision,\nwhich has clearly placed Texas among those states that follow the cross-conveyancing theory. Veal involved a\ncommunity lease where the plaintiff was challenging the title of one of the community lessors. The plaintiff only served\nthe community lessors whose title he was directly attacking, failing to serve the community lessee and the remaining\ncommunity lessors. The defendants argued that the suit had to be dismissed for failing to join indispensable parties. In\nfinding that the non-joined parties were indispensable the court made the following statement:\n\n            To our minds, when we look to the substance and intent of this lease contract as a whole, the\n       above-recited provisions can have no effect other than to constitute all the lessors of land in the unitized\n       block joint owners, or joint tenants, of all royalties reserved in each of the several leases in such block,\n       the ownership being in proportion which the acreage of the unitized block. n167\n\nRegardless of the choice of theories, the non-joined parties were indispensable because the plaintiffs were seeking to\nterminate the relationship between their alleged mineral interest and the community lease.\n\nShortly after Veal the court was faced with the same indispensable party issue where the plaintiffs were not seeking to\nterminate the relationship with the community leasehold interests but were merely seeking to substitute themselves for\nthe defendants as the proper royalty owners. In Belt v. Texas Co., n168 the same community lease that was litigated in\nVeal was before the court. The court refused to distinguish Veal on the different relief sought, instead opting to apply\nthe cross-conveyance theory to all interests created by a community lease. Once the court applied the theory it was\ninescapable that the non-joined community lessors would be indispensable. n169\n\nThe Veal holding was followed in Brown v. Smith. n170 While Brown directly involved the right of the owner of the\nexecutive power to lease non-participating royalty interests, the court in discussing the rights of the non-executive\nowner clearly embraced the cross-conveyance theory as the one that best describes the nature of the unitized title. n171\nIn finding that the executive did not possess the power to pool the interests reserved to the non-executive through a\ncommunity lease, the court described the consequences of executing a community lease as follows:\n\n            An oil and gas lease jointly executed by the owners of two or more tracts of land owned in severalty,\n       with provision for pooling or sharing, on the basis of acreage, the royalties from oil or gas produced\n       anywhere on the leased land, has the effect of vesting all of the lessors, at least during the life of the\n       lease, \"with joint ownership of the royalty earned from all the land in such block.\" Veal v. Thomason,\n       138 Tex. 341, 349, 159 S.W.2d 472, 476 . The lease so executed is a conveyance by each lessor to each of\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 10\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n       the other lessors of an undivided interest in the royalties. n172\n\nSince the non-executive had not joined in the community lease, she did not convey her interest to the community. The\nexecutive did not possess the power to convey that interest without her further consent. She could not be divested of her\nfull interest, nor could she receive the interests from the other royalty owners unless she joined in the lease. n173\n\nThe first Texas case extending the cross-conveyance doctrine to a pooling agreement was Miles v. Amerada Petroleum\nCorp. n174 The court followed the Veal holding that an exercise of the power by a lessee was a conveyance or\nexchange of a part of the lessor's royalty interest for a part of the interests of other royalty owners who were included in\nthe pooled unit. n175 Later Texas cases have applied the cross-conveyance theory in other contexts. n175.1 For\nexample, in Renwar Oil Corp. v. Lancaster, n176 the plaintiffs sought to interpret a survey so that it would include their\nlands within a lease that had a producing well located thereon. The procedural issue raised related to the proper venue\nfor the action. The suit was filed in Dallas County although the land itself was located in Nueces County. The defendant\nobjected to the trial court's jurisdiction through a properly filed plea of privilege asserting that the lawsuit was one that\nrelated to the recovery of land, which under the then existing venue statute had to be filed in the district court for the\ncounty where the land is located. The action, while sounding in contract, was affected by Veal because the interest being\nlitigated had been pooled. Since the plaintiffs sought to have the pooling terminated as to their claimed interest because\nthey never agreed to the pooling, the court concluded that Veal was applicable. The survey interpretation sought by the\nplaintiff would change the nature of the ownership of the other royalty owners who had received a cross-conveyance of\nthe contested interest; under the Veal rationale they granted to others a proportionate share of their reserved royalty\ninterest. The court concluded:\n\n            In addition plaintiffs seek an adjudication that certain unitization agreements are void and ineffective\n       as to them. Since these agreements are essentially a conveyance of an interest in realty, Veal v.\n       Thomason ... , this constitutes an effort to remove cloud from title, even though alleged as an effort to\n       construe a contract. n177\n\nThe Court of Civil Appeals decision in Minchen v. Fields, n178 which confirmed the holding in Brown v. Smith n179\nthat the executive cannot pool, or authorize the lessee to pool, non-executive interests used the cross-conveyance theory\nto support that result. The court stated:\n\n            The reason of the rule is that where mere executive rights are conferred or reserved, there is no\n       intention evidenced to vest authority to convey a royalty interest reserved or the royalty interest\n       attributable to the minerals leased and to hold that such holder can unitize or pool the interest would\n       allow him to convey such royalty interest because a unitization of the royalty and minerals under\n       different tracts effects a cross-conveyance to the owners of minerals under the various tracts of royalty or\n       minerals so that they all own undivided interests under the unitized tract in the proportion their\n       contribution bears to the unitized tract. n180\n\nThe adoption of either the cross-conveyance or contract doctrine is irrelevant in resolving the pooling power question.\nThe major issue in determining if the non-executive's interest can be pooled should be one of intent, or more precisely,\npresumed intent of the parties since they have not expressed their intent through the relevant documents. That issue\nshould not be affected by the categorization of a pooling or unitization agreement as a contract or cross-conveyance.\nThe lessee can or cannot pool based on the intent of the parties as expressed in the instruments creating the\nnon-executive interests. The fact that the pooling would, if effective, transfer property interests or merely create\ncontractual rights should not affect the determination of the intent of the parties creating the non-executive interests.\n\nThe consequences of choosing between the cross-conveyance and contract theories also affect ancillary matters such as\njoinder problems, the Rule Against Perpetuities, and the Statute of Frauds. n181 The option does not, and should not,\neffect the basic impact of the pooling or unitization decision, which is to provide a sharing of risks, benefits and costs\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 11\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\namong the various owners within the pooled unit or unitized area.\n\nThe cross-conveyance theory was also reaffirmed in dictum in Texaco, Inc. v. Letterman, n182 a case involving the\nexercise of a leasehold pooling clause. The major issue was whether a pooling clause could be exercised a second time,\nafter the original pooled unit had been abandoned. The court concluded that the lessee could pool the lessor's royalty\ninterest so long as the lease was still alive. In dictum, however, the court suggested that if the court had held that the\nlessee could not have exercised his pooling power after the initial pooled unit had been abandoned the attack on the later\nexercises of the pooling clause would have had to have been dismissed for failure to join necessary and indispensable\nparties, the other pooled royalty owners in those units. n183\n\nIn Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v. Sheppard, n183.1 the court effectively reaffirmed the continued adherence to the\ncross-conveyance theory as it relates to a voluntary pooling created under a leasehold pooling clause, despite the\npooling clause stating \"Pooling hereunder shall not constitute a cross-conveyance of interests.\" The Texas Supreme\nCourt ruled that the effectiveness of the pooling by the lessee continued even after the termination of the lease. Thus the\npossibility of reverter had been committed to the unit by the lessee. The lessee, the court found, was empowered to\ncommit the lessor's interests for a period longer than it committed its own interest.\n\nThe merging of the cross-conveyance doctrine with other rules or canons affecting interpretation of mineral deeds has\ncaused some problems. In Kelln v. Brownlee, n184 the Kellns owned the equivalent of 151 undivided acres in Section\n59. They leased the entire 640 acres even though they only owned that lesser amount. The lease contained a pooling\nclause that was exercised to pool all of the interests in Section 59. The Kellns then transferred certain undivided\ninterests in Section 59 subject to the lease, and the grantees sought an apportioned share of the royalties based on the\ncross-conveyance theory. The court found that the royalty interests that the Kellns received by virtue of the pooling\nagreement were transferred to the grantees under the doctrine of after-acquired title in order to make the grantees whole.\nThe grantees were entitled to the benefit of the pooling agreement because their interest was transferred subject to the\nlease.\n\nThere are only a few cases that depart from the cross-conveyance theory. In Sohio Petroleum Co. v. Jurek n185 the\nplaintiffs claimed that a constructive or resulting trust should be placed on an undivided mineral interest that had been\nleased and then placed into a voluntary pooled unit. The mineral interest had been purchased with funds that were to be\nshared between the plaintiff's children and their mother. The defendants asserted that the cross-conveyance was\napplicable, and since none of the other royalty owners within the pooled unit were joined the suit had to be dismissed\nfor failing to join necessary parties. Rather than blindly applying the cross-conveyance theory, the court could have seen\nwhether the non-joined parties' interests would be affected by the litigation. It is not likely that they would be affected\nsince the plaintiffs were seeking merely to have their ownership interest recognized. There was no suggestion that they\nsought to terminate either the lease or the pooling agreement. n186\n\nThere is no way to reconcile Jurek with Veal. Other Texas cases have followed Jurek and not found non-joined pooled\nor unitized owners indispensable parties in actions where the relief sought is not the termination of the interest's\nparticipation in the pooled or unitized development. n187 Thus some courts have recognized the fact that not all\nlitigation involving owners of pooled or unitized interests affects the other owners. n187.1\n\nNot all forms of joint or cooperative development necessarily invoke the Veal rule. In Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Exxon\nCorp., n188 the Court of Civil Appeals found that there was no cross-conveyance of natural gas pursuant to the terms\nof a joint operating agreement. Several oil companies, including the plaintiff and the defendant, entered into a series of\njoint operating agreements to expand an existing gasoline plant and construct additional gas gathering facilities. The\nparties agreed to allocate ownership of the plant and the extracted products in proportion to the ownership interest in the\ngas reserves in the field. The plaintiff's reserves were produced faster than the defendant's, but it was only allocated its\nproportionate share of the reserves originally held. At that time, the defendant sought to exercise a termination clause in\nthe contracts and execute a new contract that had terms very unfavorable to the plaintiff. One of the theories proffered\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 12\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nby the plaintiff to avoid the express terms of the termination clause was that the original contracts had in effect\nconstituted a cross-conveyance of the gas in place, analogous to a pooling or unitization agreement. Once conveyed, the\nplaintiff's interest in the remaining reserves could not be diminished without its express consent. While admitting that\ngas reserves are realty under Texas law and therefore capable of being conveyed, the Court of Civil Appeals agreed\nwith the trial judge that the contracts in question did not evince an intent to cross-convey those reserves. In looking at\nthe instrument as a whole, the court could not find express words of grant, nor could it find an adequate description of\nthe subject matter of the deed. No mention is made of the Veal doctrine that essentially presumes an intent to convey\nfrom the language of a community lease or a pooling or unitization agreement, which usually does not contain express\norders of grant either. Nonetheless, the result in Atlantic Richfield shows that the cross-conveyance theory will not be\nblindly followed when there is clearly no intent to convey a mineral or royalty interest. While community leases,\npooling clauses, and pooling and unitization agreements create a presumed intent to cross-convey, joint operating\nagreements between lessees do not. The Texas Supreme Court did not disturb the finding of the Court of Civil Appeals\nthat no cross-conveyance took place. It reversed the lower court's application of an implied covenant to the agreement\nsince it determined that express covenants governed the parties' relationship, preempting the use of implied covenants.\n\nWhile joint operating agreements may not necessarily invoke the cross-conveyance doctrine, that is not to say that such\nagreements do not create a cotenancy relationship between the working interest owners. A number of Texas cases\nreinforce the view that the working interest owners are co-tenants. n188.1\n\nA second case that distinguished Veal raises some interesting questions. In Puckett v. First City National Bank of\nMidland, n189 the lessor's royalty interest was pooled by the lessee into two separate gas production units. Gas from\nboth units was subject to split stream sales, some being sold at higher intrastate prices, and some at lower interstate\nprices. The weighted average sale price of plaintiff's lease was lower than the other lessee's overall weighted average\nsale price. Nonetheless, the plaintiff was receiving a royalty in excess of the sales price attributed to his acreage.\nLanguage in the lease and the division order as well as language in the operating agreement evinced an intent to pay the\nplaintiff based upon on the price received for the gas produced that was allocated to his tract. One of the arguments\nraised by the plaintiff was that the pooling agreement cross-conveyed the respective royalty interests under Veal so that\nthe plaintiff was entitled to the overall weighted average of all sales from both units. The court dismissed this argument\nby stating that Veal dealt with indispensable parties and not the calculation of royalties from split stream gas sales out of\na pooled unit. The better explanation offered by the court was that the parties' express language regarding the allocation\nof royalty evinced an intent not to effect a cross-conveyance as to payments of unitized royalty. n190\n\nIn Parker v. HNG Oil Co., n190.1 the cross conveyance theory was apparently ignored in a situation in which it\notherwise might have applied. A lease had been executed in 1973 covering approximately 93 acres. Almost 24 acres\nwere committed to an oil unit where there was an existing producing well. The original lessee assigned the lease,\nretaining an overriding royalty. In 1982 the lessors sought a release of the lease as to all non-pooled acreage. HNG\nmistakenly issued a release covering the entire 93 acres while other working interest owners only released the acreage\noutside of the pooled unit. The lessors brought this action to have HNG's affidavit claiming an interest in the 24 acres\ninside the pooled unit removed from the county records as a cloud on its title. HNG counterclaimed seeking reformation\nof the release. Neither litigant would be interested in having the lawsuit dismissed for lack of joinder of indispensable\nparties. The lessors wanted to have the affidavit removed from the title records, and the lessee wanted to quiet title and\nreform the written release instrument. While the status quo may have favored the lessee's position, undoubtedly it\nwanted the title issue resolved rather than wait for a new lawsuit to be filed.\n\nSince this litigation involves title to a pooled interest, Veal would seemingly be applicable and if followed, would\nrequire that all of the other working interest owners in the pooled unit be joined as indispensable parties. Apparently,\nneither of these two parties raised the issue given the nature of the dispute, so the court did not deal with the Veal\nrequirement of joining all of the other pooled unit owners. On the merits, the case was resolved in favor of HNG since it\nmet the two pronged test for reformation of a written instrument, to wit, the true agreement of the parties is shown and\nthe provision was erroneously entered by mutual mistake.\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 13\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n\nThe unexplored issue of indispensable parties and the Veal cross conveyance rule raise some interesting questions. It is\nclear that the owners of the pooled unit production, and more specifically, the assignee of HNG's leasehold interest,\nhave an interest in the outcome of the litigation. The overriding royalty amounted to 30% of all oil and gas produced\nafter lessor royalties were paid. Why the original lessors wanted to terminate the interest was unclear. Their landowner\nroyalty was unaffected by the override. But the assignee who was obligated to pay the override was clearly an\ninterested, and probably an indispensable, party since it was out of their share that the override was being taken. The\nother working interest owners in the pooled unit would have been greatly affected by the litigation if they were sharing\nthe cost of the override. They were still interested since if the lease was terminated, in theory an unleased mineral owner\nwould now be part of the mix of owners. Since the well was off of the leasehold acreage, it can be presumed that the\nlessors would ratify the pooling, otherwise they would lose the right to share in the production from the pooled unit\nwell.\n\n     [3] Undecided States\n\n     [a] Louisiana\n\nThe early Louisiana decisions would support the cross-conveyance theory, but more recent decisions suggest Louisiana\nwould be more properly considered a contract theory state. In Martel v. A. Veeder Co., n191 the court in dictum stated\nthat if the instruments had been effective to pool the royalty interests, then an exchange of those mineral rights would\nhave occurred. Since the court had found that the instruments did not constitute a community lease, the discussion on a\npossible cross-conveyance was dictum. n192\n\nA clearer statement opting for the cross-conveyance doctrine was made in Coyle v. North American Oil Consolidated.\nn193 The issue was clearer because the necessary and indispensable party doctrine was involved in the decision. The\nplaintiff used an abandonment theory in seeking to cancel a lease as to certain formations. The trial court found no\nabandonment was proven, partially on the basis that the evidence was not clear that there was more than one producing\nsand. However, the court said that even if the trial court had determined that there had been an abandonment of one of\nthe horizons, it would have been powerless to order the lease canceled because that acreage had been pooled, and the\nother royalty owners were not served as defendants in the lawsuit. n194 The case was remanded for reconsideration of\nthe abandonment evidence for one of the formations, with the requirement that all parties to the pooling agreement be\njoined so that the plaintiff's attempt to terminate the pooling agreement for his claimed interest could be adjudicated. On\na motion for rehearing both the plaintiffs and defendants argued that it was not necessary to serve all of the other\nroyalty-and working-interest owners. The court refused to repudiate the language of its original opinion regarding the\nnecessity to join those parties, but it otherwise found that the parties to the lease never intended to treat the separate\nhorizons as segregated portions of the lease, which could be individually abandoned. The choice of the\ncross-conveyance theory was not clearly decided because of the presence of an alternative rationale for the decision.\n\nThe clearest statement by a Louisiana court that it has opted for the cross-conveyance doctrine came in Vizier v.\nHoward. n195 The plaintiffs owned several non-contiguous tracts that they alleged had been included in a community\nlease that entailed approximately thirty additional tracts of land. The plaintiffs were seeking an accounting for unpaid\nroyalties and an order terminating the lease. The trial judge issued a preliminary order requiring the plaintiff to join the\nowners from the thirty additional tracts or face dismissal of the lawsuit. The plaintiffs responded by attempting to\nconvert their lawsuit into a class action representing all of the royalty owners in the communitized leasehold area. That\nwas held by the trial court to be insufficient, and the judge dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals accepted\nwithout question the propriety of the preliminary order demanding that all communitized lessors be joined. Its opinion\nwas solely concerned with the legitimacy of the class action sought by the plaintiffs. Obviously, the Court of Appeals\nagreed that the communitized lessors are either necessary or indispensable, which lends support to the adoption of the\ncross-conveyance theory for community leases. The opinion, however, cites no cases to support the view that Louisiana\nhas opted for that theory.\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 14\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n\nTwo later cases, however, suggest that Louisiana is either opting for a contract theory or is making the determination of\nwhether the non-joined parties are indispensable on the merits of each case, without regard for either of the contract or\ncross-conveyance theories. In Melancon v. Texas Co., n196 the lessor sought cancellation of a lease when the lessee,\nwho was apparently trying to coerce the lessor to approve a pooling or unitization agreement, withheld royalty\npayments that were properly due and owing. The lease contained a pooling clause with limited pooling to 40 acres. The\nclause was exercised, a pooled unit was created, and a producing well was placed on the unit. However, the lessee\nwanted the lessor to agree to a revision of the unit that would be larger than that authorized by the pooling clause. Other\nroyalty interest owners were joined as parties defendant. The court recognizes that those other owners were necessary\nparties and, if not joined, the suit could not continue. n197 The court did not state if it was adopting either a contract or\ncross-conveyance theory, but regardless of the choice of theories the other royalty owners would be affected by the\noutcome of the litigation, because the plaintiff was seeking to terminate both the lease and the pooling.\n\nIn Mallett v. Union Oil & Gas Corp. of Louisiana, n198 the plaintiff was seeking to terminate the lease in question\nbecause of a lack of production at the end of the primary term. The lease contained a pooling clause, and near the end of\nthe primary term the lessee pooled part of the plaintiff's acreage with adjacent acreage that already had a producing well\nlocated thereon. The court determined that the pooling clause only contemplated pooling with undeveloped lands, and\ntherefore the pooling that was accomplished was beyond the lessee's authority. n199 If the cross-conveyance theory was\napplied, then the other royalty owners in the pooled unit would be indispensable parties. There was no indication in the\nopinion that the other owners were joined. The lessee apparently chose not to argue the cross-conveyance theory as a\nmeans of having the plaintiff's complaint dismissed.\n\n     [b] Montana\n\nMontana, like Louisiana, has reached some inconclusive results in several cases regarding the application of the\ncross-conveyance or contract theories. In Toomey v. State Board of Land Commissioners, n200 the plaintiff taxpayer\nsought to enjoin the state from entering into a unitization agreement that would pool state lands with private lands. The\nplaintiff urged, among other arguments, that the unitization would effectively cross-convey a fractional royalty interest\nfrom the state to the other private unitization owners, which would violate a restriction against the barter of public\nlands. The court rejected the argument but stated that the reason for the rejection was the fact that ownership of the gas\nwas an incorporeal interest subject to the rule of capture. Since the state did not own the gas in place, there was no\nbarter. While that argument may not be persuasive, one possible explanation of the holding is that the court did not\nbelieve the state was conveying its royalty interest by virtue of executing a unitization agreement. n201\n\nIn Nadeau v. Texas Co., n202 a similar inference could be reached from a small part of a decision that relied on other\ngrounds to reach its result. The plaintiff and defendant were rival claimants to oil and gas leases on the same land. The\ndefendant had apparently signed a pooling agreement, and the other parties to the agreement had not been joined. The\ncourt dismissed the argument that the non-joined parties were indispensable by simply concluding that the controversy\ndid not affect their rights but merely involved the validity of the lease. That conclusion is clearly erroneous since if the\ndefendant lost, the other parties who agreed to pool their interests and apportion their royalties would have their\ninterests substantially changed by the removal of the leased lands from the pooled unit. Again, no direct mention was\nmade to the contract or cross-conveyance theories, and the point was the last of many that the court rejected in finding\nfor the plaintiff. n203\n\nFinally, in a Ninth Circuit decision ostensibly applying Montana law, the court developed at least four different answers\nto the question of why unitized royalty owners were not necessary or indispensable parties to a lawsuit when a lessor\nsought to invalidate a lease that had previously been committed to the unit. The case of Stumpf v. Fidelity Gas Co. n204\nis a practitioner's nightmare and a law professor's dream. The facts were relatively simple. The plaintiff claimed that the\nlease he originally executed to the defendant had terminated for lack of production at the end of the primary term. Due\nto alleged fraud by the lessee, the plaintiff did not complain about the termination of the lease until well after the\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 15\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nprimary term had expired. In the meantime the defendant lessee had, pursuant to a leasehold pooling clause, entered into\na pooling agreement with another lessee who became the operator of the unit.\n\nThe defendant alleged that the suit must be dismissed because the plaintiff had not joined any of the pooled royalty\nowners who, he claimed, were indispensable parties. The court rejected that argument but the precise reason for the\nrejection is difficult to discern. The court seemingly rejects the Veal cross-conveyance doctrine, which it discusses at\ngreat length. However, the rejection of Veal may in part be based on the fact that Veal involved a community lease, and\nthis case involved a pooling clause and pooling agreement. A second explanation is that the court is applying the\nNadeau rationale that litigation between a lessor and lessee has no effect whatsoever on the other pooled royalty\nowners. As discussed earlier, the argument also lacks much merit. n205 On rehearing, the court realized that the\ntermination of the lease would affect the non-joined owners, because the modified opinion concluded that the\nunitization agreement could not be revoked by the plaintiff because the disputed interest was validly committed to the\nunit when the agreement was executed. n206 Under Erie, the court was required to apply the law of Montana. Nadeau\nand Toomey are both decisions of the Montana Supreme Court that must be applied by the federal court. They suggest\nthat pooling and unitization agreements are not cross-conveyances. Thus the court's analysis of Veal should have\nfocused on whether the Montana Supreme Court would follow Veal, rather than the results suggested by Nadeau and\nToomey.\n\nThe third explanation given by the court arises from the notice and demand clause contained in the lease. In the per\ncuriam opinion on rehearing the court for the first time suggested that the lessee's power to pool could not be terminated\nunless the lessor complied with the notice and demand provisions of the lease. But that misstates the law as it relates to\nthe termination of leases at the end of the primary term for lack of production. Montana, like most states, treats the\nhabendum clause of a lease as a common-law fee simple determinable estate. Thus, it automatically terminates at the\nend of the primary term unless there was production, or the terms of a savings provision (such as a continuous\noperations clause) were met. n207 Normally, a lessor does not have to send notice, and demand a cure to the problem of\nlack of production when the primary term has expired. n208 Thus, one should question the reasons presented by the\ncourt in its opinion on rehearing.\n\nA fourth explanation for finding the non-joined parties not indispensable was a specific provision of the unitization\nagreement that stated: \"That nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting or passing title to any lands, leases,\nor permits, but the Operator shall acquire operating rights only.\" n209\n\nFinally, the holding is also based on Hudson v. Newell, n210 where when the plaintiffs disclaimed any right to change\nthe nature of the unit agreement if they prevailed, the remaining royalty-and working-interest owners were held not to\nbe indispensable parties. n211\n\nThus, the state of the law in Montana is unclear at best. Since all three decisions applying Montana law refused to find\nthat pooled or unitized royalty owners were indispensable parties to litigation not directly involving the pooling or\nunitization agreement it might be inferred that Montana has in effect adopted a contract theory for unitized titles.\n\n     [c] Pennsylvania\n\nA very early case involving a coal lease suggests that Pennsylvania might follow a contract theory approach to the issue\nof the nature of the unitized title. In Coolbaugh v. Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., n212 a coal lease covered two\nadjacent lots, numbers 28 and 29. An apportionment of royalties clause was contained in the joint lease. Eventually Lot\n28 was sold, and the issue before the court was whether the grantor retained any share of the apportioned royalties from\nLot 29 production. The court answered the question in the negative and suggested that the joint lease did not affect the\n\"estates\" of the individuals who contributed to the lease. The court suggested that the \"titles remained distinct as they\nwere before ... .\" n213 Though it is weak authority, it again suggests that the court would not treat the signing of a\ncommunity lease as a transfer of estates between the joint signers.\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 16\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n(n1)Footnote 101.

The exact language used by the court is as follows:\n\n           The very essence of the agreement was that the contracting parties were owners of adjacent\n       properties suitable to be explored and exploited for oil and gas, and that any resulting royalties should be\n       divided proportionately to their respective acreage. When the Hovers parted with their property what did\n       they have to contribute to the common pool of possible royalties? Nothing. The agreement had quite\n       properly provided the oil royalties should be shared until it was changed by the parties. But that result\n       would follow when they sold their property if the agreement had not mentioned it.\n\n\n  95 P.2d at 266 .\n\n    (n3)Footnote 103. Kenoyer v.

There are some ambiguities in the language just quoted.\nAre the pooling provisions contained in the transfer of a property interest (the lease) totally contractual in nature, or are\nthey possibly in the nature of real covenants? The court does not delve into that murky area. In addition, the court's\nconclusion could simply be based on a traditional property-based theory that a pooling power is not the creation of a\ncontingent future interest, and, therefore, the rule is simply not applicable.\n\n  In Rosenbaum v. Texas Energies, Inc., 241 Kan. 295, 736 P.2d 888, 96 O.&G.R. 259 (1987) the Kansas Supreme\nCourt eschewed placing a label on the rights created by a unitization or pooling agreement, merely concluding that\n\"Creation of a valid unit would create vested rights ... \" 736 P.2d at 893 . Here the plaintiffs were seeking to stop their\nlessee from de-unitizing a unit because the lessee did not have the power to unitize the other joined interests. The court\nconcluded that the other royalty owner's interests were not subject to a valid unitization clause and therefore there was\nnever a valid unit created. Because no unit had been created no vested rights came into existence, and plaintiffs had no\nauthority to challenge the de-unitization.\n\n  The court in Coulter v. Anadarko Petroleum Corp., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19817 (D. Kan. Oct. 8, 1999) (unpublished\nopinion) did not analyze Kenoyer or Hover when it decided not to aggregate the claims of royalty owners to pooling\nagreements in order to meet the federal jurisdictional requirement of having a minimum of $75,000 in damages. The\ncourt seemingly ignored the ramifications of the execution of the pooling agreement setting forth both a royalty fraction\nand a royalty calculation methodology that was binding on all signatory parties.\n\n    (n6)Footnote 106.

The Oklahoma City ordinance authorized its\nBoard of Adjustment to force-pool mineral and/or royalty interests before it would authorize the issuance of a drilling\npermit. While having no trouble upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance, the court added the following\nlanguage regarding the effect of the ordinance on the title of the parties who were force-pooled:\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 17\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n           Here the city created the relationship as it now exists between the parties ... . The relationship in the\n       nature of a tenancy in common resulted merely as an incident to the application of the city's police\n       powers. The tenancy owes its existence to those powers and is entirely subject thereto. The parties cannot\n       successfully assert their common law rights as tenants in common, for such a tenancy did not exist.\n\n\n  90 P.2d at 939 .\n\n  Since tenancies in common require that a property interest be conveyed by one party to that party and another or to\ntwo other persons, the clear implication of the language cited above is that a pooling of mineral and/or royalty interests\ninvolves just such a conveyance.\n\n    (n10)Footnote 110.

The court was aware that both Texas and California had adopted a\ncross-conveyance theory for similar language in pooling or unitization agreements. It nonetheless rejected that approach\nfor the contract theory largely on the basis of the arguments presented by Leo Hoffman in his early work. L. Hoffman,\nVoluntary Pooling and Unitization (1954). Hoffman argued that the adoption of the cross-conveyance theory was\ndictum in the two major Texas cases embracing the concept. In addition, he supported the emphasis of the Oklahoma\nSupreme Court in its conclusion that parties who enter into pooling or unitization agreements do not intend to effect a\ncross-conveyance of their mineral or royalty interests. Hoffman, op cit. at 160. Finally, the court felt that the weight of\npersuasive authority favored adoption of the contract doctrine, although in its string citation of cases to support that\nconclusion the court includes some questionable authority. See, e.g., Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Southwest Natural\nProduction Co., 60 So. 2d 9, 221 La. 608, 1 O.&G.R. 1186 (1952) ; Shell Petroleum Corp. v.

The authors have classified both Louisiana and Pennsylvania as states that have taken ambiguous positions on\nthe adoption of the contract or cross-conveyance theories. See § 19.02[3][a] and [c] infra. The court also cites Kenoyer\nv. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 173 Kan. 183, 245 P.2d 176, 1 O.&G.R. 1126 (1953) , which is explained in § 19.02[1][a]\nsupra is very weak support for the adoption of the contract doctrine.\n\n    (n18)Footnote 118.

See n.119 supra. For a discussion of Hover, see § 19.02[1][a] supra.\n\n     (n21)Footnote 121. Professors Williams and Meyers argue that Garvin can be read as interpreting pooling\nagreements to create appurtenant rights to the parties that attach to the lands that are contributed. Since the rights are\nappurtenant, only those who own the lands or interests contributed to the unit can claim an apportioned share of unit\nproduction. This would contrast with a finding that the rights created are in gross or personal to the contributing party,\nwhich would remain in the grantor unless expressly mentioned in a grant of the underlying interest, notwithstanding his\ntransfer of the contributed mineral or royalty interest. 6 Williams & Meyers, Oil & Gas Law 572.1 (1988).\n\n     (n22)Footnote 122. 350 P.2d at 974 . Lewis Mosburg, Jr., who wrote the Discussion Notes in this case, also opined\nthat it was the death of the cross-conveyance theory in Oklahoma. But he was concerned by the lack of a strong\nstatement by the majority that it was rejecting the cross-conveyance theory in general, as opposed to not applying it in\nthis case because of the language of the agreement. Discussion Notes, 13 O.&G.R. 1008-12 .\n\n     (n23)Footnote 123. Again the Discussion Notes by Mr. Mosburg raise that issue and for him raised the unsettling\npossibility that the issue had not really been decided. After all, it would have been easy for the court to have cited\nSinclair rather than the specific agreement language in finding that there were only contractual rights transferred by\nvirtue of the pooling agreement.

The court reiterated its support for the view that a compulsory pooling or unitization order does\nnot create a cotenancy. Wakefield v. State, 1957 OK 10, 306 P.2d 305, 7 O.&G.R. 291 (Okla. 1957) ; Amis v. Bryan\nPetroleum Corp., 1939 OK 192, 185 Okla. 206, 90 P.2d 936 (1939) . The language of the compulsory pooling statute in\nOklahoma also supports the contract theory since it provides that there is no vesting or transfer of title by virtue of the\ncompulsory pooling order. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, § 287.9.\n\n  The Tenneco Oil and Wakefield analysis that a compulsory pooling order does not create a cotenancy relationship\nbetween the parties was followed in Schulte v. Apache Corp., 1991 OK 61, 814 P.2d 469, 113 O.&G.R. 336 (Okla.\n1991) , on later appeal, 949 P.2d 291 (Okla. 1995) .\n\n    (n26)Footnote 126. The court only cited Sinclair Crude Oil and L.

It was an attempt to dissolve the unit without going through the\nCorporation Commission. Professor Kuntz in the Discussion Notes following this case in the Oil and Gas Reporter\nsuggests that since the agreement, in order to be approved, required a provision for unit dissolution, the commission\nwould still have authority to dissolve the unit upon the petition of an interested party.

Va. 437, 92 S.E. 427 (1917) . The court did note that there was contrary authority principally in Texas and\nCalifornia and suggested that the Texas rule is different because Texas has adopted ownership-in-place theory for oil\nand gas. Such a rationale would not explain why California adopted the cross-conveyance theory, for it is a\nnon-ownership jurisdiction. The court ultimately selected the contract theory, not because of the way the state classifies\nthe ownership of oil and gas but because it is \"supported by well-reasoned and more persuasive authority.\" Id.\n\n   The nature of unitized titles was explored in depth by the Utah Supreme Court in Dye v. Miller & Viele, 587 P.2d 139,\n63 O.&G.R. 136 (Utah 1978) . The plaintiff and defendants disputed the title to certain lands. The plaintiff claimed\nthrough a chain of title tracing back to a 1927 tax deed. The defendants' claim was based on a 1928 sheriff's deed and by\ntitle through adverse possession. Their allegations relating to adverse possession were supported by the defendants'\nexecution of a voluntary pooling agreement more than four years prior to the onset of this litigation. There had been\nproduction from a well on the unit but off of the disputed acreage. The evidence showed that the defendants were never\nin actual possession of the disputed acreage. The defendants' argument was that the pooling agreement and the\noff-acreage unit activities constituted constructive possession of the disputed lands. If the court had followed a\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 20\n                               2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\ncross-conveyance theory, one might be able to argue constructive possession since the defendants would have in effect\nconveyed a fractional share of the royalty interest in the lands described in the 1928 royalty deed. The court, however,\nrejected that claim, not on the basis of the contract doctrine, but on the general proposition that actual possession cannot\nbe claimed by remote control, citing Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

One could argue\nthat if the defendants had in effect conveyed their royalty interest they would meet the requirement of constructive\npossession. The more difficult problem of attributing the actual possession of the premises to the off-premises activity\nof the pooled unit operator would still face the claimant.\n\n    (n39)Footnote 136.

The language of the court is somewhat confusing and contradictory. It stated:\n\n              It is contended by appellee [drillsite owner] that to place this construction [non-apportionment] upon\n         the contract involved in this case would, in effect, convey a part of the real estate of Lola M. Davis to her\n         sisters, when there is in the lease no words which would effect such a conveyance. This argument is not\n         well founded. The interpretation we give the contract, instead of having the effect declared, has the effect\n         of preventing one of the parties from securing a part of the estate of the others without procuring a\n         conveyance ... .\n\n\n  Id. The authors would not read the above paragraph as indicating a clear rejection of the cross-conveyance theory for\ncommunity leases. For a contrary view, see L.

In addition to Bayside Land, several later California decisions relating to the tax consequences\nof a pooling or unitization agreement also reached results that were more consistent with a contract theory than a\ncross-conveyance theory. But these cases were decided long after the strong commitment was made by the California\nSupreme Court to the cross-conveyance theory. Compare Belridge Oil Co. v.

Rptr. at 10 . The court also relies on a hard rock mineral partition case that raised\nsimilar issues. In Hardie v. Chew Fish Yuen, 258 Cal. App. 2d 301, 65 Cal. Rptr. 594, 28 O.&G.R. 1 (1968) , a hard\nrock mineral lease covered two separate parcels. The original lease had been executed by the mineral estate owners of\none parcel, but on the second parcel only half of the mineral estate was clearly leased. The other half of the second\nparcel was only leased by the life tenant. The remaindermen did not execute the lease. The plaintiff eventually acquired\nall of the interest in the second parcel and brought this quiet title action claiming that the lease of the half interest was\nvoid because the remaindermen were not joined, and it would thus constitute an act of waste. None of the owners of the\nfirst parcel was joined in the lawsuit. Without citing Tanner the court concluded that the owners of the interests in the\nfirst parcel were indispensable parties because the community lease effected a cross-conveyance of royalties between\nboth parcels that would be detrimentally affected by the plaintiff's quiet title action. The omitted parties would have had\na right to share in the royalties from leasehold production on the second parcel, and therefore no action seeking to\nterminate the second parcel lease could be brought unless all of the parties to the original community lease were joined.\n\n    (n55)Footnote 152.

Since Mrs. Lee did not\n       join in the lease, the execution and delivery of it by [the executives] ... would neither divest her of any\n       part of her royalty interest in the 20-acre tract nor vest in her any interest in the royalty in the 42.75-acre\n       tract.\n\n\n  174 S.W.2d at 46 .\n\n     (n77)Footnote 174.

In spite of appellees' argument to the\n       contrary, we can not comprehend how, in such a situation, the other royalty owners' interest could not be\n       affected. It seems clear that the rule laid down as to necessary parties in Veal ... would control in the case\n       before us. Therefore if the 1957 and 1959 Units were to be declared null and void as to appellees'\n       interest, which we do not so hold, the royalty owners under the other leases in the two unitized units\n       would have such a royalty interest in the appellees' lease to make them necessary and indispensable\n       parties.\n\n\n   343 S.W.2d at 733-734 .

The court did not address the question of how to calculate royalties in a split stream sale of\n       production from a pooled unit. Moreover, the Pucketts' lease specifically states that the entire acreage\n       pooled in a unit shall be treated for all purposes, \"except the payment of royalties on production from the\n       pooled unit,\" as if it was included in the lease.

The court's language would suggest that the removal of acreage from a pooling or unitization\nagreement has no impact on the remaining parties. That would not be the case regardless of whether the agreements\nwere treated as creating contractual rights or conveying property rights. The entire pooling or unitization agreement\nmight be rendered economically useless, and, should there be existing production, it is clear that the apportionment\nfractions would be different if the leasehold acreage was involved. If the producing well was located on the withdrawn\nacreage, the impact on the remaining owners would be devastating.\n\n    (n112)Footnote 204. Stumpf v.

The Royalty Clause and Related Provisions\n\n§ 660 Classification of Royalty Interest as “In Gross” or as “Appurtenant”\nReference has been made elsewhere to a number of classifications applicable to royalty and other\nnonoperating interests in production. Thus for certain purposes it has been necessary to classify such\ninterests as realty or as personalty,1 as corporeal or incorporeal,2 or as principal or in-come.3\nClassification of shut-in royalty has been required for the purpose of ascertaining the person or persons\nentitled to the receipt thereof under some circumstances.4\n\nYet another classification problem has given rise to some difficulty, viz., whether a royalty interest\ncreated by a lease is in gross or is appurtenant to the lessor’s mineral interest. Specifically, where a\nlessor conveys his interest in the premises (or in the minerals therein) without specific mention of the\nroyalty interest arising under a previously executed lease, does such royalty interest pass with the\nconveyed interest?\nQuite infrequently this matter may be resolved by an express lease provision to the effect that the\nbenefits of the lessor under the lease shall be appurtenant to the land of the lessor.5 In other instances\nan express “subject-to” clause in the conveyance itself may make it clear that the conveyance is\nintended to cover and include the grantor’s benefits under the lease. We have discussed elsewhere\ncertain of the construction problems arising from the employment of this clause.6\nCurrent authority supports the position that a lessor’s lease benefits, including his royalty interest, are\nappurtenant to his mineral interest and pass with a conveyance of such mineral interest even though\n1\n    See §§ 212–214, supra.\n2\n    See §§ 208–211, supra.\n3\n    See §§ 512.2, 514.1, supra.\n\nThis problem of classification has arisen in a number of states by reason of constitutional or statutory provisions allocating various types\nof receipts from state-owned lands. See, e.g., State ex rel. Fatzer v. Board of Regents, 176 Kan. 179, 269 P.2d 425, 3 O.&G.R. 1280\n(1954). The question here was whether bonus, rentals and royalties were “moneys derived from the sale of lands,” as that term was used\nin a statute allocating such moneys to a particular purpose. It was held that royalties were such moneys, but that bonus and rentals were\nnot.\n4\n    Morriss v. First Nat’l Bank, 249 S.W.2d 269, 1 O.&G.R. 1371 (Tex. Civ. App. 1952, error ref’d n.r.e.) (controversy over whether\npersons entitled to delay rentals or persons entitled to royalty were entitled to receipt of shut-in royalty; held, owners of royalty were\nentitled to receive such payment).\n5\n    E.g., the following provision of a California lease form:\n\n       “The benefits of each Lessor under this lease, including rent and royalty accruing hereunder from the entire demised\n       premises are appurtenant to the land of such Lessor included in this lease, and any transferee or subsequent owner of the\n       title to the land of any Lessor shall, as between the parties to this lease, their successors or assigns, be entitled to receive\n       such appurtenant benefits under this lease except to the extent that such benefits be expressly reserved or shall have been\n       theretofore transferred in whole or in part.”\n\n\n\n6\n    See §§ 340–340.4, supra.\n\n                                                             SUSAN BOVA\n\f                                                                                                                                 Page 2 of 4\n                                          3-6 Williams & Meyers, Oil and Gas Law § 660\n\nneither the lease nor the deed contains such clauses.7 Earlier authority in Texas to the contrary8 has\nbeen overruled.9 By appropriate language in a deed or other conveyance, of course, a royalty interest\nmay be severed from the mineral estate.10\n\n                                                [Effect of pooling or unitization]\nA somewhat more difficult problem concerns the effect of pooling or unitization. Where a lessor is\nbound by pooling or unitization, he gives up a portion of his royalty interest in his own premises\n(Blackacre) and receives a portion of the royalty in the other premises (e.g., Whitacre) included in the\nunit. Or stated somewhat differently, he becomes entitled to an apportioned share of the royalty on\n7\n     See, e.g., the following:\n\nHardcastle v.

Currie, 142 Tex. 93, 176 S.W.2d 302 (1943).\n10\n     See § 301 et seq., supra.\n\nA related problem was treated in Avery v. Moore, 150 W. Va. 136, 144 S. E. 2d 434, 23 O.&G.R. 1012 (1965). In the partition of a larger\ntract, plaintiff’s predecessor in interest (the owner of a 1/5 undivided interest) received the 50-acre parcel involved in this action. The\npartition deed reserved coal and mining rights and provided that on the expiration of the existing oil and gas lease, the owner of each\npartitioned parcel would have leasing rights but the owners of the other partitioned parcels would share in the royalty on the basis of\ntheir interests prior to the partition. Plaintiff conveyed the 50-acre parcel to defendant by a deed reciting that it was subject to a provision\nin the partition deed with reference to leasing and development. In this declaratory judgment action, it was held that the deed from\nplaintiff to defendant conveyed plaintiff’s entire interest in the oil and gas within and under the 50-acre parcel, subject to the rights of\nother claimants under the partition deed to share in the royalty, but that the deed did not convey to defendant any royalty interest in the\nother four partitioned parcels. In other words, the court held that plaintiff’s interest in the royalty in the other four partitioned parcels\nwas not appurtenant to his interest in the parcel he received by the voluntary partition.\nIn McCall v. McCall, 24 S.W.3d 508, 145 O.&G.R. 401 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, writ denied), the court was faced with\na similar problem as in Avery. After a partition deed, Ms. McCall was given a royalty interest in the mineral estates that had been given\nto third parties. She later conveyed to some of her children and a family-owned corporation the mineral estates she received from the\npartition along with the “appurtenances.” One of the children asserted that the deeds conveyed the royalty interests burdening the third\nparties’ mineral estates. The court disagreed, noting that these royalty interests were not “appurtenant” to the conveyed mineral estates.\nTo be appurtenant, a thing must be incidental to or indispensable to the conveyed interest. The court thus distinguished Day & Co. v.\nTexland Petroleum, Inc., 786 S.W.2d 667, 105 O.&G.R. 590 (Tex. 1990), that had found an executive power appurtenant to a conveyed\nmineral estate. Because the royalty interests were not appurtenant, they did not pass in the general warranty deeds and were retained by\nMs. McCall.\n\nThe rationale of McCall was not followed in Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v. BNW Property Co., 393 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n2012, rev. denied), and Chesapeake Exploration, LLC v. BNW Property Co., 393 S.W.3d 852 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2012, rev. denied),\nwhere the court concluded that a “naked” executive right appurtenant to a third party-owned non-executive mineral interest was conveyed\nwhen a fractional mineral interest containing all of the attributes of a mineral interest were conveyed.\n\n                                                              SUSAN BOVA\n\f                                                                                                                             Page 3 of 4\n                                         3-6 Williams & Meyers, Oil and Gas Law § 660\n\nproduction from the unit whether such production is from a well or wells located on the premises he\nleased or on some other portion of the unit. The question may arise in this instance whether his royalty\ninterest in such other premises included within the unit (e.g., Whiteacre) is appurtenant to his interest\nin Blackacre so that it will pass by a conveyance of his interest in Blackacre. California authority is\nto the effect that the royalty interest in Whiteacre under these circumstances is in gross and will not\npass by a conveyance of Blackacre unless specially mentioned therein.11 The preferable view is to the\ncontrary, viz., that the royalty interest in production from Whiteacre is appurtenant to the lessor’s\ninterest in Blackacre and passes with a conveyance of Blackacre unless specially reserved from such\nconveyance.12 There is uncertainty in some states as to the applica-ble law on this matter. It is\nadvisable, therefore, to include in any conveyance affecting premises included in a pooling, unitization\nor joint operating agreement express provision concerning the grantor’s interest in production from\nother premises included in such agreement. The following clause has been suggested for this purpose:\n\n     “It is agreed and made a part of this grant that if the interest hereby conveyed, in whole or in part,\n     is now or hereafter, either or both, included in a valid pooling agreement or agreements, either or\n     both, which includes all or any part of the above described land covered by this deed, then grantee,\n     his heirs and assigns, shall be entitled to all payments and other rights accruing by reason of any\n     such agreement or agreements as to the interest hereby conveyed; that is, this grant includes the\n     right to participate in and under any such agreement insofar as it covers or may include the interest\n\n11\n    See Tanner v. Title Insurance & Trust Co., 20 Cal. 2d 814, 129 P.2d 383 (1942). A community lease was executed by several\nlandowners. The court declared that:\n\n      “The royalty interest thus transferred by each landowner to his colessors is an incorporeal hereditament in gross … and the\n      grantee’s interest in the oil produced upon the property of one of the colessors is entirely separate and distinct from the\n      royalty interest retained by him in oil which might be produced from his own premises. … Although the cases clearly\n      establish that the percentage of the royalty reserved by a lessor in oil produced from his own land passes to a grantee of\n      the fee as an incident of the conveyance …, except as such rights are reserved by the deed, the incorporeal hereditament\n      owned by the grantor in the oil produced from the land of the colessors, existing in gross, obviously does not follow the\n      conveyance of the lessor’s land, but can only be conveyed by a specific transfer of that interest.” 129 P.2d at 386–387.\nAnother California case has held that a contract to sell land does not include the vendor’s royalty interest under a community oil and\ngas lease covering such land.

Voluntary\nPooling and Unitization\n\n§ 929 Pooling or Unitization Agreement as Cross-Conveyance or Contract: Introduction\n\nStated in simplest terms, a pooling or unitization agreement authorizes the exploration and/or\ndevelopment of separate parcels of land as if there were a single owner thereof and provides for the\nallocation of the expenses and proceeds of such operations among the owners of interests in the several\nparcels. Thus, if the agreement affects Blackacre and Whiteacre, the owners of each tract will share in\nproduction on a basis specified in the agreement, whether such production is from Blackacre or\nWhiteacre.\n\nA number of cases and writers1 have raised the question whether a pooling or unitization agreement\nis a cross-conveyance of interests in land or is a mere contract; that is, does the agreement have the\neffect of conveying to the owner of Blackacre some interest in Whiteacre and of conveying to the\nowner of Whiteacre some interest in Blackacre, or does the agreement have the effect merely of giving\neach owner a contract right to share in the production from premises other than those he has\ncontributed to the agreement. Upon the answer to this question, a number of important consequences\nare said to depend. In the subsections which follow we indicate the consequences said to flow from\nthe answer given this question and the effect of lease provisions expressly negating any intent to effect\na cross-conveyance. Thereafter, we examine the case authority on the matter in a number of states.\n\n     § 929.1 Pooling or unitization agreement as cross-conveyance or contract: Consequences\nA number of important legal consequences have been said to turn upon the answer to the question\nwhether a pooling or unitization agreement effects a cross-conveyance of interests in the affected\npremises among the parties to the agreement or merely creates contract rights in such parties. The more\nimportant of these consequences sometimes viewed as turning upon this question relate to the\nfollowing matters:\n\n                                              [Indispensable parties to suit]\n\n(1) Indispensable parties to title or other suits involving premises included in a pooling or unitization\nagreement.\n\nThe problem of indispensable parties to litigation affecting land included in a pooling and unitization\nagreement has been discussed herein.1 For many years in Texas, the case of Veal v. Thomason,2\nestablished the proposition that a pooling or unitization agreement effects a cross-conveyance and that,\n1\n    See, e.g., the following:\n\nHoffman, Voluntary Pooling and Unitization 144–189 (1954) (strongly opposing the cross-conveyance theory);\n\nFrench and Elliott, “Legal Effect of Voluntary Pooling and Unitization: Theories and Party Practice,” 35 Tex. L. Rev. 401 (1957);\n\nMasterson, “The Nature of Unitized Title,” 10 Sw. L.J. 146 (1956).\n1\n    See §§ 928–928.5, supra.\n2\n    Veal v. Thomason, 138 Tex. 341, 159 S.W.2d 472 (1942).\n\n                                                         SUSAN BOVA\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2 of 7\n                                       6-9 Williams & Meyers, Oil and Gas Law § 929\n\ntherefore, all persons having an interest in the pooled or unitized premises are necessary parties to an\naction involving one such parcel included in the agreement. As was noted earlier, the Veal rule can have\na debilitating effect on the substantive rights of the parties. A change in the Texas Rules of Civil\nProcedure, however, has cast a doubt on the continuing validity of that part of the Veal rule that finds\nsuch parties indispensable. While not challenging the cross-conveyance doctrine, a recent Texas court\nof appeals decision refused to apply the necessary and indispensable party part of the Veal rule to a suit\nbrought by a royalty owner seeking to invalidate a pooling of its interest without requiring the joinder\nof all other pooled royalty owners.2.1\n\n                                                  [Consent to agreement]\n\n(2) Necessity of consent to a pooling or unitization agreement.\n\nThe theory that a pooling or unitization agreement effects a cross-conveyance of interests among the\nparties thereto was viewed in Brown v. Smith3 as requiring the joinder of royalty owners in a pooling\nor unitization agreement if such agreement was to be fully effective. The plaintiffs in this action sought\nto recover the bonus agreed to be paid for the execution of a unitized lease but plaintiffs had failed to\nobtain the joinder of the owner of a royalty interest in a 20-acre portion of the 62.75-acre tract covered\nby the lease. In holding that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover since the tendered lease did not\nmeasure up to the unitized lease contracted to be given, the court noted that without joinder of the\nroyalty owner, the lease would not divest the owner of her interest in the 20-acre tract nor vest in her\nany interest in the royalty in the 42.75 acres; as a result, the lessee’s freedom of operation on the\n62.75-acre tract would be materially affected. We discuss elsewhere herein (§§ 925–925.6 supra) the\nstate of authority regarding parties whose consent to a voluntary pooling or unitization agreement is\nnecessary. It suffices here to observe that the cross-conveyance theory is said to make necessary the\nconsent of all persons having operating or nonoperating interests in premises affected by a pooling or\nunitization agreement.4\n\n                                               [Conveyancing requirements]\n\n(3) Application of the statute of frauds or conveyancing statutes to voluntary pooling or unitization\nagreement.\n\nObviously if the cross-conveyance theory is followed, then a voluntary pooling or unitization\nagreement involves the conveyance of interests in land and the requirements of the statute of frauds\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n       Sabre Oil & Gas Corp. v.

Peterson,7 the court apparently accepted the view that a pooling clause of\na lease might be invalid under the Rule against Perpetuities if the cross-conveyance view were adopted\nbut that such clause was valid under the contract view of the effect of a pooling or unitization\nagreement. This matter will be discussed in a later section.8\n\n                                                        [Venue questions]\n\n(5) Application of venue statutes to actions involving the construction or validity of a pooling or\nunitization agreement.\n\nAdoption of the cross-conveyance or of the contract theory as to the effect of a pooling or unitization\nagreement may affect the application of a venue statute to various controversies. Thus, in Texas, a\nvenue statute provided that “suits for the recovery of lands or damages thereto, or to remove\nencumbrances upon the title to land, or to quiet the title to land, or to prevent or stay waste on lands,\nmust be brought in the county in which the land, or a part thereof, may lie.”9 In Renwar Oil Corp. v.\nLancaster10 it was held that this statute was applicable to a declaratory judgment action in which an\nadjudication was sought concerning the effectiveness of a unitization agreement. The court noted that:\n\n5\n   See, e.g., Kuklies v. Reinert, 256 S.W.2d 435, 2 O.&G.R. 794 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1953, error ref’d n.r.e.)

Hoffman. He raises the possibility that should the owner of\na separate tract included in a unit conveyance convey such tract without mention of his rights in the\nunit agreement, such conveyance would not affect his interest in such other premises.12 In other words,\nif Blackacre is included in a pooling or unitization agreement affecting Blackacre and Whiteacre, a\nsubsequent conveyance of Blackacre which made no reference to the agreement would not convey the\ngrantor’s interest in royalty on pooled production from Whiteacre.\nAlthough mention of this suggestion must be made for purpose of completeness of discussion of\npossible impact of the cross-conveyance theory in various contexts, we must also emphasize our\ndisagreement with the suggestion itself. In our view the question is one of intent of the parties, not\nwhether pooling or unitization effects cross-conveyances. The court should give effect to a properly\nmanifested intent of the parties as to whether the grantor’s interest in unit production from Whiteacre\nis conveyed with Blackacre. But where the parties have failed adequately to manifest their intent in this\nregard, the question becomes one of judicially ascertained intent and, in our opinion, the courts should\nusually take the position that the grantor’s interest in unit production is included in a conveyance of\nthe premises he has committed to the unit. In other words, the interest of a party in unit production\nshould ordinarily be viewed as appurtenant to his interest in premises committed to the unit rather than\n“in gross.”13 Decisions on this matter do not appear to have been affected by the adoption or rejection\nof the cross-conveyance theory; thus, both in California and in Mississippi the cross-conveyance\ntheory appears to have been adopted, but the two states differ in answering the question whether a\nparty’s interest in unit production is appurtenant or in gross.14\n\n                                   [Operation of recordation statutes and bona fide\n\n                                                       purchaser doctrine]\n\n(7) Effect of pooling or unitization agreement upon prior unrecorded interests in affected lands.\n\nIf a pooling or unitization agreement is viewed as a conveyance it may be contended that execution\nof such an agreement brings into play doctrines relating to the operation of recordation statutes and the\n11\n     Renwar Oil Corp. v.

Thus, if subsequent to the creation of unrecorded legal or equitable\ninterests in Blackacre, the record title owner commits Blackacre to a pooling or unitization agreement,\nwill such unrecorded legal or equitable interests be defeated insofar as inconsistent with the interests\nof other parties claiming under the agreement? In Sohio Petroleum Co. v. Jurek,15 it was urged that by\nvirtue of the pooling of Blackacre, the lessors of other pooled tracts became the owners of undivided\ninterests in Blackacre, thereby cutting off the equitable interests of the plaintiffs therein under the bona\nfide purchaser doctrine. The court in this case refused to apply the cross-conveyance theory. This\nholding is contrary to the weight of Texas authority,16 but in the instant case it enabled the court to\navoid addressing itself to this issue. As indicated by a student note, the logic of the cross-conveyance\ntheory requires application of the bona fide purchaser doctrine and the recording statutes to pooling\nagreement.17\n\n                                                        [Tax consequences]\n\n(8) Tax treatment of participant in pooling or unitization agreement.\nThe characterization of a unit agreement is also of significance for federal tax purposes.

Examples of such provisions are collected\nelsewhere herein.1\n\nThe effect of such a provision in the agreement remains uncertain. There is some authority for the\ncontention that it will be given effect by the courts. In Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Peterson,2 for example,\nin holding that the Rule against Perpetuities was inapplicable to a pooling clause in an oil and gas\nlease, the court emphasized certain language in the pooling clause said to indicate that “the effect of\nunitization was to be only with respect to allocation of production and the computation of royalties and\nwas not to effect cross-transfers of royalty interests.”3 It further noted that the unitization agreement\nitself clearly provided that “[n]othing herein … shall be construed to transfer title to any land or to any\nlease or operating agreement.”4 And a distinguished writer on the law of unitization has essayed the\nfollowing conclusions:\n\n     “There can hardly be any objection in the law to such an express agreement that the pooling or\n     unitization shall not constitute an exchange or transfer of real property interests. Presumably such\n     a provision is valid and, therefore, effective for the purpose of nullifying any cross-conveyancing\n     which could otherwise result.”5\n\nThe authors hereof are not so sanguine on the matter. Although parties to an agreement may “make\ntheir own law” in many respects by contract, they may not do so for all purposes. If, for example,\napplication of the Rule against Perpetuities to a lease pooling clause or to a pooling or unitization\nagreement or if the question of indispensable parties in a title or other suit involving unitized premises\nturn upon whether the agreement effects a cross-conveyance or is a “mere” contract, it seems difficult\nto believe that a characterization given by the parties to their agreement will be effective to determine\nsuch important legal consequences.\nWilliams & Meyers, Oil and Gas Law\nCopyright 2014, Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., a member of the LexisNexis Group.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    See § 921.6, supra.\n2\n   Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

In General\n   The word \"royalty\" is a chameleon-hued term. It changes meaning with\nthe context in which it is used. As commonly understood, a royalty is a real\nproperty interest with two distinguishing characteristics. It is nonpossess01y\nand it is free of production and operating expenses. The owner of such an\ninterest has no right to explore, drill, or produce oil and gas; similarly, he\nnormally has no right to execute oil and gas leases. T he principal benefit\nconferr-ed by royalty ownership is the right to a fraction of oil, gas, or\nmineral production free of drilling, mining, and operating expenses. 287·1\n   This common understanding of the term \"royalty\" is correct in a general\nsense, but it is both underinclusive and overinclusive. It is underinclusive\nbecause it does not fully encompass all contexts in which the word is used.\nHybrid interests can be created. The separation of all possessory rights from\na mineral fee interest will not automatically transform it into a royalty, 288\nand, conversely, rights normally attached to a mineral fee interest, even\nincluding the right to patticipate in leases,289 can be attached to a royalty.\nMore commonly the royalty owner is given specified rights to use the\nsurface and subsurface or rights to share in lease benefits in addition to\nproduction. 290 Although instruments creating such interests almost invari-\nably create problems of interpretation and lead to litigation over whether the\ninterest is a royalty or a fractional interest in the mineral fee, 291 they are\nencountered with surprising frequency.\n   Additional ly, the word \"royalty\" is used in oil and gas leases and\n\n   287 1\n      ·   There is an exception for some overriding royalties carved from leases subject to a\njoint operating agreement. See. e.g., Boldrick v. BTA Oil Producers, 222 S.W.3d 672 (Tex.\nApp.-Eastland 2007) and refer to Section 17.3(E) of this treatise.\n   288  See, e.g., Buffalo Ranch Co. v. Thomason, 727 S. W.2d 331 (Tex.. App.-Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1987, writ refd n.r.e.).\n   289\n       Elick v. Champlin Petroleum Co.,-697 S.W.2d I (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n1985, writ refd n.r.e.).\n   290 See. e.g., Brady v. Security Home lnv. Co .. 640 S.W.2d 731 (Tex. App.-Houston\n\n(14th Dist.] 1982, n.w.h.); Nee! v. Alpar Resources. Inc., 797 S.W.2d 361 (Tex.\nApp.-Amarillo 1990, n.w.h.).\n    291 See, e.g.. Altman v. Blake, 712 S.W.2d 117 (Tex. 1986); Diamond Shamrock Corp.\n\nv. Cone, 673 S.W.2d 310 (Tex. App.- Amarillo 1984, writ refd n.r.e.). Problems of\ninterpreting such instruments are discussed at Section 3.5(8) of this treatise. See also Bruce\nM. Kramer, Conveying Minerallllterests- Mastering the Problem Areas, 26 TULSA L.J. 175\n( 1990).\n\n                                                                        (l!<llll/\\-1 U2008   l'ub.R257~)\n\f2.4[B]                            Texas Law of Oil and Gas                                    2-62\n\noccasionally in other instruments to describe payments that are not based on\nproduction. The most co11Ullon example is shut-in royalties, which are\npayments made to maintain a lease where all wells have been shut in for Jack\nof a market. Minimum royalties and some forms of compensatory and in lieu\nroyalties may also not be tied entirely to production. 292 Royalty owners have\nargued that settlements between gas producers and purchasers over the\npurchasers' failure to take or pay for contracted amounts of production\nshould also be subject to royalty payments.293 The term has also been used\nto refer to a lessor 's share of oil or gas after they have been produced or to\nthe money payable to the lessor from the sale of such production. 294\n  The common understanding of royalty is overinclusive in that it encom-\npasses interests not usually referred to as royalties. For example, the owner\nof a production payment has a nonpossessory interest which entitles her to\nan expense-free share of production, but she is not usually considered to own\na \"royalty.\"\n   This section will attempt to describe the vruiety of interests that, either\nthrough common usage or by their nature, may fairly be considered forms of\nroyalty or closely related thereto. Its major focus will be on the traditional\nroyalty interests: the lessor's royalty, the royalty created by grant or\nreservation in a deed, and the overriding royalty carved from a working\ninterest. Except when otherwise indicated, the term \"royalty\" will be used in\naccordance with its commonly understood meaning.\n\n  B.       Types, Duration, and Size of Royalties\n   A royalty is usuaJly categorized in accordance with the transaction in\nwhich it was created. These are principally the execution of an oil and gas\nlease, the transfer of an interest in land by deed, and the assignment of all or\npart of a lessee's working interest. Regardless of how created, all such\nroyalties are interest in real property and are governed by the doctrines\napplicable to real property. 294.1\n\n\n   292\n       Refer to Sections 4.5(C) and (F) of this treatise, dealing with shut-in royalty and\nminimum royalty provisions.\n   293   This issue is discussed in Section 4.6(E)(4) of this treatise.\n   294\n         See Jones v. O'Brien, 251 S.W. 208 (Tex. Comm'n App. 1923).\n   294 1\n      ·   See, e.g., Sheffield v. Hogg, 77 S.W.2d 1021 , 124 Tex. 290 (1934), mot. overruled.\n80 S.W.2d 741. 124 Tex. 290 (1935} (landowner's royally reserved in executing oil and gas\nlease): Kelly Oil Co.. Inc. v. Svetlik. 975 S.

Bennett. 227 S.W. 3d\n\n                                                                          11M JOA-11/2008   Puh.82~~~\n\f2-63                        Types of lnterests in Oil and Gas              § 2.4[B][l]\n\n   The names used for royalties created in these transactions are not, strictly\nspeaking, legal terms. They have evolved from common industry usage.\nAlthough widely used, the terminology has not been consistent over time or\nfrom location to location. Hence a draftsman who uses a term such as\n\"overriding royalty\" should be careful to define it rather than rely on\ncommon understanding within the industry.\n   In analyzing rights of royalty owners, Texas courts have tended to ignore\ndistinctions between types of royalties. Alameda Corp. v. Transamerican\nNatural Gas Corp. 295 and Condra v. Quinoco Petroleum, Inc. 2 9 6 are good\nexamples. The courts in both cases apparently assumed that the doctrines\narticulated were applicable to all types of royalty; for much of the judicial\nlanguage refers to lease royalty, even though the royalty claims were not\nbased on the royalty clause of an oil and gas lease. Alameda Corp. involved\na nonparticipating royalty and Condra involved an overriding royalty.\nBecause of this judicial approach, most of the discussion of the calculation\nand payment of lease royalties in Section 4.6 of this treatise is also\napplicable to nonparticipating and overriding royalties. It should be noted,\nhowever, that some issues, such as the lessee's ability to pool a royalty\nwithout first obtaining the express consent of the royalty owner, require a\nconsideration of the distinctions between the types of royalty and the context\nin which the royalty was created.296· 1 A lessee's right to pool royalties is\ntreated in Section 4.8.\n        1.   Tbe Landowner's Royalty\n   The most common transaction in which a royalty is created is probably the\nexecution of an oil and gas lease. The landowner who executes an oil and gas\nlease invariably retains a right to a specified fraction of gross production.\nThis royalty, which is frequently called a \"landowner's royalty,\" terminates\nwhen the lease terminates. This limitation on its duration has practical\nconsequences primarily in situations where the original lessor has trans-\nferred all or part of his landowner's royalty to another person, for the\ntransferee's interest will not outlast the lease.\n  The landowner's royalty varied considerably in size during the first two\n\n51 (Tex. 2007) (agreement to compensate geologist by conveying overriding royalty subject\nto the statute of frauds.) Refer to Section 2.4(E).\n  295\n         950 S.W.2d 93 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1997. writ refd).\n  296    954 S.W.2d 68 (Tex. App. -San Antonio 1997, writ rerd.]\n  296 · 1\n        See, e.g., Union Pac. Resources Co. v. Hutchison, 990 S.W.2d 368 (Tex. App.-\nAuslin 1999).\n\n                                                                     md 14-<112012 l'ub.N2S72>\n\f§ 2.4[B][2]                      Texas Law of Oil and Gas                                   2-64\n\ndecades of this century297 and then became standardized at 1/8 during the\n1920s and early 1930s. Landowners' royalties that are larger than 1/8\nbecame increasingly common in oil and gas leases executed after the\nmid-1970s. It is unusual to find a lease executed within the last 20 years that\nprovides for a royalty of less than 1/6, and many now provide for a royalty\nof 115 or even 1/4. On state-owned lands the royalty is commonly set at 1/4.\n   The landowner's royalty is dealt with in detail in Chapter 4 of this treatise.\n        2.   The Nonparticipating Royalty\n   Royalties are also frequently created in deeds of real estate, by either grant\nor reservation. A royalty created in such a transaction is sometimes referred\nto as a \"nonparticipating royalty.\" 2 9 8 Its duration may be perpetual or, as\ndiscussed in Section 2.5 of this chapter, it may be limited to a defined period.\nA royalty owner's right to share in production accrues monthly as oil and gas\nare produced, and the statute of limitations begins to run when the owner\nreceives information that puts him on notice that there is production from or\nattributable to the land subject to his royalty. 299\n   The size of this type of royalty may be stated in two different ways. The\ndeed may either specify a stipulated fraction of gross production, such as\n1/16,300 or it may specify a fraction of the royalty reserved in an oil and gas\nlease. 301 The owner of a royalty stated as a set fraction of gross production\nwill be entitled to that fraction, regardless of the terms of any existing or\nfuture oil and gas lease.302 If, however, the interest creates a right to a\nfraction of royalty, the owner's share of production will vary with the size of\nthe royalty reserved in an oil and gas lease. Thus, the owner of a right to\n\"one-fourth of royalty\" will receive 1/32 of the gross production from a lease\nproviding for a l/8 royalty, but he will receive l/24 of the gross production\nfrom a lease providing for a 1/6 royalty.\n   An unfortunately common formulation combines these two basic methods\n\n  297\n       Compare Southern Oil Co. v. Colquitt, 69 S.W. 169 (Tex. Civ. App. 1902) (1110\nroyalty) with Consumers' Gas Trust Co. v. Littler. 162 Ind. 320, 70 N.E. 363 (1904) (1/6\nroyalty).\n  298\n       This term as applied in this context is obviously undcrinclusive. for all royalties are\nnonparticipating in the sense that they bear no share of the capital or operating costs.\n  299\n         Harrison v. Bass Enters. Prod. Co., 888 S. W.2d 532 (Tex. App.-El Paso 1994).\n  300\n        E.g., the instrument in Watkins v. Slaughter, 144 Tex. 179. 189 S.W.2d 699 (1945).\n  301\n        See, e.g., the deed in Schlitller v. Smith, 128 Tex. 628. 101 S.W.2d 543 (1937).\n  302   See, e.g., Winslow v.

App.-Austin 1985. n.w.h.).\n\n                                                                         !Rd 14·612012   ru~ .82~721\n\f2-65                        Types of Interests in Oil and Gas                § 2.4[B][3]\n\nof stating the size of the nonparticipating royalty. An example is the\nreservation of \"an undivided one-half interest in and to all of the royalty that\nmay be payable under any and all oil and gas leases, by which royalty is\nmeant one-eighth of production.'' Language such as this, which clearly states\nthat the parties were thinking in terms of a 118 landowner's royalty, has the\neffect of limiting the royalty to the specified fraction of 1/8. Thus the grantor\nis entitled to only 1116 of the gross production, even though an oil and gas\nlease provides for a royalty larger than the standard 118.303 Variations on this\nlanguage often lead to litigation over the intent of the parties to the deed.sou\n  Regardless of size or the manner of describing the fractional interest, the\nowner of a nonparticipating royalty is limited to receiving a share of gross\nproduction. Other lease benefits, such as bonus and delay rentals, are not\nshared with the owner of a nonparticipating royalty unless the instrument\ncreating the royalty expressly provides for participation in these benefits.304\n       3.   The Overriding Royalty\n   The term \"overriding royalty\" has at least two, somewhat different\nmeanings. In earlier years it was occasionally used in referring to any portion\nof a landowner's royalty which exceeds 1/8. For example, the lease litigated\nin Martin v. Glass 305 provided for a 1/8 royalty and an additional \"overriding\nroyalty in the aggregate amount of 1132nd of 7/8ths of all oil, gas and other\nminerals saved, produced or sold from the premises.\" This use of \"overrid-\ning royalty'' is quite uncommon today, however, and the term is typically\nused in referring to a gross production interest created in a transaction\nbetween an oil and gas lessee and a person other than the landowner. Thus\nan oil and gas lessee may assign all or part of its leasehold interest and\nreserve an overriding royalty in any production obtained from the assigned\nacreage. In some instances, a condition may be attached to the overriding\nroyalty, such as a provision that if it is not paid within a specified period after\nproduction commences, the assignor has the right to terminate the assign-\nment.305·1\n  Alternatively, an overriding royalty may be carved out of the leasehold\n\n  303\n        See, e.g., Ray v. Truitt, 751 S.W.2d 205 (Tex. App.-El Paso 1988, n.w.h.).\n  303 1\n     · See Section 3.7[A] of this Chapter.\n  304 Schlittler v. Smith, 128 Tex. 628, 101   S.W.2d 543 (1937).\n  305\n        571 F.

Although there may be some occasional\nexceptions where deliberate fraud is involved, in the absence of an express\nsavings clause all interests which are dependent upon the lease will normally\nterminate when the lease terminates. For example, in one situation, tbe lessee\nallowed a lease subject to overriding royalties to terminate by not spending\na rather minimal amount of money to repair the well's broken rod and then\nobtained a new lease which would not be subject to the overriding royalties.\nThe court conceded that there was some support for the proposition that a\nlessee that deliberately engages in conduct in order to wash out an overriding\nroyalty is subject to liability, but went on to point out that Texas courts have\ngenerally been reluctant to impose any type of duty-either an implied\ncontractual covenant or a fiduciary obligation-on a lessee in favor of the\nholder of an overriding royalty. 306..1\n   Whether reserved or assigned, the fraction of gross production included in\nthe overriding royalty should be clearly specified.

There may be,\nfor example, confusion whether a 1/16 overriding royalty entitles its owner\nto 1/16 of total production or only 1116 of the production to which the lessee\nwas entitled, e.g., 1/16 of 7/8.\n  C.     Benefits Included in a Right to a Fraction \"of Royalty\"\n   Unless the word \"royalty\" is defined, a grant or reservation of a fraction\n\"of royalty\" may lead to disputes over the royalty owner's right to share in\na variety of lease benefits. The Texas courts have generally construed the\nword \"royalty\" when used in this context to mean payments from production\nwhich will continue throughout the life of an oil and gas lease. Hence, the\nowner of \"one-fourth of royalty\" will receive her stated fraction from all\nroyalty reserved in an oil and gas lease, even though the payments from\ngross production exceed one-eighth, which was the standard royalty\nthroughout much of the twentieth century, and are labeled \"excess royalty\"\nor \"bonus.\"307 This definition excludes from royalty a lease benefit payable\nfrom production which will terminate when a specified sum has been\nreceived. Such payments, commonly designated \"oil payments\" or \"produc-\ntion payments,\" are sometimes used to provide additional or deferred bonus\nmoney, and the owner of a fraction \"of royalty\" is not entitled to share\nthem.308\n   The Texas courts have frequently dealt with other lease benefits on an ad\nhoc basis, without express reference to a general definition. Thus a\n\"compensatory\" royalty that a lessee paid from production of a well draining\nthe leased tract in settlement of its obligation to drill an offset well was\ndeemed a royalty within the meaning of a prior deed which had conveyed a\nright to one-fourth \"of the oil royalty, gas royalty and royalty in casinghead\ngas, gasoline, and royalty in other minerals in and under, and that may be\nproduced and mined\" from the premises.309 The same treatment has been\naccorded \"minimum royalty,\" which is a sum payable under a lease clause\n\n  307\n      Griffith v.

Minimum royalty falls\neven more clearly within the definition. Although such payments are pegged\nto the delay rental, they are clearly required only if the lease is maintained\nby production. The fact that they are not based on the sale price of\nproduction does not distinguish them from other common lease royalties,\nsuch as those paid on production which\n                                                          (Text continued on page 2-67)\n\n  310\n        Morriss v.

Although one appellate court has\nindicated that the royalty owners would share in such payments,311 the\nlanguage was dictum, because that issue was not before the court.\nShut-in payments do not fall within the concept of payments based on\nproduction because they are expressly paid in lieu of production.\nMoreover, treating shut-in payments as royalty is arguably inconsistent\nwith the long line of cases holding that shut-in payments do not maintain\na term royalty interest beyond its initial specified term. 312\n\n          D. Interests Similar to Royalties\n     There are several types of interests in gross production that, although\nnot generally called royalties, are similar to them.\n     A \"production payment\" is a right to a specified fraction of\nproduction until a specified sum has been received. Occasionally the\nparties creating it may provide for its termination upon some other\nevent. 3l3 Because a production payment is almost always carved out of\nthe lessee's interest in an oil and gas lease, the terminating event must\nbe something other than lease termination, or the interest in production\nwill be classified as a royalty. 314 Like a royalty, it does not bear any of\nthe costs of drilling. completing, or operating the well. A production\npayment may be limited to certain categories of production, such as oil,\ngas well gas, or casinghead gas, and may be payable in kind rather than\nin cash. Such an interest may be given to a lessor as a means of providing\nhim with an additional bonus,315 to a lender as a means of repaying or\nproviding security for a loan, or to a person, such as a geologist, who has\nperformed services for the lessee and receives the production payment\nas compensation. It may also be consideration for the assignment of an\noil and gas lease.316\n\n\n\n\n     311. Id.\n     312. Archer County v. Webb, 161 Tex. 210, 338 S.W.2d 435 (1960).

It has\nsome similarity to a royalty in that its owner is not personally liable for\ndrilling or operating expenses. Unlike the royalty, however, it entitles\nits owner only to a share of profits after expenses have been paid. The\nmethod of computing net profits, lhe manner and time of payment, and\nlhe costs to be taken into account are determined by the instrument\ncreating the interest. Because the term \"net profits\" has no fixed legal\ndefinition, it is essential that the parties creating such an interest set out\nin detail the method for determining net profits. For example, they\nshould specify whether the owner is entitled to payment only after\ndrilling and completion costs have been recouped, or whether his\ninterest is subject only to operating expenses. In lieu of a definition, the\nparties may well have their rights determined by the same doctrines\nwhich are applicable to a cotenant who does not participate in leasing\nor developing. Such a co-owner has a form of net profits interest as a\nmatter of law, although he is more commonly spoken of as having a\ncarried interest.\n     The term \"carried interest\" is used in a variety of contexts. Such an\ninterest may arise by operation of law, as in the case of cotenants, or it\nmay arise through contractual agreement. The term is, therefore, only\ngenerally descriptive of any interest which entitles its owner to a\nspecified fraction of production, while not subjecting him to personal\nliability for certain expenses. The carrying party is responsible for lhose\nexpenses but is entitled to recoup them from the carried party's share of\nproduction. Unlike lhe net profits interest, which normally continues\nfor the duration of the underlying oil and gas lease, the carried interest\nterminates when the agreed-upon costs have been recouped by the\ncarrying party. At that point the carried interest is transformed into a\nfractiona l share of the working interest, and its owner is liable for costs\nand entitled to a share of production like other working interest owners.\nThus the point to which the interest is \"carried\" is crucial to a\ndetermination of the parties' rights and liabilities. This point will vary\nfrom agreement to agreement, but frequently the owner is carried either\n\"to the casing point,\" in which case he is not personally liable for the\ndrilling and testing costs but is subject to his proportionate share of\ncompletion and operating costs, or \"to the tanks or pipeline,\" in which\ncase he is freed from liability for virtually all expenses, including\noperating expenses. Joint operating agreements commonly include a\nprovision whereby a party who does not wish to commit funds for\nadditional wells may be carried to well completion but is not entitled to\nany share of production until the carrying parties have recovered some\nmultiple of the carried party's share of cost from his share of production.\nThis type of interest is sometimes referred to as a \"Manahan\" type of\n\n\n\n2-68                                           TEX.

Nature and Incidents of Royalty Ownership\n    All varieties of royalties,319 overriding royalties, 320 and production\npayments321 are nonpossessory interests in land, whether payable in\nmoney or payable in kind.322 The same analysis is usually made of\ncarried interests323 and net profits interests.324 They are thus subject to\nad valorem taxes as interests in land,325 and an instrument creating or\ntransferring them must meet the requirements of the statute of frauds. 326\nBecause such interests are nonpossessory, their owners normally are not\nentitled to compel a suit for partition327 or to invoke possessory\nremedies, such as a trespass to try title.3 28 Moreover, because the owner\n\n\n     317.

Most of these disputes have arisen in the context\nof the landowner's royalty created by an oil and gas lease and are treated\nin Chapter 4 of this treatise.\n\n\n2.5.     TERM lNTERESTS\n\n     Royalty interests and interests in the mineral estate presumptively\nlast in perpetuity.331 Such interests may, however, be for a more limited\nduration. Term interests, whether created by grant or reservation, are\nquite common in Texas. The most typical term interest is for a specified\nperiod of time, such as five years, and so long thereafter as oil, gas, or\nother minerals are produced from the described lands. The interest\ncreated by such language normally terminates at the end of the specified\nperiod if there is no production at that time. If there is production, the\ninterest will extend beyond the specified period and terminate only\nwhen production terminates.\n\n         A. What Constitutes Production\n     Probably the most frequently litigated issue that arises under an\ninstrument creating a term interest is the meaning of \"production.\" In\nthe absence of language to the contrary in the instrument creating the\nterm interest, the payment of shut-in royalty under an oil and gas lease\ndoes not constitute \"production\" that will extend the term interest past\nits specified period.

Westwood Energy, Inc.,M a nonoperator bad signed an\nunrecorded operating agreement giving the operator a lien on the nonopera-\ntor's working interest to secure the payment of all sums due the operator.\nThe nonoperator subsequently borrowed money from MBank Abilene and\ngave the bank a deed of trust as security. When the nonoperator defaulted on\nhis obligation to pay his share of the operating expenses, the operator sued\nto foreclose its lien on the nonoperator's working interest. MBank, which\nwas made a party to the suit, alleged priority of its deed of trust over the\nunrecorded operator's lien. The court rejected MBank's argument on the\nground that the bank was deemed to have taken its lien with notice of the\npreexisting operator's lien. Under the rule of the Westland case, MBank was\non notice of every recital and reference in its chain of title, and recorded\nassignments of the nonoperator's working interest had contained references\nto the operating agreement.\n3.4 STANDARD RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND\n          CONSTRUCTIONAL PREFERENCES\n   Grants and reservations of mineral interests are frequently unclear. The\nlanguage used to describe the interest may be equally consistent with a\nroyalty and a mineral fee. The instrument may be silent on what substances\nare included in the term \"minerals.\" The size of the interest created may be\nthe subject of dispute. In resolving such issues, the parties' intent is\ndetermined, if possible, by considering the instrument as a whole. ''The\nprimary duty of the courts in interpreting a deed is to ascertain the intent of\nthe parties.

In Lesley v. ~terans Land Bd.,7 o.z the court rejected an argument\nthat a subdivision developer bad impliedly retained the exclusive executive\nright by making the deeds to the lots in the subdivision subject to a recorded\ncovenant prohibiting oil and gas development and bad thus stripped the\ngrantees of the right to execute oil and gas leases. Interests such as royalty\nand executive right that are appurtenant to the granted estate will pass to the\ngrantee even though they are not specifically mentioned in the deed. 70.3 The\ngeneral rule against implying grounds for forfeiture71 is a logical extension\nof this doctrine.\n   Of course the doctrine that all incidents of a mineral estate are transferred\n\n  89\n        Bruce M.

For example, an instrument\nassigning a grantor's lien on the surface estate will not operate to transfer the\ngrantor's interest in a severed mineral estate in the same land, even though\nthe granting clause states that it conveys \"all liens and titles held by me in\nand to said land. \" 72 Similarly, interests such as nonparticipating royalties\nthat are appurtenant to other lands are not impliedly included in a\nconveyance, even though such lands were once part of a larger, single tract\nand the grantor received the interests when the larger tract was parti·\ntioned. 72.1 The oil and gas lease is an important exception to the rule\nfavoring the grantee in deed construction, for it is usually construed against\nthe lessee and in favor of the lessor-grantor. 73 A related doctrine which\nusually (although not always) results in a deed interpretation favorable to the\ngrantee is the rule that the granting clause prevails in the event of an\nirreconcilable conflict with other deed clauses. The importance of this\ndoctrine as applied to mineral deeds has diminished, however, as a result of\nthe Texas Supreme Court's decision in Luckel v. White. 74 The Luckel opinion\noverruled an earlier case, Alford v. Krum, 75 which involved a deed that\ngranted \"one-half of the one-eighth interest\" in the mineral estate, covered\nand included \"l/16th of all royalties due\" under an existing lease, and\nprovided that under future oil and gas leases \"the lease interests and all\nfuture rentals . . . shall be owned jointly by [the grantor and grantee] each\nowning a one-half interest.\" The Alford court held that the granting clause\nshould prevail because it was in irreconcilable conflict with the future-leases\nclause.

Although the\ndoctrine has occasionally been invoked to prevent a grantee from disavow-\ning recitals or reservations in a deed be bas accepted, 79.1 it is used far more\ncommonly when a grantor attempts to assert a reservation in derogation of\nthe grant.. The cases that have arisen in this context are dealt with in a\nseparate section of the treatise.792\n  Rules of grammar may also be used to aid in deed construction.79.3\nWhether a deed is ambiguous is a question of law, determined by an\nexamination of the entire document. 7u If it is impossible to resolve an\nambiguity through the use of rules of grammar or construction, extrinsic\n\n  77\n     McMahon v.

Traditional Language\n   The language used in a grant or reservation determines whether a mineral\nfee or a royalty bas been created The traditional language used to create a\nmineral fee is a reference to the oil, gas, and other minerals in, on, and under\nthe described land.11 Specific rights of ingress and egress and surface and\nsubsurface easements are also commonly included.82 Although most of these\nrights would be implied in favor of the mineral fee owner in any event,\nsetting them out specifically may accomplish three things. First, it makes\nmuch clearer the intent to create a mineral fee with its concomitant rights to\nexplore, drill, and produce. Second, it reduces the possibility of disputes\nwith the surface owner over the rights held by the mineral fee owner. The\nsurface owner is more likely to be convinced by written language than by an\nargument based on implied rights. Third, it gives the draftsman an\nopportunity to list specific rights which might not be implied in the mineral\nowner's favor or which are broader than implied rights.\n   A royalty is typically created simply by using the word ''royalty.\" Thus a\nlandowner may grant \"a 1116tb royalty\" or a right to \"1114tb of royalty,\" and\nin either event it is clear that the grantee will receive a fraction of gross\nproduction.u The same result can be accomplished by using the form of\nlanguage in Barker v. Levy, 14 where a deed granting a \"one/one hundred and\nsixtieth (l/160tb) part of all oil, petroleum, sulphur and all other minerals\nthat may be produced and saved\" was held to have unambiguously\ntransferred a royalty rather than an undivided interest in the mineral fee.\n   B.

LAW OF OIL & GAS (2d ed. 2014)\n  volume 1 § 2.4[B][1] ............................................................................................9\n  volume 1 § 2.49[A] ...............................................................................................8\n\n\n\n\n                                                          6\n\f                                   Introduction\n\n      The Quinn siblings originally shared an undivided interest in the mineral\n\nestate of the Rose Teal Quinn Ranch. When they later partitioned the mineral\n\nestate, they expressly pooled their royalty interests. Sam Quinn then conveyed his\n\nestate to House, together with all rights and appurtenances. Sam’s pooled royalty\n\ninterest in the entire ranch necessarily passed to House. At this point, Sam had\n\nnothing left to give — as such, his subsequent deed to Hoskins conveyed nothing.\n\n      Hoskins argues that, by cross-conveyance, the Quinns did not pool their\n\nroyalty interests but instead splintered their interests into distinct parts for each\n\nsibling’s tract that could not be appurtenant to the tract committed to the pool\n\n(despite admitting that each tract is burdened by all of the other siblings’ royalty\n\ninterests). Hoskins’ argument ignores not only the Quinns’ express intent to pool,\n\nbut also the plain terms of their agreement to cross-convey only as “necessary to\n\neffectuate the pooling.” Hoskins overlooks the fundamental nature of pooling as a\n\nform of joint ownership involving both contract and real property law.\n\n      As Hoskins concedes, Sam’s tract was burdened by the pooled royalty\n\ninterest, making that interest an appurtenance as a matter of law. Respected cases\n\nand commentators agree that pooled royalty interests are both rights and\n\nappurtenances. Because Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House and not to\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fHoskins, the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and judgment rendered in\n\nfavor of House and Aery.\n\n                                    Argument\n\n      Appellees filed eight briefs, which generally join the arguments of Clifton\n\nHoskins. For the sake of brevity, the appellees are addressed collectively as\n\n“Hoskins” unless noted otherwise. This term explicitly includes the oil and gas\n\nproducers, whose summary judgments are entirely derivative of the motion granted\n\nin favor of Clifton. See Appellants’ Brief at 25; CR5:1631-32.\n\nI.    Hoskins confuses semantics with substance by labeling the Quinns’\n      pooled royalty interest as “NPIR/NPRI.”\n\n      Clifton Hoskins insists on using the novel term “non-participating interest in\n\nroyalty” (NPIR) to describe the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest in the entire Rose\n\nTeal Quinn Ranch. See, e.g., Clifton’s Brief at vii. Other appellees use the\n\ntraditional term “non-participating royalty interest” (NPRI). See, e.g., Jane’s Brief\n\nat 4 n.1. Either term is a red herring. See ERNEST E. SMITH & JACQUELINE LANG\n\nWEAVER, 1 TEX. LAW OF OIL & GAS § 2.49[A] (2d ed. 2014) (defining “royalty” as\n\na “chameleon-hued” term).\n\n      The dispute here is not whether the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest is non-\n\nparticipatory in the costs of production. Instead, the dispute is whether the Quinns\n\ncreated a pooled royalty interest that, by contract and property law, was conveyed\n\nto House.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      While Hoskins contends that the sole issue in this appeal is the construction\n\nof the deed from Sam to House, he ultimately recognizes that the scope of Sam’s\n\nownership interest depends on his prior agreement with his siblings — an\n\nagreement to, in their own words, “pool their interests in the royalties from the\n\nproduction of oil, gas and any other mineral, produced and saved from any part of\n\nthe 2,471.8 acres of land, more or less, known as the Rose Teal Quinn Ranch.”\n\nClifton’s Brief at viii, 17; CR2:416. Hoskins’ label (either NPIR or NPRI)\n\ncompletely ignores any concept of pooling. See, e.g., Clifton’s Brief at 3-4.\n\n      Additionally, Hoskins’ label does not affect the law governing the Quinns’\n\npooled royalty interest, despite Hoskins’ suggestion to the contrary. Compare\n\nBlake’s Brief at 3-4 (arguing that cases involving lease royalty interests cannot be\n\napplied to cases involving NPRIs) with SMITH, 1 TEX. LAW            OF   OIL & GAS\n\n§ 2.4[B][1] (“In analyzing rights of royalty owners, Texas courts have tended to\n\nignore distinctions between types of royalties”) & Merrill Eng’g Co. v.

Pooling is subject to both property and contract law.\n\n       Not only does Hoskins attempt to use irrelevant labels to divert the Court’s\n\nattention from the key documents, Hoskins also attempts to draw a sharp\n\ndistinction between contract and real property law. See, e.g., Clifton’s Brief at 15,\n\n30. Texas, however, applies both contract and property law in the oil and gas\n\ncontext.\n\n       For example:\n\n       •     Pooling is a real property interest. MCEN 1996 P’ship v.

Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House as a contract right.\n\n       Significantly, Hoskins agrees that if pooled royalty interests are contractual,\n\nthen they pass whether explicitly described in a deed or not. Clifton’s Brief at 26\n\n(conceding that “contract-theory jurisdictions treat pooled interests as appurtenant”\n\nbut arguing that Texas does not recognize pooling as contractual); Aurora’s Brief\n\nat 5 (conceding the Quinns’ pooling agreement is contractual). In an attempt to\n\navoid this concession, Hoskins claims that House and Aery waived any reliance on\n\ncontract. Clifton’s Brief at 26.\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      House and Aery have consistently applied both contract and property law.\n\nSee, e.g., Appellants’ Brief 27 (noting that review should be de novo under\n\nproperty and contract law); id. at 28 (citing multiple cases for property and contract\n\nprinciples); id. at 28 (quoting Professor Bruce Kramer, Hoskins’ expert in the trial\n\ncourt, for the proposition that pooling agreements are contracts that grow out of\n\nproperty law); id. at 29 (explaining that Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to\n\nHouse under “contract and property law”); id. at 35 (highlighting Sam’s transfer of\n\nall rights to House); CR2:394-96 (describing the express contract language in the\n\nQuinns’ pooling agreement).\n\n      Likewise, House and Aery have consistently relied on Wagner & Brown,\n\nLtd. v. Sheppard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895065\"><a href=\"/opinion/895065/wagner-brown-ltd-v-sheppard/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (Tex. 2008) — a case not mentioned or\n\nacknowledged by Hoskins — for the rule that pooling is contractual. Compare\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 28 & CR2:395 with Clifton’s Brief at v.\n\n      In this case, the pooling agreement signed by all of the Quinns was a valid\n\ncontract that gave Sam rights in the pooled royalty interest in the entire Rose Teal\n\nQuinn Ranch. CR2:408-19; Wagner, 282 S.W.3d at 424. There can be no doubt\n\nthat Sam, in his deed to House, explicitly transferred his contract right to House.\n\nCR2:432 (transferring to House “all and singular the rights … in anywise\n\nbelonging”); Coolbaugh v. Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615 (Pa.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f1907) (illustrating that a deed’s reference to rights passes pooled contractual\n\nrights). The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\nIV.   Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House pursuant to the greatest\n      estate rule.\n\n      Falling back on real property law, Hoskins insists that Sam’s pooled royalty\n\ninterest must be particularly described in a deed before it can be conveyed.\n\nClifton’s Brief at 10-11 (citing Gage v. Owen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2404480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2404480/gage-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (Tex.

Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House as an appurtenance.\n\n      Hoskins denies that a pooled royalty interest is an “appurtenance,” but\n\nHoskins is wrong. See Clifton’s Brief at 17. The Quinns’ pooled royalty interest in\n\nthe entire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch is directly appurtenant to Sam’s own land.\n\n      A.    Hoskins’ cross-conveyance theory is not dispositive.\n\n      Hoskins argues that the Quinns’ pooling agreement, as a cross-conveyance,\n\n“resolves this case.” Id. at 17 & n.8 (citing NANCY SAINT-PAUL, 4 SUMMERS OIL &\n\nGAS § 54.3 (3d ed. 2014)). Ironically, after criticizing House and Aery for relying\n\non secondary sources, Hoskins does the same. Compare id. at 28. Hoskins’\n\nreliance on SUMMERS, however, is inconsistent with Texas law.\n\n      According to Hoskins’ reading of SUMMERS, a contract state characterizes\n\npooling as a contract right, while a cross-conveyance state characterizes pooling as\n\na property interest that is not appurtenant to any unit committed to the pool.\n\nClifton’s Brief at 17 (citing SAINT-PAUL, 4 SUMMERS OIL & GAS § 54.3). While\n\nSUMMERS is actually addressing a community lease, a community lease is a type of\n\nvoluntary pooling agreement where a single oil and gas lease covers two or more\n\ntracts executed by the separate owners as if they were joint owners. BRUCE M.\n\nKRAMER & PATRICK H. MARTIN, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS OIL & GAS LAW § 904\n\n(2014).\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f      Hoskins then characterizes Texas as a cross-conveyance state. Clifton’s\n\nBrief at 17. Whether Texas is a cross-conveyance state is a nonstarter, in part\n\nbecause Texas does not sharply distinguish contract and property law in the oil and\n\ngas context. As Professor Kramer further explains, the adoption or rejection of the\n\ncross-conveyance theory has no effect on whether the interest in a pooled unit is\n\nappurtenant (passes with the land) or in gross (does not pass with the land).\n\nKRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6).\n\n      For example, both California and Mississippi are cross-conveyance states,\n\nbut Mississippi considers a pooled royalty interest to be appurtenant, while\n\nCalifornia does not. Id. § 930.1, § 930.4; Merrill, 5 So. 2d at 672 (holding that “in\n\nthe absence of a reservation to the contrary[,] a subsequent grantee of any part of\n\nthe pooled area would be entitled to the benefits”); Tanner v. Title Ins. & Trust\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386 (Cal. 1942) (holding that the pooled royalty interest is “an\n\nincorporeal    hereditament   in   gross”).   Thus,   SUMMERS’ position        is   an\n\noversimplification, and Hoskins’ reliance on it is misplaced.\n\n      B.      The Quinns’ express intent is dispositive.\n\n      Consistent with Texas principles of contract and deed construction, Kramer\n\nconcentrates on the “intent of the parties, not whether pooling or unitization effects\n\ncross-conveyances.” KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6); see also\n\nWagner, 282 S.W.3d at 424 (construing a Texas pooling agreement based on the\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fintent reflected in the agreement). Even Tanner, the leading “in gross” case cited\n\nabove from California, is consistent with this basic tenant of document\n\nconstruction. Tanner, 129 P.2d at 389 (concurring that the intention of the parties\n\nas expressed in their agreement controls).\n\n      Kramer further notes that if the parties did not adequately manifest their\n\nintent, “the courts should usually take the position that the grantor’s interest in unit\n\nproduction is included in a conveyance of the premises he has committed to the\n\nunit.” KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6). “In other words, the interest of\n\na party in unit production should ordinarily be viewed as appurtenant to his interest\n\nin premises committed to the unit rather than ‘in gross.’ ” Id.\n\n      Here, although it leads to the same result in favor of House and Aery, the\n\nCourt need not resort to Kramer’s default position because the Quinns fully\n\nmanifested their intent. The Quinn siblings pooled all of their royalty interests.\n\nCR2:416 (expressing the Quinns’ “desire to and do hereby pool their interests in\n\nthe royalties from the production of oil, gas and any other mineral, produced and\n\nsaved from any part of the 2,471.8 acres of land, more or less, known as the Rose\n\nTeal Quinn Ranch”).\n\n      Furthermore, the Quinns evidenced their intent to cross-convey only to the\n\nextent “necessary to effectuate” their pooling agreement. CR1:231; see also\n\nKRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 919.2 (pooling language may negate any\n\n\n                                          15\n\fundesirable consequences of cross-conveyance by agreement of the parties). If the\n\nQuinns had intended to create the separate and distinct royalty interests in each\n\nsibling’s tract that Hoskins advocates, then they would have used a simple\n\nconveyance to reach that result without implicating pooling at all.\n\n      In their pooling agreement, the Quinns bound their heirs and assigns, further\n\nevidencing their intent to pass their pooled royalty interest with the tracts\n\ncommitted to the pool. CR2:409. This intent is further underscored by the\n\nrecitations regarding the siblings’ prior undivided interests in the mineral estate of\n\nthe entire ranch and by the inclusion of their mother as a party to the agreement\n\nand holder of a life estate in the ranch’s mineral estate. CR2:408, 418-49.\n\n      Later, when Sam conveyed his rights and appurtenances to House, he\n\nevidenced his intent to convey his pooled royalty interest in the entire ranch.\n\nCR2:432. Not only did Sam mention all “rights and appurtenances,” but he also\n\ndescribed the entire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch by name and cross-reference to other\n\nfiled documents. CR2:431-32. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nin favor of Hoskins rather than House and Aery.\n\n      C.     Precedent from this Court and the Supreme Court controls.\n\n      Hoskins contends that Sam’s pooled royalty interest cannot be an\n\nappurtenance because is not necessary to the enjoyment of Sam’s tract, but\n\nHoskins’ contention focuses only on Sam’s surface tract. Clifton’s Brief at 19.\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fThat narrow focus is misplaced and is inconsistent with Hoskins’ admission that\n\nSam’s tract was “burdened” with an obligation to share royalties. Id. at 25 (row\n\nthree of Hoskins’ chart).\n\n      “A burden that obligates the owner or occupier of a particular unit or parcel\n\nin that person’s capacity as owner or occupier is an appurtenant burden.” Killam\n\nRanch Properties, Ltd. v.

See Cox, 143 S.W.2d at 364.

Because Sam’s royalty interest in the pool was appurtenant\n\nto the tract he committed to the pool, that pooled royalty interest passed to House.\n\n      D.     Commentators agree pooled royalty interests are appurtenances.\n\n      For Professor Kramer, the pooled royalty interest “should ordinarily be\n\nviewed as appurtenant to [the] interest in premises committed to the unit rather\n\nthan ‘in gross.’ ” KRAMER, 6 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 929.1(6); see also\n\n3 WILLIAMS & MEYERS § 660. Under Kramer’s analysis, even if the Quinn siblings\n\nowned fractional royalty interests in each other’s tracts as Hoskins claims (when\n\nthey did not), those interests would still be appurtenant to the tract committed to\n\nthe unit.

Avery and McCall are not binding on this Court.\n\n      In rejecting pooled royalty interests as appurtenances, Hoskins relies heavily\n\non McCall and the West Virginia case it cites.

McCall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1666179\"><a href=\"/opinion/1666179/mccall-v-mccall/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

Regardless, as\n\nHoskins admits, Avery does not explicitly discuss appurtenances (nor does it even\n\ndiscuss contractual rights); it simply draws a conclusion without relating enough\n\nfacts to make a comparison here. See Clifton’s Brief at 21.\n\n      As for McCall, the “facts as stated in the court’s opinion are not entirely\n\nclear.” See Edwin P. Horner, McCall v. McCall Discussion Notes, 145 OIL & GAS\n\nREP. 415, 419 (2001). Nonetheless, there was no pooling of the royalty interest\n\nconcurrent with the partition of the remaining mineral estate. For that simple\n\nreason, McCall has no bearing on the Quinns’ pooling agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f      Moreover, Professor Horner criticized McCall for reaching the wrong result.\n\nFirst, the opinion defined the term “appurtenance” too narrowly in the royalty\n\ncontext. Horner, 145 OIL & GAS REP. at 420.\n\n      Second, the opinion disregarded Harris v. Currie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3901702\"><a href=\"/opinion/4138847/harris-v-currie/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\n1943), and Day & Co., Inc. v.

Horner, 145 OIL & GAS REP. at 418-19. According to\n\nProfessor Horner, “where the owner of a tract included in a pooled unit sells his\n\ntract, then his conveyance also includes his interest in the production from the\n\npooled unit, which production may come from another tract in the unit.” Id. at 418-\n\n19.\n\n      While Hoskins discounts Professor Horner and the other Texas\n\ncommentators, their observations offer valuable insight into Texas law. Regardless,\n\nHoskins himself proves why McCall has no precedential value here. When\n\ndiscussing McCall, Hoskins concedes that Sam’s tract was “burdened by a royalty\n\ninterest in favor of the owners of the other tracts.” See Clifton’s Brief at 25\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      McCall rejects burdens as appurtenances, which conflicts with this Court’s\n\nrecognition of burdens as appurtenances. Killam Ranch, 376 S.W.3d at 156 n.4.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\fMoreover, McCall is narrowly focused on appurtenances and fails to address the\n\ncontractual rights reflected in the Quinns’ pooling agreement.\n\nVI.   Recitations in the House and Aery chain of title have no effect.\n\n      In his factual statement, Hoskins mentions the “subject to” language in the\n\nHouse and Aery chain of title. Clifton’s Brief at 6-8. This language acknowledges\n\nthe recording of Sam’s deed to L.R. Hoskins (dated after Sam’s deed to House),\n\nbut the reference does not acknowledge the validity of the second deed. See Teal\n\nTrading & Dev., LP v. Champee Springs Ranches Prop. Owners Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2014, pet. denied). In light of this\n\nauthority, Hoskins makes no argument based on his factual recitation.\n\nVII. Hoskins’ position is not logical.\n\n      Although Hoskins insists his position is logical, it is not. See Clifton’s Brief\n\nat 15, 17. In Texas, if a landowner enters an ordinary oil and gas lease and\n\nsubsequently conveys the land by warranty deed without reserving any mineral\n\ninterests, then the grantee takes the land and any royalty due under the lease. Bibb\n\nv.

Civ. App.—Waco 1928, writ ref’d). The same\n\nresult must occur if the land is subject to a pooled lease — all the more so in this\n\ncase, where the grantors expressly pooled their royalty interests by agreement\n\nbefore entering any oil and gas leases.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n         This case illustrates the blending of contract and property law. The Quinns\n\nagreed to partition their jointly owned mineral estate, but for their royalty interests,\n\nwhich they expressly agreed to pool in perpetuity. Whether Hoskins characterizes\n\nthe Quinns’ pooled royalty interest as an NPIR or NPRI or a cross-conveyance is\n\nirrelevant. Nor does it really matter whether the pooled royalty interest can be\n\nspatially divided as Hoskins wrongly asserts.\n\n         The bottom line is that the Quinns’ pooled royalty interest was both a\n\ncontractual right and interest in real property. The pooled royalty interest in the\n\nentire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch also necessarily (and admittedly) burdened all of the\n\ntracts committed to the pool and affected their value. As a result, the pooled\n\nroyalty interest in the entire Rose Teal Quinn Ranch was appurtenant to Sam’s\n\ntract.\n\n         When Sam transferred and conveyed the “described premises, together with\n\nall and singular the rights and appurtenances thereto in anywise belonging” to\n\nHouse, Sam’s pooled royalty interest passed to House (and subsequently to Aery).\n\nThe trial court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\n         As outlined in more detail in the prayer of their opening brief, Aery and\n\nHouse ask the Court to reverse the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of\n\nClifton Hoskins, as well as the other summary judgments and final judgment upon\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fwhich it is based.

Thus,\neach owner may retain an undivided royalty interest in tracts allocated to other cotenants while taking ownership of all other\nincidents of mineral ownership, including the power of leasing his own partitioned tract. A subsequent conveyance by the\nowner of such a partitioned tract will carry with it all mineral rights in that tract, subject to the outstanding royalty interests, but\nit will not convey any of the grantor’s royalty interest in the other tracts.13\n\nWhere two cotenants own the surface estate and a third cotenant owns an interest in the minerals, a partition deed by the two\nsurface owners partitioning the land on the basis of the surface ownership will be construed to partition the\n\n1See generally, American Law of Property (1952), §§ 6.19, 6.20; Powell, The Law of Real Property (1954), P610; Tiffany, The Law of Real\nProperty (3rd ed. 1939), §§ 468–472.\n2   See § 5.5.\n3   Griffin v.

This result and the underlying reasons are clearly described in the following concise statement by Justice Smith:\n\n        “This case is controlled by our decision in Hutchinson v. Sheppard, supra. There we held that where the parties to a\n        partition deed owned two estates in the land, one in common and in the same ratio as the division and the other not\n        in common and therefore not in that ratio, the deed should be construed as a conveyance only of the estate held in\n        common. And that conclusion was reached even though the deed purported to convey all the grantor’s ‘right, title,\n        interest and claim’ in and to the land. The governing rule is obviously both sensible and just, for it prevents either\n        party from gaining an advantage at the other’s expense.”14\n\nWhether or not the voluntary partition was intended to partition the mineral as well as the surface interest raises a problem of\nconstruction of the partition deeds. In the case of deeds not involving a partition, it is uniformly held that upon a conveyance of\nland, the ownership of or the rights to oil and gas pass to the grantee unless they are expressly reserved or excepted.15 Partition\ndeeds are not subject to all of the formalities required of other conveyances, but the usual rules of construction apply, and it\nmay be found that it was intended to partition the minerals as well as the surface, although the minerals are not specially\nmentioned.16 Partition deeds which cover both mineral and surface interests by mistake can, because of the mutual mistake, be\nreformed to cover only the surface and not the mineral interest.17\n\nIf an oil and gas lease is outstanding on the entire tract owned by the cotenants at the time of the voluntary partition of the\nsurface and mineral estates, it is not necessary that the oil and gas lessee be a party to the partition,18 but such partition can not\nimpair the rights of the lessee who is entitled to develop the entire tract as a unit and not as separate tracts.19\n\nA voluntary partition may be rescinded for mutual mistake, but it cannot be rescinded for a unilateral mistake unless the other\nparty knew of the mistake or induced it.

He is entitled to all of the royalty payments for production from his portion of the partitioned\ntract and is not entitled to a share of royalties for oil or gas produced elsewhere on the larger tract under the lease.20 Under the\nrule applied in a minority of the jurisdictions having decisions on the point, royalties and payments under the lease would be\napportioned, that is, royalties payable for oil or gas produced at any point on the larger tract would be divided among the\nvarious owners of the tracts into which it was partitioned. This result has been explained on the basis that oil and gas are\nfugitive in nature and that production must be apportioned among the partitioned owners because it is being drained from the\nentire tract.21 In Kentucky, if nothing is said about the outstanding lease and royalties payable thereunder, the rule of\napportionment applies on the theory that the royalties and other payments under a lease are not only payment for oil extracted\nbut also serve as rentals by which the entire tract is held under the terms of the lease.22 Such cotenants may, however, partition\nthe minerals and rights under the lease so as to prevent such apportionment.23\n\nThe effect of a partition of land that is subject to an oil and gas lease may depend upon the provisions of the oil and gas lease.\nThus, in Texas, where the nonapportionment rule is followed and it is held that royalty payable under an outstanding lease will\nnot be apportioned after a partition of the mineral rights of the lessors, a federal court has concluded that a different result\nshould be reached if the outstanding lease is a community lease. In reaching the conclusion that royalty payable under the\ncommunity lease should continue to be apportioned after a voluntary partition of the mineral rights by the lessors, the court\nmade a careful analysis of Japhet (applying the nonapportionment doctrine) and Parker (applying apportionment under the\ncommunity lease concept), and made the following perceptive comment:\n\n        “As we pointed out previously, Japhet and Parker have been distinguished on two grounds. First, a purchaser of a\n        subdivided section of land under a lease is deemed to have purchased with ‘his eyes wide open to the rights of the\n        various parties.’ Second, a single lessor is different from joint lessors because he cannot form a community with\n        himself. Strict adherence to the second distinction perhaps even compels continuance of the apportionment\n        presumption in a partition after unitization. Before the partition the parties have formed the community which was\n        lacking in Japhet. The first distinction requires that no presumption be placed either for or against apportionment.\n        With their eyes wide open, the parties joined a community and allowed one lessee to treat the lands as a unit. Their\n        act of cooperation was based on a profit incentive, and each expected to reap benefits. Can it be said that each\n        party to the partition then abandoned his assurance of royalties in favor of a gamble that the lessee would drill on\n        his contributed land? At least no presumption to that effect can be defended when the instruments do not so\n        provide. There can be a defiance of community by partition where the transaction is capable of being construed as\n        an act of liberation; however, either the words or the incidence of the transaction must demonstrate some\n        disavowal of former relationships.”24\n\n20   Texas.

One such facet involves the\nrespective rights of the lessor and the grantee as between themselves. The other fact involves the respective rights of the lessor\nand grantee as against the lessee. An analysis of both facets of the problem is aided by a consideration of certain fundamentals.\n\nThe right to receive royalties under an oil and gas lease is one of the separately alienable incidents of ownership of the\nminerals.1 Although such right is capable of being alienated separately, the right to receive royalties will pass with a\nconveyance of the minerals, unless such right is expressly reserved or excepted.2 Further, although the right to receive royalty\nbears some resemblance to the right to receive rent and there have been instances where the law relating to rent has controlled\nthe results reached with respect to the right to receive royalty,3 there is an important difference which must be recognized.\nOrdinarily, rent is not apportionable as to time and does not accrue from day to day but is payable to the owner of the reversion\non the date that the rent becomes payable. Oil and gas royalties, on the other hand, ordinarily accrue from day to day and are\nregarded as being apportionable as to time even though provision may be made in the lease for an accounting period.\n\nIn the instance of the royalty which is payable as the result of oil production, the oil and gas lease commonly provides that the\nlessee shall deliver, to the lessor or to the lessor’s credit in a pipeline, a portion of the oil produced and saved.4 In the instance\nof the royalty which is payable as the result of gas production, the lease commonly provides that the lessee shall pay to the\nlessor an amount to be determined either by the value of gas produced or by the proceeds of the sale of such gas.5 In both such\ninstances, the payment of royalty is not made on the basis of the passage of time. The payment is made to compensate the\nlessor for the lessor’s share of a substance that has been removed, and except in the rare instance where a fixed periodic gas\nrental might be used,6 the amount of the royalty bears no relation to the passage of time. Provision is occasionally made for the\nlessee to make payments or to account periodically, but such a provision does not change the nature of the payment. Such a\nprovision is obviously designed to solve a mechanical problem incident to payment and is not designed to alter substantive\nrights.\n\nAccordingly, although the analysis suggested above has not necessarily been applied in the cases as a basis for decision, it has\nbeen uniformly held or assumed in connection with a related holding that, if after an oil and gas lease has been granted, the\nlessor should convey the minerals without exception or reservation or should otherwise make a complete disposition of the\nright to receive royalty payments, such lessor is entitled to receive those royalty payments which have accrued to the date of\nthe conveyance.7 With very rare exception,8 it has likewise been held or assumed that the right to receive royalty passes with a\ndevise or conveyance or inheritance of the mineral interest\n\n1   See § 15.1.\n2   See § 14.1.\n3See, e.g., Handlan v.

Gormley, 184 Pa 354, 39 Atl 57 (1898), in which the court regarded the right to receive royalty\nunder an oil and gas lease as a personal right of the lessor which did not pass with a devise of the land upon the death of the lessor.\n\f                                                  3-42 Kuntz, Law of Oil and Gas § 42.6\n\n\nand that royalty which accrues after the date of passage of title properly belongs to the grantee, devisee, or heir of the lessor, as\nbeing incident to the interest which was acquired by virtue of the conveyance, devise, or inheritance.9\n\nThe problem of determining which parties are entitled to receive royalty after the lessor has made a conveyance has a different\nappearance when considered from the standpoint of the lessee. From the standpoint of the lessee, the problem is one of\ndetermining what is required to discharge a liability. The lessee must pay the royalty to the party entitled to receive it, and a\npayment to the wrong party is no defense in an action by the party who is entitled to receive the royalty.10 Consequently, it is\nof considerable importance to the lessee to be able to establish the effective date of a change in the parties entitled to receive\nroyalty.\n\nAlthough the effective date of the passage of title will control the right to receive royalty as between the lessor and the person\nto whom the mineral interest was conveyed, such date may or may not be the controlling date for purposes of determining the\nlessee’s liability. Such date may be controlled by statutory provisions for notice. More likely, such date will be controlled by\nthe presence of a provision in the oil and gas lease which provides that no change of ownership of the lessor’s interest is\nbinding on the lessee until a prescribed form of notice is given to such lessee.11\n\nAccording to the operation of the change of ownership clause, the lessee is not required to recognize any change in ownership\nof the lessor’s right to receive royalty until after receipt of the notice prescribed by such clause. Accordingly, until there is\ncompliance with such charge of ownership clause, the lessee may discharge the liability to pay royalty by making payment in\naccordance with the status of title prior to any such change.12\n\n           [b] Conveyance of undivided interest by lessor.\n\nSimilar to the situation where the lessor conveys the entire interest after having granted an oil and gas lease,13 if the lessor\nconveys an undivided interest in the minerals after having granted an oil and gas lease, the resulting problem has two facets.\nOne facet involves the respective rights of the lessor and the grantee toward one another. The other facet involves the\nrespective rights of the lessor and the grantee as against the lessee.\n\nWith respect to the first facet of the problem, the principles which are applicable to a conveyance by the lessor of the entire\ninterest may be applied with equal validity to the situation where the lessor conveys an undivided interest after having granted\nan oil and gas lease. With respect to the undivided interest conveyed, the grantor is entitled to all royalties attributable to such\ninterest which have accrued up to the date of passage of title, and the grantee is entitled to all royalties attributable to such\ninterest which are payable as the result of production on and after such date. The parties are cotenants after title has passed to\nan undivided interest in the minerals, and the remedies incident to such cotenancy are available to each cotenant if the other\ncotenant has received and retained more than a proper share of the royalty payable under the lease.14 A cotenant is not,\nhowever, limited to such remedies against another cotenant but is entitled to proceed directly against the lessee.\n\n9 See Osborn v.

The special problem which is\nintroduced when an undivided interest is conveyed is the problem of whether the lessee is required to pay each cotenant\nseparately, is entitled to pay them jointly, or is entitled to discharge the liability by paying the entire amount to one of them as\njoint obligee.\n\nIn a very early case, the right to receive royalty was treated as the right to receive rent, and it was recognized that if a single\nlessor should grant an oil and gas lease and subsequently convey an undivided interest, an apportionment is necessary. It was\nheld, however, that if cotenants grant a single lease they become joint obligees and if one of the cotenants conveys an interest,\nthere is no apportionment and the lessee may pay the entire royalty to any one of the lessor’s as a joint obligee, either before or\nafter the conveyance.16 Under the principles applied in such case, if a sole lessor conveyed an undivided interest in the\nminerals after having granted an oil and gas lease, each cotenant lessor would be entitled to a share of royalty, and a payment\nby the lessee to one of them as a joint obligee or to their joint account as joint obligees would not discharge the lessee’s\nobligation. If, however, the oil and gas lease were granted by joint lessors, then they would be joint obligees, and a payment of\nroyalty to any one of the lessors or to all lessors jointly would satisfy the lessee’s obligation. Further, a conveyance by any one\nof such joint obligees would not change the lessee’s right to discharge the liability to the lessors as joint obligees.\n\nEven though the principles just described would otherwise apply, it must be assumed that the modern oil and gas lease, with its\nprovisions for assignments and notice of change of ownership, and the common practices used in the delivery and sale of\nroyalty oil17 and royalty gas18 demonstrate an intention that each owner of an undivided interest in the minerals is entitled to\nthe receipt of such owner’s share of the royalty, even though the lease was originally granted by joint lessors. If, after an oil\nand gas lease has been granted, the lessor or one of the lessors should convey an undivided interest in the minerals or otherwise\ndisposes of the right to receive a part of the royalties payable under such lease, the lessee is required to make future royalty\npayments in the correct proportions to the new owners, after having received proper notice of such change in ownership.19\n\n         [c] Conveyance of interest in subdivided part of leased premises by lessor.20\n\nIf, after having granted an oil and gas lease, the lessor should convey an interest in a subdivided part of the leased premises, a\nquestion may arise with respect to the rights of such grantee to share in production realized under such lease. Specifically, the\nquestion which may arise is whether the grantee of such subdivided interest should share proportionately in the royalty on all\nproduction under the lease regardless of the locations of the wells or whether such grantee is entitled to participate only in the\nroyalty on production which is realized from wells drilled on the subdivided part in which an interest is owned. Stated as\ngeneral matter, the problem is whether or not royalties are apportioned among the owners of mineral interests in subdivided\nparts of the leased premises if the subdivision occurred after the lease was granted. If, for example, the owner of an eighty-acre\ntract of land should grant an oil and gas lease and then convey to another the entire interest in a forty-acre portion of the leased\npremises, will such grantee be entitled to one-half of the royalty on production from any well on the eighty acres, or will such\ngrantee\n\n15   See § 42.6(a).\n16   Swint v.

Such an intention may be found expressed in a provision in the lease or in a\nprovision of the deed or other instrument by which the subdivision was accomplished. A division order may serve as a\nmemorandum of a prior oral agreement for apportioning royalty and render such agreement enforceable.33\n\nThe provision which is deliberately placed in an oil and gas lease to overcome the non-apportionment rule and to provide for\nan apportionment of royalty in the event of a subdivision of the lessor’s interest is the entirety clause. The effect of such clause\nis discussed elsewhere herein.34 A provision which is not placed deliberately in the lease to overcome the non-apportionment\nrule but which might have such effect is the lesser interest clause. The effect of such clause is also discussed elsewhere\nherein.35\n\nIn the instance where the intention to apportion royalties is found in the deed or other instrument by which the subdivision is\naccomplished, the grantor may convey the mineral interest in a specified tract and also convey a royalty interest in the entire\nleased premises. Thus, if an owner of an eighty-acre tract of land grants an oil and gas lease and then subsequently conveys a\none-half interest in a forty-acre tract but also provides that the interest is subject to a described outstanding lease and further\nstates that the grantee is to be entitled to receive one-half of the royalty payable under such lease, the grantee of such deed will\nreceive a conveyance of a one-half mineral interest in forty acres subject to a lease covering eighty acres and also a royalty\ninterest in the entire eighty acres for the duration of such lease. The following quoted provision was construed to have such an\neffect:\n\n“It is understood and agreed that this sale is made subject to said lease, but covers and includes one-half of all the oil royalty\nand gas rental or royalty due to be paid under the terms of said lease …”36\n\nA similar provision appeared in the deed which was involved in another reported case, but the point was not discussed.37\n\nA mere mention of the outstanding oil and gas lease should not be sufficient to have the effect of a conveyance of a royalty\ninterest in the entire leased premises.

Thus, the language which is quoted\nbelow and which was contained in a deed was held not to require an apportionment of royalties under the outstanding lease\nmentioned.\n\n“It is expressly understood and agreed that there is an oil, gas and mineral lease now in effect covering the above described\ntract together with other acreage, and the Grantors hereby convey and assign unto Grantees all their right, title and interest as\nLessors under said lease so far as it applied to the above described tract of land, save and except the one-sixteenth (1/16th)\nroyalty interest hereinabove provided … to have and to hold the above described premises together with all and singular the\nrights and appurtenances thereto in anywise belonging subject, however, to the royalty reservation hereinabove provided.”38\n\nSpecifically, the court held that the use of the term “appurtenances” in the habendum clause of the deed did not reveal an\nintention to convey a royalty interest in the entire tract covered by the lease. Similarly, it has been observed that such an\nintention may or may not be expressed in the following language:\n\n“This sale is made subject to the above mentioned oil and gas lease and to the above mentioned royalty deed but covers and\nincludes the above described land in fee simple together with all rentals and royalties due under said lease together with all\nreversionary rights and other rights of every kind and character owned by grantor.”39\n\nIf the oil and gas lease or related agreement make provision for payments other than the conventional delay rental and royalty\npayments, problems might be encountered in determining whether such payments should be treated as delay rentals and\napportioned as to acreage or should be treated as royalty and not apportioned. It is to be expected that the degree to which the\npayment in question resembles either a delay rental or a royalty payment will govern the decision. Thus, in one instance\npayments which, according to an agreement, were made in lieu of further development after an initial producing well had been\ndrilled were regarded as bearing more resemblance to a delay rental than a royalty and hence were apportioned among the\nmineral owners of subdivisions of the land under lease.40 On the other hand, in another instance, payments to be made under a\nminimum production covenant were regarded as bearing more resemblance to royalty payments and hence were not subject to\napportionment.41\n\nAfter a lessor has conveyed interests so that there are separate owners of subdivided portions of the land subject to the lease,\nthere is nothing to prevent such owners from entering into any arrangement among themselves for pooling their interests or\napportioning the royalty payable under such lease. There is no reason why they cannot make cross-conveyances of royalty\ninterests with the duration of such interests limited to the duration of the lease. Further, upon termination of the existing lease,\nthere is no reason why the parties cannot then enter into a community lease and provide for an apportionment of the royalty\npayable under such a lease.42 Difficulties might arise, however, when the parties enter into a transaction after they have\nacquired their subdivided interest and do not make their intentions clear.\n\nIf, after the existing lease terminates, the owners of interests in the subdivided tracts were to join in the granting of a common\noil and gas lease covering all of such tracts, such conduct would be regarded as revealing an intention to enter into a\ncommunity lease in many jurisdictions.43 It is doubtful, however, that a ratification or extension of an existing oil and gas lease\nby the owners of the subdivided tracts would be similarly regarded.

The principle circumstance\nwhich distinguishes such transactions is the matter of timing. The parties may pool their interests by entering into a community\nlease, or they may grant the leases and thereafter accomplish the same objective by subsequent agreement. There has been no\ndemonstrated tendency on the part of the courts to treat such circumstance of timing as a significant factor. The view has been\nexpressed that the situation where the lessors join in a community lease is not distinguishable from the situation where the\nlessors subsequently enter into a pooling or unitization agreement after granting separate leases.47\n\nIf, after having joined in a community lease or in a pooling or unitization agreement, a lessor should convey all or part of the\nmineral interest subject to such lease or agreement, a question is likely to arise with respect to the right of the grantee to\nparticipate in the royalty on production which is realized from wells drilled on other land covered by the transaction. The\nanswer to such question will depend upon the theory entertained with respect to the effect of entering into a community lease\nor pooling agreement, and if the theory is entertained that the parties exchange conveyances, the answer will also depend upon\nthe further theory as to the nature of the interests which are acquired by the cross-conveyances.\n\nIn those jurisdictions inclined toward the theory that community leases or pooling or unitization agreements do not result in\ncross-conveyances but create contractual rights among the parties, it is helpful in analyzing their rights and duties to identify\nthe contractual provision involved. The contractual provision under consideration is the royalty clause in the lease granted, as\nit may be modified by a pooling or unitization agreement. Regardless of any such modification, such clause remains the source\nof the rights and duties. Accordingly, a lessor who conveys an interest in the minerals will, to the extent of the interest granted,\npart with the right to participate in royalty from production on the land covered by the agreement. The grantor parts with the\nright to participate in royalty produced from the owned land because such right follows the title.\n\nSuch grantor also parts with the right to royalty on production from the other land covered by the community lease or\nunitization agreement because the right to such royalty stems from the covenant in the lease that runs with the land or mineral\ninterest conveyed.\n\nIt may also be reasoned that the grantor parts with the right to participate in royalty from the other land because such right\narises by virtue of the contribution of land to the community of interest, and a lessor who disposes of an interest in land that\nwas contributed to such community is no longer making the contribution required for participation. The successor in interest is\nthe one making the contribution and should receive the compensating benefits.48\n\n44   See Seal v. Banes, 183 Okla 203, 80 P(2d) 657 (1938).\n45   See Raley v.

There are reasons to believe, however, that the cross-conveyance theory will not be applied\nrigidly. It has been held that production from one tract covered by a community lease will prevent the termination of a\nterminable mineral interest in another tract covered by such community lease. In so holding, the court made the explanation\nwhich is set forth below and which reveals an attitude that each lessor enjoys a share of royalty on production from another\ntract because it is agreed that production shall be treated as coming from all parts of the leased premises. Under such\nreasoning, the right to receive royalty from production which is realized from wells located on other land covered by the\ncommunity lease would necessarily follow the ownership of each tract of land contributed to the community lease.\n\n“As between the lessors themselves, each relinquishes his right to have his own tract separately developed, his right to receive\nall of the royalties from production from wells on his own tract, and his right to have wells drilled on his tract off-setting other\nwells on the leased premises, and each gains the right to share proportionately in royalties from wells on the other included\ntracts. In short, the parties by the execution of a unitized lease agree that production\n\n49   Thomas v.

The consideration for that transfer was the similar\nmutual assignments of the other lessors. The royalty interest thus transferred by each landowner to his colessors is an incorporeal\nhereditament in gross … and the grantee’s interest in the oil produced upon the property of one of the colessors is entirely separate and\ndistinct from the royalty interest retained by him in oil which might be produced from his own premises.” Tanner v.

By joining in the lease they\nnecessarily agreed to the legal consequences that production from any of the tracts would be regarded as production from all\nother included tracts. More specifically, by joining in the lease the Powells agreed with the other parties thereto, including\nSouthland, that production from the 50 acre tract would be regarded during the life of the lease as production from the 160 and\nthe 40 acre tracts.”56\n\nIn Texas, it has been held by a federal court that the royalty payable under a community lease should continue to be\napportioned after a voluntary partition of the mineral rights by the lessors, unless some special provision is made for\ndiscontinuing the apportionment of royalty.57 It has also been held that where the granting clause of the mineral deed covers\nthe entire tract covered by the outstanding pooled leases and the grantor does not own an interest in all parts of the tract, the\nmineral deed has the effect of conveying the described mineral interest in the tracts owned, and the “subject to” clause has the\neffect of conveying the described fraction of royalty under the existing leases.58\nKuntz, Law of Oil and Gas\nCopyright 2014, Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., a member of the LexisNexis Group.\n\n\n56   Southland Royalty Co. v.

Effect of Subsequent Conveyances\n     One of the legal problems which is particularly crea ted\n  by the doct rine that the act of pooling or unitization\n  effec ts a cross -con veya nce of the real prop erty inter ests\n  {royalty or working interest} in the various tract s com-\n  prising the unit is that of dealing with conv eyan ces of\n  the sepa rate tract s mad e after the form ation of the\n  unit. This prob lem generally arises where the conv ey-\n ance of the sepa rate tract , or of some inter est in the\n sepa rate tract , is acco mpli shed by a deed or othe r form\n of conv eyan ce which makes no rrent ion of the unit or\n of the statu s of the tract in the unit. It is part of the\n very natu re of the prob lem that it will ordinarily relat e\n to the ownership of the unit royalty interests, since if\n there is a multiple working inter est ownership and a con-\n veya nce is mad e of working inter est in a segr egat ed\ntract the parti es to such a trans actio n will generally pro-\nvide expr es.sly and in sufficient detai l for the inten ded\neffec t of the conv eyan ce with resp ect to the unit. As\ntime goes on an increasing num ber of roya lty trans ac-\ntions are hand led in the same manner. But it is inherent\nthat roya lty trans fers will not always be tend ed with\ncare, and it is also inhere~+ that even after a unit is\nform ed the parti es are naturally inclined to rega rd their\nlegal titles as occu pyin g the same statu s as their statu s\n\f170        VOLUNTA RY POOLING AND UNITIZA TION\n\n\nprior to pooling or unitization, burdene d · only with the\naddition al contrac t covenan t. of sharing of product ion.\nThus many subsequ ent conveya nces inevitab ly are pre-\npared on an individual tract basis, without mention of the\nprior pooling or unitization of the particul ar tract with\nother tracts. In a produci ng unit this type of convey-\nance imposes a substan tial burden upon the purchas er\nof the product ion or other party paying the royalties\nsince he must determi ne, if he can, the legal effect of the\npurport ed c.o nveyan ce of an entire tract, or of some speci-\nfied interest in the tract, represen ting only a portion of\nthe unit area.\n\n\nIllustration of the Problem\n   In this instance again the problem is perhaps best illus-\ntrated by simplified hypothe tical facts. It may be as-\nsumed that A , B, C, and D each leases his separate ly-\nowned I 0-acre tract to the same lessee, X. Subsequ ently\nA, B, C, and. D enter into a pooling agreem ent with X in\nwhich the four tracts are pooled to form the 40-acre\ndrilling unit required by the spacing rules for the field\nfor the drilling of one well. X then drills a well on the\ntract contrib uted to the unit by A and it is an oil pro-\nducer. Subsequ ently B conveys his I 0-acre tract to E\nunder the usual form of warr_a nty deed which describ es\nonly that tract and makes no referenc e to the pooling\nagreem ent. This, of course, represen ts the most sim-\nplified version of the problem , but it is typical of trans-\nactions occurrin g constan tly within the boundar ies of\noil and gas units and involving fieldwide units as well as\nsingle-well drilling units.\n\f               SEPARATE POOLING AGREEMENT                171\n\nApplication of the Cross-Conveyance Theory\n    The most pressing question in the situation illustrated\nabove is that of what royalty interest, if any. E has ac-\nquired in the productio n from the well on A's tract by\nvirtue of the simple warranty deed describin g B's tract.\n If the cross-con veyance doctrine of pooling is applied\nwithout modificat ion, as it seemingly should be in juris-\ndictions which purport to follow the theory of the Veal\nand Belt cases, the act of pooling resulted in the owner-\nship by each A, B. C. and D of ! of the royalty interest\nin each of the four tracts. Since B could convey to E\nno more than he owned in the tract described in the\ndeed he. may have conv.eyed to E at most the surface,\nthe reversion ary interest, and only *of the royalty interest\nin that tract. Such an analysis leaves B. even after the\nconveyan ce, with ownership of ! of the royalty in eoch\nof the tracts contribut ed to the unit by A , C. and D.\nThis results, then, in the continued ownership by B of ! of\nthe royalty on the productio n from A's tract, while E.\nthe grantee, 9oes not participa te in such productio n ot\nall. It is probably . although not necessarily, true that\nB and E did not at all contempl ate such a result. They\nno doubt intended that with the unconditional convey-\nance of B's tract would go all interest in the unit produc-\ntion which was initially derived from the ownership of\nthat tract. But in the light of such doctrine as that of\nthe Veal and Belt cases are they defeated in their pur-\npose by the failure of the deed expressly to convey, not\nonly the ·t ract described , but all of B's royalty interest\nin the entire unit? Moreover , can the latter conveyan ce\nbe accompH shed by anything less than an adequate legal\ndescriptio n, by reference or otherwise, of all of the land\n\f172         VOLUNTARY POOLING A~'l> UNITIZATION\n\n\n  comprising the unit? Or, on the other hand, . without all\n  this, does all\" of B's parti.cipation in the unit follow the\n ownership of his tract?                 .\n     It is apparent that a strict application of the Veal and\n  Belt decisions to the situation illustrated above results in\n the acquisition by the grantee of no participation in the\n royalty on the unit production while the grantor, having\n conveyed his entire ownership in the tract which consti-\n tuted his sole initial contribution to the unit, nevertheless\n retains · as great a royalty participation in the unit pro-\n duction as he had absent the conveyance. The situa-\n tion is, of course, aggravated by the location of the unit\n well on a tract other than that conveyed. Were the\n unit well located on the tract conveyed the grantee, by\n virtue of his having acquired by the deed all of B's ~ of\n the royalty in that tract, would have no immediate ground\nfor complaint, since at best he is entitled to only ~ of\nthe royalty production. However, the legal question ex-\n ists to the same degree in either case. It is only by a\n coincidence of circumstances that the grantee sustains\n no actual loss in the latter case on account of the seem-\ningly defective deed so long as the unit production is\nfrom the tract conveyed to him.                             .\n    There are infinite variations of the situation illustrated\nabove. The conveyance to E might have been of a\nfractional undivided interest in the tract or in the miner-\nals or royalties in the tract. \"Such variations serve to\ncomplicate the facts but the basic issue remains the same.\nIn other circumstances the tract conveyed may represent\nonly a small part of a fieldwide unit, complicating the\nmatter still further. But still the fundamental problem\n~s the same.\n\f               SEPARATE POOLING AGREEMENT                173\nAvailable Interpretations\n    Even in the situation illustrated above there is a pos-\n sible interpret ation beyond those stated-i .e., the in-\n                                                   *\n terpretat ion, on the one hand, which gives E of the\n royalty in the tract conveyed with no royalty interest in\nthe ref!1aining tracts in the unit and the interpret ation,\non the other hand, which gives E all of B's participa tion\nin the unit which was initially derived from the tract con-\nveyed as an incident of the ownership in such tract.\nThe third interpret ation is a comprom ise, perhaps one of\nmerit. This interpret ation would recognize that by vir-\ntue of the cross-assignment theory of pooling B owned\n     *\nonly of the royalty in the tract conveyed and that only\nsuch royalty interest in only such tract is conveyed to\nE under the deed-bu t subject immediat ely to the pool-\ning agreemen t, so that the ! interest of E in the single\ntract is pooled with the retained ~ interest of B in the\nremaining tracts. If this interpreta tion were applied and\nthe pooling had been in proportio n to acreage as illus-\ntrated, E would become the owner of I I 16 of the roy-\nalty on the productio n from the unit well, while B would\nretain 3/16 of such royalty. It !s not likely that this third\nsuggeste d interpret ation is actua.lly within the contem-\nplation of the grantor and grantee, but this interpret a-\ntion is perhaps as reasonab le as i-he interpret ation which\ndenies the grantee practicall y all of the royalty owner-\nship in the unit which was initially attributa ble to the\ntract presently conveyed .\n\f 174           VOLU NTAR Y POOL ING AND UNIT IZAT ION\n\n\n California Decisions\n     Wit h this back grou nd it is well to cons ider the deci ded\n   case s relating to the effe ct of the conv eyan ce of a\n                                                              seg-\n   rega ted trac t afte r pooling or unitization has been\n                                                                ac-\n  complished.

It requi res a\n much lesser mental burde n to arrive at this conclusion\n wher e the found ation rule of cross -conv eyanc es of real\n prope rty intere sts as effec ted by pooli ng or unitization\n is avoid ed in the first instan ce. If this rule of law be\n avoid ed then the effec t of pooling or unitization is to\nleave the estat es in real prope rty as they exist prior to\n pooling or unitization but to impo se upon each such\nestat e the propo rtion ate burde n and benef it of the shar-\ning of unit produ ction after produ ction is achie ved.\nThus the pooli ng or unitization agree ment creat es a shar-\ning cove nant which runs with the land and other intere sts\nin real prope rty. Any conv eyanc e of any such intere st,\nwhet her expre ssly state d or not, would then be subje ct\nto the terms of the pooling or unitization agree ment\n(assuming actua l or const ructiv e notic e to the grant ee\nof the existe nce of such agree ment ) and would carry\nwith it the propo rtion ate benef its and burde ns of the\nsharin g arran geme nt speci fied in the agree ment .

Proportion-\nately smaller interests in the royalty in the other unit\ntracts would pass with a smaller interest conveyed in\nthe tract described. The description of the other tracts\nin the unit would necessarily be implied from the unit\nagreement of which the grantee will almost invariably\nhave actual or constructive notice. Such reasoning as\nthis conflicts with the ruling of the California court that\nthe royalty interest of the lessor in the land of his co-\nlessors in the unit is a right or interest in gross and is,\ntherefore, not transferred unless specifically conveyed.\nHowever, it is believed that such interest in land of the\ncolessors is better treated as a right or interest appur-\ntenant, rather than in gross.\n   The principal objective, where overriding considera-\ntions of public policy are not involved, is to give effect\nto the probable intention of the parties in the transac-\ntion. And in this type of situation the actual intention\nof the grantor and grantee is normally to convey all of\nthe grantor's ownership in the unit which he acquired\nby virtue of the contribution to the unit of the interest\ndescribed in the conveyance.

H<;>wever, the case of the con-\nveyance after pooling will ordinarily provide even a\nstronger case in logic for the continued enforcement of\nthe apportionment under the pooling agreement since\nthe pqoling agreement in this situ\"ation is obviously in-\ntended as a covenant which will run with the land and bind\nall future purchasers and is just as .obviously a reasonable\nrestraint on the future alienation of the lands comprising\nthe unit.\n\nProcedure for Purchaser\n   From what has been said it is apparent that this prob-\nlem has not yet been fully developed and decided by\nthe courts in most of the oil and gas jurisdictions. It is\nlikewise apparent that the problem will furnish the basis\nfor future litigation and that the purchasers or other\nparties charged with the duty of making payment for unit\nproduction meanwhile can not feel wholly secure in mak-\ning such payments to the grantor or grantee in the type\nof situation envisaged here in those jurisdictions in which\nthe matter has not been fully dealt with in the appellate\ncourts.

The proble m of nonjoinder is a\ntrouble some one for the nonjoining party himself, since he\nmay feel sincerely that his individual interes t and rights\nwill be seriously jeopar dized by his partici pation in the\npooling or unitization arrang ement, yet he must recogn ize\nat the same time that in many instances his interes t will\nbe affecte d by the operat ion of the unit even though he\ndoes not partici pate. In the case of the operat or or\nlessee in the unit, on the other hand, the proble m create d\nby the refusal of mineral or royalty owners to join can\nbe even more trouble some.

It is stated in the facts\n       that the 3,296-acre tract was common ly owned by Taub,\n       Dwyer, and Mrs. McCall before its partition into sixteen\n       sep<lfate tracts. The land was under three oil and gas leases\n       at the time of partition. When a tract is portitioned, the\n       minerals and the surface usually remain together. In the\n       principal agreement, it was provided that each continued to\n       own a stipulated interest as ex.isted in the tracts prior to parti-\n       tion and that in future leases, each would continue to own\n       a stipulated royalty interest in the tracts of others. ln other\n       words, each became a nonparticipating royalty owner of the\n       agreed fraction in the other tracts. Their agreement was unlike\n       that involved in Garza v. Montalvo, 1 where the siblings\n       pm1itioned their jointly owned I ,100 acres, which tract was\n       under tense. No mention was made in the partition of the oil\n       and gas Iealie or the minerals. The subsequent production was\n       held to belong solely to the owner of the tract on which the\n       producing well was located.\n             No mention was made of any production from Mrs.\n       McCall's tract during the period of time involved in the\n\n   12L7 S.W. 2d 988 (Tex.

McCALL                              417\n\n        principal case. The production at issue was from the eight\n        new wells drilled on tbe Taub and Dwyer tracts.\n              The question arises as to the creation of Mrs. McCall's\n        interest in production from the others' tracts. One possibility\n        is that her interest was similar in principle to that set forth\n        in Veal v. Thomason, 2 in which owners of separate minerals\n        in separate tracts committed them to a unit agreement under\n        which each tract would share in the production from the other\n        tracts, and Parker v. Parker, 3 where owners of separate tracts\n        signed a single lease combining their tracts, with it being held\n        that each tract shared in subsequent production from the\n        others. Such transactions are frequently refen·ed to as cross-\n        conveyances; the interest being conveyed is a royalty, an\n        interest in real property.\n              The facts in the opinion state that the pat1ition agreement\n        provided that each was to continue to own the existing interest\n        at the time of partition \"in each of the tracts granted to the\n        other parties.\" If this existing interest was a continuation of\n        the jointly owned interest in the other tracts and each tract\n        partitioned was burdened with the existing lease and royalty\n        ownership, then it would appear, as stated above, that each\n        would continue to own a nonparticipating royalty interest in\n        all of the tracts. Mrs. McCall would then own a royalty inter-\n        est in each of the producing tracts on the Taub and Dwyer\n        land. But if the ownership in each other's land had been a\n        result of a cross-conveyance, then the issue would be con-\n        trolled by Veal and related cases.\n              In any event, there was no problem as to whether Mrs.\n        McCall and her assignees would share in the production on\n        the other tracts. T he case turned on whether Mrs. McCall\n        assigned an interest in the disputed production to Lila under\n        the deed in which she was a grantee or conveyed this royalty\n        in the deed executed in the 1997 conveyance to her three\n        children, excluding Lila.\n              The following analysis of the deed under which Lila\n        claimed an interest in production of the eight new wells on\n        the Taub and Dwyer tracts is in contrast and conflict with\n\n   2   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3938167\"><a href=\"/opinion/4170896/veal-v-thomason/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

The deed executed by Mrs.\n        McCall, in which Lila was a named grantee, provided as\n        shown in the opinion that the grantor did \"GRANT, BAR-\n        GAIN, SELL and CONVEY that certain tract of land\n        . . . particularly described in Exhibit A . . . and appurtenances\n        thereto . . . unto Grantees . . . .\"4 It is not stated whether\n        the land described in Exhibit A included the entire 3,298-acrc\n        tract formerly commonly owned, or only those tracts set aside\n        to Mrs. McCall in the partition deed. In this deed, no mention\n        was made of any minerals, exceptions, or reservations. If\n        Exhibit A described the 3,298-acre transaction, then the roy-\n        alty interest owned by Mrs. McCall in the tracts of the others\n        would be included in the description, but if Exhibit A included\n        only those tracts partitioned by Mrs. McCall, then the ques-\n        tion would involve the conveyance of royalty in tracts not\n        desc'r ibed in the deed, but which would be included as an\n        appurtenance to Mrs. McCall's royalty in the tracts of the\n        others under the cross-conveyance theory.\n               In Harris v. Currie, 5 it is stated: \"When the owner of\n        the entire estate in land conveys it by an ordinary form of\n        deed containing no exception or reservation, hls grantee\n        acquires the same title whlch the grantor had and such title\n        includes all minerals.\" The case held that delay rentals under\n        an oil and gas lease are a part of the mineral eslate, and that\n        unaccrued delay rentals, although not mentioned in the deed,\n        pass as a patt of the mineral estate to the grantee. This rule\n       ·has been cited as authority that a deed conveys the grantor's\n        interest in the tract, including the minerals, less those ex-\n        cepted or reserved. 6 If Mrs. McCall had expressly stated in\n        her conveyance that she conveyed only the trac ts that she\n        owned after the partition, she would have also, under 1he rule\n        stated in Harris, conveyed her royally interest in the Taub\n        and Dwyer tracts.

The royalty interest that Mrs. McCall owned both\n       in her tracts and in the other tracts is a part of her mineral\n       estate, and although unmentioned in a conveyance of the\n       ordinary deed form, would pass under Harris.\n             Day & Co., Inc. v. Texland Petroleum Co., Inc., 7 was\n       cited by Lila for the rule from Harris and Cockrell. The court\n       distinguished Day by stating that the deed in that case only\n       purported to convey ten acres of the ninety-acre tract. The\n       principal issue in Day was the court's holding that the\n       executive right is neither a power nor akin to a power, but\n       is an attribute of the complete mineral estate, i.e., a \"stick\"\n       that can be separately owned and conveyed. As an interest\n       in the mineral estate, it passed under the warranty deed\n       involved. It is submitted that the royalty interest owed by Mrs.\n       McCall in others' tracts, being an interest in realty, passed\n       under the rule stated by the Texas Supreme Court in Harris,\n       Cockrell, and Day. The application of the rule is a matter of\n       law. If a party contends that by the application of the rule,\n       it does not reach a result intended by the parties, then there\n       is a case for reformation of a mutual mistake. The reasoning\n       that the Day case was not applicable because it applied only\n       to ten acres and not to the entire ninety-acre tract is difficult\n       to follow. Harris and Cockrell were not cited in the opinion.\n             In Harris, the court defined \"appurtenant\" consistently\n       with the definition given in Note 8 of the principal case. 8\n       The comt stated, \"[T]he grant or reservation carries with it,\n       as a necessary appurtenance thereto, the right to use . . . the\n       surface . ... \" 9\n             Lila argued that the word \"appurtenance\" in the war-\n       ranty deed caused the royalty interest in the Taub and Dwyer\n       tracts to pass under the warranty deed. The court rejected this\n       argument, defining \"appurtenance\" in the footnote as limited\n       to that which is necessary to the enjoyment of the principal\n       thing granted or indispensable to the proper use of the\n       premises demised.

One method of arriving at such\n       result wou ld be to consider that all royalty interests\n       created in the unit by virtue of the presumed cross-\n       conveyances arc incident or appurtenant to the interests\n       from wltich they were derived and that any transfer of\n       any interest in the latter category passes with all of the\n       incidental or appurtenant interests in the other tracts in\n       the unit. Thus, the lessor who contributed a I0-acre tract\n       to a 40~acre driJUng unit and subsequently conveys his\n       I 0-acre tract without mention of the unit would pass\n       interest in the tract described and 1/4 of the royally\n       interest in each of the other tracts as an indicant of or\n       appurtenant to the tract described.u\n              But whatever definition is given to the word \"appurte-\n        nance,\" whether a broad definition or a narrow one, it is\n        submillcd that Mrs. McCall's royalty interest in the others'\n        tracts was a real property interest, a part of the \"mineral\n        package\" acquired by her either in the partition agreement\n        or by cross-conveyance, and when she executed the deed\n        without rninernl or royally, the rule io Harris and Cockrell\n        applied to pass to the grontees (including Lila) an interest.\n        Although Lila hntl never been paid roynlty on production, the\n        nonpayment did not preclude the conveyance to her of the\n        royalty interest by the deed in question.\n              As a side note, not involved in the opinion, is a drafting\n        question. ln I he June I, 1997, deed, MCDCO conveyed to\n        Lila, Patricia, and Mildred \"in equal shares, an undivided 1/3\n        interest in all oil, gas and mineral then owned by MCDCO\n   10 Supraat p. 412.\n   11 Hoffman, Vohmtary Pooling and Unitiwtion, at 83 (Matthew Bender 1954)\n(emphasis added).\n(Manhew ll<:l!da & Co..

This section focuses on\nthe two major approaches to resolving the question of the characterization of what is the post-pooled or unitized title.\n\nIn reviewing the cases and the doctrines it is crucial to remember the context in which the court is deciding whether to\nopt for the contract or cross-conveyance theory. A decision relating to joinder issues, such as what constitutes a\nnecessary or indispensable party, may have different considerations than a decision relating to whether the Rule Against\nPerpetuities has been violated. Likewise, the plaintiff's views as to the continued validity of the pooled or unitized entity\nmight also impact the court's choice. Finally, in looking at these competing theories or doctrines, most courts are\nsearching for the intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument that created the pooled or unitized title. Many of the\nproblems and differences between jurisdictions are caused by the court's varying interpretations of standard provisions\nin community leases or pooling or unitization agreements. In most of these cases, there is no express statement of intent\nto create contractual rights or property rights. It is that lacunae that these decisions attempt to fill. The emphasis on the\nintent of the parties suggests that when the parties expressly state their preference, the courts will follow that language\nand not resort to the choice made by that state when the parties have left the issue undecided. Two different theories\nhave been developed to describe the nature of the unitized title where the parties to a voluntary pooling and unitization\nagreement have not specified if they intended to convey property rights in the pooled or unitized area. These two\ntheories have been labeled the cross-conveyance (cross-assignment) theory and the contract theory. These theories do\nnot exist in the abstract but in the context of the following issues: who may effect a pooling of interests; who will be\nindispensable parties to litigation regarding the pooled unit; and what is the appropriate venue for litigation. Yet as these\nproblems get resolved by reference to the two theories they mask the underlying issues that are not resolvable by the\nchoice of a cross-conveyance or contract theory.\n\nThe only real issues that could be affected by the adoption of either theory have not been the subject of much litigation.\nFor example, an important issue relates to whether or not the terms of a pooling or unitization agreement are binding on\nassignees. Whether the original agreement was a contract or a cross-conveyance would affect the outcome of that issue.\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 2\n                               2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.01\n\n\n\nThe descendability or inheritability of pooled or unitized interests would also be affected by the choice of doctrine.\nOther issues such as the affect of recordation of instruments, third party rights and/or liabilities, and the impact of lien\nand other security interest statutes would also be impacted by the characterization decision as a contract or a\ncross-conveyance of property interests.\n\nWhatever the context of the dispute, the choice between the two doctrines may be outcome determinative. That is, the\nchoice of which doctrine to apply will necessarily lead to a single result. Therefore, it becomes important to have sound\nand easily understood rules that can be applied in an evenhanded manner.\n\nThe two theories develop naturally from the purposes and nature of a pooling or unitization agreement that purports to\ncombine various interests for the purpose of joint operations. In essence, the internal property lines within a pooled unit\nand a unitized area have been erased pursuant to the express terms of the agreement. The two theories attempt to explain\nwhether that combination is property-based or contractually-based. The courts have been trying to deal with oil and gas\nproduction and development that had no counterpart in the traditional estate system developed in medieval England.\nTrying to fit the oil and gas property system in general and the nature of the pooled or unitized title into classical\nproperty theory has led to substantial doctrinal uncertainty. That uncertainty is present in many court decisions relating\nto the two doctrines. The soundest approach to the underlying issue is to treat pooling and unitization agreements as a\nspecial area of contract law, but clearly note that these contracts grow out of, and affect, property rights. Rather than\ntrying to fit these issues into the old bottle of estates-in-land and classic property doctrine, it would be better if a new\nbottle was created that recognizes the interrelationship between contract and property rights and makes a suitable\naccommodation between those rights in order to carry out the intent of the parties without undue interference or\nconfusion from the courts.\n\n     [2] Effects of the Classification Scheme\n\nPerhaps in no other area than the determination of who are indispensable parties has the choice between the contract and\ncross-conveyance theory led to the greatest doctrinal conflict. n2 It is important, however, to place in context many of\nthe cases that were decided in an era in which there was still a substantial distinction between in rem and in personam\njurisdiction. That distinction affected the ability to join parties if the contract or cross-conveyance theory was adopted.\nIn today's world of long-arm statutes, where personal jurisdiction is available on a \"minimum contacts\" theory, one\ncould get jurisdiction over any party who is part of a pooling or unitization agreement, since it is clear that a party to\nthose agreements has sufficient minimum contacts with the jurisdiction regardless of the label attached. The question of\nproceeding with litigation affecting a pooling or unitization agreement, with or without the joinder of all the parties,\nshould not turn on the question of whether the agreement was a contract or cross-conveyance of property interests. The\nunderlying issue should be the impact of the litigation on the rights of the parties, however one classifies those rights.\n\nIt is clear, however, that under most definitions of indispensable parties, if the court applies the cross-conveyance theory\nthe other pooled or unitized owners will be indispensable. However, the converse is not true. A choice of the contract\ntheory does not necessarily lead to a result that the pooled and unitized owners are not indispensable. Whatever its exact\nnature, whether an ordinary contract provision that provides for a changed manner of operation and of calculating\nroyalties or a real covenant that runs with the land, it still cannot be denied that in a title suit involving the title to a tract\nof land committed to the unit that all participants in the unit have an interest in the tract involved. Treating the\nagreement as a contract affecting property interests would more accurately describe what the pooling or unitization\nagreement concerns. Not allowing the contract/cross-conveyance theory to decide issues of indispensable parties is the\nbetter approach. By requiring a more ad hoc exploration of the nature and the agreement of the lawsuit, in order to\nanswer the question of whether the non-joined interests are indispensable, will allow the court to consider such\nimportant and diverse issues as where are the producing well or wells located, what is the allocation formula, and what\nare the minimum or maximum size requirements, if any, that will be affected by a change in ownership on one of the\ntracts.\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                   1 of 1 DOCUMENT\n\n                                     The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition\n\n                Copyright 2014, Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., a member of the LexisNexis Group.\n\n                                     CHAPTER 19 The Nature of the Unitized Title\n\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n§ 19.02 State Analysis\n\n\n\n     [1] Contract Theory States\n\n     [a] Kansas\n\nTwo cases clearly suggest in dictum that Kansas has rejected the cross-conveyance theory and has adopted the contract\ntheory for pooled or unitized titles. The first case, Hover v. Cleveland Oil Co., n101 is typical of court decisions that\nstruggle with the concept of what a unitized title should be but never directly answer the question. Adjacent lessors had\nentered into an agreement whereby they would share certain economic benefits, including oil runs, bonuses, and rentals,\non a surface acreage basis until they mutually agreed otherwise. One of the lessors then conveyed his interests to a third\nparty through the use of a warranty deed. The issue before the court was whether the sale of one of the interests\nterminated the sharing or pooling agreement even when the other parties had not joined in the conveyance. The\napplication of one theory would produce different consequences than the application of the other theory. Under\ncross-conveyance theory, the lessors would each own an undivided interest in the others' interest, and each would\nthereby have conveyed to the others a similar interest in the premises originally owned. Undoubtedly the warranty deed\ndid not mention a reduced share of the described premises, nor did it include the vendor's share of the other premises\nthat were the subject of the pooling agreement. However, if the lessor had merely given contractual rights to the other\nlessors, those could be terminated unilaterally under the provisions of the agreement, and the warranty deed would be\nsatisfied insofar as it transferred all of the vendor's interest in the described premises. Under a contract theory the deed\nwould be effective to transfer a non-pooled interest and, in effect, terminate the pooling agreement.\n\nThe holding of the court would support the contract theory, although the language of the opinion is somewhat\nambiguous. The court found that the pooling agreement had terminated by the sale by one of the parties to the\nagreement. After the sale the seller no longer had anything to contribute to the pooling agreement and the court was\nunwilling to substitute the purchaser for the seller as being bound by the terms of the pooling agreement. n102 If there\nhad been a cross-conveyance of interests, unilateral termination would arguably be impossible unless expressly\nprovided for in the agreement. The pooling agreement would have cross-conveyed interests that would remain with the\nparties until the agreement terminated by its own provisions or until there were later conveyances of the cross-conveyed\ninterests. Thus, the result and the reasoning are consistent with the contract doctrine; all that was created was a\ncontractual right to share, which would terminate upon the transfer of the contributed mineral or royalty interest even in\nthe absence of a formal provision.\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 2\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n\nFurther support for the contract doctrine in Kansas can be inferred from the holding and analysis in Kenoyer v.\nMagnolia Petroleum Co. n103 Kenoyer involved an exercise of a pooling power that was alleged to be in violation of\nthe common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. n104 In ruling that the rule was not applicable to an exercise of the pooling\npower, the court found that the pooling power was not a traditional property-based power but merely a means of\neffecting a contractual change in the way that royalties were to be paid and the leasehold estate operated. Again, if the\ncourt were to have adopted a cross-conveyance theory it would have been much more difficult to dismiss the rule\nchallenge, although states such as Texas that have adopted the cross-conveyance theory also find that the rule is not\nviolated by the exercise of the pooling power. The Kansas court said:\n\n            we fail to see how the provision in question violates the rule against perpetuities. The lease does not\n       create any future estates ... . It granted to lessee the right to operate the lands covered by it separately or\n       as a part of a consolidated unit. The royalty provisions fit either operation and provide a formula by\n       which the amount of royalties payable to the lessor is capable of accurate and definite ascertainment.\n       These rights were vested ... .\n\n            ... .\n\n           In our opinion the rule against perpetuities simply has no application to the provision of the lease\n       under consideration. n105\n\nNo further light has been shed on the problem in Kansas, but the clear indication from Hover and Kenoyer is that\nKansas treats a voluntary pooling and unitization agreement as merely involving the transfer of contractual rights.\n\n     [b] Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma appears to have shifted ground in the cross-conveyance/contract controversy. The early case of Lusk v. Green\nn106 involved whether the signing of a single lease covering two non-contiguous parcels, each owned separately by a\nhusband and wife, constituted a community lease and a pooling of royalty interests. The court eventually concluded that\nthe signing of the single lease with the two parcels described therein did not create a community lease, and, therefore,\nthere was no effective pooling of the separate interests. In reaching that conclusion the court said:\n\n            under the state of facts disclosed by the record in this case, we are not willing to say that, because\n       the lessors executed a lease covering their respective tracts of land, which were not contiguous but\n       several miles apart, on the same piece of paper, that they thereby each intended to convey to the other a\n       half interest in the royalties. n107\n\nOne can infer that if the parties had shown an intent to enter into a community lease or, for that matter, a pooling or\nunitization agreement, they would have in effect cross-conveyed to each other a one half interest in their respective\ntracts. n108\n\nAlthough Lusk received some support in dictum in Amis v. Bryan Petroleum Corp., n109 there were some early signs\nthat there was not widespread support for the cross-conveyance theory. In at least two instances the Oklahoma Supreme\nCourt found that the Statute of Frauds would not be applicable to agreements to pool or apportion royalties. n110 Since\nthe Statute of Frauds requires a writing for conveyances, with a few irrelevant exceptions, it would have been\ninconsistent to state that a pooling agreement amounted to a cross-conveyance of the royalty interests and to find\nsimultaneously that the Statute of Frauds is not applicable. n111\n\nThe death knell for the cross-conveyance theory in Oklahoma began tolling with Sinclair Crude Oil Co. v. Oklahoma\nTax Commission. n112 Oklahoma was seeking to apply the state's gross production and proration tax to royalty oil that\nwas payable to several Indian allottees. The allottees had entered into several unitization agreements that provided them\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 3\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\na proportional share of royalties from production located anywhere on the unit. The basis for the liability was the Tax\nCommission's conclusion that the Indian allottees had conveyed their otherwise tax exempt interest to the other parties\nwho had signed the unit agreement. In exchange they received a cross-conveyance from the other unit members of a\nproportional share of their royalty interests in the entire unit. n113 This newly created interest, according to the Tax\nCommission, did not fall under any of the tax exemption provisions of the otherwise applicable Cherokee Allotment\nAct.\n\nThe unitization agreement did not contain any specific provision relating to the issue of whether the parties intended to\napply a cross-conveyancing or contract theory. Without citing Lusk or Amis the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined\nthat the language of the unitization agreement did not evince an intent to cross-convey the various unitized interests. It\nemphasized the lack of specific words of grant that it concluded were vital to treating a document as a conveyance of a\nproperty interest. It did ignore, however, one provision of the unitization agreement that provided that the agreement\nwould constitute a real covenant running with the land. n114 Under the normal requirements of privity of estate, a real\ncovenant can only be created when there is a transfer of a property interest or a tenurial relationship between the parties,\nsuch as landlord and tenant. In this case there was neither; the language suggesting that the promises contained in the\nagreement were to be construed as real covenants does evince an intent to cross-convey interests that would provide the\nprivity requirement for real covenants. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the absence of words of grant was critical.\nIt said:\n\n            ...in order for the communitization agreements to constitute and effect an exchange, conveyance or\n       cross transfer between the royalty owners of title and ownership to an undivided fractional share and\n       interest in the oil ..., it was essential that the agreements contain adequate operative words such as grant,\n       bargain, convey, or others of like import, sufficient to effect a conveyance of title to the minerals\n       underlying the land ... . n115\n\nThe court emphasized the contractual nature of the agreements when it concluded:\n\n           The communitization agreements here in question constitute a valid form of private contract ... .\n       From a consideration of the agreements as a whole we fail to agree with the findings and holdings of the\n       Tax Commission wherein it holds that the agreements constitute and effect an exchange of title to the\n       mineral or royalty interests ... .\" n116\n\nWhile not citing Lusk, the court was aware of the contrary position on this issue that had been taken in Texas. It clearly\nchose to follow the contract doctrine largely on the basis that the weight of \"persuasive\" authority treated the contract\ndoctrine as the one that more closely reflected the true intent of parties to pooling and unitization agreements not to\neffect a cross-conveyance of their interests. n117\n\nIf further evidence was needed that the Oklahoma Supreme Court had adopted the contract theory, it was provided in\nGarvin v. Pettigrew. n118 In Garvin, some ten owners of both unleased mineral and royalty interests entered into an\nagreement whereby they would share in the royalties that would accrue to each separate tract in proportion to the\nacreage that each contributed to the agreement. Specific language contained in the agreement evinced an intent not to\nconvey or transfer any interest in the lands themselves. n119 The defendant's predecessors had conveyed to that\nplaintiff's predecessors all of the acreage committed to the unit. The plaintiff was seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe defendant was not entitled to share in the benefits of off-unit production. The jury found for the defendant, but the\ntrial court ordered a new trial, concluding that the pooling agreement violated the Rule Against Perpetuities and was\ntherefore void. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's granting of the motion for a new trial but differed as to the\nreason for overturning the jury verdict. Principally relying on the Hover case, the court found that a pooling agreement,\nsuch as the one used in this case, does not result in a cross-conveyance of any royalty or mineral interests. This was\nespecially evident from the specific language of the agreement denying a transfer of any mineral or royalty interests.\nn120 The court could have decided this case on narrower grounds, such as a specific lack of intent to transfer interests\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 4\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nor that the rights to share in unit production were attached to the lands that were contractually contributed and once\nthose lands were no longer owned by a party, the contractual right to shared royalties also expired. n121\n\nThe court's language, however, goes beyond the narrow interpretation of the specific terms and broadly rejects the\ncross-conveyance doctrine. The court stated:\n\n            The contract here involved constituted a pooling agreement. It was so referred to in the record and in\n       the briefs of the parties. It could not have been a conveyance of a mineral interest. Nowhere does it\n       appear therein a granting clause of any kind. Nor was it an assignment of royalties in perpetuity. n122\n\nNonetheless, this broad language must be read in the context of the express disclaimer of interest in the\n\"lands-of-others\" provision of the agreement which was emphasized by the court.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this decision followed Sinclair Crude Oil by about six weeks, yet Sinclair 's clear language\nrejecting a cross-conveyance theory is not cited. This is particularly n123 troublesome since there was a vigorous\ndissenting opinion that clearly preferred an express approval of the cross-conveyance theory for pooling and unitization\nagreements. The majority's emphasis on typical language in the pooling agreement and its failure to overrule Lusk and\ncite Sinclair, muddied the waters of Oklahoma oil and gas jurisprudence until 1970.\n\nIn Tenneco Oil Co. v. District Court n124 the Oklahoma Supreme Court again rejected the cross-conveyance theory for\npooling agreements. The plaintiffs were the lessees of certain lands that were voluntarily unitized; the defendant was\ndeclared the operator of the unit under the unit agreement. The unit was approved by the Corporation Commission. The\nplaintiffs were seeking a partition of the interests committed to the voluntary unitization order. They also sought an\ninjunction prohibiting an expansion of a secondary recovery operation that was being proposed by the unit operator. A\nrequirement before a party can seek partition is the existence of a cotenancy between the parties. If the\ncross-conveyance theory for voluntary unit agreements is followed then, by necessity, a cotenancy is created. However,\nif the contract theory is followed, there have been no property interests transferred and therefore no cotenancy. n125\n\nThus, the issue was squarely before the court. The court rejected the cross-conveyance theory and adopted the contract\ntheory as it applies to the typical unitization or pooling agreement. No special terms or disclaimers need to be placed in\nthose agreements for a court to find that only contractual rights are created. In the absence of provisions to the contrary,\nit will be presumed that the parties to the pooling and unitization agreement do not intend to cross-convey any property\ninterests. n126 In answering the question of whether or not a cotenancy had been established the court definitively\nstated:\n\n            co-tenancy has never been established or created. The parties have title and ownership to separate\n       tracts. No party has been conveyed an interest in the property of the other. The plan of unitization is not a\n       cross conveyance of interest, but rather a plan to unitize their several tracts ... . Neither the plan of\n       unitization nor the statutes which authorized the Corporation Commission to approve and regulate the\n       same intended to convey an interest between the parties. The Plan of Unitization has no operative words\n       of conveyance and it is apparent from the instrument itself that none was intended. n127\n\nIt is clear that Oklahoma has rejected the cross-conveyance theory for the typical pooling and unitization agreement\nbecause the typical agreements normally disclaim any intent to cross-convey property interests. Where the partners are\nsilent on the issue, the court would also find no cross-conveyance because there would be no operative words of\nconveyance. If parties want to cross-convey property interests they need to amend the standard forms and put in explicit\ngranting or conveying language evincing such an intent. n128 Thus, Oklahoma has finally planted its feet firmly in the\ncamp of contract theory states, notwithstanding an initial decision opting for the cross-conveyance theory.\n\nOklahoma's compulsory pooling system also raises issues over the nature of the unitized title. n129 Non-operating\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 5\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nworking-interest owners sometimes are given an option not to participate in well production expenses and instead\nreceive a bonus payment and/or some overriding royalties. Is an assignment of the working interest so that the\nnon-operator is divested of all of his or her interests within the pooled unit? In Ranola Oil Co. v. Corporation\nCommission, n130 the court concluded that when the non-operator accepted a bonus payment in lieu of participation,\nthe entire working interest was deemed transferred to the operator. That precluded the non-operator from participating\nas a matter of right in increased-density wells approved later. The pooling order when accepted by the non-operator\nterminated the non-operator's working interest in the minerals within the pooled unit.\n\n Ranola Oil is perhaps inconsistent with an earlier decision of the Oklahoma Court of Appeals, Southern Union\nProduction Co. v. Eason Oil Co. n131 This decision of the Court of Appeals is not binding as precedent because it was\nnot ordered released for publication by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. In Southern Union, Eason as a working-interest\nowner had opted by default for the bonus payment alternative to participation in production expenses. Eason never\nformally assigned its working interest to Southern Union, the operator. A dry hole was drilled and the Corporation\nCommission eventually deleted the Eason acreage from the pooled unit. Eason then drilled a producing well on a\nre-spaced 80-acre unit, and Southern Union claimed a conversion of its working interest had occurred. That claim was\nbased on the prior assignment of Eason's working interest that was ordered in the creation of the 640-acre unit. The\nCourt of Appeals disagreed that Eason had conveyed a fee interest in its working interest. It concluded that no\nassignment had taken place or, alternatively, if an assignment had occurred it had been extinguished with the\ntermination of the 640-acre unit. Ranola Oil clearly would have found that Eason had conveyed its interest when it\nchose the bonus alternative. But the termination of the unit was a factor that the Ranola Oil court did not face. The\nCorporation Commission never provided whether the assignment was a full fee simple absolute assignment or a\ndefeasible fee assignment that automatically terminated upon the termination of the unit. The Southern Union court\nconcluded that it was the equivalent of a defeasible fee assignment, if any assignment of an interest took place at all.\n\nIn Unit Petroleum Co. v. Mobil Exploration & Production North America, Inc., n131.1 the court explored in the\ncontext of a gas balancing dispute the relationship between working interest owners who have executed a joint\noperating agreement. n131.2 Relying on Harrell v. Samson Resources Co., n131.3 the court described the relationship\nbetween the parties to the JOA as \"cotenant-like.\" This labeling affected the outcome of the suit because the court found\nthat the JOA did not provide for immediate cash balancing but said that Mobil's sale, if it derogated Unit's rights as a\ncotenant and \"beneficiary of the trust relationship,\" might trigger an immediate right to cash balancing. In addition, if\nthe sale by Mobil caused it to deny further liability for the overproduction then Unit could be entitled to immediate cash\nbalancing. The use of the term trust relationship is somewhat troubling because the parties to a JOA normally are not\ntreated as being in such a relationship. In many JOAs the parties can protect themselves against the sale of working\ninterests by including a preferential right to purchase provision or other type of clause that gives them the right to\napprove of a transfer of a working interest. In order to determine whether or not there is a derogation of the trust\nrelationship or a denial of future liability, an ad hoc determination of the facts of each case must be made by the trial\ncourt.\n\n     [c] Utah\n\nWhile no state court decision has adopted either theory, an opinion of the Tenth Circuit applying Utah law apparently\nassumes that Utah would adopt a contract theory rather than a cross-conveyance theory. In Phillips Petroleum Co. v.\nPeterson, n132 the Rule Against Perpetuities was again at the center of the controversy. The lessors claimed that the\nleasehold pooling clause was invalid because it violated the rule, and, therefore, the placement of their acreage into\nvarious units was likewise invalid. The Tenth Circuit concluded that the rule was only applicable if the pooling or\nunitization agreements constituted a conveyance of interests in realty. n133 The court held that the pooling clause in the\nlease and the terms of the unitization agreement did not evince a clear intent to cross-convey the respective royalty\ninterests. It adopted the view suggested by Leo Hoffman that pooling and unitization agreements generally use\ncontractual terms rather than language typical of conveyances. There was no special provision in the agreement stating\nthat no cross-conveyance was intended. Instead the general language regarding allocation of production costs and\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 6\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nroyalty payments was deemed to evince an intent not to cross-convey. n134 The court also followed what it believed to\nbe the more persuasive case authority that adopts the contract doctrine. n135\n\n     [d] West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia is here classified as adopting the contract theory, but the cases upon which this classification are based\nare unclear and perhaps contradictory. The first case that suggested that the court was opting for the contract doctrine\nwas Lynch v. Davis. n136 Lynch involved a community lease whereby several separate owners of mineral estates joined\nin one lease of their respective tracts. n137 The ultimate issue related to whether or not there should be an\napportionment of royalties based on a surface acreage allocation formula. The court rejected an argument that finding\nfor apportioned royalties is the equivalent of finding that the parties cross-conveyed their interests; it ruled that the\ncommunity lease was not a conveyance of an interest in the minerals. If it was a conveyance, the court would have to\nfind that the non-apportionment rule would apply. n138 While not a model of clarity, the opinion suggests that a\ncommunity lease does not entail a conveyance of interests in real property unless it undertakes to do so through specific\nlanguage of grant. n139\n\nWhile Lynch standing alone would cause us to place West Virginia in the ambiguous category, the case of Boggess v.\nMilam n140 would support a conclusion that West Virginia has embraced the contract doctrine. Boggess involved the\nright to share in royalties where there had been a pooling of less than all of the interests in the pooled tracts. Boggess\nowned an undivided interest in a tract of land. He was given an opportunity to join in a pooling or unitization\nagreement, but he refused. The agreement was executed by the other owners, including those who owned fractional\nshares in the same tract as Boggess. The unit well was drilled off of the Boggess acreage. He nonetheless claimed a\nshare of the royalty from the unit well's production. Under either a contract or cross-conveyance theory Boggess had to\nlose because he had refused to execute the agreement. His argument was based on a cross-conveyance theory, asserting\nthat he was a cotenant of the royalty interests of those owners who had joined the agreement. While that argument\nwould be persuasive had he executed the agreement, his failure to join gave him no rights whatsoever in the off-tract\npooled production. While not critical to its holding, the court discussed the contract and cross-conveyance theories and\nconcluded that a unitization agreement merely involves the merging of contractual rights. n141 By stating that the\nunitization agreement did not effectuate a merger of title the court was in essence rejecting a cross-conveyance theory,\nwhich if adopted would cause a merger of title between the parties to the agreement. While not a solid member of the\ncontract theory group, the combination of Boggess and Lynch clearly indicate a judicial predilection for treating pooling\nand unitization agreements as merely entailing contractual relationships.\n\n     [2] Cross-Conveyance Theory States\n\n     [a] California\n\nAlthough California is now considered a state firmly committed to the cross-conveyance theory, some of its early\nopinions suggested that the contract theory was the preferable approach. In Bayside Land Co. v. Dabney, n142 the\nlessor entered into a lease with the defendant that contained a form of pooling clause that gave the lessee the power to\nenter into subsequent leases with other parties. The lessee could then jointly develop the separate leasehold estates as\nlong as there was a sharing of the royalties. The court concluded that the lessee had properly signed leases with other\nparties, which provided for a sharing of royalties. In describing the relationship between the plaintiff and the other\nlessors the court clearly distinguished this case from an earlier case n143 on the basis that in this case there was no\ntenancy in common formed by the lessee's exercise of the pooling clause, even when there was a pooling of the\nroyalties. n144 If there was no tenancy in common there could be no conveyance of royalty interests. The court\nemphasized the fact that only contractual rights were involved so that no cotenancy situation would exist. n145\n\nThe adoption of the cross-conveyance theory occurred in 1946 with Tanner v. Title Insurance & Trust Co. n146 A\ncommunity lease was the subject of the litigation in Tanner. In resolving the dispute between transferees of the original\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 7\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nlessors and the lessee regarding the right to pooled or apportioned royalties, the court made the following statement\nabout the nature of the pooled title that ensued from the signing of the community lease:\n\n           By executing the community lease, the respondents and each of the other lessors assigned or\n       conveyed to his colessors a percentage interest in all oil produced on his land by the lessee during the\n       continuance of the lease. The consideration for that transfer was the similar mutual assignments of the\n       other lessors. n147\n\nThe interest that was transferred to each of the colessors was distinct from the royalty interest that may have been\nretained by the lessor in production on his own premises. This view was followed in other cases that reiterated the\nconclusion that community leases or other forms of pooling or unitization agreements constitute a cross-conveyance of\nroyalty interests. n148\n\nThe Tanner rule was followed in another community lease case, Southern California Title Clearing Co. v. Laws. n149\nIn this case, the legal issue was whether all of the community lessors were indispensable parties to a lawsuit seeking\npartition of the lessors' interest. n150 The original community lease combined thirteen different tracts with thirteen\ndifferent owners. The partition suit was solely directed at the divided ownership of one of the lots. The owners of the\ntwelve remaining tracts were not joined. The court used the Tanner rationale to find that the act of executing a\ncommunity lease cross-conveyed royalty interests between the lessors. As such, a partition action seeking to terminate\nthe lease as to one of the tracts would also affect the other lessors who were owners of a fractional share of the royalty\ninterest in the tract where the partition was being sought. Under the California test for indispensable parties, they were\nindispensable because their ownership rights were being affected. n151\n\nDoubts about the commitment of the California courts to the cross-conveyance theory was raised by the case of LeBard\nv. Richfield Oil Corp., n152 although the facts of the case are unique. LeBard involved the very limited statutory\ncompulsory pooling laws that exist in California. n153 Under the statute at issue, when one acre or smaller parcels are\nlocated adjacent to existing leased parcels and certain other requirements are met these smaller parcels are deemed\nincluded within the lease, and the owner of the minerals is entitled to a proportionate share of the royalty payments.\nAfter the plaintiff's interest had been committed to the pooled unit, she sold her entire estate to the defendants or their\npredecessors in interest. She then claimed that the pooled royalties she was entitled to by virtue of the statutory\nforced-pooling were interests in gross and were not therefore transferred with the mineral estate conveyance. The court\nrejected that reading of the rights created by the statutory pooling procedure. Then the plaintiff argued that the statute in\neffect made her the equivalent of a community lessor, which, under the Tanner rule, would constitute a\ncross-conveyance of the royalty interests in the pooled unit. n154 While agreeing that the Tanner court adopted a\ncross-conveyance doctrine, this court attempted to limit the application of the doctrine by stating that it did \"not fit the\npattern established by Section 3608 for compensating owners who have been deprived of the right to recover oil and gas\nfrom their lands.\" n155 The court was correct in not making equivalent a voluntary community lease or pooling\nagreement and a compulsory pooling statute. In dealing with voluntary agreements, the courts are interpreting the\nlanguage of the agreements to ascertain the intent of the parties. Where the choice of contract or cross-conveyance\ntheories is expressly stated the court will enforce the language as written. n156 The Tanner rule merely states that where\nthe community lease or pooling or unitization agreement does not contain express language indicating a choice of\ntheories, the courts will find that a cross-conveyance of property interests has occurred. The Laws decision recognized\nthat the parties are free to make that choice but if they do not the Tanner rule will apply when the court said: \"Whether\nin any given agreement for unit development the Tanner rules will be applicable between the parties will depend on the\nterms of the agreement.\" n157\n\nBut in this case we are not dealing with voluntary agreements and the intent of the parties but with a question of\nstatutory interpretation. Here the court looked at the provisions of the compulsory pooling statute and determined that\nthe legislature had not intended to effect a cross-conveyance of property interests whenever the compulsory pooling\nprocess was used. This would be consistent with the general rule that actions of state conservation agencies, while\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 8\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\naffecting property interests, cannot convey or affect the title to property interests held by those who have been brought\ninto the regulatory process.\n\n     [b] Illinois\n\nIllinois has shown some support for the cross-conveyance theory in a case involving the joinder of indispensable parties.\nIn Ragsdale v. Superior Oil Co., n158 the plaintiffs claimed that the operator of a pooled unit that had included the\nplaintiffs' lands had committed tortious acts including trespass, wrongful entry, and conversion. The unit contained 37\nworking-interest owners and 140 royalty-interest owners. None but the unit operator was named in the suit. The\nintermediate appellate court had found that those parties were not indispensable without opting for the contract theory.\nn159 The Illinois Supreme Court reversed and found that the action should be dismissed for failure to join indispensable\nparties. The rationale for that result is not as clear as it could have been had the court simply adopted the\ncross-conveyance theory as the one applicable in Illinois. After describing the usual effects of unitization, the court\nsimply concluded that a judgment for the plaintiff in this case would by definition adversely impact all of the other\nowners. The court concluded:\n\n            The oil produced is pooled, regardless of the separate tracts upon which the wells are located and\n       from which the oil is produced. They all share in the oil produced, saved and sold in the proportion\n       which each owner's tract bears to the entire unitized tract. For all practical purposes the same situation\n       exists as though there was a single owner-lessor and a single lessee ... . Assuming that the well, or even\n       one of several, is on the tract in question and title failed. The production would belong to the successful\n       litigant rather than to the record owners. The unitized tract would be broken and every party owning an\n       interest in it would be adversely affected. n160\n\nWhile consistent with the cross-conveyance theory, the Illinois court properly refused to allow the choice of theory to\naffect the determination of who are indispensable parties. Under either theory it could be argued that the non-joined\nparties' interests would be substantially affected by the removal of the Ragsdale tract from the unit. If the lessee would\nlose this case and be forced off of the tract, other interests might be terminated or otherwise affected. The analysis\ncorrectly focused on the legal and practical impacts of the litigation and not on the choice of theory.\n\n     [c] Mississippi\n\nMississippi, as a general matter, follows fairly closely the oil and gas jurisprudence of the Texas courts. It would thus\nnot be surprising if Mississippi followed the lead of Texas and adopted the cross-conveyance theory. The limited case\nlaw does suggest that result, although there is no clear indication in any Mississippi case that it has opted for the\ncross-conveyance doctrine. n161 In Merrill Engineering Co. v. Capital National Bank, n162 the main issue was\nwhether a royalty interest was realty or personalty such that when the owner of a royalty transferred his realty his\nroyalty interest was also conveyed. The answer was clearly yes, but the answer was made more difficult because the\nlessor's interest had been pooled with adjacent tract owners pursuant to a pooling agreement. While only tangentially\ninvolving a cross-conveyance or contract issue, the court's repeated emphasis that both the pre-pooling and post-pooling\nroyalty interests were realty lends support to the idea that those interests were conveyed to the parties who executed the\npooling agreement.\n\nA federal case applying Mississippi law, Hudson v. Newell, n163 found that Mississippi would follow the\ncross-conveyance theory. Again, the issue related to indispensable parties to litigation involving interests which had\nbeen committed to a unitization agreement. The plaintiffs sought to quiet title in themselves because certain transfers\nhad been executed by a life tenant without the joinder of the remaindermen. After one of those transfers, a lease of the\nminerals had taken place and a unitization agreement was executed pursuant to the lease. The court saw the issue quite\nplainly. If the unitization agreement constituted a cross-conveyance of royalty interests, no litigation could occur unless\nall royalty owners within the unit were joined, since their interests would be affected. Noting the close ties between\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 9\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nTexas and Mississippi oil and gas law the Fifth Circuit resolved the issue as follows:\n\n            The district judge held that in Mississippi the oil in place is, as in Texas, conveyed by oil leases,\n       royalty sales, and other formal recorded contracts, and that a unitization contract vests joint ownership\n       jointly in all the unitized reserves in place and in the royalty oil produced from the well, citing Veal v.\n       Thomason, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3938167\"><a href=\"/opinion/4170896/veal-v-thomason/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3938167\"><a href=\"/opinion/4170896/veal-v-thomason/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> . While no Mississippi authorities on point are cited, we\n       believe this to be correct, so that all these owners must be parties, or the unitized lands must be excluded\n       from any decree. n164\n\nThe finding that a cross-conveyance occurs requires the conclusion that the other royalty owners are indispensable\nparties to a lawsuit relating to the title of one of the royalty owners. As was discussed earlier in § 19.01[2][a][ii], on\nrehearing, the Fifth Circuit eventually held that the non-joined royalty owners were not indispensable after the plaintiffs\nfiled affidavits disclaiming any intent to interfere with the unitization agreements executed by the defendants to the\nlitigation. n165\n\n     [d] Texas\n\nTexas has been the state where the choice of the cross conveyance theory has had the most influence. While not the first\ncase to adopt the cross conveyance theory, Veal v. Thomason n166 is perhaps the most oft-cited and important decision,\nwhich has clearly placed Texas among those states that follow the cross-conveyancing theory. Veal involved a\ncommunity lease where the plaintiff was challenging the title of one of the community lessors. The plaintiff only served\nthe community lessors whose title he was directly attacking, failing to serve the community lessee and the remaining\ncommunity lessors. The defendants argued that the suit had to be dismissed for failing to join indispensable parties. In\nfinding that the non-joined parties were indispensable the court made the following statement:\n\n            To our minds, when we look to the substance and intent of this lease contract as a whole, the\n       above-recited provisions can have no effect other than to constitute all the lessors of land in the unitized\n       block joint owners, or joint tenants, of all royalties reserved in each of the several leases in such block,\n       the ownership being in proportion which the acreage of the unitized block. n167\n\nRegardless of the choice of theories, the non-joined parties were indispensable because the plaintiffs were seeking to\nterminate the relationship between their alleged mineral interest and the community lease.\n\nShortly after Veal the court was faced with the same indispensable party issue where the plaintiffs were not seeking to\nterminate the relationship with the community leasehold interests but were merely seeking to substitute themselves for\nthe defendants as the proper royalty owners. In Belt v. Texas Co., n168 the same community lease that was litigated in\nVeal was before the court. The court refused to distinguish Veal on the different relief sought, instead opting to apply\nthe cross-conveyance theory to all interests created by a community lease. Once the court applied the theory it was\ninescapable that the non-joined community lessors would be indispensable. n169\n\nThe Veal holding was followed in Brown v. Smith. n170 While Brown directly involved the right of the owner of the\nexecutive power to lease non-participating royalty interests, the court in discussing the rights of the non-executive\nowner clearly embraced the cross-conveyance theory as the one that best describes the nature of the unitized title. n171\nIn finding that the executive did not possess the power to pool the interests reserved to the non-executive through a\ncommunity lease, the court described the consequences of executing a community lease as follows:\n\n            An oil and gas lease jointly executed by the owners of two or more tracts of land owned in severalty,\n       with provision for pooling or sharing, on the basis of acreage, the royalties from oil or gas produced\n       anywhere on the leased land, has the effect of vesting all of the lessors, at least during the life of the\n       lease, \"with joint ownership of the royalty earned from all the land in such block.\" Veal v. Thomason,\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3938167\"><a href=\"/opinion/4170896/veal-v-thomason/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3938167\"><a href=\"/opinion/4170896/veal-v-thomason/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476 . The lease so executed is a conveyance by each lessor to each of\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 10\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n       the other lessors of an undivided interest in the royalties. n172\n\nSince the non-executive had not joined in the community lease, she did not convey her interest to the community. The\nexecutive did not possess the power to convey that interest without her further consent. She could not be divested of her\nfull interest, nor could she receive the interests from the other royalty owners unless she joined in the lease. n173\n\nThe first Texas case extending the cross-conveyance doctrine to a pooling agreement was Miles v. Amerada Petroleum\nCorp. n174 The court followed the Veal holding that an exercise of the power by a lessee was a conveyance or\nexchange of a part of the lessor's royalty interest for a part of the interests of other royalty owners who were included in\nthe pooled unit. n175 Later Texas cases have applied the cross-conveyance theory in other contexts. n175.1 For\nexample, in Renwar Oil Corp. v. Lancaster, n176 the plaintiffs sought to interpret a survey so that it would include their\nlands within a lease that had a producing well located thereon. The procedural issue raised related to the proper venue\nfor the action. The suit was filed in Dallas County although the land itself was located in Nueces County. The defendant\nobjected to the trial court's jurisdiction through a properly filed plea of privilege asserting that the lawsuit was one that\nrelated to the recovery of land, which under the then existing venue statute had to be filed in the district court for the\ncounty where the land is located. The action, while sounding in contract, was affected by Veal because the interest being\nlitigated had been pooled. Since the plaintiffs sought to have the pooling terminated as to their claimed interest because\nthey never agreed to the pooling, the court concluded that Veal was applicable. The survey interpretation sought by the\nplaintiff would change the nature of the ownership of the other royalty owners who had received a cross-conveyance of\nthe contested interest; under the Veal rationale they granted to others a proportionate share of their reserved royalty\ninterest. The court concluded:\n\n            In addition plaintiffs seek an adjudication that certain unitization agreements are void and ineffective\n       as to them. Since these agreements are essentially a conveyance of an interest in realty, Veal v.\n       Thomason ... , this constitutes an effort to remove cloud from title, even though alleged as an effort to\n       construe a contract. n177\n\nThe Court of Civil Appeals decision in Minchen v. Fields, n178 which confirmed the holding in Brown v. Smith n179\nthat the executive cannot pool, or authorize the lessee to pool, non-executive interests used the cross-conveyance theory\nto support that result. The court stated:\n\n            The reason of the rule is that where mere executive rights are conferred or reserved, there is no\n       intention evidenced to vest authority to convey a royalty interest reserved or the royalty interest\n       attributable to the minerals leased and to hold that such holder can unitize or pool the interest would\n       allow him to convey such royalty interest because a unitization of the royalty and minerals under\n       different tracts effects a cross-conveyance to the owners of minerals under the various tracts of royalty or\n       minerals so that they all own undivided interests under the unitized tract in the proportion their\n       contribution bears to the unitized tract. n180\n\nThe adoption of either the cross-conveyance or contract doctrine is irrelevant in resolving the pooling power question.\nThe major issue in determining if the non-executive's interest can be pooled should be one of intent, or more precisely,\npresumed intent of the parties since they have not expressed their intent through the relevant documents. That issue\nshould not be affected by the categorization of a pooling or unitization agreement as a contract or cross-conveyance.\nThe lessee can or cannot pool based on the intent of the parties as expressed in the instruments creating the\nnon-executive interests. The fact that the pooling would, if effective, transfer property interests or merely create\ncontractual rights should not affect the determination of the intent of the parties creating the non-executive interests.\n\nThe consequences of choosing between the cross-conveyance and contract theories also affect ancillary matters such as\njoinder problems, the Rule Against Perpetuities, and the Statute of Frauds. n181 The option does not, and should not,\neffect the basic impact of the pooling or unitization decision, which is to provide a sharing of risks, benefits and costs\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 11\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\namong the various owners within the pooled unit or unitized area.\n\nThe cross-conveyance theory was also reaffirmed in dictum in Texaco, Inc. v. Letterman, n182 a case involving the\nexercise of a leasehold pooling clause. The major issue was whether a pooling clause could be exercised a second time,\nafter the original pooled unit had been abandoned. The court concluded that the lessee could pool the lessor's royalty\ninterest so long as the lease was still alive. In dictum, however, the court suggested that if the court had held that the\nlessee could not have exercised his pooling power after the initial pooled unit had been abandoned the attack on the later\nexercises of the pooling clause would have had to have been dismissed for failure to join necessary and indispensable\nparties, the other pooled royalty owners in those units. n183\n\nIn Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v. Sheppard, n183.1 the court effectively reaffirmed the continued adherence to the\ncross-conveyance theory as it relates to a voluntary pooling created under a leasehold pooling clause, despite the\npooling clause stating \"Pooling hereunder shall not constitute a cross-conveyance of interests.\" The Texas Supreme\nCourt ruled that the effectiveness of the pooling by the lessee continued even after the termination of the lease. Thus the\npossibility of reverter had been committed to the unit by the lessee. The lessee, the court found, was empowered to\ncommit the lessor's interests for a period longer than it committed its own interest.\n\nThe merging of the cross-conveyance doctrine with other rules or canons affecting interpretation of mineral deeds has\ncaused some problems. In Kelln v. Brownlee, n184 the Kellns owned the equivalent of 151 undivided acres in Section\n59. They leased the entire 640 acres even though they only owned that lesser amount. The lease contained a pooling\nclause that was exercised to pool all of the interests in Section 59. The Kellns then transferred certain undivided\ninterests in Section 59 subject to the lease, and the grantees sought an apportioned share of the royalties based on the\ncross-conveyance theory. The court found that the royalty interests that the Kellns received by virtue of the pooling\nagreement were transferred to the grantees under the doctrine of after-acquired title in order to make the grantees whole.\nThe grantees were entitled to the benefit of the pooling agreement because their interest was transferred subject to the\nlease.\n\nThere are only a few cases that depart from the cross-conveyance theory. In Sohio Petroleum Co. v. Jurek n185 the\nplaintiffs claimed that a constructive or resulting trust should be placed on an undivided mineral interest that had been\nleased and then placed into a voluntary pooled unit. The mineral interest had been purchased with funds that were to be\nshared between the plaintiff's children and their mother. The defendants asserted that the cross-conveyance was\napplicable, and since none of the other royalty owners within the pooled unit were joined the suit had to be dismissed\nfor failing to join necessary parties. Rather than blindly applying the cross-conveyance theory, the court could have seen\nwhether the non-joined parties' interests would be affected by the litigation. It is not likely that they would be affected\nsince the plaintiffs were seeking merely to have their ownership interest recognized. There was no suggestion that they\nsought to terminate either the lease or the pooling agreement. n186\n\nThere is no way to reconcile Jurek with Veal. Other Texas cases have followed Jurek and not found non-joined pooled\nor unitized owners indispensable parties in actions where the relief sought is not the termination of the interest's\nparticipation in the pooled or unitized development. n187 Thus some courts have recognized the fact that not all\nlitigation involving owners of pooled or unitized interests affects the other owners. n187.1\n\nNot all forms of joint or cooperative development necessarily invoke the Veal rule. In Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Exxon\nCorp., n188 the Court of Civil Appeals found that there was no cross-conveyance of natural gas pursuant to the terms\nof a joint operating agreement. Several oil companies, including the plaintiff and the defendant, entered into a series of\njoint operating agreements to expand an existing gasoline plant and construct additional gas gathering facilities. The\nparties agreed to allocate ownership of the plant and the extracted products in proportion to the ownership interest in the\ngas reserves in the field. The plaintiff's reserves were produced faster than the defendant's, but it was only allocated its\nproportionate share of the reserves originally held. At that time, the defendant sought to exercise a termination clause in\nthe contracts and execute a new contract that had terms very unfavorable to the plaintiff. One of the theories proffered\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 12\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nby the plaintiff to avoid the express terms of the termination clause was that the original contracts had in effect\nconstituted a cross-conveyance of the gas in place, analogous to a pooling or unitization agreement. Once conveyed, the\nplaintiff's interest in the remaining reserves could not be diminished without its express consent. While admitting that\ngas reserves are realty under Texas law and therefore capable of being conveyed, the Court of Civil Appeals agreed\nwith the trial judge that the contracts in question did not evince an intent to cross-convey those reserves. In looking at\nthe instrument as a whole, the court could not find express words of grant, nor could it find an adequate description of\nthe subject matter of the deed. No mention is made of the Veal doctrine that essentially presumes an intent to convey\nfrom the language of a community lease or a pooling or unitization agreement, which usually does not contain express\norders of grant either. Nonetheless, the result in Atlantic Richfield shows that the cross-conveyance theory will not be\nblindly followed when there is clearly no intent to convey a mineral or royalty interest. While community leases,\npooling clauses, and pooling and unitization agreements create a presumed intent to cross-convey, joint operating\nagreements between lessees do not. The Texas Supreme Court did not disturb the finding of the Court of Civil Appeals\nthat no cross-conveyance took place. It reversed the lower court's application of an implied covenant to the agreement\nsince it determined that express covenants governed the parties' relationship, preempting the use of implied covenants.\n\nWhile joint operating agreements may not necessarily invoke the cross-conveyance doctrine, that is not to say that such\nagreements do not create a cotenancy relationship between the working interest owners. A number of Texas cases\nreinforce the view that the working interest owners are co-tenants. n188.1\n\nA second case that distinguished Veal raises some interesting questions. In Puckett v. First City National Bank of\nMidland, n189 the lessor's royalty interest was pooled by the lessee into two separate gas production units. Gas from\nboth units was subject to split stream sales, some being sold at higher intrastate prices, and some at lower interstate\nprices. The weighted average sale price of plaintiff's lease was lower than the other lessee's overall weighted average\nsale price. Nonetheless, the plaintiff was receiving a royalty in excess of the sales price attributed to his acreage.\nLanguage in the lease and the division order as well as language in the operating agreement evinced an intent to pay the\nplaintiff based upon on the price received for the gas produced that was allocated to his tract. One of the arguments\nraised by the plaintiff was that the pooling agreement cross-conveyed the respective royalty interests under Veal so that\nthe plaintiff was entitled to the overall weighted average of all sales from both units. The court dismissed this argument\nby stating that Veal dealt with indispensable parties and not the calculation of royalties from split stream gas sales out of\na pooled unit. The better explanation offered by the court was that the parties' express language regarding the allocation\nof royalty evinced an intent not to effect a cross-conveyance as to payments of unitized royalty. n190\n\nIn Parker v. HNG Oil Co., n190.1 the cross conveyance theory was apparently ignored in a situation in which it\notherwise might have applied. A lease had been executed in 1973 covering approximately 93 acres. Almost 24 acres\nwere committed to an oil unit where there was an existing producing well. The original lessee assigned the lease,\nretaining an overriding royalty. In 1982 the lessors sought a release of the lease as to all non-pooled acreage. HNG\nmistakenly issued a release covering the entire 93 acres while other working interest owners only released the acreage\noutside of the pooled unit. The lessors brought this action to have HNG's affidavit claiming an interest in the 24 acres\ninside the pooled unit removed from the county records as a cloud on its title. HNG counterclaimed seeking reformation\nof the release. Neither litigant would be interested in having the lawsuit dismissed for lack of joinder of indispensable\nparties. The lessors wanted to have the affidavit removed from the title records, and the lessee wanted to quiet title and\nreform the written release instrument. While the status quo may have favored the lessee's position, undoubtedly it\nwanted the title issue resolved rather than wait for a new lawsuit to be filed.\n\nSince this litigation involves title to a pooled interest, Veal would seemingly be applicable and if followed, would\nrequire that all of the other working interest owners in the pooled unit be joined as indispensable parties. Apparently,\nneither of these two parties raised the issue given the nature of the dispute, so the court did not deal with the Veal\nrequirement of joining all of the other pooled unit owners. On the merits, the case was resolved in favor of HNG since it\nmet the two pronged test for reformation of a written instrument, to wit, the true agreement of the parties is shown and\nthe provision was erroneously entered by mutual mistake.\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 13\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n\nThe unexplored issue of indispensable parties and the Veal cross conveyance rule raise some interesting questions. It is\nclear that the owners of the pooled unit production, and more specifically, the assignee of HNG's leasehold interest,\nhave an interest in the outcome of the litigation. The overriding royalty amounted to 30% of all oil and gas produced\nafter lessor royalties were paid. Why the original lessors wanted to terminate the interest was unclear. Their landowner\nroyalty was unaffected by the override. But the assignee who was obligated to pay the override was clearly an\ninterested, and probably an indispensable, party since it was out of their share that the override was being taken. The\nother working interest owners in the pooled unit would have been greatly affected by the litigation if they were sharing\nthe cost of the override. They were still interested since if the lease was terminated, in theory an unleased mineral owner\nwould now be part of the mix of owners. Since the well was off of the leasehold acreage, it can be presumed that the\nlessors would ratify the pooling, otherwise they would lose the right to share in the production from the pooled unit\nwell.\n\n     [3] Undecided States\n\n     [a] Louisiana\n\nThe early Louisiana decisions would support the cross-conveyance theory, but more recent decisions suggest Louisiana\nwould be more properly considered a contract theory state. In Martel v. A. Veeder Co., n191 the court in dictum stated\nthat if the instruments had been effective to pool the royalty interests, then an exchange of those mineral rights would\nhave occurred. Since the court had found that the instruments did not constitute a community lease, the discussion on a\npossible cross-conveyance was dictum. n192\n\nA clearer statement opting for the cross-conveyance doctrine was made in Coyle v. North American Oil Consolidated.\nn193 The issue was clearer because the necessary and indispensable party doctrine was involved in the decision. The\nplaintiff used an abandonment theory in seeking to cancel a lease as to certain formations. The trial court found no\nabandonment was proven, partially on the basis that the evidence was not clear that there was more than one producing\nsand. However, the court said that even if the trial court had determined that there had been an abandonment of one of\nthe horizons, it would have been powerless to order the lease canceled because that acreage had been pooled, and the\nother royalty owners were not served as defendants in the lawsuit. n194 The case was remanded for reconsideration of\nthe abandonment evidence for one of the formations, with the requirement that all parties to the pooling agreement be\njoined so that the plaintiff's attempt to terminate the pooling agreement for his claimed interest could be adjudicated. On\na motion for rehearing both the plaintiffs and defendants argued that it was not necessary to serve all of the other\nroyalty-and working-interest owners. The court refused to repudiate the language of its original opinion regarding the\nnecessity to join those parties, but it otherwise found that the parties to the lease never intended to treat the separate\nhorizons as segregated portions of the lease, which could be individually abandoned. The choice of the\ncross-conveyance theory was not clearly decided because of the presence of an alternative rationale for the decision.\n\nThe clearest statement by a Louisiana court that it has opted for the cross-conveyance doctrine came in Vizier v.\nHoward. n195 The plaintiffs owned several non-contiguous tracts that they alleged had been included in a community\nlease that entailed approximately thirty additional tracts of land. The plaintiffs were seeking an accounting for unpaid\nroyalties and an order terminating the lease. The trial judge issued a preliminary order requiring the plaintiff to join the\nowners from the thirty additional tracts or face dismissal of the lawsuit. The plaintiffs responded by attempting to\nconvert their lawsuit into a class action representing all of the royalty owners in the communitized leasehold area. That\nwas held by the trial court to be insufficient, and the judge dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals accepted\nwithout question the propriety of the preliminary order demanding that all communitized lessors be joined. Its opinion\nwas solely concerned with the legitimacy of the class action sought by the plaintiffs. Obviously, the Court of Appeals\nagreed that the communitized lessors are either necessary or indispensable, which lends support to the adoption of the\ncross-conveyance theory for community leases. The opinion, however, cites no cases to support the view that Louisiana\nhas opted for that theory.\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 14\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n\nTwo later cases, however, suggest that Louisiana is either opting for a contract theory or is making the determination of\nwhether the non-joined parties are indispensable on the merits of each case, without regard for either of the contract or\ncross-conveyance theories. In Melancon v. Texas Co., n196 the lessor sought cancellation of a lease when the lessee,\nwho was apparently trying to coerce the lessor to approve a pooling or unitization agreement, withheld royalty\npayments that were properly due and owing. The lease contained a pooling clause with limited pooling to 40 acres. The\nclause was exercised, a pooled unit was created, and a producing well was placed on the unit. However, the lessee\nwanted the lessor to agree to a revision of the unit that would be larger than that authorized by the pooling clause. Other\nroyalty interest owners were joined as parties defendant. The court recognizes that those other owners were necessary\nparties and, if not joined, the suit could not continue. n197 The court did not state if it was adopting either a contract or\ncross-conveyance theory, but regardless of the choice of theories the other royalty owners would be affected by the\noutcome of the litigation, because the plaintiff was seeking to terminate both the lease and the pooling.\n\nIn Mallett v. Union Oil & Gas Corp. of Louisiana, n198 the plaintiff was seeking to terminate the lease in question\nbecause of a lack of production at the end of the primary term. The lease contained a pooling clause, and near the end of\nthe primary term the lessee pooled part of the plaintiff's acreage with adjacent acreage that already had a producing well\nlocated thereon. The court determined that the pooling clause only contemplated pooling with undeveloped lands, and\ntherefore the pooling that was accomplished was beyond the lessee's authority. n199 If the cross-conveyance theory was\napplied, then the other royalty owners in the pooled unit would be indispensable parties. There was no indication in the\nopinion that the other owners were joined. The lessee apparently chose not to argue the cross-conveyance theory as a\nmeans of having the plaintiff's complaint dismissed.\n\n     [b] Montana\n\nMontana, like Louisiana, has reached some inconclusive results in several cases regarding the application of the\ncross-conveyance or contract theories. In Toomey v. State Board of Land Commissioners, n200 the plaintiff taxpayer\nsought to enjoin the state from entering into a unitization agreement that would pool state lands with private lands. The\nplaintiff urged, among other arguments, that the unitization would effectively cross-convey a fractional royalty interest\nfrom the state to the other private unitization owners, which would violate a restriction against the barter of public\nlands. The court rejected the argument but stated that the reason for the rejection was the fact that ownership of the gas\nwas an incorporeal interest subject to the rule of capture. Since the state did not own the gas in place, there was no\nbarter. While that argument may not be persuasive, one possible explanation of the holding is that the court did not\nbelieve the state was conveying its royalty interest by virtue of executing a unitization agreement. n201\n\nIn Nadeau v. Texas Co., n202 a similar inference could be reached from a small part of a decision that relied on other\ngrounds to reach its result. The plaintiff and defendant were rival claimants to oil and gas leases on the same land. The\ndefendant had apparently signed a pooling agreement, and the other parties to the agreement had not been joined. The\ncourt dismissed the argument that the non-joined parties were indispensable by simply concluding that the controversy\ndid not affect their rights but merely involved the validity of the lease. That conclusion is clearly erroneous since if the\ndefendant lost, the other parties who agreed to pool their interests and apportion their royalties would have their\ninterests substantially changed by the removal of the leased lands from the pooled unit. Again, no direct mention was\nmade to the contract or cross-conveyance theories, and the point was the last of many that the court rejected in finding\nfor the plaintiff. n203\n\nFinally, in a Ninth Circuit decision ostensibly applying Montana law, the court developed at least four different answers\nto the question of why unitized royalty owners were not necessary or indispensable parties to a lawsuit when a lessor\nsought to invalidate a lease that had previously been committed to the unit. The case of Stumpf v. Fidelity Gas Co. n204\nis a practitioner's nightmare and a law professor's dream. The facts were relatively simple. The plaintiff claimed that the\nlease he originally executed to the defendant had terminated for lack of production at the end of the primary term. Due\nto alleged fraud by the lessee, the plaintiff did not complain about the termination of the lease until well after the\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 15\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nprimary term had expired. In the meantime the defendant lessee had, pursuant to a leasehold pooling clause, entered into\na pooling agreement with another lessee who became the operator of the unit.\n\nThe defendant alleged that the suit must be dismissed because the plaintiff had not joined any of the pooled royalty\nowners who, he claimed, were indispensable parties. The court rejected that argument but the precise reason for the\nrejection is difficult to discern. The court seemingly rejects the Veal cross-conveyance doctrine, which it discusses at\ngreat length. However, the rejection of Veal may in part be based on the fact that Veal involved a community lease, and\nthis case involved a pooling clause and pooling agreement. A second explanation is that the court is applying the\nNadeau rationale that litigation between a lessor and lessee has no effect whatsoever on the other pooled royalty\nowners. As discussed earlier, the argument also lacks much merit. n205 On rehearing, the court realized that the\ntermination of the lease would affect the non-joined owners, because the modified opinion concluded that the\nunitization agreement could not be revoked by the plaintiff because the disputed interest was validly committed to the\nunit when the agreement was executed. n206 Under Erie, the court was required to apply the law of Montana. Nadeau\nand Toomey are both decisions of the Montana Supreme Court that must be applied by the federal court. They suggest\nthat pooling and unitization agreements are not cross-conveyances. Thus the court's analysis of Veal should have\nfocused on whether the Montana Supreme Court would follow Veal, rather than the results suggested by Nadeau and\nToomey.\n\nThe third explanation given by the court arises from the notice and demand clause contained in the lease. In the per\ncuriam opinion on rehearing the court for the first time suggested that the lessee's power to pool could not be terminated\nunless the lessor complied with the notice and demand provisions of the lease. But that misstates the law as it relates to\nthe termination of leases at the end of the primary term for lack of production. Montana, like most states, treats the\nhabendum clause of a lease as a common-law fee simple determinable estate. Thus, it automatically terminates at the\nend of the primary term unless there was production, or the terms of a savings provision (such as a continuous\noperations clause) were met. n207 Normally, a lessor does not have to send notice, and demand a cure to the problem of\nlack of production when the primary term has expired. n208 Thus, one should question the reasons presented by the\ncourt in its opinion on rehearing.\n\nA fourth explanation for finding the non-joined parties not indispensable was a specific provision of the unitization\nagreement that stated: \"That nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting or passing title to any lands, leases,\nor permits, but the Operator shall acquire operating rights only.\" n209\n\nFinally, the holding is also based on Hudson v. Newell, n210 where when the plaintiffs disclaimed any right to change\nthe nature of the unit agreement if they prevailed, the remaining royalty-and working-interest owners were held not to\nbe indispensable parties. n211\n\nThus, the state of the law in Montana is unclear at best. Since all three decisions applying Montana law refused to find\nthat pooled or unitized royalty owners were indispensable parties to litigation not directly involving the pooling or\nunitization agreement it might be inferred that Montana has in effect adopted a contract theory for unitized titles.\n\n     [c] Pennsylvania\n\nA very early case involving a coal lease suggests that Pennsylvania might follow a contract theory approach to the issue\nof the nature of the unitized title. In Coolbaugh v. Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., n212 a coal lease covered two\nadjacent lots, numbers 28 and 29. An apportionment of royalties clause was contained in the joint lease. Eventually Lot\n28 was sold, and the issue before the court was whether the grantor retained any share of the apportioned royalties from\nLot 29 production. The court answered the question in the negative and suggested that the joint lease did not affect the\n\"estates\" of the individuals who contributed to the lease. The court suggested that the \"titles remained distinct as they\nwere before ... .\" n213 Though it is weak authority, it again suggests that the court would not treat the signing of a\ncommunity lease as a transfer of estates between the joint signers.\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 16\n                              2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n(n1)Footnote 101.

Amis\ninvolved the general validity of a municipal compulsory pooling statute. The Oklahoma City ordinance authorized its\nBoard of Adjustment to force-pool mineral and/or royalty interests before it would authorize the issuance of a drilling\npermit. While having no trouble upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance, the court added the following\nlanguage regarding the effect of the ordinance on the title of the parties who were force-pooled:\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 17\n                             2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\n           Here the city created the relationship as it now exists between the parties ... . The relationship in the\n       nature of a tenancy in common resulted merely as an incident to the application of the city's police\n       powers. The tenancy owes its existence to those powers and is entirely subject thereto. The parties cannot\n       successfully assert their common law rights as tenants in common, for such a tenancy did not exist.\n\n\n  90 P.2d at 939 .\n\n  Since tenancies in common require that a property interest be conveyed by one party to that party and another or to\ntwo other persons, the clear implication of the language cited above is that a pooling of mineral and/or royalty interests\ninvolves just such a conveyance.\n\n    (n10)Footnote 110.

The court was aware that both Texas and California had adopted a\ncross-conveyance theory for similar language in pooling or unitization agreements. It nonetheless rejected that approach\nfor the contract theory largely on the basis of the arguments presented by Leo Hoffman in his early work. L. Hoffman,\nVoluntary Pooling and Unitization (1954). Hoffman argued that the adoption of the cross-conveyance theory was\ndictum in the two major Texas cases embracing the concept. In addition, he supported the emphasis of the Oklahoma\nSupreme Court in its conclusion that parties who enter into pooling or unitization agreements do not intend to effect a\ncross-conveyance of their mineral or royalty interests. Hoffman, op cit. at 160. Finally, the court felt that the weight of\npersuasive authority favored adoption of the contract doctrine, although in its string citation of cases to support that\nconclusion the court includes some questionable authority.

Since the rights are\nappurtenant, only those who own the lands or interests contributed to the unit can claim an apportioned share of unit\nproduction. This would contrast with a finding that the rights created are in gross or personal to the contributing party,\nwhich would remain in the grantor unless expressly mentioned in a grant of the underlying interest, notwithstanding his\ntransfer of the contributed mineral or royalty interest. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Will.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">& Meyers, Oil & Gas Law 572.1 (1988).\n\n     (n22)Footnote 122. 350 P.2d at 974 . Lewis Mosburg, Jr., who wrote the Discussion Notes in this case, also opined\nthat it was the death of the cross-conveyance theory in Oklahoma.

The court did note that there was contrary authority principally in Texas and\nCalifornia and suggested that the Texas rule is different because Texas has adopted ownership-in-place theory for oil\nand gas. Such a rationale would not explain why California adopted the cross-conveyance theory, for it is a\nnon-ownership jurisdiction.

The plaintiff and defendants disputed the title to certain lands. The plaintiff claimed\nthrough a chain of title tracing back to a 1927 tax deed. The defendants' claim was based on a 1928 sheriff's deed and by\ntitle through adverse possession. Their allegations relating to adverse possession were supported by the defendants'\nexecution of a voluntary pooling agreement more than four years prior to the onset of this litigation. There had been\nproduction from a well on the unit but off of the disputed acreage. The evidence showed that the defendants were never\nin actual possession of the disputed acreage. The defendants' argument was that the pooling agreement and the\noff-acreage unit activities constituted constructive possession of the disputed lands. If the court had followed a\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 20\n                               2-19 The Law of Pooling and Unitization, 3rd Edition § 19.02\n\n\n\ncross-conveyance theory, one might be able to argue constructive possession since the defendants would have in effect\nconveyed a fractional share of the royalty interest in the lands described in the 1928 royalty deed.

The original lease had been executed by the mineral estate owners of\none parcel, but on the second parcel only half of the mineral estate was clearly leased. The other half of the second\nparcel was only leased by the life tenant. The remaindermen did not execute the lease. The plaintiff eventually acquired\nall of the interest in the second parcel and brought this quiet title action claiming that the lease of the half interest was\nvoid because the remaindermen were not joined, and it would thus constitute an act of waste. None of the owners of the\nfirst parcel was joined in the lawsuit. Without citing Tanner the court concluded that the owners of the interests in the\nfirst parcel were indispensable parties because the community lease effected a cross-conveyance of royalties between\nboth parcels that would be detrimentally affected by the plaintiff's quiet title action. The omitted parties would have had\na right to share in the royalties from leasehold production on the second parcel, and therefore no action seeking to\nterminate the second parcel lease could be brought unless all of the parties to the original community lease were joined.\n\n    (n55)Footnote 152.

The entire pooling or unitization agreement\nmight be rendered economically useless, and, should there be existing production, it is clear that the apportionment\nfractions would be different if the leasehold acreage was involved.

The Royalty Clause and Related Provisions\n\n§ 660 Classification of Royalty Interest as “In Gross” or as “Appurtenant”\nReference has been made elsewhere to a number of classifications applicable to royalty and other\nnonoperating interests in production. Thus for certain purposes it has been necessary to classify such\ninterests as realty or as personalty,1 as corporeal or incorporeal,2 or as principal or in-come.3\nClassification of shut-in royalty has been required for the purpose of ascertaining the person or persons\nentitled to the receipt thereof under some circumstances.4\n\nYet another classification problem has given rise to some difficulty, viz., whether a royalty interest\ncreated by a lease is in gross or is appurtenant to the lessor’s mineral interest. Specifically, where a\nlessor conveys his interest in the premises (or in the minerals therein) without specific mention of the\nroyalty interest arising under a previously executed lease, does such royalty interest pass with the\nconveyed interest?\nQuite infrequently this matter may be resolved by an express lease provision to the effect that the\nbenefits of the lessor under the lease shall be appurtenant to the land of the lessor.5 In other instances\nan express “subject-to” clause in the conveyance itself may make it clear that the conveyance is\nintended to cover and include the grantor’s benefits under the lease. We have discussed elsewhere\ncertain of the construction problems arising from the employment of this clause.6\nCurrent authority supports the position that a lessor’s lease benefits, including his royalty interest, are\nappurtenant to his mineral interest and pass with a conveyance of such mineral interest even though\n1\n    See §§ 212–214, supra.\n2\n    See §§ 208–211, supra.\n3\n    See §§ 512.2, 514.1, supra.\n\nThis problem of classification has arisen in a number of states by reason of constitutional or statutory provisions allocating various types\nof receipts from state-owned lands. See, e.g., State ex rel. Fatzer v. Board of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1398094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1398094/state-ex-rel-v-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1398094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1398094/state-ex-rel-v-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 O.&G.R. 1280\n(1954). The question here was whether bonus, rentals and royalties were “moneys derived from the sale of lands,” as that term was used\nin a statute allocating such moneys to a particular purpose. It was held that royalties were such moneys, but that bonus and rentals were\nnot.\n4\n    Morriss v.

In the partition of a larger\ntract, plaintiff’s predecessor in interest (the owner of a 1/5 undivided interest) received the 50-acre parcel involved in this action. The\npartition deed reserved coal and mining rights and provided that on the expiration of the existing oil and gas lease, the owner of each\npartitioned parcel would have leasing rights but the owners of the other partitioned parcels would share in the royalty on the basis of\ntheir interests prior to the partition. Plaintiff conveyed the 50-acre parcel to defendant by a deed reciting that it was subject to a provision\nin the partition deed with reference to leasing and development. In this declaratory judgment action, it was held that the deed from\nplaintiff to defendant conveyed plaintiff’s entire interest in the oil and gas within and under the 50-acre parcel, subject to the rights of\nother claimants under the partition deed to share in the royalty, but that the deed did not convey to defendant any royalty interest in the\nother four partitioned parcels. In other words, the court held that plaintiff’s interest in the royalty in the other four partitioned parcels\nwas not appurtenant to his interest in the parcel he received by the voluntary partition.\nIn McCall v.

The question may arise in this instance whether his royalty\ninterest in such other premises included within the unit (e.g., Whiteacre) is appurtenant to his interest\nin Blackacre so that it will pass by a conveyance of his interest in Blackacre. California authority is\nto the effect that the royalty interest in Whiteacre under these circumstances is in gross and will not\npass by a conveyance of Blackacre unless specially mentioned therein.11 The preferable view is to the\ncontrary, viz., that the royalty interest in production from Whiteacre is appurtenant to the lessor’s\ninterest in Blackacre and passes with a conveyance of Blackacre unless specially reserved from such\nconveyance.12 There is uncertainty in some states as to the applica-ble law on this matter.

Voluntary\nPooling and Unitization\n\n§ 929 Pooling or Unitization Agreement as Cross-Conveyance or Contract: Introduction\n\nStated in simplest terms, a pooling or unitization agreement authorizes the exploration and/or\ndevelopment of separate parcels of land as if there were a single owner thereof and provides for the\nallocation of the expenses and proceeds of such operations among the owners of interests in the several\nparcels. Thus, if the agreement affects Blackacre and Whiteacre, the owners of each tract will share in\nproduction on a basis specified in the agreement, whether such production is from Blackacre or\nWhiteacre.\n\nA number of cases and writers1 have raised the question whether a pooling or unitization agreement\nis a cross-conveyance of interests in land or is a mere contract; that is, does the agreement have the\neffect of conveying to the owner of Blackacre some interest in Whiteacre and of conveying to the\nowner of Whiteacre some interest in Blackacre, or does the agreement have the effect merely of giving\neach owner a contract right to share in the production from premises other than those he has\ncontributed to the agreement. Upon the answer to this question, a number of important consequences\nare said to depend. In the subsections which follow we indicate the consequences said to flow from\nthe answer given this question and the effect of lease provisions expressly negating any intent to effect\na cross-conveyance. Thereafter, we examine the case authority on the matter in a number of states.\n\n     § 929.1 Pooling or unitization agreement as cross-conveyance or contract: Consequences\nA number of important legal consequences have been said to turn upon the answer to the question\nwhether a pooling or unitization agreement effects a cross-conveyance of interests in the affected\npremises among the parties to the agreement or merely creates contract rights in such parties. The more\nimportant of these consequences sometimes viewed as turning upon this question relate to the\nfollowing matters:\n\n                                              [Indispensable parties to suit]\n\n(1) Indispensable parties to title or other suits involving premises included in a pooling or unitization\nagreement.\n\nThe problem of indispensable parties to litigation affecting land included in a pooling and unitization\nagreement has been discussed herein.1 For many years in Texas, the case of Veal v. Thomason,2\nestablished the proposition that a pooling or unitization agreement effects a cross-conveyance and that,\n1\n    See, e.g., the following:\n\nHoffman, Voluntary Pooling and Unitization 144–189 (1954) (strongly opposing the cross-conveyance theory);\n\nFrench and Elliott, “Legal Effect of Voluntary Pooling and Unitization: Theories and Party Practice,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

As was noted earlier, the Veal rule can have\na debilitating effect on the substantive rights of the parties. A change in the Texas Rules of Civil\nProcedure, however, has cast a doubt on the continuing validity of that part of the Veal rule that finds\nsuch parties indispensable. While not challenging the cross-conveyance doctrine, a recent Texas court\nof appeals decision refused to apply the necessary and indispensable party part of the Veal rule to a suit\nbrought by a royalty owner seeking to invalidate a pooling of its interest without requiring the joinder\nof all other pooled royalty owners.2.1\n\n                                                  [Consent to agreement]\n\n(2) Necessity of consent to a pooling or unitization agreement.\n\nThe theory that a pooling or unitization agreement effects a cross-conveyance of interests among the\nparties thereto was viewed in Brown v. Smith3 as requiring the joinder of royalty owners in a pooling\nor unitization agreement if such agreement was to be fully effective. The plaintiffs in this action sought\nto recover the bonus agreed to be paid for the execution of a unitized lease but plaintiffs had failed to\nobtain the joinder of the owner of a royalty interest in a 20-acre portion of the 62.75-acre tract covered\nby the lease. In holding that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover since the tendered lease did not\nmeasure up to the unitized lease contracted to be given, the court noted that without joinder of the\nroyalty owner, the lease would not divest the owner of her interest in the 20-acre tract nor vest in her\nany interest in the royalty in the 42.75 acres; as a result, the lessee’s freedom of operation on the\n62.75-acre tract would be materially affected. We discuss elsewhere herein (§§ 925–925.6 supra) the\nstate of authority regarding parties whose consent to a voluntary pooling or unitization agreement is\nnecessary. It suffices here to observe that the cross-conveyance theory is said to make necessary the\nconsent of all persons having operating or nonoperating interests in premises affected by a pooling or\nunitization agreement.4\n\n                                               [Conveyancing requirements]\n\n(3) Application of the statute of frauds or conveyancing statutes to voluntary pooling or unitization\nagreement.\n\nObviously if the cross-conveyance theory is followed, then a voluntary pooling or unitization\nagreement involves the conveyance of interests in land and the requirements of the statute of frauds\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n       Sabre Oil & Gas Corp. v.

Hoffman. He raises the possibility that should the owner of\na separate tract included in a unit conveyance convey such tract without mention of his rights in the\nunit agreement, such conveyance would not affect his interest in such other premises.12 In other words,\nif Blackacre is included in a pooling or unitization agreement affecting Blackacre and Whiteacre, a\nsubsequent conveyance of Blackacre which made no reference to the agreement would not convey the\ngrantor’s interest in royalty on pooled production from Whiteacre.\nAlthough mention of this suggestion must be made for purpose of completeness of discussion of\npossible impact of the cross-conveyance theory in various contexts, we must also emphasize our\ndisagreement with the suggestion itself. In our view the question is one of intent of the parties, not\nwhether pooling or unitization effects cross-conveyances. The court should give effect to a properly\nmanifested intent of the parties as to whether the grantor’s interest in unit production from Whiteacre\nis conveyed with Blackacre. But where the parties have failed adequately to manifest their intent in this\nregard, the question becomes one of judicially ascertained intent and, in our opinion, the courts should\nusually take the position that the grantor’s interest in unit production is included in a conveyance of\nthe premises he has committed to the unit. In other words, the interest of a party in unit production\nshould ordinarily be viewed as appurtenant to his interest in premises committed to the unit rather than\n“in gross.”13 Decisions on this matter do not appear to have been affected by the adoption or rejection\nof the cross-conveyance theory; thus, both in California and in Mississippi the cross-conveyance\ntheory appears to have been adopted, but the two states differ in answering the question whether a\nparty’s interest in unit production is appurtenant or in gross.14\n\n                                   [Operation of recordation statutes and bona fide\n\n                                                       purchaser doctrine]\n\n(7) Effect of pooling or unitization agreement upon prior unrecorded interests in affected lands.\n\nIf a pooling or unitization agreement is viewed as a conveyance it may be contended that execution\nof such an agreement brings into play doctrines relating to the operation of recordation statutes and the\n11\n     Renwar Oil Corp. v.

Thus, if subsequent to the creation of unrecorded legal or equitable\ninterests in Blackacre, the record title owner commits Blackacre to a pooling or unitization agreement,\nwill such unrecorded legal or equitable interests be defeated insofar as inconsistent with the interests\nof other parties claiming under the agreement? In Sohio Petroleum Co. v. Jurek,15 it was urged that by\nvirtue of the pooling of Blackacre, the lessors of other pooled tracts became the owners of undivided\ninterests in Blackacre, thereby cutting off the equitable interests of the plaintiffs therein under the bona\nfide purchaser doctrine. The court in this case refused to apply the cross-conveyance theory. This\nholding is contrary to the weight of Texas authority,16 but in the instant case it enabled the court to\navoid addressing itself to this issue. As indicated by a student note, the logic of the cross-conveyance\ntheory requires application of the bona fide purchaser doctrine and the recording statutes to pooling\nagreement.17\n\n                                                        [Tax consequences]\n\n(8) Tax treatment of participant in pooling or unitization agreement.\nThe characterization of a unit agreement is also of significance for federal tax purposes. One theory\nis that the unitization agreement effects a series of nontaxable exchanges and another is that no\nexchange of depletable properties takes place upon unitization but that the parties merely agree\ncontractually to devote their depletable properties to common use and to share in the common product.\nThe problem is discussed in the papers noted below.18 It suffices here to observe that the conclusion\nwhether a particular state has adopted the cross-conveyance or the contract theory as to the effect of\na pooling or unitization agreement should not be determinative of federal tax consequences.19\n\nIn Wyoming State Tax Commission v. BHP Petroleum Company,19.1 the court held that delinquent ad\nvalorem property taxes on mineral production could not be assessed and collected from the unit\noperator of a federal exploratory unit, as opposed to the working interest owners.

Peterson,2 for example,\nin holding that the Rule against Perpetuities was inapplicable to a pooling clause in an oil and gas\nlease, the court emphasized certain language in the pooling clause said to indicate that “the effect of\nunitization was to be only with respect to allocation of production and the computation of royalties and\nwas not to effect cross-transfers of royalty interests.”3 It further noted that the unitization agreement\nitself clearly provided that “[n]othing herein … shall be construed to transfer title to any land or to any\nlease or operating agreement.”4 And a distinguished writer on the law of unitization has essayed the\nfollowing conclusions:\n\n     “There can hardly be any objection in the law to such an express agreement that the pooling or\n     unitization shall not constitute an exchange or transfer of real property interests. Presumably such\n     a provision is valid and, therefore, effective for the purpose of nullifying any cross-conveyancing\n     which could otherwise result.”5\n\nThe authors hereof are not so sanguine on the matter. Although parties to an agreement may “make\ntheir own law” in many respects by contract, they may not do so for all purposes. If, for example,\napplication of the Rule against Perpetuities to a lease pooling clause or to a pooling or unitization\nagreement or if the question of indispensable parties in a title or other suit involving unitized premises\nturn upon whether the agreement effects a cross-conveyance or is a “mere” contract, it seems difficult\nto believe that a characterization given by the parties to their agreement will be effective to determine\nsuch important legal consequences.\nWilliams & Meyers, Oil and Gas Law\nCopyright 2014, Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., a member of the LexisNexis Group.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    See § 921.6, supra.\n2\n   Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

In General\n   The word \"royalty\" is a chameleon-hued term. It changes meaning with\nthe context in which it is used. As commonly understood, a royalty is a real\nproperty interest with two distinguishing characteristics. It is nonpossess01y\nand it is free of production and operating expenses. The owner of such an\ninterest has no right to explore, drill, or produce oil and gas; similarly, he\nnormally has no right to execute oil and gas leases. T he principal benefit\nconferr-ed by royalty ownership is the right to a fraction of oil, gas, or\nmineral production free of drilling, mining, and operating expenses. 287·1\n   This common understanding of the term \"royalty\" is correct in a general\nsense, but it is both underinclusive and overinclusive. It is underinclusive\nbecause it does not fully encompass all contexts in which the word is used.\nHybrid interests can be created. The separation of all possessory rights from\na mineral fee interest will not automatically transform it into a royalty, 288\nand, conversely, rights normally attached to a mineral fee interest, even\nincluding the right to patticipate in leases,289 can be attached to a royalty.\nMore commonly the royalty owner is given specified rights to use the\nsurface and subsurface or rights to share in lease benefits in addition to\nproduction. 290 Although instruments creating such interests almost invari-\nably create problems of interpretation and lead to litigation over whether the\ninterest is a royalty or a fractional interest in the mineral fee, 291 they are\nencountered with surprising frequency.\n   Additional ly, the word \"royalty\" is used in oil and gas leases and\n\n   287 1\n      ·   There is an exception for some overriding royalties carved from leases subject to a\njoint operating agreement.

The most co11Ullon example is shut-in royalties, which are\npayments made to maintain a lease where all wells have been shut in for Jack\nof a market. Minimum royalties and some forms of compensatory and in lieu\nroyalties may also not be tied entirely to production. 292 Royalty owners have\nargued that settlements between gas producers and purchasers over the\npurchasers' failure to take or pay for contracted amounts of production\nshould also be subject to royalty payments.293 The term has also been used\nto refer to a lessor 's share of oil or gas after they have been produced or to\nthe money payable to the lessor from the sale of such production. 294\n  The common understanding of royalty is overinclusive in that it encom-\npasses interests not usually referred to as royalties. For example, the owner\nof a production payment has a nonpossessory interest which entitles her to\nan expense-free share of production, but she is not usually considered to own\na \"royalty.\"\n   This section will attempt to describe the vruiety of interests that, either\nthrough common usage or by their nature, may fairly be considered forms of\nroyalty or closely related thereto. Its major focus will be on the traditional\nroyalty interests: the lessor's royalty, the royalty created by grant or\nreservation in a deed, and the overriding royalty carved from a working\ninterest. Except when otherwise indicated, the term \"royalty\" will be used in\naccordance with its commonly understood meaning.\n\n  B.       Types, Duration, and Size of Royalties\n   A royalty is usuaJly categorized in accordance with the transaction in\nwhich it was created. These are principally the execution of an oil and gas\nlease, the transfer of an interest in land by deed, and the assignment of all or\npart of a lessee's working interest. Regardless of how created, all such\nroyalties are interest in real property and are governed by the doctrines\napplicable to real property. 294.1\n\n\n   292\n       Refer to Sections 4.5(C) and (F) of this treatise, dealing with shut-in royalty and\nminimum royalty provisions.\n   293   This issue is discussed in Section 4.6(E)(4) of this treatise.\n   294\n         See Jones v.

They have evolved from common industry usage.\nAlthough widely used, the terminology has not been consistent over time or\nfrom location to location. Hence a draftsman who uses a term such as\n\"overriding royalty\" should be careful to define it rather than rely on\ncommon understanding within the industry.\n   In analyzing rights of royalty owners, Texas courts have tended to ignore\ndistinctions between types of royalties. Alameda Corp. v. Transamerican\nNatural Gas Corp. 295 and Condra v. Quinoco Petroleum, Inc. 2 9 6 are good\nexamples. The courts in both cases apparently assumed that the doctrines\narticulated were applicable to all types of royalty; for much of the judicial\nlanguage refers to lease royalty, even though the royalty claims were not\nbased on the royalty clause of an oil and gas lease. Alameda Corp. involved\na nonparticipating royalty and Condra involved an overriding royalty.\nBecause of this judicial approach, most of the discussion of the calculation\nand payment of lease royalties in Section 4.6 of this treatise is also\napplicable to nonparticipating and overriding royalties. It should be noted,\nhowever, that some issues, such as the lessee's ability to pool a royalty\nwithout first obtaining the express consent of the royalty owner, require a\nconsideration of the distinctions between the types of royalty and the context\nin which the royalty was created.296· 1 A lessee's right to pool royalties is\ntreated in Section 4.8.\n        1.   Tbe Landowner's Royalty\n   The most common transaction in which a royalty is created is probably the\nexecution of an oil and gas lease. The landowner who executes an oil and gas\nlease invariably retains a right to a specified fraction of gross production.\nThis royalty, which is frequently called a \"landowner's royalty,\" terminates\nwhen the lease terminates. This limitation on its duration has practical\nconsequences primarily in situations where the original lessor has trans-\nferred all or part of his landowner's royalty to another person, for the\ntransferee's interest will not outlast the lease.\n  The landowner's royalty varied considerably in size during the first two\n\n51 (Tex. 2007) (agreement to compensate geologist by conveying overriding royalty subject\nto the statute of frauds.)

Landowners' royalties that are larger than 1/8\nbecame increasingly common in oil and gas leases executed after the\nmid-1970s. It is unusual to find a lease executed within the last 20 years that\nprovides for a royalty of less than 1/6, and many now provide for a royalty\nof 115 or even 1/4. On state-owned lands the royalty is commonly set at 1/4.\n   The landowner's royalty is dealt with in detail in Chapter 4 of this treatise.\n        2.   The Nonparticipating Royalty\n   Royalties are also frequently created in deeds of real estate, by either grant\nor reservation. A royalty created in such a transaction is sometimes referred\nto as a \"nonparticipating royalty.\" 2 9 8 Its duration may be perpetual or, as\ndiscussed in Section 2.5 of this chapter, it may be limited to a defined period.\nA royalty owner's right to share in production accrues monthly as oil and gas\nare produced, and the statute of limitations begins to run when the owner\nreceives information that puts him on notice that there is production from or\nattributable to the land subject to his royalty. 299\n   The size of this type of royalty may be stated in two different ways. The\ndeed may either specify a stipulated fraction of gross production, such as\n1/16,300 or it may specify a fraction of the royalty reserved in an oil and gas\nlease. 301 The owner of a royalty stated as a set fraction of gross production\nwill be entitled to that fraction, regardless of the terms of any existing or\nfuture oil and gas lease.302 If, however, the interest creates a right to a\nfraction of royalty, the owner's share of production will vary with the size of\nthe royalty reserved in an oil and gas lease. Thus, the owner of a right to\n\"one-fourth of royalty\" will receive 1/32 of the gross production from a lease\nproviding for a l/8 royalty, but he will receive l/24 of the gross production\nfrom a lease providing for a 1/6 royalty.\n   An unfortunately common formulation combines these two basic methods\n\n  297\n       Compare Southern Oil Co. v.

An example is the\nreservation of \"an undivided one-half interest in and to all of the royalty that\nmay be payable under any and all oil and gas leases, by which royalty is\nmeant one-eighth of production.'' Language such as this, which clearly states\nthat the parties were thinking in terms of a 118 landowner's royalty, has the\neffect of limiting the royalty to the specified fraction of 1/8. Thus the grantor\nis entitled to only 1116 of the gross production, even though an oil and gas\nlease provides for a royalty larger than the standard 118.303 Variations on this\nlanguage often lead to litigation over the intent of the parties to the deed.sou\n  Regardless of size or the manner of describing the fractional interest, the\nowner of a nonparticipating royalty is limited to receiving a share of gross\nproduction. Other lease benefits, such as bonus and delay rentals, are not\nshared with the owner of a nonparticipating royalty unless the instrument\ncreating the royalty expressly provides for participation in these benefits.304\n       3.   The Overriding Royalty\n   The term \"overriding royalty\" has at least two, somewhat different\nmeanings. In earlier years it was occasionally used in referring to any portion\nof a landowner's royalty which exceeds 1/8. For example, the lease litigated\nin Martin v. Glass 305 provided for a 1/8 royalty and an additional \"overriding\nroyalty in the aggregate amount of 1132nd of 7/8ths of all oil, gas and other\nminerals saved, produced or sold from the premises.\" This use of \"overrid-\ning royalty'' is quite uncommon today, however, and the term is typically\nused in referring to a gross production interest created in a transaction\nbetween an oil and gas lessee and a person other than the landowner. Thus\nan oil and gas lessee may assign all or part of its leasehold interest and\nreserve an overriding royalty in any production obtained from the assigned\nacreage. In some instances, a condition may be attached to the overriding\nroyalty, such as a provision that if it is not paid within a specified period after\nproduction commences, the assignor has the right to terminate the assign-\nment.305·1\n  Alternatively, an overriding royalty may be carved out of the leasehold\n\n  303\n        See, e.g., Ray v.

There may be,\nfor example, confusion whether a 1/16 overriding royalty entitles its owner\nto 1/16 of total production or only 1116 of the production to which the lessee\nwas entitled, e.g., 1/16 of 7/8.\n  C.     Benefits Included in a Right to a Fraction \"of Royalty\"\n   Unless the word \"royalty\" is defined, a grant or reservation of a fraction\n\"of royalty\" may lead to disputes over the royalty owner's right to share in\na variety of lease benefits. The Texas courts have generally construed the\nword \"royalty\" when used in this context to mean payments from production\nwhich will continue throughout the life of an oil and gas lease. Hence, the\nowner of \"one-fourth of royalty\" will receive her stated fraction from all\nroyalty reserved in an oil and gas lease, even though the payments from\ngross production exceed one-eighth, which was the standard royalty\nthroughout much of the twentieth century, and are labeled \"excess royalty\"\nor \"bonus.\"307 This definition excludes from royalty a lease benefit payable\nfrom production which will terminate when a specified sum has been\nreceived. Such payments, commonly designated \"oil payments\" or \"produc-\ntion payments,\" are sometimes used to provide additional or deferred bonus\nmoney, and the owner of a fraction \"of royalty\" is not entitled to share\nthem.308\n   The Texas courts have frequently dealt with other lease benefits on an ad\nhoc basis, without express reference to a general definition. Thus a\n\"compensatory\" royalty that a lessee paid from production of a well draining\nthe leased tract in settlement of its obligation to drill an offset well was\ndeemed a royalty within the meaning of a prior deed which had conveyed a\nright to one-fourth \"of the oil royalty, gas royalty and royalty in casinghead\ngas, gasoline, and royalty in other minerals in and under, and that may be\nproduced and mined\" from the premises.309 The same treatment has been\naccorded \"minimum royalty,\" which is a sum payable under a lease clause\n\n  307\n      Griffith v.

Although one appellate court has\nindicated that the royalty owners would share in such payments,311 the\nlanguage was dictum, because that issue was not before the court.\nShut-in payments do not fall within the concept of payments based on\nproduction because they are expressly paid in lieu of production.\nMoreover, treating shut-in payments as royalty is arguably inconsistent\nwith the long line of cases holding that shut-in payments do not maintain\na term royalty interest beyond its initial specified term. 312\n\n          D. Interests Similar to Royalties\n     There are several types of interests in gross production that, although\nnot generally called royalties, are similar to them.\n     A \"production payment\" is a right to a specified fraction of\nproduction until a specified sum has been received. Occasionally the\nparties creating it may provide for its termination upon some other\nevent. 3l3 Because a production payment is almost always carved out of\nthe lessee's interest in an oil and gas lease, the terminating event must\nbe something other than lease termination, or the interest in production\nwill be classified as a royalty. 314 Like a royalty, it does not bear any of\nthe costs of drilling. completing, or operating the well. A production\npayment may be limited to certain categories of production, such as oil,\ngas well gas, or casinghead gas, and may be payable in kind rather than\nin cash. Such an interest may be given to a lessor as a means of providing\nhim with an additional bonus,315 to a lender as a means of repaying or\nproviding security for a loan, or to a person, such as a geologist, who has\nperformed services for the lessee and receives the production payment\nas compensation. It may also be consideration for the assignment of an\noil and gas lease.316\n\n\n\n\n     311. Id.\n     312. Archer County v.

It has\nsome similarity to a royalty in that its owner is not personally liable for\ndrilling or operating expenses. Unlike the royalty, however, it entitles\nits owner only to a share of profits after expenses have been paid. The\nmethod of computing net profits, lhe manner and time of payment, and\nlhe costs to be taken into account are determined by the instrument\ncreating the interest. Because the term \"net profits\" has no fixed legal\ndefinition, it is essential that the parties creating such an interest set out\nin detail the method for determining net profits. For example, they\nshould specify whether the owner is entitled to payment only after\ndrilling and completion costs have been recouped, or whether his\ninterest is subject only to operating expenses. In lieu of a definition, the\nparties may well have their rights determined by the same doctrines\nwhich are applicable to a cotenant who does not participate in leasing\nor developing. Such a co-owner has a form of net profits interest as a\nmatter of law, although he is more commonly spoken of as having a\ncarried interest.\n     The term \"carried interest\" is used in a variety of contexts. Such an\ninterest may arise by operation of law, as in the case of cotenants, or it\nmay arise through contractual agreement. The term is, therefore, only\ngenerally descriptive of any interest which entitles its owner to a\nspecified fraction of production, while not subjecting him to personal\nliability for certain expenses. The carrying party is responsible for lhose\nexpenses but is entitled to recoup them from the carried party's share of\nproduction. Unlike lhe net profits interest, which normally continues\nfor the duration of the underlying oil and gas lease, the carried interest\nterminates when the agreed-upon costs have been recouped by the\ncarrying party. At that point the carried interest is transformed into a\nfractiona l share of the working interest, and its owner is liable for costs\nand entitled to a share of production like other working interest owners.\nThus the point to which the interest is \"carried\" is crucial to a\ndetermination of the parties' rights and liabilities. This point will vary\nfrom agreement to agreement, but frequently the owner is carried either\n\"to the casing point,\" in which case he is not personally liable for the\ndrilling and testing costs but is subject to his proportionate share of\ncompletion and operating costs, or \"to the tanks or pipeline,\" in which\ncase he is freed from liability for virtually all expenses, including\noperating expenses. Joint operating agreements commonly include a\nprovision whereby a party who does not wish to commit funds for\nadditional wells may be carried to well completion but is not entitled to\nany share of production until the carrying parties have recovered some\nmultiple of the carried party's share of cost from his share of production.\nThis type of interest is sometimes referred to as a \"Manahan\" type of\n\n\n\n2-68                                           TEX.

Most of these disputes have arisen in the context\nof the landowner's royalty created by an oil and gas lease and are treated\nin Chapter 4 of this treatise.\n\n\n2.5.     TERM lNTERESTS\n\n     Royalty interests and interests in the mineral estate presumptively\nlast in perpetuity.331 Such interests may, however, be for a more limited\nduration. Term interests, whether created by grant or reservation, are\nquite common in Texas. The most typical term interest is for a specified\nperiod of time, such as five years, and so long thereafter as oil, gas, or\nother minerals are produced from the described lands. The interest\ncreated by such language normally terminates at the end of the specified\nperiod if there is no production at that time. If there is production, the\ninterest will extend beyond the specified period and terminate only\nwhen production terminates.\n\n         A. What Constitutes Production\n     Probably the most frequently litigated issue that arises under an\ninstrument creating a term interest is the meaning of \"production.\" In\nthe absence of language to the contrary in the instrument creating the\nterm interest, the payment of shut-in royalty under an oil and gas lease\ndoes not constitute \"production\" that will extend the term interest past\nits specified period.

Westwood Energy, Inc.,M a nonoperator bad signed an\nunrecorded operating agreement giving the operator a lien on the nonopera-\ntor's working interest to secure the payment of all sums due the operator.\nThe nonoperator subsequently borrowed money from MBank Abilene and\ngave the bank a deed of trust as security. When the nonoperator defaulted on\nhis obligation to pay his share of the operating expenses, the operator sued\nto foreclose its lien on the nonoperator's working interest. MBank, which\nwas made a party to the suit, alleged priority of its deed of trust over the\nunrecorded operator's lien. The court rejected MBank's argument on the\nground that the bank was deemed to have taken its lien with notice of the\npreexisting operator's lien. Under the rule of the Westland case, MBank was\non notice of every recital and reference in its chain of title, and recorded\nassignments of the nonoperator's working interest had contained references\nto the operating agreement.\n3.4 STANDARD RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND\n          CONSTRUCTIONAL PREFERENCES\n   Grants and reservations of mineral interests are frequently unclear. The\nlanguage used to describe the interest may be equally consistent with a\nroyalty and a mineral fee. The instrument may be silent on what substances\nare included in the term \"minerals.\" The size of the interest created may be\nthe subject of dispute. In resolving such issues, the parties' intent is\ndetermined, if possible, by considering the instrument as a whole. ''The\nprimary duty of the courts in interpreting a deed is to ascertain the intent of\nthe parties. But it is the intent of the parties as expressed within the four\ncomers of the instrument which controls.\"87 Unless there is an irreconcilable\nconflict, all provisions of an instrument will be given effect. Thus, apparently\ncontradictory and inconsistent language will be given a construction which\nhannonizes all provisions in the instrument.61\n\n  66  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485379\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485379/mbank-abilene-na-v-westwood-energy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

In Lesley v. ~terans Land Bd.,7 o.z the court rejected an argument\nthat a subdivision developer bad impliedly retained the exclusive executive\nright by making the deeds to the lots in the subdivision subject to a recorded\ncovenant prohibiting oil and gas development and bad thus stripped the\ngrantees of the right to execute oil and gas leases. Interests such as royalty\nand executive right that are appurtenant to the granted estate will pass to the\ngrantee even though they are not specifically mentioned in the deed. 70.3 The\ngeneral rule against implying grounds for forfeiture71 is a logical extension\nof this doctrine.\n   Of course the doctrine that all incidents of a mineral estate are transferred\n\n  89\n        Bruce M.

Traditional Language\n   The language used in a grant or reservation determines whether a mineral\nfee or a royalty bas been created The traditional language used to create a\nmineral fee is a reference to the oil, gas, and other minerals in, on, and under\nthe described land.11 Specific rights of ingress and egress and surface and\nsubsurface easements are also commonly included.82 Although most of these\nrights would be implied in favor of the mineral fee owner in any event,\nsetting them out specifically may accomplish three things. First, it makes\nmuch clearer the intent to create a mineral fee with its concomitant rights to\nexplore, drill, and produce. Second, it reduces the possibility of disputes\nwith the surface owner over the rights held by the mineral fee owner. The\nsurface owner is more likely to be convinced by written language than by an\nargument based on implied rights. Third, it gives the draftsman an\nopportunity to list specific rights which might not be implied in the mineral\nowner's favor or which are broader than implied rights.\n   A royalty is typically created simply by using the word ''royalty.\" Thus a\nlandowner may grant \"a 1116tb royalty\" or a right to \"1114tb of royalty,\" and\nin either event it is clear that the grantee will receive a fraction of gross\nproduction.u The same result can be accomplished by using the form of\nlanguage in Barker v. Levy, 14 where a deed granting a \"one/one hundred and\nsixtieth (l/160tb) part of all oil, petroleum, sulphur and all other minerals\nthat may be produced and saved\" was held to have unambiguously\ntransferred a royalty rather than an undivided interest in the mineral fee.\n   B.
