The FLRA specifically rejected the AFGE’s sole\nargument, which was that most of the money in the AWCF does\nnot consist of appropriated funds because the AWCF is in large\npart financed through collections from customers to whom\nTYAD sells services. Petitioner sought review.\n        Resolution of this issue turns on the definition of\nappropriated funds. The question of when agency funds are\ndefined as “appropriated” has important legal implications going\nto the heart of Congress’ power to control the financial activities\nand expenditures of the Executive Branch.\n        For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we determine\nthat AWCF’s money is properly considered appropriated funds,\nand we will affirm the decision of the FLRA.\n\n\n                                 2\n\f                                    I.\n\n        TYAD is the Defense Department’s largest full-service\nelectronic maintenance and repair facility, and is located in\nTobyhanna, Pennsylvania. Civilian employees are represented\nby AFGE. TYAD is financed by a defense working capital fund\n– the TYAD AWCF. Defense working capital funds like the\nAWCF are continually replenished with money paid by outside\nfederal agencies and private businesses for the purchase of\ndefense agency goods and services. Additionally, defense\nworking capital funds receive direct annual appropriations from\nCongress when required. See, e.g., National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, §\n302, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003).\n        In 2002, the union and TYAD management discussed a\nproposed amendment to their collective bargaining agreement\nthat would have provided for reimbursements of any\ndocumented financial losses suffered by an employee because of\na cancellation of annual leave. Under the proposal, an employee\nwhose leave was cancelled by TYAD would be reimbursed for\nforfeited airline tickets, hotel deposits, and the like. The\nproposal specifically suggested that the reimbursement would be\n“from other than appropriated funds.” This presumably referred\nto the assumption that AWCF revenues from services performed\nfor other agencies and businesses were not appropriated funds,\nand therefore not subject to the legal requirement that\n“[a]ppropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which\nthe appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by\nlaw.” 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a).\n        Ultimately, TYAD rejected the union proposal on the\nground that it was inconsistent with the law, because payment of\npersonal costs is not within the scope of TYAD’s authorized\nappropriations.1 The union appealed to the FLRA. Before the\nAuthority, the AFGE conceded that the statute governing the\nTYAD AWCF does not authorize using appropriated money to\nreimburse employees for personal expenses lost because of\n\n\n       1\n           Under 5 U.S.C. § 7117(a)(1), “the duty to bargain in good faith\n. . . [applies] to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law. . ..”\n\n                                    3\n\fgovernment action. (App. 3-4, 83-84.) But, the union argued,\nthe AWCF is a revolving fund, meaning that its outflows of\nmoney are replenished by income from billings to the TYAD’s\ncustomers. Thus, the union urged, although appropriated funds\ncould not be used to pay for personal out-of-pocket losses,\nTYAD could draw on its sales revenues because these were not\nappropriated funds.2\n        The FLRA upheld the determination that the AFGE’s\nreimbursement proposal was improper. The Authority reasoned\nthat as a revolving fund the AWCF should be treated, as a matter\nof law, as an “on-going or continuing appropriation.” (App. 4.) 3\nGiven the union’s acknowledgment that the AWCF statute did\nnot authorize appropriated funds to be spent for personal\nreimbursements, the FLRA concluded that the union’s proposal\nwould violate 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), and therefore was not a\nproper subject for collective bargaining under 5 U.S.C. § 7117.\n        We have jurisdiction over this petition for review under 5\nU.S.C. § 7123(a). We review the FLRA’s decision under the\nstandards of the Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. §\n7123(c) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. § 706). Because the question\nhere is whether the FLRA decision is an improper interpretation\nof statutes governing the AWCF, our review is plenary, and we\nfollow the agency’s interpretation only insofar as its reasoning is\n“sound.” Ass’n of Civilian Technicians, Tex. Lone Star Chapter\n100 v. FLRA, 250 F.3d 778, 782 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\n\n\n       2\n         After briefs were submitted and at oral argument, the AFGE\nsought to take the position that even if the AWCF funds were\nappropriated, the governing statute would allow use of that appropriated\nmoney to reimburse lost personal expenses. Letter pursuant to Rule\n28(j), September 30, 2004. Because that was not the union’s position\nbefore the Authority, we decline to allow the union to switch horses for\nthis appeal. See 5 U.S.C. 7123(c) (“No objection that has not been urged\nbefore the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court,\nunless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of\nextraordinary circumstances.”).\n       3\n          The FLRA opined that a revolving fund is created not to step\noutside the appropriations process, but as a means by which TYAD was\nrelieved of the ordinary requirement that appropriated funds be spent in\nthe same fiscal year. (App. 4.)\n\n                                   4\n\f                               II.\n\n                               A.\n\n       One of the fundamental powers lodged by the\nConstitution in the Congress is control over the expenditure of\npublic money. The Appropriations Clause provides:\n\n              No money shall be drawn from the Treasury,\n              but in Consequence of Appropriations made by\n              Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the\n              Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money\n              shall be published from time\n              to time.\n\nU.S. Const. Art. I, § 9, Cl. 7.\n        For purposes of the appropriations power, public money\nis defined broadly. As Justice Story observed in his\nCommentaries, it includes “all the taxes raised from the people,\nas well as revenues arising from other sources.” 2 Joseph Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1348\n(3d ed. 1858), quoted in Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496\nU.S. 414, 427 (1990). By law, public money includes money\nfrom any source such as taxes, customs and user fees, and other\nproceeds of government agency activities. See 31 U.S.C. § 3302\n(Miscellaneous Receipts Act). The purpose of the Clause is to\nplace authority to dispose of public funds firmly in the hands of\nCongress, rather than the Executive. Richmond, 496 U.S. at\n425-27; Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321\n(1937). This not only allows Congress to guard against\n“extravagance,” Story, supra, but hands the Legislative Branch a\npowerful tool to curb behavior by the Executive. See generally\nKate Stith, Congress’ Power of the Purse, 97 Yale L.J. 1343\n(1988). Without congressional permission, therefore, no money\nmay be paid by the Treasury. Richmond, 496 U.S. at 427-28;\nReeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 272, 291 (1850) (alternate\nholding).\n        Congress itself may choose, however, to loosen its own\nreins on public expenditure. So, for example, although Congress\nordinarily requires that appropriations be spent within a single\n\n\n                                5\n\fyear, it may also authorize appropriations that continue for a\nlonger period of time. See Nat’l Ass’n of Reg’l Councils v.\nCostle, 564 F.2d 583, 587 & n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Congress\nmay also decide not to finance a federal entity with\nappropriations, thereby giving rise to what is described as a\nnonappropriated fund instrumentality or NAFI. See United\nStates v. Hopkins, 427 U.S. 123, 125 n.2 (1976); 10 U.S.C. §§\n4779(b), 9779(b). NAFI entities are “arms of the [federal]\ngovernment,” Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, 316 U.S. 481, 485\n(1942), but their “monies do not come from congressional\nappropriation but rather primarily from [their] own activities,\nservices, and product sales.” Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, 786 F.2d\n445, 446 (1 st Cir. 1986).\n        What distinguishes a NAFI from other federal entities that\nare financed through the normal appropriations process? Under\nthe case law, the test is not simply whether the organization in\nquestion receives payments from its own activities, but whether\nthe organization is “denied by the Government any use of\nappropriated monies.” L’Enfant Plaza Props, Inc. v. United\nStates, 668 F.2d 1211, 1212 (Ct. Cl. 1982); see also Hopkins,\n427 U.S. at 125 & n.2. Since the power to appropriate belongs\nto Congress, see Richmond; Cincinnati Soap, 301 U.S. at 321,\nCongress must make the decision whether to allow or deny a\nfederal instrumentality appropriated funds. Congress may\nimpose the restriction that the instrumentality be entirely self-\nsupporting, without any appropriated funds, in which case it is a\nNAFI. See, e.g., Core Concepts of Florida, Inc. v. United States,\n327 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Federal Prison Industries is a\nNAFI); Furash & Co. v. United States, 252 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir.\n2001) (Federal Housing Finance Board is a NAFI). Or,\nCongress may direct an entity to be self sufficient, but leave\nopen the possibility that appropriations may be applied. See, e.g.,\nL’Enfant Plaza, 668 F.2d at 1212 (financial self-sufficiency does\nnot establish NAFI where historically appropriations were\nreceived and are allowed under the statute for the future);\nSlattery v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. 258 (Fed. Cl. 2002) (FDIC\nBank Insurance Fund is not a NAFI because Congress expressed\nwillingness to appropriate funds, although it never has).\nWhether an agency or agency fund is a NAFI is determined by\nlooking at the entirety of its financial wellspring, not by parsing\n\n\n                                6\n\fits revenue stream to determine which moneys came from the\nTreasury and which from customer payments. Indeed, an entity\nis not treated as a NAFI even if all of its money flows from its\nown activities, and even if appropriated funds have never been\nused, so long as “under the agency’s authorizing legislation\nCongress could appropriate funds if necessary.” L’Enfant Plaza,\n668 F.2d at 1212.\n        As our review of authority suggests, most of the analysis\nof the line between appropriated funds and NAFIs has been\nundertaken by the Federal Circuit, the United States Court of\nFederal Claims, and its predecessor courts. That is\nunderstandable, since under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491,\njudgments against the United States are paid from appropriated\nfunds, so that the claims courts’ jurisdiction often depends on\nwhether the defendant to a claim is a NAFI. In considering\nwhether an organization’s funds are appropriated or not, the\nFederal Circuit has adopted a clear-statement test, presuming\nthat funds disbursed by an entity should be treated as\nappropriated unless there is “a clear expression by Congress that\nthe agency was to be separated from general federal revenues.”\nL’Enfant Plaza, 668 F.2d at 1212; see also Core Concepts, 327\nF.3d at 1334; Research Triangle Inst. v. Bd. of Governors of the\nFed. Reserve Sys., 132 F.3d 985, 988 (4 th Cir. 1997) (applying\nsame test).\n        While that “clear expression” standard arises in the\ncontext of Tucker Act jurisprudence, we think it accurately\nreflects the broader principle that one should not lightly presume\nthat Congress meant to surrender its control over public\nexpenditures by authorizing an entity to be entirely self-\nsufficient and outside the appropriations process. There is a\npowerful reason for this assumption. At bottom, Congress’\ndecision to treat an agency’s funds as appropriated or\nnonappropriated is not simply a selection of the anticipated\nsource of the funds, but a political decision about how tightly\nCongress wants to supervise the spending decisions of the\nagency and whether it wants to stand behind the agency with the\nfull faith and credit of the Treasury. See Slattery, 53 Fed. Cl. at\n273 (holding the FDIC Bank Insurance Fund appropriations\nbecause Treasury stands behind Fund as last resort). When\nCongress establishes a NAFI, it insulates the public fisc but also\n\n\n                                 7\n\fmay surrender some degree of control over the entity’s\nspending.4 Otherwise, Congress reserves its traditional full\nmeasure of appropriations power in funding an executive\nagency. For this reason, the courts have sensibly treated agency\nmoney as appropriated even when the agency is fully financed\nby outside revenues, so long as Congress has not clearly stated\nthat it wishes to relinquish the control normally afforded through\nthe appropriations process. And, in fact, Congress itself has\nsignaled how jealously it guards the appropriations prerogative\nby imposing a similar “clear statement” rule regarding when a\ncourt may find that an appropriation has been made. 31 U.S.C. §\n1301(d) (“A law may be construed to make an appropriation . . .\nonly if the law specifically states that an appropriation is made . .\n. .”).\n\n                                 B.\n\n         The TYAD AW CF is a defense working-capital fund\nauthorized by statute, 10 U.S.C. § 2208. AFGE argues that\nunder the statute, funds like the AWCF are at least in part\ncomprised of nonappropriated funds. Since, as we have\nexplained, Congress must determine whether instrumentalities\nare supplied with appropriated or nonappropriated money, this\nquestion turns on interpretation of § 2208, applying the clear\nexpression and other principles we have described.\n        Both sides agree that § 2208 authorizes the Secretary of\nDefense to establish working-capital funds as “revolving funds,”\ni.e., funds in which income from operations is applied to finance\noperations without regard to fiscal year limitations. (App. 2-3.)\nAFGE argued before the FLRA that, to the extent the AWCF is\nlargely composed of collections from sales, those collected\nmoneys are not appropriated and are therefore available to pay\nfor purposes other than those specified in the appropriation.\nTYAD argued, to the contrary, that any revolving fund is by\ndefinition just an appropriation that continues past the fiscal\nyear. The Comptroller General evidently agrees with this\n\n\n       4\n         Of course, Congress may impose separate spending restrictions\non a NAFI. See AINS, Inc. v. United States, 56 Fed. Cl. 522, 540 n.29\n(Fed. Cl. 2003).\n\n                                  8\n\fcharacterization. 4 U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Principles of\nFederal Appropriations Law, 15-18 to 15-128 (2d ed. 2001)\n(noting that one of the foundational rules of a revolving fund is\nthat it is an appropriation). And the FLRA adopted the view of\nthe Comptroller General and the TYAD, which is that revolving\nfunds in their entirety are per se “treated as on-going or\ncontinuing appropriations.” (App. 4.)\n         We do not agree with the FLRA’s blanket generalization\nthat revolving funds are always appropriations. But we also\ndisagree with AFGE that whether revolving funds are not\nappropriated depends on whether some or all of the revenues\nflow from sales or services to third parties. Instead, we think the\ncorrect rule is that the characterization of a government fund as\nappropriated or not depends entirely on Congress’ expression,\nwhatever the actual source of the money and whether or not the\nfund operates on a revolving rather than annualized basis.\n         We turn first to the position of the FLRA. Its decision\nwas ostensibly supported by statements in United Biscuit Co. of\nAmerica v. Wirtz, 359 F.2d 206, 212-13 & n.14 (D.C. Cir.\n1965), and a long line of Comptroller General decisions, see\nMDB Communications, Inc. v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. 245,\n248-49 (Fed. Cl. 2002). But these authorities are either\ndistinguishable or unpersuasive.\n         In United Biscuit, the court considered whether purchases\nfor military commissaries were made with appropriated funds for\npurposes of deciding the applicability of the Walsh-Healey\nPublic Contracts Act, Pub. L. No. 74-846, 49 Stat. 2036 (1936). 5\nThe court determined that the commissaries were financed\nthrough a Treasury Department “stock fund,” in which\nappropriated moneys were spent to purchase supplies and then\nrecouped by the stock fund when the commissaries sold supplies.\n\n\n       5\n          As explained in United Biscuit, the Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act is designed to force suppliers and manufacturers doing\nbusiness with the government to observe minimum labor and wage\nstandards by the insertion in government contracts of certain\nrepresentations and stipulations. 359 F.2d at 208. Violation of these\nrepresentations and stipulations renders the contracting party liable for\ndamages, and, possibly, for blacklisting from government contracts for\na three-year period. Id.\n\n                                   9\n\fExamining the context of the specific statute establishing that\nfunding arrangement, the court accepted the broad view of the\nComptroller General that “establishment of a revolving fund,\nreplenished by moneys from the public, constitutes an on-going\nappropriation which does not have to be renewed each year.”\n359 F.2d at 212. But while that statement may have been correct\nand necessary in the particular context of the commisaries’\n“stock fund,” it is dicta – and likely incorrect dicta – with respect\nto other, different types of revolving funds. The particular\nstructure of the stock fund in United Biscuit mandated that\nannual appropriations pay for the commissaries’ purchases of\ngoods, and that the revenue from sales return to Treasury. See\nAINS, Inc. v. United States, 56 Fed. Cl. 522, 540 n.29 (Fed. Cl.\n2003) (distinguishing United Biscuit). But other revolving funds\nare designed to stand alone financially, and therefore do not\nconstitute appropriations. Hopkins, 427 U.S. 123 (post\nexchanges); Furash, 252 F.3d at 1336 (the Federal Housing\nFinance Board); AINS, 46 Fed. Cl. at 522 (the Mint). Properly\nread, therefore, the holding of United Biscuit is not that all\nrevolving funds are appropriations, but that it depends on\nwhether the particular revolving fund is financed – or is\npermitted to be financed – by appropriated funds. That is\nconsistent with our own test.\n        The FLRA also put considerable weight on the Court of\nFederal Claims, decision in MDB Communications, and the line\nof Comptroller General decisions on which it relies. MDB\nCommunications held that a “revolving fund is, in substance, a\ncontinuing or permanent appropriation.” 253 Fed. Cl. at 248.\nBut the FLRA disregarded the Federal Circuit’s later decision in\nCore Concepts, which expressly held that the Comptroller\nGeneral’s “view that all revolving funds are appropriations is\nmisplaced [in the context of the NAFI doctrine].” 327 F.3d at\n1338. MDB Communication’s generalized holding about\nrevolving funds, therefore, has been effectively overruled by\nCore Concepts.\n        Finally, the FLRA invoked support from a line of\nopinions by the Comptroller General which assert that revolving\nfunds are necessarily appropriated funds based on the interplay\nbetween the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) –\nwhich generally requires money received by the government to\n\n\n                                 10\n\fbe deposited in the Treasury’s general fund – and the\nAppropriations Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. 4 U.S. Gen.\nAccounting Office, supra, at 15-81 to 15-128. Essentially, the\nComptroller General argues that because Congress normally\nrequires all receipts to flow into the Treasury under § 3302(b),\nand because all appropriations from the Treasury must be made\nby Congress under the Appropriations Clause, it follows that all\nrevolving funds are appropriations.\n        But, as the court in Core Concepts correctly noted, the\nComptroller General’s premise is flawed. The Miscellaneous\nReceipts Act need not apply to all government revenues.\nCongress may choose to treat some agency revenues outside of\nthe general Treasury fund by statutorily authorizing those\nrevenues to be deposited into a special fund. Core Concepts,\n327 F.3d at 1338. Having done so, Congress has taken the\nrevenues out of the appropriations cycle. There is, as we have\nalready explained, no Appropriations Clause impediment to\nCongress relinquishing its own appropriations authority. See\nCincinnati Soap, 301 U.S. at 321.\n        Finally, the Comptroller General’s view is inconsistent\nwith Supreme Court precedent. The Comptroller General\ndefines a revolving fund as “a permanent authorization for a\nprogram to be financed, in whole or in part, through the use of\nits collections to carry out future operations.” 4 U.S. Gen.\nAccounting Office, supra, at 15-81 to 15-128. This definition\ncomprehends the funds that traditionally support the military\npost exchanges. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 4779(b), 9779(b). But in\nUnited States v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court described these\npost exchange moneys as nonappropriated funds, based on the\nparticular statutes authorizing the funds. 427 U.S. at 125 & n.2.\nThe fact that the Supreme Court has recognized that collected\nmoneys can (but need not) be nonappropriated funds completes\nthe demolition of the Comptroller General’s position that all\nrevolving funds derived wholly or in part from collections are\nnecessarily appropriated funds.\n        In short, United Biscuit and Core Concepts reaffirm our\nprinciple that each agency fund, whether or not “revolving,”\nmust be separately examined under the congressional “clear\nexpression” test to see if it consists of appropriated or\nnonappropriated money. We disagree with the FLRA’s\n\n\n                                11\n\facceptance of the view that the TYAD AWCF revolving fund is\nnecessarily appropriated money.\n        But that does not mean we adopt the argument of the\nAFGE that because the AWCF is replenished from customer\nfees we should treat the AWCF (or some part of it) as\nnonappropriated. Under the approach we have outlined, what\nmatters is how Congress’ wishes to treat government revenue,\nnot the source of the revenue. We examine the particular\nfunding arrangement of the AWCF, therefore, to see whether\nthere is a “clear expression by Congress that it intended to\nseparate the agency from general federal revenues.” Furash, 252\nF.3d at 1339. If so, it would be a NAFI. But in the case of the\ndefense working-capital funds, Congress has actually expressed\nthe contrary view: that the defense working-capital funds were\nmeant to be supported by appropriated funds.\n        Section 2208(d), which authorizes the working-capital\nfunds, expressly provides that “such amounts may be\nappropriated for the purpose of providing capital for working\ncapital funds as have been specifically authorized by law.” 10\nU.S.C. § 2208(d). Subsection (c) mandates that “[w]orking-\ncapital funds shall be . . . reimbursed from available\nappropriations or otherwise credited for . . . costs.” Thus, the\nstatute suggests that Congress intended to infuse the working-\ncapital funds with appropriated moneys. And, as noted above,\nCongress has in fact regularly supplemented the capital in the\ndefense working capital funds with direct appropriations. See,\ne.g., National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004,\nPub. L. No. 108-136, § 302, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003)\n(appropriating $632,261,000 for military working-capital funds);\nBob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\n2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, § 302, 116 Stat. 2458, 2506 (2002)\n(appropriating $387,156,000 for military working-capital funds);\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, Pub.\nL. No. 107-107, § 302, 115 Stat. 1012, 1047 (2001)\n(appropriating $1,656,396,000 for military working-capital\nfunds).\n        Undoubtedly, therefore, the TYAD AW CF is not a NAFI.\nNot only has Congress expressly indicated that the working-\ncapital fund may be financed through appropriations, but it has\ndone so repeatedly. Under the “clear expression” test, and the\n\n\n                               12\n\fline of appellate decisions which we have discussed, the moneys\nin the AWCF are legally appropriated funds.\n        The AFGE nevertheless advances two arguments in\nsupport of its claim that the AW CF is exempt from the statutory\nrestriction on the use of appropriations. First, the union observes\nthat at least some of the money is received from customers, and\nit urges us to segregate these and treat them as nonappropriated\nfunds. The uniform rule, however, is that the character of an\nagency’s funding is defined as a whole. Slattery, 53 Fed. Cl. at\n258. The reason is fundamental. As we have explained, what is\nat stake in the characterization of agency funds is not merely an\naccounting of the source of revenue, but a decision about the\ndegree of congressional supervision of agency spending. Where\nCongress has not “clearly expressed” its decision to create a\nNAFI, therefore, it has determined that the agency’s spending\nshould be subject to the usual appropriations authority even if\nthe Treasury is not the source of all or even any of the funds.\nAFGE’s suggestion that one culls specific money based on\nwhether generated from the Treasury or outside revenues is\ninconsistent with this conceptual underpinning of the NAFI\ndoctrine, and the judicial precedent.\n        Second, the AFGE relies on Department of Defense\ninternal accounting rules that separately categorize cash by\nsource: operations, investments, and appropriations. But\nregulations or rules promulgated by the Executive on its own\ncannot affect the character of an agency’s funds. The purpose of\nthe Constitution’s Appropriations Clause is to constrain the\nExecutive and assure Congress’ control over expenditures.\nCongress may choose to relinquish its appropriations authority in\nspecific instances by establishing NAFIs or continuing\nappropriations, but that is the choice of Congress. Here,\nCongress has chosen not to give up appropriations authority over\nthe defense working-capital funds. To say that the Defense\nDepartment can, on its own, carve out an area of\nnonappropriated funding would create an Executive prerogative\nthat offends the Appropriations Clause and affects the\nconstitutional balance of powers. This we decline to do.\n        Accordingly, we believe that the FLRA’s decision that the\nTYAD AWCF consists of appropriated funds was correct, albeit\non reasoning somewhat different than that adopted by the\n\n\n                                13\n\fAuthority. 6 The petition for review will be denied.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         We offer no opinion on the AFGE’s belated argument, see supra\nnote 2, that expenditure of appropriated funds to compensate for lost\npersonal expenses is permissible. That contention can be raised, if\nappropriate, someplace else. See generally ACT v. FLRA, 370 F.3d 1214\n(D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n                                 14\n\f",

The FLRA specifically rejected the AFGE’s sole\nargument, which was that most of the money in the AWCF does\nnot consist of appropriated funds because the AWCF is in large\npart financed through collections from customers to whom\nTYAD sells services. Petitioner sought review.\n        Resolution of this issue turns on the definition of\nappropriated funds. The question of when agency funds are\ndefined as “appropriated” has important legal implications going\nto the heart of Congress’ power to control the financial activities\nand expenditures of the Executive Branch.\n        For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we determine\nthat AWCF’s money is properly considered appropriated funds,\nand we will affirm the decision of the FLRA.\n\n\n                                 2\n\f                                    I.\n\n        TYAD is the Defense Department’s largest full-service\nelectronic maintenance and repair facility, and is located in\nTobyhanna, Pennsylvania. Civilian employees are represented\nby AFGE. TYAD is financed by a defense working capital fund\n– the TYAD AWCF. Defense working capital funds like the\nAWCF are continually replenished with money paid by outside\nfederal agencies and private businesses for the purchase of\ndefense agency goods and services. Additionally, defense\nworking capital funds receive direct annual appropriations from\nCongress when required. See, e.g., National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, §\n302, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003).\n        In 2002, the union and TYAD management discussed a\nproposed amendment to their collective bargaining agreement\nthat would have provided for reimbursements of any\ndocumented financial losses suffered by an employee because of\na cancellation of annual leave. Under the proposal, an employee\nwhose leave was cancelled by TYAD would be reimbursed for\nforfeited airline tickets, hotel deposits, and the like. The\nproposal specifically suggested that the reimbursement would be\n“from other than appropriated funds.” This presumably referred\nto the assumption that AWCF revenues from services performed\nfor other agencies and businesses were not appropriated funds,\nand therefore not subject to the legal requirement that\n“[a]ppropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which\nthe appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by\nlaw.” 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a).\n        Ultimately, TYAD rejected the union proposal on the\nground that it was inconsistent with the law, because payment of\npersonal costs is not within the scope of TYAD’s authorized\nappropriations.1 The union appealed to the FLRA. Before the\nAuthority, the AFGE conceded that the statute governing the\nTYAD AWCF does not authorize using appropriated money to\nreimburse employees for personal expenses lost because of\n\n\n       1\n           Under 5 U.S.C. § 7117(a)(1), “the duty to bargain in good faith\n. . . [applies] to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law. . ..”\n\n                                    3\n\fgovernment action. (App. 3-4, 83-84.) But, the union argued,\nthe AWCF is a revolving fund, meaning that its outflows of\nmoney are replenished by income from billings to the TYAD’s\ncustomers. Thus, the union urged, although appropriated funds\ncould not be used to pay for personal out-of-pocket losses,\nTYAD could draw on its sales revenues because these were not\nappropriated funds.2\n        The FLRA upheld the determination that the AFGE’s\nreimbursement proposal was improper. The Authority reasoned\nthat as a revolving fund the AWCF should be treated, as a matter\nof law, as an “on-going or continuing appropriation.” (App. 4.) 3\nGiven the union’s acknowledgment that the AWCF statute did\nnot authorize appropriated funds to be spent for personal\nreimbursements, the FLRA concluded that the union’s proposal\nwould violate 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), and therefore was not a\nproper subject for collective bargaining under 5 U.S.C. § 7117.\n        We have jurisdiction over this petition for review under 5\nU.S.C. § 7123(a). We review the FLRA’s decision under the\nstandards of the Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. §\n7123(c) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. § 706). Because the question\nhere is whether the FLRA decision is an improper interpretation\nof statutes governing the AWCF, our review is plenary, and we\nfollow the agency’s interpretation only insofar as its reasoning is\n“sound.” Ass’n of Civilian Technicians, Tex.

Cir. 2001).\n\n\n       2\n         After briefs were submitted and at oral argument, the AFGE\nsought to take the position that even if the AWCF funds were\nappropriated, the governing statute would allow use of that appropriated\nmoney to reimburse lost personal expenses. Letter pursuant to Rule\n28(j), September 30, 2004. Because that was not the union’s position\nbefore the Authority, we decline to allow the union to switch horses for\nthis appeal. See 5 U.S.C. 7123(c) (“No objection that has not been urged\nbefore the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court,\nunless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of\nextraordinary circumstances.”).\n       3\n          The FLRA opined that a revolving fund is created not to step\noutside the appropriations process, but as a means by which TYAD was\nrelieved of the ordinary requirement that appropriated funds be spent in\nthe same fiscal year. (App. 4.)\n\n                                   4\n\f                               II.\n\n                               A.\n\n       One of the fundamental powers lodged by the\nConstitution in the Congress is control over the expenditure of\npublic money. The Appropriations Clause provides:\n\n              No money shall be drawn from the Treasury,\n              but in Consequence of Appropriations made by\n              Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the\n              Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money\n              shall be published from time\n              to time.\n\nU.S. Const. Art. I, § 9, Cl. 7.\n        For purposes of the appropriations power, public money\nis defined broadly. As Justice Story observed in his\nCommentaries, it includes “all the taxes raised from the people,\nas well as revenues arising from other sources.” 2 Joseph Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1348\n(3d ed. 1858), quoted in Office of Pers.

By law, public money includes money\nfrom any source such as taxes, customs and user fees, and other\nproceeds of government agency activities. See 31 U.S.C. § 3302\n(Miscellaneous Receipts Act). The purpose of the Clause is to\nplace authority to dispose of public funds firmly in the hands of\nCongress, rather than the Executive. Richmond, 496 U.S. at\n425-27; Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102824\"><a href=\"/opinion/102824/cincinnati-soap-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321\n(1937). This not only allows Congress to guard against\n“extravagance,” Story, supra, but hands the Legislative Branch a\npowerful tool to curb behavior by the Executive. See generally\nKate Stith, Congress’ Power of the Purse, 97 Yale L.J. 1343\n(1988). Without congressional permission, therefore, no money\nmay be paid by the Treasury. Richmond, 496 U.S. at 427-28;\nReeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 272, 291 (1850) (alternate\nholding).\n        Congress itself may choose, however, to loosen its own\nreins on public expenditure. So, for example, although Congress\nordinarily requires that appropriations be spent within a single\n\n\n                                5\n\fyear, it may also authorize appropriations that continue for a\nlonger period of time.

Cl. 2002) (FDIC\nBank Insurance Fund is not a NAFI because Congress expressed\nwillingness to appropriate funds, although it never has).\nWhether an agency or agency fund is a NAFI is determined by\nlooking at the entirety of its financial wellspring, not by parsing\n\n\n                                6\n\fits revenue stream to determine which moneys came from the\nTreasury and which from customer payments. Indeed, an entity\nis not treated as a NAFI even if all of its money flows from its\nown activities, and even if appropriated funds have never been\nused, so long as “under the agency’s authorizing legislation\nCongress could appropriate funds if necessary.” L’Enfant Plaza,\n668 F.2d at 1212.\n        As our review of authority suggests, most of the analysis\nof the line between appropriated funds and NAFIs has been\nundertaken by the Federal Circuit, the United States Court of\nFederal Claims, and its predecessor courts. That is\nunderstandable, since under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491,\njudgments against the United States are paid from appropriated\nfunds, so that the claims courts’ jurisdiction often depends on\nwhether the defendant to a claim is a NAFI. In considering\nwhether an organization’s funds are appropriated or not, the\nFederal Circuit has adopted a clear-statement test, presuming\nthat funds disbursed by an entity should be treated as\nappropriated unless there is “a clear expression by Congress that\nthe agency was to be separated from general federal revenues.”\nL’Enfant Plaza, 668 F.2d at 1212; see also Core Concepts, 327\nF.3d at 1334; Research Triangle Inst. v. Bd. of Governors of the\nFed. Reserve Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749878\"><a href=\"/opinion/749878/research-triangle-institute-v-the-board-of-governors-of-the-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 988 (4 th Cir. 1997) (applying\nsame test).\n        While that “clear expression” standard arises in the\ncontext of Tucker Act jurisprudence, we think it accurately\nreflects the broader principle that one should not lightly presume\nthat Congress meant to surrender its control over public\nexpenditures by authorizing an entity to be entirely self-\nsufficient and outside the appropriations process. There is a\npowerful reason for this assumption. At bottom, Congress’\ndecision to treat an agency’s funds as appropriated or\nnonappropriated is not simply a selection of the anticipated\nsource of the funds, but a political decision about how tightly\nCongress wants to supervise the spending decisions of the\nagency and whether it wants to stand behind the agency with the\nfull faith and credit of the Treasury. See Slattery, 53 Fed. Cl. at\n273 (holding the FDIC Bank Insurance Fund appropriations\nbecause Treasury stands behind Fund as last resort). When\nCongress establishes a NAFI, it insulates the public fisc but also\n\n\n                                 7\n\fmay surrender some degree of control over the entity’s\nspending.4 Otherwise, Congress reserves its traditional full\nmeasure of appropriations power in funding an executive\nagency. For this reason, the courts have sensibly treated agency\nmoney as appropriated even when the agency is fully financed\nby outside revenues, so long as Congress has not clearly stated\nthat it wishes to relinquish the control normally afforded through\nthe appropriations process. And, in fact, Congress itself has\nsignaled how jealously it guards the appropriations prerogative\nby imposing a similar “clear statement” rule regarding when a\ncourt may find that an appropriation has been made. 31 U.S.C. §\n1301(d) (“A law may be construed to make an appropriation . . .\nonly if the law specifically states that an appropriation is made . .\n. .”).\n\n                                 B.\n\n         The TYAD AW CF is a defense working-capital fund\nauthorized by statute, 10 U.S.C. § 2208. AFGE argues that\nunder the statute, funds like the AWCF are at least in part\ncomprised of nonappropriated funds. Since, as we have\nexplained, Congress must determine whether instrumentalities\nare supplied with appropriated or nonappropriated money, this\nquestion turns on interpretation of § 2208, applying the clear\nexpression and other principles we have described.\n        Both sides agree that § 2208 authorizes the Secretary of\nDefense to establish working-capital funds as “revolving funds,”\ni.e., funds in which income from operations is applied to finance\noperations without regard to fiscal year limitations. (App. 2-3.)\nAFGE argued before the FLRA that, to the extent the AWCF is\nlargely composed of collections from sales, those collected\nmoneys are not appropriated and are therefore available to pay\nfor purposes other than those specified in the appropriation.\nTYAD argued, to the contrary, that any revolving fund is by\ndefinition just an appropriation that continues past the fiscal\nyear. The Comptroller General evidently agrees with this\n\n\n       4\n         Of course, Congress may impose separate spending restrictions\non a NAFI. See AINS, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Accounting Office, Principles of\nFederal Appropriations Law, 15-18 to 15-128 (2d ed. 2001)\n(noting that one of the foundational rules of a revolving fund is\nthat it is an appropriation). And the FLRA adopted the view of\nthe Comptroller General and the TYAD, which is that revolving\nfunds in their entirety are per se “treated as on-going or\ncontinuing appropriations.” (App. 4.)\n         We do not agree with the FLRA’s blanket generalization\nthat revolving funds are always appropriations. But we also\ndisagree with AFGE that whether revolving funds are not\nappropriated depends on whether some or all of the revenues\nflow from sales or services to third parties. Instead, we think the\ncorrect rule is that the characterization of a government fund as\nappropriated or not depends entirely on Congress’ expression,\nwhatever the actual source of the money and whether or not the\nfund operates on a revolving rather than annualized basis.\n         We turn first to the position of the FLRA. Its decision\nwas ostensibly supported by statements in United Biscuit Co. of\nAmerica v. Wirtz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212-13 & n.14 (D.C. Cir.\n1965), and a long line of Comptroller General decisions, see\nMDB Communications, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n248-49 (Fed. Cl. 2002). But these authorities are either\ndistinguishable or unpersuasive.\n         In United Biscuit, the court considered whether purchases\nfor military commissaries were made with appropriated funds for\npurposes of deciding the applicability of the Walsh-Healey\nPublic Contracts Act, Pub. L. No. 74-846, 49 Stat. 2036 (1936). 5\nThe court determined that the commissaries were financed\nthrough a Treasury Department “stock fund,” in which\nappropriated moneys were spent to purchase supplies and then\nrecouped by the stock fund when the commissaries sold supplies.\n\n\n       5\n          As explained in United Biscuit, the Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act is designed to force suppliers and manufacturers doing\nbusiness with the government to observe minimum labor and wage\nstandards by the insertion in government contracts of certain\nrepresentations and stipulations. 359 F.2d at 208. Violation of these\nrepresentations and stipulations renders the contracting party liable for\ndamages, and, possibly, for blacklisting from government contracts for\na three-year period. Id.\n\n                                   9\n\fExamining the context of the specific statute establishing that\nfunding arrangement, the court accepted the broad view of the\nComptroller General that “establishment of a revolving fund,\nreplenished by moneys from the public, constitutes an on-going\nappropriation which does not have to be renewed each year.”\n359 F.2d at 212. But while that statement may have been correct\nand necessary in the particular context of the commisaries’\n“stock fund,” it is dicta – and likely incorrect dicta – with respect\nto other, different types of revolving funds. The particular\nstructure of the stock fund in United Biscuit mandated that\nannual appropriations pay for the commissaries’ purchases of\ngoods, and that the revenue from sales return to Treasury. See\nAINS, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 n.29 (Fed. Cl.\n2003) (distinguishing United Biscuit). But other revolving funds\nare designed to stand alone financially, and therefore do not\nconstitute appropriations. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109507\"><a href=\"/opinion/109507/united-states-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (post\nexchanges); Furash, 252 F.3d at 1336 (the Federal Housing\nFinance Board); AINS, 46 Fed. Cl. at 522 (the Mint). Properly\nread, therefore, the holding of United Biscuit is not that all\nrevolving funds are appropriations, but that it depends on\nwhether the particular revolving fund is financed – or is\npermitted to be financed – by appropriated funds. That is\nconsistent with our own test.\n        The FLRA also put considerable weight on the Court of\nFederal Claims, decision in MDB Communications, and the line\nof Comptroller General decisions on which it relies. MDB\nCommunications held that a “revolving fund is, in substance, a\ncontinuing or permanent appropriation.” 253 Fed. Cl. at 248.\nBut the FLRA disregarded the Federal Circuit’s later decision in\nCore Concepts, which expressly held that the Comptroller\nGeneral’s “view that all revolving funds are appropriations is\nmisplaced [in the context of the NAFI doctrine].” 327 F.3d at\n1338. MDB Communication’s generalized holding about\nrevolving funds, therefore, has been effectively overruled by\nCore Concepts.\n        Finally, the FLRA invoked support from a line of\nopinions by the Comptroller General which assert that revolving\nfunds are necessarily appropriated funds based on the interplay\nbetween the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) –\nwhich generally requires money received by the government to\n\n\n                                 10\n\fbe deposited in the Treasury’s general fund – and the\nAppropriations Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. 4 U.S. Gen.\nAccounting Office, supra, at 15-81 to 15-128. Essentially, the\nComptroller General argues that because Congress normally\nrequires all receipts to flow into the Treasury under § 3302(b),\nand because all appropriations from the Treasury must be made\nby Congress under the Appropriations Clause, it follows that all\nrevolving funds are appropriations.\n        But, as the court in Core Concepts correctly noted, the\nComptroller General’s premise is flawed. The Miscellaneous\nReceipts Act need not apply to all government revenues.\nCongress may choose to treat some agency revenues outside of\nthe general Treasury fund by statutorily authorizing those\nrevenues to be deposited into a special fund. Core Concepts,\n327 F.3d at 1338. Having done so, Congress has taken the\nrevenues out of the appropriations cycle. There is, as we have\nalready explained, no Appropriations Clause impediment to\nCongress relinquishing its own appropriations authority. See\nCincinnati Soap, 301 U.S. at 321.\n        Finally, the Comptroller General’s view is inconsistent\nwith Supreme Court precedent. The Comptroller General\ndefines a revolving fund as “a permanent authorization for a\nprogram to be financed, in whole or in part, through the use of\nits collections to carry out future operations.” 4 U.S. Gen.\nAccounting Office, supra, at 15-81 to 15-128. This definition\ncomprehends the funds that traditionally support the military\npost exchanges. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 4779(b), 9779(b). But in\nUnited States v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court described these\npost exchange moneys as nonappropriated funds, based on the\nparticular statutes authorizing the funds. 427 U.S. at 125 & n.2.\nThe fact that the Supreme Court has recognized that collected\nmoneys can (but need not) be nonappropriated funds completes\nthe demolition of the Comptroller General’s position that all\nrevolving funds derived wholly or in part from collections are\nnecessarily appropriated funds.\n        In short, United Biscuit and Core Concepts reaffirm our\nprinciple that each agency fund, whether or not “revolving,”\nmust be separately examined under the congressional “clear\nexpression” test to see if it consists of appropriated or\nnonappropriated money. We disagree with the FLRA’s\n\n\n                                11\n\facceptance of the view that the TYAD AWCF revolving fund is\nnecessarily appropriated money.\n        But that does not mean we adopt the argument of the\nAFGE that because the AWCF is replenished from customer\nfees we should treat the AWCF (or some part of it) as\nnonappropriated. Under the approach we have outlined, what\nmatters is how Congress’ wishes to treat government revenue,\nnot the source of the revenue. We examine the particular\nfunding arrangement of the AWCF, therefore, to see whether\nthere is a “clear expression by Congress that it intended to\nseparate the agency from general federal revenues.” Furash, 252\nF.3d at 1339. If so, it would be a NAFI. But in the case of the\ndefense working-capital funds, Congress has actually expressed\nthe contrary view: that the defense working-capital funds were\nmeant to be supported by appropriated funds.\n        Section 2208(d), which authorizes the working-capital\nfunds, expressly provides that “such amounts may be\nappropriated for the purpose of providing capital for working\ncapital funds as have been specifically authorized by law.” 10\nU.S.C. § 2208(d). Subsection (c) mandates that “[w]orking-\ncapital funds shall be . . . reimbursed from available\nappropriations or otherwise credited for . . . costs.” Thus, the\nstatute suggests that Congress intended to infuse the working-\ncapital funds with appropriated moneys. And, as noted above,\nCongress has in fact regularly supplemented the capital in the\ndefense working capital funds with direct appropriations. See,\ne.g., National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004,\nPub. L. No. 108-136, § 302, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003)\n(appropriating $632,261,000 for military working-capital funds);\nBob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\n2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, § 302, 116 Stat. 2458, 2506 (2002)\n(appropriating $387,156,000 for military working-capital funds);\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, Pub.\nL. No. 107-107, § 302, 115 Stat. 1012, 1047 (2001)\n(appropriating $1,656,396,000 for military working-capital\nfunds).\n        Undoubtedly, therefore, the TYAD AW CF is not a NAFI.\nNot only has Congress expressly indicated that the working-\ncapital fund may be financed through appropriations, but it has\ndone so repeatedly. Under the “clear expression” test, and the\n\n\n                               12\n\fline of appellate decisions which we have discussed, the moneys\nin the AWCF are legally appropriated funds.\n        The AFGE nevertheless advances two arguments in\nsupport of its claim that the AW CF is exempt from the statutory\nrestriction on the use of appropriations. First, the union observes\nthat at least some of the money is received from customers, and\nit urges us to segregate these and treat them as nonappropriated\nfunds. The uniform rule, however, is that the character of an\nagency’s funding is defined as a whole. Slattery, 53 Fed. Cl. at\n258. The reason is fundamental. As we have explained, what is\nat stake in the characterization of agency funds is not merely an\naccounting of the source of revenue, but a decision about the\ndegree of congressional supervision of agency spending. Where\nCongress has not “clearly expressed” its decision to create a\nNAFI, therefore, it has determined that the agency’s spending\nshould be subject to the usual appropriations authority even if\nthe Treasury is not the source of all or even any of the funds.\nAFGE’s suggestion that one culls specific money based on\nwhether generated from the Treasury or outside revenues is\ninconsistent with this conceptual underpinning of the NAFI\ndoctrine, and the judicial precedent.\n        Second, the AFGE relies on Department of Defense\ninternal accounting rules that separately categorize cash by\nsource: operations, investments, and appropriations. But\nregulations or rules promulgated by the Executive on its own\ncannot affect the character of an agency’s funds. The purpose of\nthe Constitution’s Appropriations Clause is to constrain the\nExecutive and assure Congress’ control over expenditures.\nCongress may choose to relinquish its appropriations authority in\nspecific instances by establishing NAFIs or continuing\nappropriations, but that is the choice of Congress. Here,\nCongress has chosen not to give up appropriations authority over\nthe defense working-capital funds. To say that the Defense\nDepartment can, on its own, carve out an area of\nnonappropriated funding would create an Executive prerogative\nthat offends the Appropriations Clause and affects the\nconstitutional balance of powers. This we decline to do.\n        Accordingly, we believe that the FLRA’s decision that the\nTYAD AWCF consists of appropriated funds was correct, albeit\non reasoning somewhat different than that adopted by the\n\n\n                                13\n\fAuthority. 6 The petition for review will be denied.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         We offer no opinion on the AFGE’s belated argument, see supra\nnote 2, that expenditure of appropriated funds to compensate for lost\npersonal expenses is permissible. That contention can be raised, if\nappropriate, someplace else. See generally ACT v.
