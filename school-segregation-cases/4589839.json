The corporation’s\n                board of directors are the memberswho served on the ISD’sboard of\n                trustees at the time the corporation was fixmded.

Article III, section 52(a) of the Texas\n    thnsbtio~     however, generally prohibits independent school districts fiom “grant[i]\n    public money or thing of vah~e,in aid 0s or to” a person or corporation, such as the\n    foundation you descrii.\n\n\n            ‘we&nctcclLaer-tkkgslitycfrektiollshipyaldocrikis~bytbcvay\n    recenuy enacted school tinax   lefoms. see Acts 1993,nd Leg., ch. 347.\n\n\n\n                                                 p.     1327\n\fHonorable WtiamR. RatliE - Page 2              (~~-256)\n\n\n\n\n       In Attorney General Cpiion MW-373 (1981). this 05ce considered the\n-p            between the University of Texas and the University of Texas Law School\nFoundation, “a nonprofit corporation with the purpose of supporting the educational\ndataldng of the School of Law of the University of Texas.” Attorney General Opiion\nMW-373 at 1. The memorandum of tmderstanding between the f&ion                   and the\nuniversity stated, in part, that the law school would provide the foundation with 05ce\nspace, utilities, and telephone service. Id. at 5. This 05ce concluded that the university\nhad the statutory authority to provide the foundation with these items as “terms and\nwnditions” attached to its donations under section 65.31(e) of the Education Code which\nprovides as follows:\n                 The board is specificallyauthorized, upon terms and conditions\n            acceptable to it, to accept and administer gifts, grants, or donations\n            of any kind, tiom any source, for the use by the system or any of the\n            component institutions of the system.\nId. at 2 (quoting Educ. Code 8 65.31(e)); ore also id at S-6.\n\n       This 05~ then considered whether the terms of the memorandum of\nunderstanding would violate article III, section 51, the legislative counterpart of section\n52(a). See id. at 8-l 1. The opinion stated that the constitutional prohibition\n            requiresthataCCrantbytheuniversitytothefouadstonmussservea\n            public purpose, appropriate to the function of a university~and that\n            adequate consideration must flow to the public. . . . In addition, the\n            unbsity     must mahtain some controls over the fbtmdation’s\n            activities, to enare that the public purpose is acmally\n            achieved. . . . If these. conditions are met, the grant by the public\n            wtity is not unconstitutional.\nId. at 9.\n\n         As noted above, section 23.26 of the Education Code vests the trustees of an\nindependent school district with “the exchtsive power to manage and govern the public\nkee schools of the district.” Rduc. Code 8 23.26(b). The trustees of an independent\nschool district am authorized to “receivebequests and donations or other moneys or fimds\ncoming legally into their hands.” Id. # 23.26(a); see t&c id. 55 20.482 (authorizing board\nof truames to invest giSs made to school district to provide college scholarships), 21.903\n(authorizing board of trustees to accept bequests for the benefh of the public schools and\nprovidigethat~maybeexpeadedbytnuteeo”for~pplrposed~~bythe\ndonor so long as that purpose is in keeping with the lawibl putposes of the schools for the\nbe&t of which the donation was made”); Tex.

In addition, “[a]ll rights and\ntitles to the school property of the district, whether real or personal, shsll be vested in the\n\n\n                                          p.     1328\n\fHonorable Wtiam R Ratlitf - Page 3 (DM-256)\n\n\n\n\ntrustees.” Educ. Code Q23.26(c). Trustees hold school district property in trust for\nschool purposes. Texas Antiquities Coumr. v. Dallas Corm@Community College Dist.,\n554 S.W.2d 924 (Tex. 1977);Low v. City of Dallas, 40 S.W.2d 20 (Tex. 1931); Attorney\nOeneml Opinion I’M-958(1988). Thus, the use of school property must serve a school\npupose.\n\n        We believe that section 23.26 of the Education Code authorizes the trustees of an\nindependent school district to accept donations and other gifls Tom a private foundation,\nand to supply the foundation with office space and the use of other school property,\nassuming a school purpose is served. The question whether the constitution permits the\ntrustees to supply the foundation with office.space and the use of other school property is\nanother matter. We have not been provided with su5cient fbcts to determine whether this\nwould serve a public purpose, appropriate to the tbnction of an independent school\ndistrict; whether adequate considerationwould Sow to the public; or whether the trustees\nwould mainminsufiicientcontrols over the foundation’sactivities,to ensure that the public\npurpose is actually achieved. This determination is one to be made by the board of\ntrustees in the first instanw. See Attorney Oeneral Opiion MW-373 at 9.\n\n        Next, you ask if”members of the ISITs board of trustees [can] also be members of\nthe corporation’sboard.” As noted above, we assume that the independent school district\ntrustees do not receive compensation or any other remuneration for sendng on the board\nof directors of the foundation. Conflictsof interest on the part of local public 05cials are\nregulated by chapter 171 of the Local Govemment Code, which preempts common-law\ncon5cts of interests as applied to local public 05cials. See Local Gov’t Code\n0 171.007(a). This chapter applies to trustees of independent school districts, see id.\n8 171.001(l). and generslly requires an official who has a “substantial interest in a\nbusiness entity.” see id. Q 171.002. to disclose that interest and to refrain from\nparticipating in actions involving the entity, see id. 0 171.004.

Therefore, a trustee would be well-advised to avoid\ncagaeiag in conduct which might give rise to such a cause of action.\n\n         Fii,    you ask if “an ISD’sprovision 0 of free 05ce [space] and incidental items\nviolate[s]l either an order entered by the federal district court in United Stutes v.

These orders mquired TEA to take numerous actions to facilitate and encourage\ndewgmgaGon. TEA was prohiiied, for example, from permitting school extmamicular\nactivities which would result in segregation or diswminadon. See id. at 445-96. TEA\nwas ordered to suspend the accreditation of school districts opemting extmwniwlar\nactivities in a discriminatory msnner and to reduce their lintding. See id. at 446.

RatliE - Page 2              (~~-256)\n\n\n\n\n       In Attorney General Cpiion MW-373 (1981). this 05ce considered the\n-p            between the University of Texas and the University of Texas Law School\nFoundation, “a nonprofit corporation with the purpose of supporting the educational\ndataldng of the School of Law of the University of Texas.” Attorney General Opiion\nMW-373 at 1. The memorandum of tmderstanding between the f&ion                   and the\nuniversity stated, in part, that the law school would provide the foundation with 05ce\nspace, utilities, and telephone service. Id. at 5. This 05ce concluded that the university\nhad the statutory authority to provide the foundation with these items as “terms and\nwnditions” attached to its donations under section 65.31(e) of the Education Code which\nprovides as follows:\n                 The board is specificallyauthorized, upon terms and conditions\n            acceptable to it, to accept and administer gifts, grants, or donations\n            of any kind, tiom any source, for the use by the system or any of the\n            component institutions of the system.\nId. at 2 (quoting Educ. Code 8 65.31(e)); ore also id at S-6.\n\n       This 05~ then considered whether the terms of the memorandum of\nunderstanding would violate article III, section 51, the legislative counterpart of section\n52(a). See id. at 8-l 1. The opinion stated that the constitutional prohibition\n            requiresthataCCrantbytheuniversitytothefouadstonmussservea\n            public purpose, appropriate to the function of a university~and that\n            adequate consideration must flow to the public. . . . In addition, the\n            unbsity     must mahtain some controls over the fbtmdation’s\n            activities, to enare that the public purpose is acmally\n            achieved. . . . If these. conditions are met, the grant by the public\n            wtity is not unconstitutional.\nId. at 9.\n\n         As noted above, section 23.26 of the Education Code vests the trustees of an\nindependent school district with “the exchtsive power to manage and govern the public\nkee schools of the district.” Rduc.

The trustees of an independent\nschool district am authorized to “receivebequests and donations or other moneys or fimds\ncoming legally into their hands.” Id. # 23.26(a); see t&c id. 55 20.482 (authorizing board\nof truames to invest giSs made to school district to provide college scholarships), 21.903\n(authorizing board of trustees to accept bequests for the benefh of the public schools and\nprovidigethat~maybeexpeadedbytnuteeo”for~pplrposed~~bythe\ndonor so long as that purpose is in keeping with the lawibl putposes of the schools for the\nbe&t of which the donation was made”); Tex.

Thus, the use of school property must serve a school\npupose.\n\n        We believe that section 23.26 of the Education Code authorizes the trustees of an\nindependent school district to accept donations and other gifls Tom a private foundation,\nand to supply the foundation with office space and the use of other school property,\nassuming a school purpose is served. The question whether the constitution permits the\ntrustees to supply the foundation with office.space and the use of other school property is\nanother matter. We have not been provided with su5cient fbcts to determine whether this\nwould serve a public purpose, appropriate to the tbnction of an independent school\ndistrict; whether adequate considerationwould Sow to the public; or whether the trustees\nwould mainminsufiicientcontrols over the foundation’sactivities,to ensure that the public\npurpose is actually achieved. This determination is one to be made by the board of\ntrustees in the first instanw. See Attorney Oeneral Opiion MW-373 at 9.\n\n        Next, you ask if”members of the ISITs board of trustees [can] also be members of\nthe corporation’sboard.” As noted above, we assume that the independent school district\ntrustees do not receive compensation or any other remuneration for sendng on the board\nof directors of the foundation. Conflictsof interest on the part of local public 05cials are\nregulated by chapter 171 of the Local Govemment Code, which preempts common-law\ncon5cts of interests as applied to local public 05cials. See Local Gov’t Code\n0 171.007(a). This chapter applies to trustees of independent school districts, see id.\n8 171.001(l). and generslly requires an official who has a “substantial interest in a\nbusiness entity.” see id. Q 171.002. to disclose that interest and to refrain from\nparticipating in actions involving the entity, see id. 0 171.004. Section 171.099 provides\nas follows:\n                Itshallbe.law5lforalocalpublico5cisltoserveasamember\n           of the board of directors of private, nonprofit corporations when\n           such 05cials receive no compensation or other remuneration from\n           the nonprofit cotporation or other nonprofit entity.\nBecause chapter 171 generally preempts common-lawwnflicts of interest,s we conclude\nthatsectionl71.009pamitrImindependaa~hooldistricttrusteetoBerveasadirectorof\n\n\n        zlo Attomcy GwenI optrdon IM-1006 (1989) (dad hmuuy 12. 1989). this oilice atached\ntlmttkoommml8wdcMtliclsofdrcstddoalagcncyprohibited8mcmbMob~~\n~wortfrom~~~titlmutwmpoamtiMMthboarddrnotlproZit\n\n\nchsprcrl7lwpIinspplisable~~thecountyjudgcwarnotcompcnsatcdforhirEavics,udthttbe\ncommon law of cwflicts of tntatst tbcrcfon amtinocd to apply.
