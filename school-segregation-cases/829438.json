Act 1227, 2013 Ark. Acts 1227 (Apr. 16, 2013),\ncodified at Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901 et seq. The Act contains a \"broad school\nchoice transfer option.\" Teague v. Cooper, 720 F.3d 973, 976 (8th Cir. 2013). But the\nAct also contains exemptions. In relevant part, it provides that \"'[a] school district\nannually may declare an exemption under this section if the school district is subject\nto the desegregation order or mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the\neffects of past racial segregation.'\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(1). The Act\nrequires a school district to \"notify the [Arkansas Department of Education] by April\n1\" if the district intends to declare an exemption \"in the next school year.\" Id. § 6-18-\n1906(b)(3). The \"exemptions under the 2013 Act are limited to individual school\ndistricts that are subject to federal desegregation mandates.\" Teague, 720 F.3d at 977\nn.2.\n\n       Heath Adkisson, Lori Adkisson, Ryan Braswell, Melissa Braswell, Oliver\nCoppedge, Tracy Coppedge, George A. Hale III, Stephanie Hale, Jeff Langston, and\nMissy Langston (collectively, \"appellants\") have minor children who reside within\nthe area of the Blytheville School District #5 (\"District\"). The appellants applied to\ntransfer their children from the District to neighboring school districts, but the\nDistrict's Board of Directors subsequently adopted a resolution to exempt the District\nfrom the 2013 Act under § 6-18-1906(b) on the basis that the District \"is subject to\na desegregation order or mandate of a federal court of [sic] agency remedying the\neffects of past racial segregation.\" The appellants brought suit against the District,\nalleging that the district violated their constitutional rights when it resolved, for the\n2013-2014 school year, to opt-out under § 6-18-1906(b) of the Act. They sued for\nviolations of their due process and equal protection rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\nfor violations of the Arkansas Civil Rights Act. Relevant to the present appeal, the\nappellants also sought a preliminary injunction requiring the District to rescind its\nresolution declaring the exemption for the 2013-2014 school year under the Act. The\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fdistrict court1 denied the preliminary injunction, and the appellants appealed.\nFollowing oral argument, we sua sponte requested supplemental briefing on the issue\nof whether the appeal of the order denying the preliminary injunction is moot. We\nnow hold that the present appeal is moot.\n\n\n\n                                    I. Background\n       In their motion for a preliminary injunction (\"motion\"), the appellants\nrequested, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a), that the district court\nenter a preliminary injunction enjoining the District to rescind its resolution to opt out\nof the Act for the 2013-2014 school year. Because the terms of the preliminary\ninjunction are dispositive of our mootness finding, we set forth the relevant portions\nof the motion below:\n\n      Plaintiffs, in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, state:\n\n            1. The plaintiffs request that this Court enter a preliminary\n      injunction enjoining Blytheville School District No. 5 (\"Blytheville\n      School District\") to rescind its Resolution to opt out of Act 1227 of\n      2013, also known as the Arkansas Public School Choice Act of 2013\n      (the \"Act\") for the upcoming school year. FED. R. CIV. P. 65(a).\n\n             2. The plaintiffs request that the Court set this matter for hearing\n      on an expedited basis so that public school-choice transfer applications\n      may be considered under the Act before non-resident districts must\n      notify applicants of acceptances by August 1, 2013.\n\n                                          ***\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Kristine G. Baker, United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      7. Based on the facts and the law, plaintiffs’ likelihood of success\non the merits is strong.\n\n      a. Blytheville School District is a state actor under 42\n      U.S.C. § 1983 and ARK. CODE ANN. § 16-123-105(a)\n      because it is a duly created and existing school district\n      under the laws of Arkansas.\n\n      b. Blytheville School District violated plaintiffs' equal\n      protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n      United States Constitution because its Resolution was\n      arbitrary and capricious and an irrational act that denies\n      plaintiffs the right to be treated the same as other similarly\n      situated parents and children in the State of Arkansas.\n\n      c. Blytheville School District violated plaintiffs' procedural\n      due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n      United States Constitution because its Resolution deprives\n      the plaintiffs of a protected property interest without\n      adequate sufficient process.\n\n      d. Blytheville School District violated plaintiffs'\n      substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth\n      Amendment to the United States Constitution because its\n      Resolution was so completely arbitrary and capricious, and\n      made in bad faith, that it shocks the conscience and\n      frustrates plaintiffs' rights and expectations under the Act.\n\n                                   ***\n\n      11. The following exhibits are attached to this Motion:\n\n                                 ***\n      Exhibit C Board Resolution passed by the Blytheville\n      School District on April 29, 2013;\n\n                                   ***\n\n                                   -4-\n\f             WHEREFORE, and for all reasons appearing in the record,\n      plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court issue its order:\n\n             a. enjoining Blytheville School District to rescind the\n             Resolution for the upcoming school year 2013-14 pending\n             determination of the merits of this case.\n\n             b. enjoining Blytheville School District to notify all\n             adjoining school districts of the rescission of the\n             Resolution;\n\n             c. establishing an expedited briefing period and hearing on\n             this matter;\n\n             d. granting all other just and proper relief.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n                                      II. Discussion\n      We undoubtedly possess \"statutory jurisdiction over the instant appeal\"\nbecause the appellants' \"complaint states federal causes of action under . . . 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, and the appeal of the district court's [denial of the motion for] preliminary\ninjunction is permitted by 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\" Ind. Party of Richmond Cnty. v.\nGraham, 413 F.3d 252, 255 (2d Cir. 2005). Section 1291(a)(1) \"allows immediate\nappeals of '[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts . . . granting, continuing,\nmodifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify\ninjunctions.'\" Id. (alterations in original) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1)).\n\n             Statutory authority, however, is not sufficient to satisfy the\n      jurisdictional requirements of Article III of the Constitution. We are\n      empowered by Article III to render opinions only with respect to \"live\n      cases and controversies,\" meaning, among other things, that \"'if an event\n      occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,' we\n      must dismiss the case, rather than issue an advisory opinion.\" ABC, Inc.\n      v. Stewart, 360 F.3d 90, 97 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting Church of\n      Scientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S. Ct. 447, 121 L. Ed.\n      2d 313 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Irish Gay\n      and Lesbian Organization v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d 638, 648 (2d Cir.1998)\n      (emphasizing that mootness is a jurisdictional bar to review that the\n      court must recognize regardless of the parties' positions on the question).\n\nId. at 255–56.\n\n        \"[T]he appeal of a preliminary injunction is moot where the effective time\nperiod of the injunction has passed.\" Brooks v. Georgia State Bd. of Elections, 59\nF.3d 1114, 1119 (11th Cir. 1995) (emphases added); cf. Bacon v. Neer, 631 F.3d 875,\n877 (8th Cir. 2011) (\"[T]he appeal of an order denying a preliminary injunction\nbecomes moot if the act sought to be enjoined has occurred.\"); Curtis Industries, Inc.\nv. Livingston, 30 F.3d 96 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding that the question of whether a\nformer employer was entitled to a preliminary injunction commanding former\nemployees to abide by noncompetition agreements was moot because the restraint on\ncompetition, if valid, lasted only one year, and that year had passed by the time of the\nappeal).\n\n      In the present case, the relief requested in the appellants' motion for\npreliminary injunction \"was limited in its applicability to\" the April 29, 2013\nResolution and the 2013-2014 school year. Graham, 413 F.3d at 256.2 Paragraph 1\n\n      2\n        See also Pacific Ins. Co. v. Gen'l Dev. Corp., 28 F.3d 1093, 1096 (11th Cir.\n1994) (holding that \"no meaningful relief remains for us to provide\" because \"the\ninjunction we are asked to review has expired by its own terms\") Tropicana Prods.\nSales, Inc. v. Phillips Brokerage Co., 874 F.2d 1581 (11th Cir.1989) (\"[T]he express\nlimitation Tropicana's motion set for itself has divested this Court of jurisdiction over\nthe appeal.\"); Leedom Management Grp., Inc. v. Perlmutter, 532 F. App'x 893, 895\n(11th Cir. 2013) (\"There is no live case or controversy regarding these two orders. By\n\n                                          -6-\n\fof the motion asks the district court to enter a preliminary injunction enjoining the\nBlytheville District \"to rescind its Resolution to opt out\" of the 2013 Act \"for the\nupcoming school year.\" In ¶ 11, the plaintiffs make clear that by \"Resolution\" they\nmean the \"Board Resolution passed by the Blytheville School District on April 29,\n2013.\" The motion pertains only to the April 29, 2013 Resolution; nowhere in their\nmotion do the appellants ask the court to enjoin the District from passing further\nresolutions opting out of the 2013 Act. Moreover, the request for relief clarifies that\nthe appellants are seeking injunctive relief as it pertains to \"the upcoming 2013-2014\nschool year,\" not future school years. The 2013-2014 school year is complete, and we\ncannot \"undo\" the school year.\n\n       In summary, nowhere in the motion do the appellants request that the district\ncourt enjoin the District from passing further resolutions opting out of the Act in\nfuture school years, which they could have requested. By the motion's own terms, the\ntime period in which the requested relief would have been effective has expired. See\nGraham, 413 F.3d at 256.\n\n       The appellants recognized the time-sensitive nature of the relief that they\nrequested as it pertains to the 2013-2014 school year in ¶ 2 of their motion. Paragraph\n2 requested that the district court hold a hearing on the motion \"on an expedited basis\nso that public-school choice transfer applications may be considered under the Act\nbefore non-resident districts must notify applicants of acceptance by August 1, 2013.\"\nThe district court granted this request and held an expedited hearing on the motion\nprior to the August 1, 2013 deadline. But the appellants never requested an expedited\nhearing before this court, and the deadline for non-resident districts to notify\n\n\nits own terms, the preliminary injunction established by the two orders ended on\nDecember 21, 2012. Therefore, the controversy over its geographic scope is no longer\n'definite' or 'concrete,' and we cannot grant 'specific relief through a decree of a\nconclusive character.'\" (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240–41\n(1937))).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fapplicants for the 2013-2014 school year has long since passed. The challenged\nschool year is complete.\n\n       The appellants attempt \"to wedge [their] case into the mootness exception for\nclaims 'capable of repetition, yet evading review,' but this case does not fit.\" Simes\nv. Ark. Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm'n, 734 F.3d 830, 835 (8th Cir. 2013)\n(quoting Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399–400 (1975)).\n\n       \"[A] controversy is capable of repetition, yet evading review where both\n       of the following two requirements are met: (1) the challenged action [is]\n       in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or\n       expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same\n       complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.\"\n\nGraham, 413 F.3d at 256 (second, third, and fourth alterations in original) (quoting\nVan Wie v. Pataki, 267 F.3d 109, 113–14 (2d Cir. 2001)).\n\n       Neither requirement for invoking this exception to the mootness doctrine is\nsatisfied in the present case. The controversy is not \"capable of repetition\" because\nthe requested preliminary injunction pertains only to the appellants' request for an\ninjunction permitting the appellants' children to exercise their school choice rights\nunder the 2013 Act for the 2013-2014 school year, not future school years. And, there\nis no reasonable expectation that the appellants will be subject to the same action\nagain with regard to the 2013-2014 school year, as that school year is complete. As\nthe District points out, the issues implicated by the district court's denial of the motion\nfor preliminary injunction do not \"evade review\" \"because [a]ppellants' request for\ndeclaratory relief and for a permanent injunction raise the same underlying legal\nquestions that remain pending before the district court.\" This means that \"[t]he issues\nraised by [a]ppellants' request for permanent relief can be fully litigated before the\ndistrict court and, following the entry of final judgment in that court, can be reviewed\non appeal in this Court.\"\n\n                                           -8-\n\f      Finally, the appellants try to evade a mootness finding by arguing that \"the\nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief is not limited to a past event but includes 'all\nother just and proper relief.'\" This argument fails because the clear terms of the\nmotion—which the appellants crafted—state that the motion pertains to the April 29,\n2013 Resolution and the 2013-2014 school year.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n      Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as moot.\n\nCOLLOTON, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n\n       Although the question is close, I concur in the judgment on the ground that\nwhile this controversy is “capable of repetition” in relation to the 2014-15 school\nyear, the controversy need not “evade review” if the plaintiffs seek prompt rulings in\nthe district court and expedited appellate review on claims for preliminary injunctive\nor permanent injunctive and declaratory relief.

The \"exemptions under the 2013 Act are limited to individual school\ndistricts that are subject to federal desegregation mandates.\" Teague, 720 F.3d at 977\nn.2.\n\n       Heath Adkisson, Lori Adkisson, Ryan Braswell, Melissa Braswell, Oliver\nCoppedge, Tracy Coppedge, George A. Hale III, Stephanie Hale, Jeff Langston, and\nMissy Langston (collectively, \"appellants\") have minor children who reside within\nthe area of the Blytheville School District #5 (\"District\"). The appellants applied to\ntransfer their children from the District to neighboring school districts, but the\nDistrict's Board of Directors subsequently adopted a resolution to exempt the District\nfrom the 2013 Act under § 6-18-1906(b) on the basis that the District \"is subject to\na desegregation order or mandate of a federal court of [sic] agency remedying the\neffects of past racial segregation.\" The appellants brought suit against the District,\nalleging that the district violated their constitutional rights when it resolved, for the\n2013-2014 school year, to opt-out under § 6-18-1906(b) of the Act. They sued for\nviolations of their due process and equal protection rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\nfor violations of the Arkansas Civil Rights Act. Relevant to the present appeal, the\nappellants also sought a preliminary injunction requiring the District to rescind its\nresolution declaring the exemption for the 2013-2014 school year under the Act. The\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fdistrict court1 denied the preliminary injunction, and the appellants appealed.\nFollowing oral argument, we sua sponte requested supplemental briefing on the issue\nof whether the appeal of the order denying the preliminary injunction is moot. We\nnow hold that the present appeal is moot.\n\n\n\n                                    I. Background\n       In their motion for a preliminary injunction (\"motion\"), the appellants\nrequested, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a), that the district court\nenter a preliminary injunction enjoining the District to rescind its resolution to opt out\nof the Act for the 2013-2014 school year. Because the terms of the preliminary\ninjunction are dispositive of our mootness finding, we set forth the relevant portions\nof the motion below:\n\n      Plaintiffs, in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, state:\n\n            1. The plaintiffs request that this Court enter a preliminary\n      injunction enjoining Blytheville School District No. 5 (\"Blytheville\n      School District\") to rescind its Resolution to opt out of Act 1227 of\n      2013, also known as the Arkansas Public School Choice Act of 2013\n      (the \"Act\") for the upcoming school year. FED. R. CIV. P. 65(a).\n\n             2. The plaintiffs request that the Court set this matter for hearing\n      on an expedited basis so that public school-choice transfer applications\n      may be considered under the Act before non-resident districts must\n      notify applicants of acceptances by August 1, 2013.\n\n                                          ***\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Kristine G. Baker, United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      7. Based on the facts and the law, plaintiffs’ likelihood of success\non the merits is strong.\n\n      a. Blytheville School District is a state actor under 42\n      U.S.C. § 1983 and ARK. CODE ANN. § 16-123-105(a)\n      because it is a duly created and existing school district\n      under the laws of Arkansas.\n\n      b. Blytheville School District violated plaintiffs' equal\n      protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n      United States Constitution because its Resolution was\n      arbitrary and capricious and an irrational act that denies\n      plaintiffs the right to be treated the same as other similarly\n      situated parents and children in the State of Arkansas.\n\n      c. Blytheville School District violated plaintiffs' procedural\n      due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n      United States Constitution because its Resolution deprives\n      the plaintiffs of a protected property interest without\n      adequate sufficient process.\n\n      d. Blytheville School District violated plaintiffs'\n      substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth\n      Amendment to the United States Constitution because its\n      Resolution was so completely arbitrary and capricious, and\n      made in bad faith, that it shocks the conscience and\n      frustrates plaintiffs' rights and expectations under the Act.\n\n                                   ***\n\n      11. The following exhibits are attached to this Motion:\n\n                                 ***\n      Exhibit C Board Resolution passed by the Blytheville\n      School District on April 29, 2013;\n\n                                   ***\n\n                                   -4-\n\f             WHEREFORE, and for all reasons appearing in the record,\n      plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court issue its order:\n\n             a. enjoining Blytheville School District to rescind the\n             Resolution for the upcoming school year 2013-14 pending\n             determination of the merits of this case.\n\n             b. enjoining Blytheville School District to notify all\n             adjoining school districts of the rescission of the\n             Resolution;\n\n             c. establishing an expedited briefing period and hearing on\n             this matter;\n\n             d. granting all other just and proper relief.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n                                      II.

Moreover, the request for relief clarifies that\nthe appellants are seeking injunctive relief as it pertains to \"the upcoming 2013-2014\nschool year,\" not future school years. The 2013-2014 school year is complete, and we\ncannot \"undo\" the school year.\n\n       In summary, nowhere in the motion do the appellants request that the district\ncourt enjoin the District from passing further resolutions opting out of the Act in\nfuture school years, which they could have requested. By the motion's own terms, the\ntime period in which the requested relief would have been effective has expired. See\nGraham, 413 F.3d at 256.\n\n       The appellants recognized the time-sensitive nature of the relief that they\nrequested as it pertains to the 2013-2014 school year in ¶ 2 of their motion. Paragraph\n2 requested that the district court hold a hearing on the motion \"on an expedited basis\nso that public-school choice transfer applications may be considered under the Act\nbefore non-resident districts must notify applicants of acceptance by August 1, 2013.\"\nThe district court granted this request and held an expedited hearing on the motion\nprior to the August 1, 2013 deadline. But the appellants never requested an expedited\nhearing before this court, and the deadline for non-resident districts to notify\n\n\nits own terms, the preliminary injunction established by the two orders ended on\nDecember 21, 2012. Therefore, the controversy over its geographic scope is no longer\n'definite' or 'concrete,' and we cannot grant 'specific relief through a decree of a\nconclusive character.'\" (quoting Aetna Life Ins.

The controversy is not \"capable of repetition\" because\nthe requested preliminary injunction pertains only to the appellants' request for an\ninjunction permitting the appellants' children to exercise their school choice rights\nunder the 2013 Act for the 2013-2014 school year, not future school years. And, there\nis no reasonable expectation that the appellants will be subject to the same action\nagain with regard to the 2013-2014 school year, as that school year is complete. As\nthe District points out, the issues implicated by the district court's denial of the motion\nfor preliminary injunction do not \"evade review\" \"because [a]ppellants' request for\ndeclaratory relief and for a permanent injunction raise the same underlying legal\nquestions that remain pending before the district court.\" This means that \"[t]he issues\nraised by [a]ppellants' request for permanent relief can be fully litigated before the\ndistrict court and, following the entry of final judgment in that court, can be reviewed\non appeal in this Court.\"\n\n                                           -8-\n\f      Finally, the appellants try to evade a mootness finding by arguing that \"the\nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief is not limited to a past event but includes 'all\nother just and proper relief.'\" This argument fails because the clear terms of the\nmotion—which the appellants crafted—state that the motion pertains to the April 29,\n2013 Resolution and the 2013-2014 school year.\n\n                                III.
