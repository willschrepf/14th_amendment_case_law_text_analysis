Introduction\n\n     In three issues, Appellant American Homeowner Preservation Fund, LP\n\n(American) appeals a judgment declaring null and void its lien on property\n\fpurchased by Appellee Brian J. Pirkle at a tax-foreclosure sale, declaring null and\n\nvoid a note executed by Cathy Lewis1 and secured by the property, dismissing\n\nAmerican’s constitutional takings claims against the taxing authorities involved in\n\nthe foreclosure sale, and awarding attorney’s fees to Pirkle. We modify the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment and affirm the judgment as modified.\n\n                                   II. Factual History\n\n      On October 20, 2003, Lewis executed a note and deed of trust in favor of\n\nAvailable Mortgage Funding, LLC (AMF) secured by property located at 5700\n\nCalloway Street, Fort Worth. The deed of trust was filed of record ten days later,\n\nperfecting AMF’s security interest in the property. See Tex. Prop. Code Ann.\n\n§§ 13.001–.002 (West 2014).\n\n      In 2009, the note and deed of trust were assigned to Stewardship Fund\n\nNo. 3, LP (SF3) by Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS),\n\nacting solely as nominee for AMF. This assignment was filed of record shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n      One year later, on August 27, 2010, Appellees Tarrant County, the Tarrant\n\nCounty Hospital District, the City of Sansom Park, and the Tarrant County\n\nCommunity College District (collectively, the taxing authorities) filed a delinquent-\n\nproperty-tax suit. In that suit, the taxing authorities named only Lewis and MERS\n\nas defendants. SF3, the lienholder of record at the time the delinquent-tax suit\n\n\n      1\n       Cathy Lewis is not a party to this appeal.\n\n                                         2\n\fwas filed, was not named as a defendant, nor was SF3 ever made a party to the\n\nlawsuit.2\n\n      On April 26, 2012, the trial court entered judgment against Lewis and\n\nMERS, authorizing the sale of the property to satisfy the tax liens.          At the\n\nsubsequent tax-foreclosure sale, which occurred on August 7, 2012, Pirkle\n\npurchased the property. The constable’s deed, which acknowledged the tax sale\n\nand purported to convey free and clear title to Pirkle, was recorded on August 27,\n\n2012. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 34.01(m) (West 2015).\n\n      Two months after the deed was recorded, on October 31, 2012, SF3\n\nassigned all of its rights, title, and interest in the property to American. American\n\ncontends that it took the assignment without notice of the tax suit or the tax sale,\n\neven though the constable’s deed had been on file in the deed records for 65\n\ndays prior to the assignment and the tax suit had been on file for 2 years and 65\n\ndays prior to the assignment.\n\n      Pirkle was first introduced to American by a letter from American’s counsel\n\ndated January 15, 2013, the same day that American filed its assignment from\n\nSF3 in the deed records of Tarrant County. This letter notified Pirkle that SF3’s\n\nnote and deed of trust had been assigned to American and that American now\n\nclaimed a lien against Pirkle’s property, a lien that American believed survived\n\n\n      2\n       It is undisputed that SF3 did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit or the\ntax sale.\n\n\n                                         3\n\fthe tax sale because the taxing authorities had failed to join SF3 as a party to the\n\ntax suit.\n\n                             III. Procedural History\n\n       On February 15, 2013, American sent a notice of default to Lewis\n\ndescribing Lewis’s default under the terms of the note, notifying Lewis that\n\nAmerican had accelerated the note, and demanding payment of the entire\n\nbalance due on the note.3 After Lewis failed to pay as demanded, American\n\nprepared for a nonjudicial foreclosure of its interest in the property and posted\n\nthe property for foreclosure sale to occur on Tuesday, April 2, 2013. See Tex.\n\nProp. Code Ann. § 51.002 (West 2014).\n\n       The day before the foreclosure sale, Pirkle filed a lawsuit seeking a\n\ntemporary restraining order (TRO) and temporary injunction to stay the\n\nforeclosure proceedings. The trial court granted the TRO, and 14 days later, it\n\nsigned a temporary injunction enjoining American from proceeding with the\n\nnonjudicial foreclosure sale on the property.\n\n       On May 2, 2013, American answered the lawsuit and asserted a\n\ncounterclaim for judicial foreclosure of its security interest. Within a month, both\n\nsides had filed competing summary judgment motions, which were heard on\n\nAugust 29, 2013. On September 30, the trial court signed an order granting\n\npartial summary judgment in favor of Pirkle, denying American’s summary\n\n\n       3\n        American claimed Lewis owed $99,901.71 on the note.\n\n                                         4\n\fjudgment motion, and declaring that: (1) the constable’s deed conveying title to\n\nPirkle was a valid deed; (2) American’s rights under the deed of trust were\n\nextinguished by the tax sale; (3) American’s rights under the note were\n\nextinguished by the tax sale; and (4) American’s claim or lien on the property was\n\nextinguished and otherwise null and void.\n\n        The September 30 summary judgment remained interlocutory because it\n\ndid not dispose of Pirkle’s claim for attorney’s fees, and on January 31, 2014, the\n\ntrial court signed an order permitting American to file a third-party petition against\n\nthe taxing authorities. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 38(a). American’s third-party petition,\n\nfiled on March 7, 2014, added the taxing authorities4 to the lawsuit as third-party\n\ndefendants, suing for damages for an unconstitutional taking of the property\n\nunder article I of the Texas Constitution and for an “invalidation of the [t]ax [s]uit\n\n[j]udgment and subsequent [t]ax [s]ale” under Texas Government Code chapter\n\n2007.\n\n        On June 26, 2014, the trial court granted the taxing authorities’ plea to the\n\njurisdiction. The final judgment in this case was signed on August 14, 2014,\n\nincorporating and merging the interlocutory orders into the final judgment and\n\nawarding to Pirkle attorney’s fees in the amount of $35,000.\n\n\n\n        4\n        American also named Castleberry Independent School District, which had\nintervened in the original tax-delinquency suit as a third-party defendant prior to\nthe judgment and tax sale. Castleberry was subsequently nonsuited and is not a\nparty to this appeal. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 162.\n\n                                          5\n\f                                  IV. Discussion\n\n      American brings three issues on appeal.          In its first issue, American\n\nchallenges the trial court’s rulings on the competing summary judgment motions.\n\nIn its second issue, American alternatively complains that if the trial court\n\ncorrectly granted Pirkle’s motion, then the taxing authorities are liable for an\n\nunconstitutional taking of its extinguished lienholder’s rights.    And in its third\n\nissue, American contends that the trial court erred by awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nPirkle when no evidence was presented on the segregation of attorney’s fees\n\nbetween the various parties involved and causes of action asserted.\n\nA. Pirkle’s Summary Judgment\n\n      In its first issue, American challenges the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nrulings on the basis that the trial court “effectively rul[ed] that a tax foreclosure\n\nsale extinguishes an existing lien against real property despite the fact that the\n\nlienholder of record was not a party to, nor provided notice of, the underlying\n\ndelinquent tax lawsuit,” and that American established as a matter of law its\n\nentitlement to judicial foreclosure. American also argues that the trial court erred\n\nby granting declaratory relief on the underlying note.5\n\n\n      5\n        American further argues that Pirkle failed to submit competent summary\njudgment evidence and that the trial court erred by overruling American’s\nobjections to the summary judgment evidence that Pirkle did submit, but based\non our resolution below, we do not reach this sub-issue. See Tex. R. App. P.\n47.1. We do note, however, that the trial court had before it competing motions\nfor summary judgment filed by both parties on a pure question of law, that neither\nside contends that a fact issue precluded the granting of summary judgment, and\nthat all of the facts necessary to decide the legal issue before this court are\n                                         6\n\f      1. Summary Judgment on the Lewis Note\n\n      Because the note represented Lewis’s promise to pay the lender and any\n\nassignees of the note the amounts due and because Pirkle had no interest under\n\nthe note, American argues that no justiciable controversy existed between Pirkle\n\nand American with respect to the Lewis note. Therefore, American argues, the\n\ntrial court erred by declaring that the note was “null and void and has no force\n\nand effect.” American is correct.\n\n      Under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, “[a] court of record within\n\nits jurisdiction has power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations\n\nwhether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\nAnn. § 37.003(a) (West 2015). However, a declaratory judgment is appropriate\n\nonly if a justiciable controversy exists as to the rights and status of the parties.\n\nBonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995).             Because\n\nLewis was not a party to this suit, and Pirkle had no interest with regard to the\n\nnote, there was no justiciable controversy between Pirkle and American\n\nregarding the validity of Lewis’s note.      See id.   Therefore, the trial court’s\n\n\nundisputed by both American and Pirkle and included in their briefs on appeal.\nSee Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(g) (stating that in civil cases, “the court will accept as\ntrue the facts stated unless another party contradicts them”). We also note that\nbecause both motions were properly before the court at the time summary\njudgment was granted on Pirkle’s motion, all of the evidence accompanying\nAmerican’s summary judgment motion could have been considered by the trial\ncourt in deciding Pirkle’s motion, and vice versa. See FM Props. Operating Co.\nv. City of Austin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex. 2000); DeBord v. Muller, 446 S.W.2d\n299, 301 (Tex. 1969).\n\n                                         7\n\fdeclaration regarding the validity of the Lewis note was improper under these\n\ncircumstances, and we sustain this part of American’s first issue.\n\n      2. Effect of the Tax Foreclosure Sale on SF3’s and American’s Lien\n\n      American argues that, pursuant to rule of civil procedure 39, SF3 was a\n\nnecessary and indispensable party to the delinquent tax suit, and because SF3\n\nwas not joined as a party to the lawsuit, American was therefore not bound by\n\nthe judgment or tax sale that followed. According to American, Pirkle purchased\n\nthe property at the tax sale subject to SF3’s lien. Then when SF3 assigned all of\n\nits rights, title, and interest to the property to American three months later,\n\nAmerican stood in the shoes of SF3 with full authority to enforce and foreclose\n\nupon the lien on Pirkle’s property.\n\n      Pirkle frames the issue differently. Notwithstanding the fact that SF3 was\n\nneither aware of nor made a party to the underlying delinquent-tax lawsuit, Pirkle\n\ncontends that because the property was acquired at a tax sale, his ownership\n\ninterest came with certain statutory protections. American learned of Pirkle’s\n\nownership interest and the circumstances under which he had acquired the\n\nproperty within at least six months of the recording of Pirkle’s deed.6 Pirkle\n\ncontends that once American became aware of the tax sale, it was incumbent\n\nupon American to comply with the requirements of the tax code in order to\n\nchallenge Pirkle’s claim. Instead, American chose to proceed with foreclosure,\n\n      6\n       On January 15, 2013, American sent its first letter to Pirkle in which it\ndiscussed the tax sale.\n\n                                        8\n\fnotwithstanding the tax code’s provisions. Pirkle argues that American’s refusal\n\nto follow the statutory scheme regarding tax-sale challenges barred any recovery\n\nagainst Pirkle by American and, pursuant to section 33.54 of the tax code, on\n\nAugust 28, 2013, Pirkle owned the property free and clear of American’s\n\npurported lien.\n\n             a. Tax Code Provisions\n\n      The tax code provides a statutory framework through which a challenge to\n\na tax sale may be instituted against a purchaser at the sale. Section 34.08,\n\n“Challenge to Validity of Tax Sale,” provides:\n\n      (a) A person may not commence an action that challenges the\n      validity of a tax sale under this chapter unless the person:\n\n             (1) deposits into the registry of the court an amount equal to\n             the amount of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest\n             specified in the judgment of foreclosure obtained against the\n             property plus all costs of the tax sale; . . .\n\n             ....\n\n      (b) A person may not commence an action challenging the validity of\n      a tax sale after the time set forth in Section 33.54(a)(1) . . . against a\n      subsequent purchaser for value who acquired the property in\n      reliance on the tax sale. The purchaser may conclusively presume\n      that the tax sale was valid and shall have full title to the property free\n      and clear of the right, title, and interest of any person that arose\n      before the tax sale . . . .\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 34.08 (West 2015) (emphasis added). Tax code\n\nsection 33.54, “Limitation on Actions Relating to Property Sold for Taxes,”\n\nfurther provides:\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f        (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), an action relating to the\n        title to property may not be maintained against the purchaser of the\n        property at a tax sale unless the action commenced:\n\n                 (1) before the first anniversary of the date that the deed\n                 executed to the purchaser at the tax sale is filed of record; . . .\n\n                 ....\n\n        (c) When actions are barred by this section, the purchaser at the tax\n        sale . . . has full title to the property, precluding all other claims.\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54 (West 2015) (emphasis added).\n\n        Pursuant to these statutes, in order to challenge the validity of the tax sale\n\nor Pirkle’s right to the property free and clear of liens, American was required to:\n\n(1) commence an action against Pirkle no later than August 27, 2013, the one-\n\nyear anniversary of the tax-sale-deed recordation and (2) prior to commencing\n\nthe action, make a deposit into the registry of the court in an amount equal to the\n\namount of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest, plus all costs of the tax\n\nsale.       See id. §§ 33.54(a)(1), 34.08(a)(1).     Pirkle argues that American was\n\nrequired to do both, and American admits that it did neither.7 Therefore, unless\n\nAmerican was not subject to the statutory requirements for challenging a tax sale\n\nor a tax-sale purchaser’s title, by the one-year anniversary of the recording of the\n\nsale—August 28, 2013—Pirkle could have conclusively presumed that the tax\n\n        7\n        American argues that it “never filed suit to set aside the judgment\nrendered in the underlying tax suit . . . because it was not required to do so in\norder to protect and enforce its rights in the Property.” It further argues, “More\nimportantly, [American] was not subject to the ‘prerequisites’ imposed by Tax\nCode §34.08 and is not barred thereby from taking legal action to enforce its\nrights in the Property.”\n\n                                             10\n\fsale was valid and that he was vested with full title to the property free and clear\n\nof American’s purported lien. See id. § 34.08(b).\n\n      To support its assertion that it was not required to comply with the\n\nmandates of the tax code, American relies primarily on Security State Bank &\n\nTrust v. Bexar County. 397 S.W.3d 715, 722 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2012, pet.\n\ndenied) (op. on reh’g). In Security State Bank, the bank—a lienholder of record\n\nat the time the tax suit and sale occurred that had not received notice of, nor\n\nbeen made a party to, the delinquent tax lawsuit—brought a lawsuit challenging\n\nthe tax sale. Id. at 717–18. The bank’s challenge did not comply with the tax\n\ncode in two respects: (1) the lawsuit was filed four days after the one-year\n\nlimitations period had run and (2) the deposit was not filed prior to, but rather 55\n\ndays after, the bank’s lawsuit had been filed. Id. at 720–21. Nevertheless, after\n\nconsidering the bank’s due-process arguments, the court held that the bank’s\n\nchallenge was proper, independent of the tax code, and that the tax judgment\n\nand tax sale were void as to the bank. Id. at 724. In so holding, the court drew a\n\ndistinction between the facts of its case and the line of cases that have held that\n\nregardless of the merits of a tax sale challenge, the challenger must bring its suit\n\nwithin the tax code’s limitations period and make the required deposit prior to\n\nfiling the suit. Id. (“These cases are distinguishable, however, because none\n\ninvolved a record lienholder with a prior lien against the property.”).\n\n      The distinction between a purported owner and a record lienholder\n\nbecomes significant in the context of tax-sale challenges because of the\n\n                                         11\n\fapplication of the tax code’s tolling provision as to limitations. The tax code\n\nprovides that the one-year limitation for challenging a tax sale can be tolled by a\n\nparty who continues to pay taxes on the property up until the party’s challenge is\n\nmade.8 As upheld by our sister court, the requirement that a property owner\n\nchallenge the tax sale within the one-year time limit or, in the alternative,\n\ncontinue to pay property taxes, which tolls limitations, is not unreasonable. W.L.\n\nPickens Grandchildren’s Joint Venture v. DOH Oil Co., 281 S.W.3d 116, 121\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2008, pet. denied). After all, even if a property owner is\n\nunaware of the foreclosure, he or she should continue to pay property taxes. Id.\n\nThis explains why—regardless of whether he or she is named and served with\n\ncitation in a tax suit—the tax code does not work to deny an owner the\n\nopportunity to challenge the tax sale.        See id.; see also John K. Harrison\n\nHoldings, LLC v. Strauss, 221 S.W.3d 785, 789 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2007,\n\npet. denied) (“It is reasonable to expect one claiming an ownership in property to\n\npay the taxes on the property to avoid the limitations bar.”).\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       Tax code section 33.54(b) provides,\n\n      If a person other than the purchaser at the tax sale . . . pays taxes\n      on the property during the applicable limitations period and until the\n      commencement of an action challenging the validity of the tax sale\n      and that person was not served citation in the suit to foreclose the\n      tax lien, [the] limitations period does not apply to that person.\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54(b).\n\n                                         12\n\f       This rationale does not necessarily hold true for lienholders, however. A\n\nlienholder, who is not ordinarily liable for payment of taxes on the property, would\n\nnot be in the same position as an owner who, perhaps unwittingly, tolls the\n\nlimitations period simply by carrying on in the normal course through the payment\n\nof property taxes as they become due. In recognition of this distinction, the court\n\nin Security State Bank rejected the notion that the bank in that case, which was a\n\nlienholder “at the time the delinquent tax suit was filed” rather than a property\n\nowner, was precluded from collaterally attacking the tax sale, independent of the\n\ntax code provisions. 397 S.W.3d at 721–25. Under the facts of Security State\n\nBank and the cases Security State Bank cites in support of its holding, the\n\nlienholder received no notice of the lawsuit and had no opportunity to toll\n\nlimitations through payment of property taxes. Id. The facts of our case are quite\n\ndifferent.\n\n       Unlike the lienholder in Security State Bank—which had an existing lien\n\nagainst the property at the time the delinquent tax suit was filed and when the\n\nsale occurred and was deprived of notice of these events—American acquired its\n\nlien on the property with full notice of the delinquent tax lawsuit, the judgment\n\nresulting from the lawsuit that authorized the tax sale, and the resulting tax sale\n\nitself. As of October 31, 2012, the date American received its assignment from\n\nSF3, the constable’s deed had been on file in the deed records for 65 days, the\n\njudgment ordering the tax sale had been on file for 188 days, and the tax suit had\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fbeen on file for 2 years and 65 days prior to the assignment.9 The holding in\n\nSecurity State Bank is therefore distinguishable on its facts.\n\n      In this case, well within the limitations period and armed with actual\n\nknowledge of Pirkle’s purchase of the property at the tax sale and at least\n\ngeneral awareness of the existence of the Texas Tax Code,10 American made a\n\nconscious decision not to comply with the statutory framework created by the\n\nTexas Legislature to be followed in these very circumstances. American chose\n\nnot to make the required statutory deposit. American chose not to file suit within\n\nthe statutory limitations period or, in the alternative—even if it was already\n\nengaged in litigation with Pirkle—to toll limitations through the interim payment of\n\nproperty taxes. Instead, from the outset, American held steadfast to its position\n\nthat it was exempt from the law.\n\n      To support its position, American claims status in the underlying lawsuit as\n\na necessary party under rule of civil procedure 39. Rule 39, “Joinder of Persons\n\nNeeded for Just Adjudication,” requires service and joinder of persons whose\n\n      9\n       The property code provides that an “instrument that is properly recorded\nin the proper county . . . is notice to all persons of the existence of the\ninstrument.” Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 13.002(1); Aston Meadows, Ltd. v. Devon\nEnergy Prod. Co., 359 S.W.3d 856, 859 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2012, pet.\ndenied). Once the constable’s deed was properly filed in the deed records of\nTarrant County, an irrebuttable presumption of notice arose as to Pirkle’s\nownership of the property free and clear of all liens. Aston Meadows, 359\nS.W.3d at 859; see also Ford v. Exxon Mobil Chem. Co., 235 S.W.3d 615, 617\n(Tex. 2007).\n      10\n         American references the tax code in its January 15, 2013 demand letter\nto Pirkle.\n\n                                         14\n\finterests would be affected by a judgment. Tex. R. Civ. P. 39(a). When a person\n\nclaims an interest relating to the subject matter of an action, and “is so situated\n\nthat the disposition of the action in his absence may . . . as a practical matter\n\nimpair or impede his ability to protect that interest,” rule 39 compels his joinder in\n\nthe action. Security State Bank, 397 S.W.3d at 722 (quoting Tex. R. Civ. P. 39);\n\nsee also Brooks v. Northglen Ass’n, 141 S.W.3d 158, 162 (Tex. 2004) (“Rule\n\n39(a)(1) requires the presence of all persons who have an interest in the litigation\n\nso that any relief awarded will effectively and completely adjudicate the\n\ndispute.”).\n\n      In the context of delinquent-tax suits, Texas courts have generally held that\n\nbecause a record lienholder possesses a significant interest in the property\n\nsubject to foreclosure, a lienholder is a necessary party who must be joined in\n\nthe suit to be bound by it. Security State Bank, 397 S.W.3d at 722; Mem’l Park\n\nMed. Ctr., Inc. v. River Bend Dev. Grp., L.P., 264 S.W.3d 810, 814 (Tex. App.—\n\nEastland 2008, no pet.); Jordan v. Bustamante, 158 S.W.3d 29, 38–39 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied); Murphee Prop. Holdings, Ltd. v.\n\nSunbelt Sav. Ass’n of Tex., 817 S.W.2d 850, 852–53 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1991, no writ). These courts have further held that the absence of the\n\nlienholder from the tax suit will render the tax sale invalid as to the lienholder.\n\nSecurity State Bank, 397 S.W.3d at 722–24. At the time of the lawsuit and\n\nsubsequent tax sale, American had no interest in the property that would be\n\naffected by the judgment.\n\n                                         15\n\f      It is undisputed that SF3 was the record lienholder on the property at the\n\ntime of the tax sale. As such, SF3 should have been joined in the lawsuit as a\n\nparty and afforded an opportunity to protect its property interest. See id. at 721–\n\n22. Because it was not joined in the delinquent tax lawsuit, SF3 was not legally\n\nbound by the judgment or the tax sale. See id. at 724. Following Security State\n\nBank, SF3 could have side-stepped the mandates of the tax code and collaterally\n\nattacked the tax judgment to set aside both the judgment and tax sale as to its\n\nlien interest. See id. at 724–25.\n\n      But SF3 did not do this. Instead, three months after the tax sale, SF3\n\nassigned its lien to American, which, as discussed above, purchased the\n\nassignment with an irrebuttable presumption of notice of the intervening tax sale.\n\nSee Ford, 235 S.W.3d at 617; Aston Meadows, 359 S.W.3d at 859.               Since\n\nAmerican was not a record lienholder and had no ownership interest in the\n\nproperty at the time of the tax judgment and tax sale, American possessed no\n\ndue-process rights to notice or service of the delinquent-tax lawsuit or the\n\nsubsequent sale.     American was afforded its own due process rights as a\n\nsubsequent purchaser of SF3’s interest in the property when it purchased the\n\nassignment with notice of the intervening tax sale. Whether American, as SF3’s\n\nsuccessor in interest, could likewise disregard the tax code depends wholly upon\n\nwhether American has standing to assert SF3’s right to due process.\n\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f             b. Due Process\n\n      Generally speaking, a party has no standing to set aside a tax sale based\n\nupon the failure to join other necessary or indispensable parties in the\n\ndelinquent-tax lawsuit. Jordan, 158 S.W.3d at 39 (citing Sweed v. City of El\n\nPaso, No. 08-00-00195-CV, 2001 WL 1469071, at *2 (Tex. App.—El Paso Nov.\n\n20, 2001, pet. denied) (not designated for publication) (holding failure to join all\n\ninterested parties in delinquent-tax suit did not deprive trial court of power to\n\nrender valid judgment against those actually named, and appellant had no\n\nstanding to assert any rights on behalf of third party)); see also Murmur Corp. v.\n\nBd. of Adjustment, 718 S.W.2d 790, 793 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1986, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (holding subsequent purchaser of property had no standing to complain of\n\nlack of notice to former owner). American argues that it has standing because,\n\nas SF3’s assignee, American “effectively stands in the shoes of SF3” to assert its\n\nclaims against the taxing authorities.\n\n      Whether American’s presumption is correct, however, is not so clear.\n\nAssuming without holding that the assignment purported to convey the right to\n\nsue generally, whether a lienholder’s right to challenge a tax judgment and sale\n\nbased upon due-process violations is assignable at all appears to be an issue of\n\nfirst impression in Texas.\n\n      It is axiomatic that an assignee stands in the shoes of its predecessor in\n\ninterest, and, at first blush, this general principle should end the inquiry. Indeed,\n\nin its brief, American reaches this conclusion in one sentence, with no scrutiny of\n\n                                         17\n\fthe basis for that conclusion. In fact, the entire premise regarding standing to\n\nsue for another’s due-process violations is glossed over by American without a\n\nsingle citation to authority and simply a recitation that SF3 “assigned, granted,\n\ntransferred and conveyed all of SF3’s rights, title and interest in the Note and\n\nDeed of Trust to [American].”\n\n      We start with the general rule that causes of action are freely assignable\n\nin Texas. City of Brownsville ex rel. Pub. Utils. Bd. v. AEP Tex. Cent. Co., 348\n\nS.W.3d 348, 358 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied). However, exceptions\n\nhave been carved out of this general rule, mostly in situations when “the\n\nparticular assignment presents specific dangers, such as jury confusion, the\n\nmultiplication of disputes, and potential prejudice to the parties.” HSBC Bank\n\nUSA, N.A. v. Watson, 377 S.W.3d 766, 774 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet.\n\ndism’d) (citing State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Gandy, 925 S.W.2d 696, 707–11\n\n(Tex. 1996)).\n\n      Although not a delinquent-tax suit, the facts of HSBC are somewhat similar\n\nand its analysis is instructive to this case. See id. at 770–71, 774–75. HSBC\n\ninvolved an attempt to set aside a default judgment that voided a lien and deed of\n\ntrust on the grounds that the prior lienholder had not been served or made a\n\nparty to the underlying lawsuit. Id. at 770. Like American, the appellant in HSBC\n\nhad no then-existing right or interest at the time of the judgment. Id. HSBC, who\n\ntook the lien by assignment postjudgment, brought a bill of review and asserted\n\nstanding to challenge the judgment by asserting a violation of the prior\n\n                                       18\n\flienholder’s due-process rights, just as American does in this case. Id. at 770–\n\n71, 773–74. And in HSBC, as in this case, the appellees argued that only the\n\nparty whose due-process rights were violated had standing to assert those rights.\n\nId. at 774.\n\n      In permitting the subsequent lienholder to pursue the bill of review, the\n\ncourt held that, in the absence of policy reasons forbidding the particular\n\nassignment, the policy of the state would be to permit it. Id. at 775. Because the\n\nassignment to HSBC was not “inimical to public policy,” the court allowed HSBC\n\nto step into the shoes of its predecessor in interest and pursue its predecessor’s\n\ndue-process-violation claim. Id.\n\n      We agree with the analysis of HSBC, and the question now becomes—is\n\nthere a public policy reason to forbid the due-process claim assignment in this\n\nparticular case? We believe there is.\n\n      As the supreme court explained in Gandy, a deceptive-trade-practices-act\n\n(DTPA) case, the question of assignability of causes of action has its roots in\n\nequity, not law. 925 S.W.2d at 705–15. At early common law, a cause of action\n\ncould not be assigned.       Id. at 705–06.      This common law rule against\n\nassignability was believed to be rooted in two equitable principles. Id. at 706.\n\nFirst, the bar served as a guard against the proliferation of lawsuits and unethical\n\npractices, and, second, common law regarded rights as personal to the holder,\n\nconsidering the individuals and circumstances involved, such that rights and\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\fobligations could not be enforced apart from their context without risking\n\ndistortion. Id.\n\n      The supreme court further explained that as early as the fifteenth century,\n\nthis common law bar began to give way to the demands of commerce that\n\nassigned debts should be enforceable, and by the eighteenth century, it had\n\ncollapsed with regard to debts and contract rights. Id. The only remnants of the\n\ncommon law bar against assignability of causes of action that survived in\n\nAmerican common law were those pertaining to some torts, and by 1895, even\n\npersonal-injury claims became assignable in Texas. Id. at 706–07 (citing Beech\n\nAircraft Corp. v. Jinkins, 739 S.W.2d 19, 22 (Tex. 1987)). The supreme court\n\nexplained that while “practicalities of the modern world” have now made the\n\nassignability of causes of action the general rule, the “common law’s reservations\n\nto alienability” have not been entirely dispelled, nor has the “role of equity or\n\npolicy” been displaced in shaping the rule, such that even today, contractual\n\nassignments may be “inoperative on grounds of public policy.” Id. at 707.\n\n      The court outlined four instances in which it has held the assignment of a\n\ncause of action invalid, each of which was based on equitable principles and\n\n“historical reservations.” Id. These four instances are (1) the assignment of legal\n\nmalpractice claims, as “demean[ing to] the legal profession,” Zuniga v. Groce,\n\nLocke & Hebdon, 878 S.W.2d 313, 314, 317–18 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1994,\n\nwrit ref’d); (2) the assignment to settling defendants of a part of a plaintiff’s claim\n\nagainst nonsettling defendants—“Mary Carter” agreements—as void against\n\n                                          20\n\fpublic policy due to the tendency to promote litigation rather than settle it and the\n\ndistorting effect such agreements have on the rights of nonsettling defendants,\n\nElbaor v. Smith, 845 S.W.2d 240, 242, 246–50 (Tex. 1992); (3) the assignment to\n\none tortfeasor of rights to prosecute against a joint tortfeasor as unenforceable\n\ndue to its tendency to confuse the jury and prejudice the rights of the remaining\n\nparties, Int’l Proteins Corp. v. Ralston–Purina Co., 744 S.W.2d 932, 933–34 (Tex.\n\n1988); and (4) the particular assignment of an interest in an estate, due to its\n\ndistorting effect at trial and its effect of depriving other parties of their rights,\n\nTrevino v. Turcotte, 564 S.W.2d 682, 684–88 (Tex. 1978). Id. at 707–11.\n\n      The court then turned to the facts of Gandy, stating,\n\n      The common law’s concerns about alienability of choses in action,\n      voiced by Lord Coke and Holmes, echo in our own decisions. In\n      widely different contexts we have invalidated assignments of choses\n      in action that tend to increase and distort litigation. We have never\n      upheld assignments in the face of those concerns. With these\n      things in mind, we turn to the assignment in this case, and others\n      like it.\n\nId. at 711. After considering the facts of the case before it and applying the\n\nequitable principles involved, the supreme court held invalid assignments of an\n\ninsured’s DTPA cause of action against its insurance company, citing, among\n\nother reasons, that the point of the assignment would not end litigation but rather\n\nprolong it. Id. at 712–14.\n\n      Both Gandy and HSBC stand for the proposition that, in the face of a\n\nchallenge as to standing to assert a due-process claim that has been purportedly\n\nassigned to another, courts should inquire as to whether there are notions of\n\n                                         21\n\fequity and public policy that would vitiate the assignment of the claim under the\n\ncircumstances. Applying this standard, this court finds at least six equitable and\n\npublic-policy reasons why American should not be permitted to stand in the\n\nshoes of SF3 to assert SF3’s due process violations.\n\n            (1.)    Equity Favors Diligence\n\n      The expectation that parties exercise diligence and vigilance in their own\n\naffairs is a deeply rooted principle of equity. Rivercenter Assocs. v. Rivera, 858\n\nS.W.2d 366, 367 (Tex. 1993) (orig. proceeding) (“‘Equity aids the diligent and not\n\nthose who slumber on their rights.’”) (quoting Callahan v. Giles, 155 S.W.2d 793,\n\n795 (Tex. 1941)).     This fundamental notion of equity would be violated by\n\npermitting a subsequent purchaser to ignore the deed records that would put him\n\non notice of the purported extinguishment of the property rights he seeks to\n\nacquire and then to collaterally attack the very deed that would have provided\n\nnotice in advance of the acquisition. Instead, it would reward indolence and\n\nneglect.\n\n      On more than one occasion, the supreme court has pointed out that the\n\nfundamental purpose of recording laws is to protect parties such as American\n\nfrom this very circumstance. Ojeda de Toca v. Wise, 748 S.W.2d 449, 450–51\n\n(Tex. 1988) (“We conclude instead that the purpose of recording statutes is to\n\nprotect ‘intending purchasers and encumbrancers . . . against the evils of secret\n\ngrants and secret liens . . . .’”) (citing 66 Am. Jur. 2d Records and Recording\n\nLaws § 48 (1973)). The court in Ojeda explained that to protect American—and\n\n                                       22\n\fothers like it—“the Texas Legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory\n\nrecording system which provides in part that ‘[a]n instrument . . . properly\n\nrecorded in the proper county is notice to all persons of the existence of the\n\ninstrument.’” Id. at 451 (citing Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 13.002).11\n\n      As one commentator has observed, “The central purpose of law is to guide\n\nbehavior. When legislatures create rules, a person properly forms expectations\n\nabout how the legal system will respond to his actions.” Stephen R. Munzer, A\n\nTheory of Retroactive Legislation, 61 Tex. L. Rev. 425, 426 (1982).        In this\n\ncircumstance, where American, through the exercise of diligence, would have\n\ndiscovered Pirkle’s claim prior to taking the assignment from SF3, it would be\n\nviolative of both public policy, as expressed by both the property code and the\n\ntax code, and principles of equity to allow American nevertheless to bypass the\n\nstatutory scheme available to challenge the tax sale. Applying the standards of\n\nGandy and HSBC, the equitable principle favoring due diligence, combined with\n\na comprehensive statutory system for recording real-property records, weigh\n\n\n\n      11\n        The court further explained that while the deed record provided notice to\na subsequent purchaser, failure to search the deed records prior to purchase\nwould not operate as a bar against a fraud action against the seller. Ojeda, 748\nS.W.2d at 451. So, for example, here, American’s failure to search the deed\nrecords would not have precluded an action by it against SF3. See id. But if\nAmerican had pursued an action against SF3, limitations on that action would\nhave begun to run immediately because, as the supreme court has held, even\nwhen a party fails to examine the public record, he still is on notice of the deed\nrecords contained therein for the purposes of limitations. HECI Exploration Co.\nv. Neel, 982 S.W.2d 881, 887 (Tex. 1998).\n\n                                        23\n\fagainst permitting the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under\n\nthese circumstances.\n\n             (2.)   Public Policy Favors Limitations\n\n      In this case, American seeks to collaterally attack the effects of a tax sale\n\nrather than utilize the statutory remedy that was available to it but that also\n\ncarried with it a limitations period. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54, 34.08. As\n\nthe court in Security State Bank pointed out, a collateral attack may be brought at\n\nany time, and it is not limited to a definite time period after the tax judgment has\n\nbeen rendered or the sale has occurred. 397 S.W.3d at 723. But allowing a\n\nlienholder who acquired its interest with notice of the tax judgment and sale to\n\ncollaterally attack the tax judgment at any time in the future, unfettered by any\n\napplicable limitations period, would serve to undermine the public policy in favor\n\nof imposing limitations on causes of action. Cf. id.\n\n      Texas law favors limitations of actions. See Strauss, 221 S.W.3d at 789\n\n(“Statutes of limitations serve to further the policy that one must diligently pursue\n\nlegal rights at the risk of losing them if they are not timely asserted.”).       The\n\nsupreme court has declared that “[i]t is in society’s best interest . . . that disputes\n\nbe settled or barred within a reasonable time.”           Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v.\n\nHorwood, 58 S.W.3d 732, 734 (Tex. 2001).               In both law and law-making,\n\nlimitations statutes are ubiquitous.    See, e.g., Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann.\n\n§ 17.565 (West 2011); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §§ 16.002, 16.004–\n\n.005, .022–.028 (West 2002), §§ 16.003, .0045 (West Supp. 2014), §§ 16.051,\n\n                                          24\n\f.061 (West 2015); Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.073 (West 2008); Tex. Ins. Code\n\nAnn. § 541.162 (West 2009); Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. § 62.089 (West 2008);\n\nCosgrove v. Cade, No. 14-0346, 2015 WL 3976719, at *2 (Tex. June 26, 2015)\n\n(“A four-year period also applies to deed-reformation claims.”); Am. Star Energy\n\n& Minerals Corp. v. Stowers, 457 S.W.3d 427, 430 (Tex. 2015) (stating that when\n\nthe legislature employs the term “accrued” without accompanying definition, “‘the\n\ncourts must determine when that cause of action accrues and thus when the\n\nstatute of limitations commences to run’”) (quoting Moreno v. Sterling Drug, Inc.,\n\n787 S.W.2d 348, 351 (Tex. 1990)).12\n\n      Nor has limitations escaped the context of tax sales.            The Texas\n\nLegislature considered limitations to be sufficiently important in the context of\n\nfinality of tax sales to provide for a one-year limitations period in which to levy\n\nany challenge. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54(a). Further recognizing that\n\nthis one-year limitations period might work an injustice to parties who did not\n\nreceive actual notice of the delinquent tax lawsuit or sale, the legislature also\n\nexpressly provided for the tolling of limitations for parties so situated. See id.\n\n\n      12\n         We cite these merely for example. There are many, many more. Indeed,\na search on the Texas Legislature’s website using “limitations” as the keyword (in\naddition to “statute” as a secondary key word and “statute of limitations” as the\nexact phrase being sought) showed that for more than two decades, not a single\nregular legislative session has passed without consideration of proposed\nlegislation relating to limitations in some form or manner. See Texas Legislature\nOnline,               Text               Search,           available            at\nhttp://www.legis.state.tx.us/Search/TextSearch.aspx (last visited August 31,\n2015).\n\n                                        25\n\f§ 33.54(b).13 Despite the fact that American was aware of the tax sale well within\n\nthe limitations period and had the ability to toll the period even further, American\n\ninstead deliberately chose to disregard the limitations deadline.\n\n      The undisputed evidence in this case establishes that no later than\n\nJanuary 15, 2013, American was aware of the August 27, 2012 tax sale. By that\n\ntime, American was still within the applicable limitations period to file suit against\n\nPirkle. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54(a)(1), 34.08(b). At that point in time,\n\nAmerican had more than seven months to decide whether to pay the deposit and\n\nfile the challenge, or to pay the property taxes and toll the limitations period\n\n      13\n         Prior to September 1, 1997, the tax code provided a three-year\nlimitations period to bring a tax sale challenge. See Act of May 24, 1979, 66th\nLeg., R.S., ch. 841, § 1, sec. 33.54(a), 1979 Tex. Gen. Laws 2296, 2296, 2332\n(amended 1997) (current version at Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54 (West 2015)).\nThe 75th Legislature shortened that period of time to one year and retained the\ntolling provision for those who were not served with citation in the foreclosure\nsuit, but added the provision that prohibits a person from challenging the validity\nof a tax sale unless he or she deposits a certain amount into the registry of the\ncourt or files an affidavit of inability to pay.

See id. §§ 33.54(b), 34.08(a)(1).       The parties were cast as\n\nadversaries in litigation seventy-five days later—when Pirkle filed suit against\n\nAmerican on April 1, 2013—and still American had almost six months left of the\n\none-year limitations period to make a decision on whether to challenge the tax\n\nsuit or to pay the property taxes, thereby extending the limitations period even\n\nfurther. See id.\n\n       In this circumstance, where American had more than ample opportunity to\n\ncomply with the tax code and challenge the tax sale during the applicable period\n\nof limitations—or to take the necessary action to toll the applicable limitations\n\nperiod altogether—it would be contrary to public policy to permit American to\n\nignore the applicable statutes governing tax sale challenges and, instead, to\n\ninsist that it be allowed to collaterally attack the tax sale at whatever juncture, on\n\nwhatever timeframe,14 it fancied. Applying the standards of Gandy and HSBC,\n\nthe strong public policy in Texas that favors the imposition of limitations on the\n\ncommencement of actions—specifically, limitations on actions challenging\n\ndelinquent-property-tax sales—balances against permitting the assignment of\n\nSF3’s due-process claim to American under these circumstances.\n\n       14\n         The legislature has evidenced a strong desire that the statutory scheme\nof requiring a deposit be made prior to asserting a challenge to the tax sale be\nfollowed. As explained in the analysis of the 1997 amendments to the tax code,\n“Finally, this bill seeks to forestall frivolous claims of faulty process by requiring\nall taxes, penalties, interest, and costs on the property to be deposited into the\nregistry of the court at the time such a claim is made . . . .” Senate Comm. on\nIntergovernmental Relations, Bill Analysis, Tex.

Public Policy Favors Free and Clear Title\n\n      Equally evident from the tax code provisions is the public policy that favors\n\nthe conveyance of free and clear title to purchasers at tax sales.15\n\n      As the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized, “[t]he plain language of\n\na statute is the surest guide to the Legislature’s intent.” Prairie View A & M Univ.\n\nv. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d 500, 507 (Tex. 2012); see also Greater Houston P’ship v.\n\nPaxton, No. 13-0745, 2015 WL 3978138, at *5 (Tex.

Whisenhunt, 462\n\nS.W.3d 507, 509 (Tex. 2015) (“Our objective in construing a statute is to give\n\neffect to the Legislature’s intent, which requires us to first look to the statute’s\n\nplain language.”).\n\n      The current tax code is replete with affirmations that the purchaser at tax\n\nsales should take the property free and clear of all liens. See Tex. Tax Code\n\nAnn. § 33.54(c) (“When actions are barred by this section, the purchaser at the\n\ntax sale . . . has full title to the property, precluding all other claims.”), § 34.08(b)\n\n\n      15\n        The need for “stability and certainty” in title to real estate is also a central\npurpose of imputing constructive notice through the statutory recording scheme\ndiscussed above. HECI, 982 S.W.2d at 887. Thus, through both the tax code\nand the property code, the public policy in favor of effectuating clean title\ntransfers by availing oneself of the statutory mechanisms in place is manifest.\n\n                                           28\n\f(stating that when limitations has run under section 33.54(a)(1) or (2), the\n\npurchaser “may conclusively presume that the tax sale was valid and shall have\n\nfull title to the property free and clear of the right, title, and interest of any person\n\nthat arose before the tax sale, subject only to recorded restrictive covenants and\n\nvalid easements of record,” per section 34.01(n), “and subject to applicable rights\n\nof redemption”), § 34.01(n) (West 2015) (“[T]he [constable’s] deed vests good\n\nand perfect title in the purchaser or the purchaser’s assigns” subject to a few\n\nexceptions not applicable here).16\n\n      The public policy underlying this legislative scheme, and all other\n\njurisdictions with similar delinquent-property-tax-sale statutes, is to encourage tax\n\nsale purchases.17     See Frank S. Alexander, Tax Liens, Tax Sales, and Due\n\n      16\n           Changes to the tax code in 1997 made even more evident legislative\nintent that tax purchasers take free and clear title, subject only to challenges\nwithin the statutory framework that the legislature devised. The legislature\namended section 33.54(c)’s statutory language, which had provided that the\npurchaser “shall be held to have full title to the property, precluding all other\nclaims,” see Act of May 24, 1979, 66th Leg., R.S., ch. 841, sec. 33.54(c), 1979\nTex. Gen. Laws 2217, 2296 (amended 1997), to a more direct assertion that the\npurchaser “has full title to the property, precluding all other claims,” see Act of\nMay 28, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 1192, § 1, sec. 33.54(c), 1997 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 4594, 4595, and added section 34.08(b), which provides that unless the\nlimitations period and deposit requirements were complied with, “[s]uch\npurchaser may conclusively presume that the tax sale was valid and shall have\nfull title to the property free and clear . . . .” Act of May 28, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S.,\nch. 1192, § 3, sec. 34.08(b), 1997 Tex.

Butler, Economic Analysis for Lawyers 11, 571 (2d ed. 1998)\n\n                                       30\n\f(observing that “the concept of risk aversion is the basis for many important\n\nweights in economics, finance, and law” and that economists assume that most\n\npeople are risk averse “concerning gambles that affect a significant proportion of\n\ntheir wealth”). The assessment of risk, though not readily quantifiable, is an\n\nappreciable consideration for those engaging in business transactions.         See\n\nMark Moller, Procedure’s Ambiguity, 86 Ind. L.J. 645, 708 (2011) (distinguishing\n\nbetween the risk-averse, who avoid bets that present quantifiable odds of a\n\nterrible loss, and the uncertainty-averse, who avoid bets where the odds are\n\nunknown). One of the most critical determinants in the willingness of a private\n\ninvestor to purchase property at a tax sale is uncertainty. See Alexander, supra,\n\nat 763. Few title companies will insure title derived from a tax sale. Id. at 748.\n\nBecause the risk of potential claims against property purchased at a tax sale\n\nmight prevent or hinder prospective buyers from participating in tax sales, the\n\nTexas Legislature has reduced that risk by providing for full and clear title to\n\nthose who purchase property at tax sales. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54(c),\n\n34.08(b). With greater certainty about the strength of the title they acquire, those\n\nwho are risk-averse have more incentive to purchase property at tax sales.\n\n      Absent from the facts of this case is any compelling reason to allow an\n\nassignment of a cause of action that would only serve to create more litigation\n\nand uncertainty with regard to the effect of tax sales, especially when the\n\nlegislature has expressed unambiguous intent that it wants tax-sale purchasers\n\nto take free and clear of all preexisting liens. See id.\n\n                                          31\n\f      To allow American to stand in the shoes of SF3 to assert SF3’s due-\n\nprocess violations would further serve to thwart public policy and the intent of the\n\nTexas Legislature that unless a challenge is made within the limitations period\n\nand using the statutory framework that was promulgated for the purpose of\n\nwarding against frivolous claims, tax-sale purchasers receive free and clear title\n\nto the property purchased. Thus, the well-established public policies in favor of\n\nstability and certainty of the purchaser’s title at a delinquent-tax sale weigh\n\nagainst permitting the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under\n\nthese circumstances.\n\n            (4.)   Public Policy Disfavors Promoting Litigation\n\n      Allowing American to pursue SF3’s claim for due-process violations would\n\nalso serve to promote litigation, rather than end it. In both Elbaor and Gandy, the\n\nsupreme court held that an assignment of a cause of action that serves to\n\npromote litigation rather than end it violates public policy and should not be\n\nenforced. Gandy, 925 S.W.2d at 705–15; Elbaor, 845 S.W.2d at 250.\n\n      While SF3 could have asserted its due-process violations through a\n\ncollateral attack on the judgment, it did not choose to do so. Instead, SF3 sold its\n\ninterest to American, which took the interest with constructive notice of the\n\nrecorded constable’s deed that vested “good and perfect title” to the property in\n\nPirkle, subject only to the provisions for challenge and redemption under tax\n\ncode section 34.01(n). Allowing SF3’s due-process violations to be litigated by\n\nAmerican through collateral attack, notwithstanding limitations or any other\n\n                                        32\n\fstatutory restriction that would otherwise apply, would create not only a viable\n\nthreat of litigation but also a threat that would last in perpetuity.\n\n      As Pirkle points out in his brief, permitting American to pursue SF3’s due\n\nprocess violation claim risks “establish[ing] a dangerous precedent” by providing\n\n“an incentive to predators to peruse tax sale records for defects in notice to\n\nlienholders, acquire the lien at a discount, and then to foreclose on the lien\n\nwithout any protections to the property tax sale purchaser.”18 We agree. To\n\npermit the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim in this circumstance would\n\nwork to encourage litigation, rather than to curb it.\n\n             (5.)   Collateral Attacks are Disfavored\n\n      Collateral attacks are disfavored because they run counter to the strong\n\npublic policy of the law to give finality to judgments. H.E.B., L.L.C. v. Ardinger,\n\n369 S.W.3d 496, 521 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2012, no pet.) (citing Browning v.\n\nProstok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 345 (Tex. 2005)). Consequently, only a void judgment\n\nmay be collaterally attacked. Browning, 165 S.W.3d at 346.\n\n      While Security State Bank permitted a collateral attack on a tax suit\n\njudgment by a lienholder who did not receive notice of the lawsuit, we can find no\n\n      18\n          This is not merely a theoretical concern. In Acirema, N.V. v. Lilly, a\nlienholder took by transfer and assignment in 1996 all rights to property that had\nbeen sold at a tax sale in 1994. No. CIV. A. 1:96–0559, 1997 WL 876738, at *1–\n2 (S.D. W.Va. Aug. 11, 1997), aff’d, 141 F.3d 1157 (4th Cir. 1998). The\nsubsequent lienholder sought to have the tax deed set aside, asserting a due-\nprocess violation as to its predecessor in interest who had received no notice of\nthe original, first attempt at a tax sale in 1989. Id. at *4. The court declined to\nreinstate the deed of trust, however, partly because the lienholder failed to avail\nitself of statutory remedies. Id. at *4–5.\n                                           33\n\fcase where the right of collateral attack has been extended to subsequent\n\nlienholders, such as American, who took their interests with notice. The holding\n\nof Security State Bank was narrowly drawn, encompassing only the party whose\n\ndue process rights were denied. See 397 S.W.3d at 724–25 (concluding that the\n\nbank’s suit was a proper collateral attack based upon a due-process violation\n\nthat rendered the tax judgment and tax sale void as to it; finding the bank was not\n\nbound by the judgment, but the judgment valid to other parties; holding that the\n\nbank was entitled to have the tax judgment set aside as to its lien interest; and\n\nsetting aside the tax judgment and sale as to the bank’s interest).\n\n      And while Security State Bank supports the proposition that the delinquent\n\ntax judgment in this case was void as to SF3, it does not support the contention\n\nthat the judgment should be void as to American. Cf. id. American took its\n\ninterest with constructive notice of the constable’s deed at a time when it could\n\nhave directly attacked the judgment.         The strong public policy disfavoring\n\ncollateral attacks on judgments therefore militates against permitting the\n\nassignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under these circumstances.\n\n            (6.)   Considerations of Comity\n\n      Through an elaborate scheme that has been revisited and amended over\n\nthe years, the Texas Legislature has clearly expressed a desire to resolve tax-\n\nsale challenges pursuant to statute, not collateral attack. See Tex. Tax Code\n\nAnn. §§ 33.54, 34.08. Unlike the parties involved in the cases that American\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\fcites,19 at no point in this series of circumstances was American ever deprived of\n\na due process right, i.e., the opportunity to avail itself of statutory remedies to\n\nchallenge the sale.20\n\n      When the legislature has exercised its authority to provide a statutory\n\nremedy that, if followed, would have fully addressed every due process concern\n\n\n      19\n          In addition to Security State Bank, American also relies on Kothari v.\nOyervidez, 373 S.W.3d 801, 810 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet.\ndenied), First State Bank-Keene v. Metroplex Petroleum Inc., 155 F.3d 732, 737\n(5th Cir. 1998), and Murphee Property Holdings, Ltd. v. Sunbelt Savings\nAssociation of Texas, 817 S.W.2d 850, 852 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n1991, no writ). All three cases are distinguishable, however, because the\ncomplaining parties in those cases were the actual lienholders at the time the\ntax-suit judgment was rendered. First State Bank-Keene, 155 F.3d at 733–34,\n737 (holding that under Texas law, because the FDIC was not made a party to\nthe tax suit, its lien interest was not disposed of and the tax sale purchasers took\nthe property subject to that lien); Kothari, 373 S.W.3d at 802–04, 811 (reversing\nsummary judgment because the summary judgment record did not address\ncritical facts concerning notice and filing that were necessary for the court to\ndetermine as a matter of law whether the appellant was entitled to foreclose his\nliens on the property); Murphee, 817 S.W.2d at 851, 854 (affirming judgment for\nrecord lienholder who was not made a party to the tax suit).\n      20\n         American is not asking this court to merely follow Security State Bank\nand the line of cases that, applying the principles of due process, carve out a\ntolling provision for lienholders who were not served with notice of the delinquent\ntax lawsuit. In those cases, had the courts not intervened and permitted a\ncollateral attack on the tax-sale judgment, valuable due-process rights would\nhave been denied to otherwise assiduous lienholders who held existing property\nrights. What American instead asks this court to do is take these cases one step\nfurther. American asks this court to carve out another exception for a special\nclass of litigants—subsequent lienholders who take, with eyes wide open,\nassignments with constructive notice of the properly-recorded constable’s deed,\nand, thereafter, armed with actual knowledge of the tax sale well within the\napplicable period of limitations, nevertheless proceed to turn a blind eye to the\nstatutory mandates in place to assert a challenge to the tax sale in a proper and\ntimely manner.\n\n                                        35\n\fpresent in this circumstance, there is little justification for the courts to intervene\n\nto create new rights and remedies that would allow lienholders to side-step\n\nlegislative mandates.     The due-process analysis in Acirema is particularly\n\ninstructive:\n\n      Where the plaintiff alleges that the deprivation of his property interest\n      was unauthorized by state law, the state need not provide\n      predeprivation process but instead need only provide a\n      postdeprivation remedy. Assuming, arguendo, that the increased\n      cost of redemption did constitute a deprivation, the amended statute\n      which provides for notice—and under which Equitable did indeed\n      receive notice—provided a postdeprivation remedy of which\n      Equitable did not avail itself. Thus, plaintiff’s challenge to the\n      sheriff’s sale has been effectively dealt with by the state legislature\n      in its amended statutory provisions.\n\n1997 WL 876738, at * 5 (citations omitted).\n\n      Similarly, American seeks predeprivation process when it had full post-\n\ndeprivation remedies available to it. American asks this court to alter the system\n\ndevised by the Texas Legislature and to substitute instead the right to litigate\n\nanother party’s due process violations by collateral attack on the tax sale\n\njudgment. To do so would not only reward American for sleeping on its rights but\n\nalso encourage similar behavior by others who would follow American’s lead in\n\nthe conduct of their business affairs in the future. Principles of comity weigh\n\nagainst permitting the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under\n\nthese circumstances.21\n\n\n      21\n          We note that the Fifth Circuit, in In re Paxton, 440 F.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir.\n2006), stated that it found no reversible error when a bankruptcy court and then a\ndistrict court found that a mortgage-interest assignee could pursue its assignor’s\n                                          36\n\f   3. Conclusion\n\n      Regardless of whether SF3 was named and served with citation in the tax\n\nsuit, American was provided ample notice and opportunity to challenge the\n\nvalidity of Pirkle’s deed in compliance with the statutory scheme designed for just\n\nthis situation.   Instead, American, aware of the tax code and its provisions\n\n(having cited portions of the code to Pirkle in its January 15 letter), simply chose\n\nto ignore its statutory remedies. Applying long-standing notions of equity and\n\npublic policy, as set forth above, we hold that American has no standing to assert\n\nSF3’s due-process violations under the circumstances presented in this case.22\n\nWe overrule this part of American’s first issue, and in light of our disposition here,\n\nwe hold that American’s purported lien was not enforceable against Pirkle.\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not err by denying American’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on its cause of action for judicial foreclosure.\n\n\n\n\ndue process claims. However, the court did not elaborate on how the lower\ncourts reached this conclusion or the underlying rationale beyond the district\ncourt’s finding that “a valid assignment confers upon the assignee standing to\nsue in place of the assignor,” and the lower courts apparently did not publish\nopinions to explain their reasoning. Id. And the court did not explain whether the\nlower courts reached this conclusion under federal law or Louisiana law or\naddress whether there were other statutory remedies to address pre-deprivation\nprocess or any post deprivation remedies available to the parties involved. Id.\nTherefore, we do not consider Paxton to determine the outcome of this appeal.\n      22\n         This holding should not inhibit assignments of liens in the future. Rather,\nassignees are simply encouraged to exercise the due diligence that is expected\nof any party involved in a real-estate transaction, i.e., to consult the deed records\nprior to acquiring an interest in property.\n\n                                         37\n\fB. Unconstitutional Taking Claim and Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n      In its second issue, American complains that the taxing authorities are\n\nliable under its takings cause of action, a claim that American contends was\n\ntimely asserted, and that the trial court erred by granting the taxing authorities’\n\nplea to the jurisdiction.\n\n      In its third-party petition against the taxing authorities,23 American asserted\n\nits takings claim based on three grounds: “(1) the taxing authorities performed\n\nan intentional act that proximately caused the extinction of Appellant’s interest in\n\nthe Property; (2) Appellant did not consent to the action; and (3) Appellant did not\n\nreceive adequate compensation for the taking.” The taxing authorities responded\n\nthat American had no standing to assert the claims, that the claims were time-\n\nbarred, and that the taxing authorities were immune from suit.\n\n      Section 2007.021 of the government code, the Private Real Property\n\nRights Preservation Act (PRPRPA) provides,\n\n      (a) A private real property owner may bring suit under this\n      subchapter to determine whether the governmental action of a\n      political subdivision results in a taking under this chapter. A suit\n      under this subchapter must be filed in a district court in the county in\n      which the private real property owner’s affected property is\n      located . . . .\n\n\n\n      23\n        The trial court had already ruled on American’s and Pirkle’s summary\njudgment motions and declined American’s motion for reconsideration when\nAmerican filed its third-party petition on March 7, 2014—more than a year after\nAmerican acquired its interest in the property and sent its first letter to Pirkle\nregarding the tax sale.\n\n                                        38\n\f      (b) A suit under this subchapter must be filed not later than the\n      180th day after the date the private real property owner knew or\n      should have known that the governmental action restricted or limited\n      the owner’s right in the private real property.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.021 (West 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n      Assuming, without deciding, that American had standing to bring suit\n\nagainst the taxing authorities,24 pursuant to PRPRPA, American was required to\n\nbring suit within 180 days of the date it knew or should have known that its rights\n\nin the property had been restricted or limited. See id. Setting aside the question\n\nof whether on October 31, 2012—the date American received its assignment\n\nfrom SF3—American should have known about the tax sale and constable’s\n\ndeed (which had been filed of record more than two months earlier), certainly the\n\nrecord establishes that as of January 15, 2013—the date American sent its letter\n\nto Pirkle—American actually knew that the tax sale had occurred. Therefore,\n\npursuant to section 2007.021(b), the very latest date on which American could\n\nhave filed its takings claim was July 15, 2013—180 days after January 15, 2013.\n\nAmerican filed its third-party petition on March 7, 2014.\n\n      American does not dispute that its takings claim was subject to PRPRPA’s\n\n180-day limitations period, but it argues that its claim was nevertheless timely\n\n\n       24\n            The PRPRPA defines an “owner” as “a person with legal or equitable\ntitle to affected private real property at the time a taking occurs,” and “private real\nproperty” as “an interest in real property recognized by common law . . . that is\nnot owned by the federal government, this state, or a political subdivision of this\nstate.” Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.002(2), (4) (West 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                          39\n\fbecause the claim was not “ripe” until the trial court ruled on the summary\n\njudgment motions, declaring that the tax sale extinguished American’s rights in\n\nthe property under the deed of trust.25\n\n      To support this contention, American relies heavily upon Williamson\n\nCounty Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, a\n\nzoning-ordinance case in which the Supreme Court held that “a claim that the\n\napplication of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not\n\nripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has\n\nreached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the\n\nproperty at issue.” 473 U.S. 172, 186, 105 S. Ct. 3108, 3116 (1985). American\n\nargues that since the trial court fits the general description of a government entity\n\n“with the authority to interpret and adjudicate the proper applications of statu[t]es\n\nand regulations,” its takings claim was not ripe for filing until the trial court\n\nentered its partial summary judgment on September 30, 2013, which “divested\n\n[American] of its rights in the [p]roperty.”\n\n      This argument wholly ignores the prior judgment issued by the same trial\n\ncourt more than a year earlier, on April 26, 2012, which granted the authority to\n\nconduct the tax sale. Once the tax sale occurred pursuant the authority of the\n\ncourt, tax code section 34.08 established that Pirkle took “free and clear title,”\n\n      25\n       American argues that “[b]ecause [American] filed its Third Party Petition\n158 days later, on March 7, 2014, the [t]axing [a]uthorities’ argument, that\n[American] asserted its claim outside the 180-day statutory period, must\nnecessarily fail.”\n\n                                           40\n\fsubject only to timely challenge pursuant to other Texas Tax Code provisions. At\n\nthe very latest, as soon as SF3 or American knew about the court-authorized tax\n\nsale, it also knew that governmental action had been taken which “restricted or\n\nlimited” its right in property. See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.021.\n\n      Furthermore, the facts of this case are quite different from circumstances\n\nwhere a party is awaiting a final decision from a zoning commission or other\n\nregulatory agency to determine whether the ultimate decision will be adverse to\n\nits property interest. Cf. Williamson Cnty., 473 U.S. at 186, 105 S. Ct. at 3116\n\n(stating that a takings claim is ripe when a final decision on the application of\n\nzoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to the property is obtained and\n\nstate procedures have been used for obtaining just compensation). In fact, the\n\nPRPRPA recognizes this distinction by providing two methods through which a\n\nproperty owner may assert a takings claim under PRPRPA:                (1) a section\n\n2007.021 “suit . . . to determine whether the governmental action . . . results in a\n\ntaking” or (2) a section 2007.022 “contested case with a state agency to\n\ndetermine whether a governmental action of the state agency results in a\n\ntaking.”26 Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2007.021–.022 (West 2008); BP Am. Prod.\n\nCo., 290 S.W.3d at 366 (holding that the former must be brought in district court\n\n      26\n         If a property owner asserts a takings claim by filing a contested case with\na state agency, it must exhaust all administrative remedies available within that\nagency and be “aggrieved by a final decision” in the contested case to be entitled\nto judicial review. State v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 290 S.W.3d 345, 366 (Tex. App.—\nAustin 2009, pet denied); see also Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.025(b) (West\n2008).\n\n                                        41\n\fin the county where the property is located and the latter is filed with the state\n\nagency whose “governmental action” is alleged to have constituted a taking, but\n\n“[in] each case, the proceeding must be filed with its appropriate tribunal ‘not later\n\nthan the 180th day after the date the . . . owner knew or should have known that\n\nthe governmental action restricted or limited the owner’s right in the private real\n\nproperty’”) (quoting Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2007.021(b), .022(b)).\n\n         Beginning on the date when American “knew or should have known” about\n\nthe tax sale and constable’s deed—whether October 31, 2012 or January 15,\n\n2013—American possessed all facts necessary to determine whether a takings\n\nclaim should be filed against the taxing authorities. See Hidalgo Cnty. v. Dyer,\n\n358 S.W.3d 698, 707 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2011, no pet.) (rejecting\n\nargument that takings claim was tolled pending a ruling by the trial court in\n\ncondemnation suit and holding that nothing in PRPRPA’s plain language\n\nprovides for tolling the time a private property owner may bring suit: “Under the\n\nstatute, the time to file suit depends only on when the property owner knew or\n\nshould have known of the restriction or limitation on the owner’s real-property\n\nright.    It does not depend on the timing of any other factor.”).        By its own\n\nadmission,27 when the taxing authorities failed to name SF3 as a party to the\n\n\n         27\n          In its brief, American complains,\n\n                 Perhaps most troubling is the inescapable conclusion that the\n         [t]axing [a]uthorities knowingly violated state law when they filed the\n         [t]ax [s]uit. As stated in [American’s] Third Party Petition, “SF3, the\n         current lienholder of record and a party needed for just adjudication\n                                           42\n\funderlying delinquent-tax suit, the taxing authorities had taken action that either\n\n“caused” the taking or that was “substantially certain to result in the complained-\n\nof taking.” We overrule American’s second issue without reaching the remainder\n\nof its arguments. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.\n\nC. Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In its final issue, American argues that the trial court erred by awarding\n\nattorney’s fees to Pirkle, contending that Pirkle’s counsel failed to segregate her\n\nfees between the various parties and the causes of action asserted at the August\n\n14, 2014 hearing on American’s motion for entry of final judgment. However, a\n\nreporter’s record of the August 14, 2014 hearing was not made.28 Without a\n\nreporter’s record of the hearing, we cannot determine whether American objected\n\nto the alleged failure to segregate. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; Green Int’l, Inc. v.\n\n\n      of the matter, was not named as a defendant in the [t]ax [s]uit by any\n      of the [t]axing [a]uthorities and was not provided any notice of the\n      [t]ax [s]uit proceedings.”\n\n             ....\n\n              By ignoring the statutorily mandated requirements for\n      instituting the [t]ax [s]uit, specifically by failing to identify and join the\n      lienholder of record in the [t]ax [s]uit, the [t]axing [a]uthorities took\n      action that caused the taking or that was substantially certain to\n      result in the complained-of taking.” [Emphasis added.]\n      28\n        The clerk of this court has contacted the trial court clerk to determine\nwhether the hearing was recorded, and the trial court clerk has indicated that no\nsuch record was made or filed. The clerk’s record contains only American’s letter\ndesignating the contents of the clerk’s record and does not contain a request by\nAmerican for the reporter’s record or a designation of the portions that it should\ncontain.

Conclusion\n\n      Having sustained the part of American’s first issue pertaining to the\n\ndeclaration on Lewis’s note, we modify the trial court’s judgment to delete this\n\ndeclaration. Having overruled the remainder of American’s dispositive issues, we\n\naffirm the trial court’s judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                  /s/ Bonnie Sudderth\n                                                  BONNIE SUDDERTH\n                                                  JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GABRIEL, and SUDDERTH, JJ.\n\nDAUPHINOT and GABRIEL, JJ., concur without opinion.\n\nDELIVERED: September 3, 2015\n\n\n\n\n      29\n        The clerk’s record does not reflect that American filed any post-judgment\nmotions to attempt to preserve this complaint.

Introduction\n\n     In three issues, Appellant American Homeowner Preservation Fund, LP\n\n(American) appeals a judgment declaring null and void its lien on property\n\fpurchased by Appellee Brian J. Pirkle at a tax-foreclosure sale, declaring null and\n\nvoid a note executed by Cathy Lewis1 and secured by the property, dismissing\n\nAmerican’s constitutional takings claims against the taxing authorities involved in\n\nthe foreclosure sale, and awarding attorney’s fees to Pirkle. We modify the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment and affirm the judgment as modified.\n\n                                   II. Factual History\n\n      On October 20, 2003, Lewis executed a note and deed of trust in favor of\n\nAvailable Mortgage Funding, LLC (AMF) secured by property located at 5700\n\nCalloway Street, Fort Worth. The deed of trust was filed of record ten days later,\n\nperfecting AMF’s security interest in the property. See Tex. Prop. Code Ann.\n\n§§ 13.001–.002 (West 2014).\n\n      In 2009, the note and deed of trust were assigned to Stewardship Fund\n\nNo. 3, LP (SF3) by Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS),\n\nacting solely as nominee for AMF. This assignment was filed of record shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n      One year later, on August 27, 2010, Appellees Tarrant County, the Tarrant\n\nCounty Hospital District, the City of Sansom Park, and the Tarrant County\n\nCommunity College District (collectively, the taxing authorities) filed a delinquent-\n\nproperty-tax suit. In that suit, the taxing authorities named only Lewis and MERS\n\nas defendants. SF3, the lienholder of record at the time the delinquent-tax suit\n\n\n      1\n       Cathy Lewis is not a party to this appeal.\n\n                                         2\n\fwas filed, was not named as a defendant, nor was SF3 ever made a party to the\n\nlawsuit.2\n\n      On April 26, 2012, the trial court entered judgment against Lewis and\n\nMERS, authorizing the sale of the property to satisfy the tax liens.          At the\n\nsubsequent tax-foreclosure sale, which occurred on August 7, 2012, Pirkle\n\npurchased the property. The constable’s deed, which acknowledged the tax sale\n\nand purported to convey free and clear title to Pirkle, was recorded on August 27,\n\n2012. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 34.01(m) (West 2015).\n\n      Two months after the deed was recorded, on October 31, 2012, SF3\n\nassigned all of its rights, title, and interest in the property to American. American\n\ncontends that it took the assignment without notice of the tax suit or the tax sale,\n\neven though the constable’s deed had been on file in the deed records for 65\n\ndays prior to the assignment and the tax suit had been on file for 2 years and 65\n\ndays prior to the assignment.\n\n      Pirkle was first introduced to American by a letter from American’s counsel\n\ndated January 15, 2013, the same day that American filed its assignment from\n\nSF3 in the deed records of Tarrant County. This letter notified Pirkle that SF3’s\n\nnote and deed of trust had been assigned to American and that American now\n\nclaimed a lien against Pirkle’s property, a lien that American believed survived\n\n\n      2\n       It is undisputed that SF3 did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit or the\ntax sale.\n\n\n                                         3\n\fthe tax sale because the taxing authorities had failed to join SF3 as a party to the\n\ntax suit.\n\n                             III. Procedural History\n\n       On February 15, 2013, American sent a notice of default to Lewis\n\ndescribing Lewis’s default under the terms of the note, notifying Lewis that\n\nAmerican had accelerated the note, and demanding payment of the entire\n\nbalance due on the note.3 After Lewis failed to pay as demanded, American\n\nprepared for a nonjudicial foreclosure of its interest in the property and posted\n\nthe property for foreclosure sale to occur on Tuesday, April 2, 2013. See Tex.\n\nProp. Code Ann. § 51.002 (West 2014).\n\n       The day before the foreclosure sale, Pirkle filed a lawsuit seeking a\n\ntemporary restraining order (TRO) and temporary injunction to stay the\n\nforeclosure proceedings. The trial court granted the TRO, and 14 days later, it\n\nsigned a temporary injunction enjoining American from proceeding with the\n\nnonjudicial foreclosure sale on the property.\n\n       On May 2, 2013, American answered the lawsuit and asserted a\n\ncounterclaim for judicial foreclosure of its security interest. Within a month, both\n\nsides had filed competing summary judgment motions, which were heard on\n\nAugust 29, 2013. On September 30, the trial court signed an order granting\n\npartial summary judgment in favor of Pirkle, denying American’s summary\n\n\n       3\n        American claimed Lewis owed $99,901.71 on the note.\n\n                                         4\n\fjudgment motion, and declaring that: (1) the constable’s deed conveying title to\n\nPirkle was a valid deed; (2) American’s rights under the deed of trust were\n\nextinguished by the tax sale; (3) American’s rights under the note were\n\nextinguished by the tax sale; and (4) American’s claim or lien on the property was\n\nextinguished and otherwise null and void.\n\n        The September 30 summary judgment remained interlocutory because it\n\ndid not dispose of Pirkle’s claim for attorney’s fees, and on January 31, 2014, the\n\ntrial court signed an order permitting American to file a third-party petition against\n\nthe taxing authorities. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 38(a). American’s third-party petition,\n\nfiled on March 7, 2014, added the taxing authorities4 to the lawsuit as third-party\n\ndefendants, suing for damages for an unconstitutional taking of the property\n\nunder article I of the Texas Constitution and for an “invalidation of the [t]ax [s]uit\n\n[j]udgment and subsequent [t]ax [s]ale” under Texas Government Code chapter\n\n2007.\n\n        On June 26, 2014, the trial court granted the taxing authorities’ plea to the\n\njurisdiction. The final judgment in this case was signed on August 14, 2014,\n\nincorporating and merging the interlocutory orders into the final judgment and\n\nawarding to Pirkle attorney’s fees in the amount of $35,000.\n\n\n\n        4\n        American also named Castleberry Independent School District, which had\nintervened in the original tax-delinquency suit as a third-party defendant prior to\nthe judgment and tax sale. Castleberry was subsequently nonsuited and is not a\nparty to this appeal. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 162.\n\n                                          5\n\f                                  IV. Discussion\n\n      American brings three issues on appeal.          In its first issue, American\n\nchallenges the trial court’s rulings on the competing summary judgment motions.\n\nIn its second issue, American alternatively complains that if the trial court\n\ncorrectly granted Pirkle’s motion, then the taxing authorities are liable for an\n\nunconstitutional taking of its extinguished lienholder’s rights.    And in its third\n\nissue, American contends that the trial court erred by awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nPirkle when no evidence was presented on the segregation of attorney’s fees\n\nbetween the various parties involved and causes of action asserted.\n\nA. Pirkle’s Summary Judgment\n\n      In its first issue, American challenges the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nrulings on the basis that the trial court “effectively rul[ed] that a tax foreclosure\n\nsale extinguishes an existing lien against real property despite the fact that the\n\nlienholder of record was not a party to, nor provided notice of, the underlying\n\ndelinquent tax lawsuit,” and that American established as a matter of law its\n\nentitlement to judicial foreclosure. American also argues that the trial court erred\n\nby granting declaratory relief on the underlying note.5\n\n\n      5\n        American further argues that Pirkle failed to submit competent summary\njudgment evidence and that the trial court erred by overruling American’s\nobjections to the summary judgment evidence that Pirkle did submit, but based\non our resolution below, we do not reach this sub-issue. See Tex. R. App. P.\n47.1. We do note, however, that the trial court had before it competing motions\nfor summary judgment filed by both parties on a pure question of law, that neither\nside contends that a fact issue precluded the granting of summary judgment, and\nthat all of the facts necessary to decide the legal issue before this court are\n                                         6\n\f      1. Summary Judgment on the Lewis Note\n\n      Because the note represented Lewis’s promise to pay the lender and any\n\nassignees of the note the amounts due and because Pirkle had no interest under\n\nthe note, American argues that no justiciable controversy existed between Pirkle\n\nand American with respect to the Lewis note. Therefore, American argues, the\n\ntrial court erred by declaring that the note was “null and void and has no force\n\nand effect.” American is correct.\n\n      Under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, “[a] court of record within\n\nits jurisdiction has power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations\n\nwhether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” Tex.

Effect of the Tax Foreclosure Sale on SF3’s and American’s Lien\n\n      American argues that, pursuant to rule of civil procedure 39, SF3 was a\n\nnecessary and indispensable party to the delinquent tax suit, and because SF3\n\nwas not joined as a party to the lawsuit, American was therefore not bound by\n\nthe judgment or tax sale that followed. According to American, Pirkle purchased\n\nthe property at the tax sale subject to SF3’s lien. Then when SF3 assigned all of\n\nits rights, title, and interest to the property to American three months later,\n\nAmerican stood in the shoes of SF3 with full authority to enforce and foreclose\n\nupon the lien on Pirkle’s property.\n\n      Pirkle frames the issue differently. Notwithstanding the fact that SF3 was\n\nneither aware of nor made a party to the underlying delinquent-tax lawsuit, Pirkle\n\ncontends that because the property was acquired at a tax sale, his ownership\n\ninterest came with certain statutory protections. American learned of Pirkle’s\n\nownership interest and the circumstances under which he had acquired the\n\nproperty within at least six months of the recording of Pirkle’s deed.6 Pirkle\n\ncontends that once American became aware of the tax sale, it was incumbent\n\nupon American to comply with the requirements of the tax code in order to\n\nchallenge Pirkle’s claim. Instead, American chose to proceed with foreclosure,\n\n      6\n       On January 15, 2013, American sent its first letter to Pirkle in which it\ndiscussed the tax sale.\n\n                                        8\n\fnotwithstanding the tax code’s provisions. Pirkle argues that American’s refusal\n\nto follow the statutory scheme regarding tax-sale challenges barred any recovery\n\nagainst Pirkle by American and, pursuant to section 33.54 of the tax code, on\n\nAugust 28, 2013, Pirkle owned the property free and clear of American’s\n\npurported lien.\n\n             a. Tax Code Provisions\n\n      The tax code provides a statutory framework through which a challenge to\n\na tax sale may be instituted against a purchaser at the sale. Section 34.08,\n\n“Challenge to Validity of Tax Sale,” provides:\n\n      (a) A person may not commence an action that challenges the\n      validity of a tax sale under this chapter unless the person:\n\n             (1) deposits into the registry of the court an amount equal to\n             the amount of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest\n             specified in the judgment of foreclosure obtained against the\n             property plus all costs of the tax sale; . . .\n\n             ....\n\n      (b) A person may not commence an action challenging the validity of\n      a tax sale after the time set forth in Section 33.54(a)(1) . . . against a\n      subsequent purchaser for value who acquired the property in\n      reliance on the tax sale. The purchaser may conclusively presume\n      that the tax sale was valid and shall have full title to the property free\n      and clear of the right, title, and interest of any person that arose\n      before the tax sale . . . .\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 34.08 (West 2015) (emphasis added). Tax code\n\nsection 33.54, “Limitation on Actions Relating to Property Sold for Taxes,”\n\nfurther provides:\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f        (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), an action relating to the\n        title to property may not be maintained against the purchaser of the\n        property at a tax sale unless the action commenced:\n\n                 (1) before the first anniversary of the date that the deed\n                 executed to the purchaser at the tax sale is filed of record; . . .\n\n                 ....\n\n        (c) When actions are barred by this section, the purchaser at the tax\n        sale . . . has full title to the property, precluding all other claims.\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54 (West 2015) (emphasis added).\n\n        Pursuant to these statutes, in order to challenge the validity of the tax sale\n\nor Pirkle’s right to the property free and clear of liens, American was required to:\n\n(1) commence an action against Pirkle no later than August 27, 2013, the one-\n\nyear anniversary of the tax-sale-deed recordation and (2) prior to commencing\n\nthe action, make a deposit into the registry of the court in an amount equal to the\n\namount of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest, plus all costs of the tax\n\nsale.       See id. §§ 33.54(a)(1), 34.08(a)(1).     Pirkle argues that American was\n\nrequired to do both, and American admits that it did neither.7 Therefore, unless\n\nAmerican was not subject to the statutory requirements for challenging a tax sale\n\nor a tax-sale purchaser’s title, by the one-year anniversary of the recording of the\n\nsale—August 28, 2013—Pirkle could have conclusively presumed that the tax\n\n        7\n        American argues that it “never filed suit to set aside the judgment\nrendered in the underlying tax suit . . . because it was not required to do so in\norder to protect and enforce its rights in the Property.” It further argues, “More\nimportantly, [American] was not subject to the ‘prerequisites’ imposed by Tax\nCode §34.08 and is not barred thereby from taking legal action to enforce its\nrights in the Property.”\n\n                                             10\n\fsale was valid and that he was vested with full title to the property free and clear\n\nof American’s purported lien. See id. § 34.08(b).\n\n      To support its assertion that it was not required to comply with the\n\nmandates of the tax code, American relies primarily on Security State Bank &\n\nTrust v. Bexar County. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722 (Tex.

In Security State Bank, the bank—a lienholder of record\n\nat the time the tax suit and sale occurred that had not received notice of, nor\n\nbeen made a party to, the delinquent tax lawsuit—brought a lawsuit challenging\n\nthe tax sale. Id. at 717–18. The bank’s challenge did not comply with the tax\n\ncode in two respects: (1) the lawsuit was filed four days after the one-year\n\nlimitations period had run and (2) the deposit was not filed prior to, but rather 55\n\ndays after, the bank’s lawsuit had been filed. Id. at 720–21. Nevertheless, after\n\nconsidering the bank’s due-process arguments, the court held that the bank’s\n\nchallenge was proper, independent of the tax code, and that the tax judgment\n\nand tax sale were void as to the bank. Id. at 724. In so holding, the court drew a\n\ndistinction between the facts of its case and the line of cases that have held that\n\nregardless of the merits of a tax sale challenge, the challenger must bring its suit\n\nwithin the tax code’s limitations period and make the required deposit prior to\n\nfiling the suit. Id. (“These cases are distinguishable, however, because none\n\ninvolved a record lienholder with a prior lien against the property.”).\n\n      The distinction between a purported owner and a record lienholder\n\nbecomes significant in the context of tax-sale challenges because of the\n\n                                         11\n\fapplication of the tax code’s tolling provision as to limitations. The tax code\n\nprovides that the one-year limitation for challenging a tax sale can be tolled by a\n\nparty who continues to pay taxes on the property up until the party’s challenge is\n\nmade.8 As upheld by our sister court, the requirement that a property owner\n\nchallenge the tax sale within the one-year time limit or, in the alternative,\n\ncontinue to pay property taxes, which tolls limitations, is not unreasonable.

A\n\nlienholder, who is not ordinarily liable for payment of taxes on the property, would\n\nnot be in the same position as an owner who, perhaps unwittingly, tolls the\n\nlimitations period simply by carrying on in the normal course through the payment\n\nof property taxes as they become due. In recognition of this distinction, the court\n\nin Security State Bank rejected the notion that the bank in that case, which was a\n\nlienholder “at the time the delinquent tax suit was filed” rather than a property\n\nowner, was precluded from collaterally attacking the tax sale, independent of the\n\ntax code provisions. 397 S.W.3d at 721–25. Under the facts of Security State\n\nBank and the cases Security State Bank cites in support of its holding, the\n\nlienholder received no notice of the lawsuit and had no opportunity to toll\n\nlimitations through payment of property taxes. Id. The facts of our case are quite\n\ndifferent.\n\n       Unlike the lienholder in Security State Bank—which had an existing lien\n\nagainst the property at the time the delinquent tax suit was filed and when the\n\nsale occurred and was deprived of notice of these events—American acquired its\n\nlien on the property with full notice of the delinquent tax lawsuit, the judgment\n\nresulting from the lawsuit that authorized the tax sale, and the resulting tax sale\n\nitself. As of October 31, 2012, the date American received its assignment from\n\nSF3, the constable’s deed had been on file in the deed records for 65 days, the\n\njudgment ordering the tax sale had been on file for 188 days, and the tax suit had\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fbeen on file for 2 years and 65 days prior to the assignment.9 The holding in\n\nSecurity State Bank is therefore distinguishable on its facts.\n\n      In this case, well within the limitations period and armed with actual\n\nknowledge of Pirkle’s purchase of the property at the tax sale and at least\n\ngeneral awareness of the existence of the Texas Tax Code,10 American made a\n\nconscious decision not to comply with the statutory framework created by the\n\nTexas Legislature to be followed in these very circumstances. American chose\n\nnot to make the required statutory deposit. American chose not to file suit within\n\nthe statutory limitations period or, in the alternative—even if it was already\n\nengaged in litigation with Pirkle—to toll limitations through the interim payment of\n\nproperty taxes. Instead, from the outset, American held steadfast to its position\n\nthat it was exempt from the law.\n\n      To support its position, American claims status in the underlying lawsuit as\n\na necessary party under rule of civil procedure 39.

As such, SF3 should have been joined in the lawsuit as a\n\nparty and afforded an opportunity to protect its property interest. See id. at 721–\n\n22. Because it was not joined in the delinquent tax lawsuit, SF3 was not legally\n\nbound by the judgment or the tax sale. See id. at 724. Following Security State\n\nBank, SF3 could have side-stepped the mandates of the tax code and collaterally\n\nattacked the tax judgment to set aside both the judgment and tax sale as to its\n\nlien interest. See id. at 724–25.\n\n      But SF3 did not do this. Instead, three months after the tax sale, SF3\n\nassigned its lien to American, which, as discussed above, purchased the\n\nassignment with an irrebuttable presumption of notice of the intervening tax sale.\n\nSee Ford, 235 S.W.3d at 617; Aston Meadows, 359 S.W.3d at 859.

American was afforded its own due process rights as a\n\nsubsequent purchaser of SF3’s interest in the property when it purchased the\n\nassignment with notice of the intervening tax sale.

HSBC, who\n\ntook the lien by assignment postjudgment, brought a bill of review and asserted\n\nstanding to challenge the judgment by asserting a violation of the prior\n\n                                       18\n\flienholder’s due-process rights, just as American does in this case. Id. at 770–\n\n71, 773–74. And in HSBC, as in this case, the appellees argued that only the\n\nparty whose due-process rights were violated had standing to assert those rights.\n\nId. at 774.\n\n      In permitting the subsequent lienholder to pursue the bill of review, the\n\ncourt held that, in the absence of policy reasons forbidding the particular\n\nassignment, the policy of the state would be to permit it. Id. at 775. Because the\n\nassignment to HSBC was not “inimical to public policy,” the court allowed HSBC\n\nto step into the shoes of its predecessor in interest and pursue its predecessor’s\n\ndue-process-violation claim. Id.\n\n      We agree with the analysis of HSBC, and the question now becomes—is\n\nthere a public policy reason to forbid the due-process claim assignment in this\n\nparticular case? We believe there is.\n\n      As the supreme court explained in Gandy, a deceptive-trade-practices-act\n\n(DTPA) case, the question of assignability of causes of action has its roots in\n\nequity, not law. 925 S.W.2d at 705–15. At early common law, a cause of action\n\ncould not be assigned.       Id. at 705–06.      This common law rule against\n\nassignability was believed to be rooted in two equitable principles. Id. at 706.\n\nFirst, the bar served as a guard against the proliferation of lawsuits and unethical\n\npractices, and, second, common law regarded rights as personal to the holder,\n\nconsidering the individuals and circumstances involved, such that rights and\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\fobligations could not be enforced apart from their context without risking\n\ndistortion. Id.\n\n      The supreme court further explained that as early as the fifteenth century,\n\nthis common law bar began to give way to the demands of commerce that\n\nassigned debts should be enforceable, and by the eighteenth century, it had\n\ncollapsed with regard to debts and contract rights. Id. The only remnants of the\n\ncommon law bar against assignability of causes of action that survived in\n\nAmerican common law were those pertaining to some torts, and by 1895, even\n\npersonal-injury claims became assignable in Texas. Id. at 706–07 (citing Beech\n\nAircraft Corp. v.

The supreme court\n\nexplained that while “practicalities of the modern world” have now made the\n\nassignability of causes of action the general rule, the “common law’s reservations\n\nto alienability” have not been entirely dispelled, nor has the “role of equity or\n\npolicy” been displaced in shaping the rule, such that even today, contractual\n\nassignments may be “inoperative on grounds of public policy.” Id. at 707.\n\n      The court outlined four instances in which it has held the assignment of a\n\ncause of action invalid, each of which was based on equitable principles and\n\n“historical reservations.” Id.

Id. at 707–11.\n\n      The court then turned to the facts of Gandy, stating,\n\n      The common law’s concerns about alienability of choses in action,\n      voiced by Lord Coke and Holmes, echo in our own decisions. In\n      widely different contexts we have invalidated assignments of choses\n      in action that tend to increase and distort litigation. We have never\n      upheld assignments in the face of those concerns. With these\n      things in mind, we turn to the assignment in this case, and others\n      like it.\n\nId. at 711. After considering the facts of the case before it and applying the\n\nequitable principles involved, the supreme court held invalid assignments of an\n\ninsured’s DTPA cause of action against its insurance company, citing, among\n\nother reasons, that the point of the assignment would not end litigation but rather\n\nprolong it. Id. at 712–14.\n\n      Both Gandy and HSBC stand for the proposition that, in the face of a\n\nchallenge as to standing to assert a due-process claim that has been purportedly\n\nassigned to another, courts should inquire as to whether there are notions of\n\n                                         21\n\fequity and public policy that would vitiate the assignment of the claim under the\n\ncircumstances. Applying this standard, this court finds at least six equitable and\n\npublic-policy reasons why American should not be permitted to stand in the\n\nshoes of SF3 to assert SF3’s due process violations.\n\n            (1.)    Equity Favors Diligence\n\n      The expectation that parties exercise diligence and vigilance in their own\n\naffairs is a deeply rooted principle of equity. Rivercenter Assocs. v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1745901\"><a href=\"/opinion/1745901/rivercenter-associates-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (Tex. 1993) (orig. proceeding) (“‘Equity aids the diligent and not\n\nthose who slumber on their rights.’”) (quoting Callahan v.

This fundamental notion of equity would be violated by\n\npermitting a subsequent purchaser to ignore the deed records that would put him\n\non notice of the purported extinguishment of the property rights he seeks to\n\nacquire and then to collaterally attack the very deed that would have provided\n\nnotice in advance of the acquisition. Instead, it would reward indolence and\n\nneglect.\n\n      On more than one occasion, the supreme court has pointed out that the\n\nfundamental purpose of recording laws is to protect parties such as American\n\nfrom this very circumstance. Ojeda de Toca v. Wise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1664958\"><a href=\"/opinion/1664958/ojeda-de-toca-v-wise/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450–51\n\n(Tex. 1988) (“We conclude instead that the purpose of recording statutes is to\n\nprotect ‘intending purchasers and encumbrancers . . . against the evils of secret\n\ngrants and secret liens . . . .’”) (citing 66 Am. Jur. 2d Records and Recording\n\nLaws § 48 (1973)). The court in Ojeda explained that to protect American—and\n\n                                       22\n\fothers like it—“the Texas Legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory\n\nrecording system which provides in part that ‘[a]n instrument . . . properly\n\nrecorded in the proper county is notice to all persons of the existence of the\n\ninstrument.’” Id. at 451 (citing Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 13.002).11\n\n      As one commentator has observed, “The central purpose of law is to guide\n\nbehavior. When legislatures create rules, a person properly forms expectations\n\nabout how the legal system will respond to his actions.” Stephen R.

Rev.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426 (1982).        In this\n\ncircumstance, where American, through the exercise of diligence, would have\n\ndiscovered Pirkle’s claim prior to taking the assignment from SF3, it would be\n\nviolative of both public policy, as expressed by both the property code and the\n\ntax code, and principles of equity to allow American nevertheless to bypass the\n\nstatutory scheme available to challenge the tax sale. Applying the standards of\n\nGandy and HSBC, the equitable principle favoring due diligence, combined with\n\na comprehensive statutory system for recording real-property records, weigh\n\n\n\n      11\n        The court further explained that while the deed record provided notice to\na subsequent purchaser, failure to search the deed records prior to purchase\nwould not operate as a bar against a fraud action against the seller. Ojeda, 748\nS.W.2d at 451. So, for example, here, American’s failure to search the deed\nrecords would not have precluded an action by it against SF3. See id. But if\nAmerican had pursued an action against SF3, limitations on that action would\nhave begun to run immediately because, as the supreme court has held, even\nwhen a party fails to examine the public record, he still is on notice of the deed\nrecords contained therein for the purposes of limitations.

Public Policy Favors Limitations\n\n      In this case, American seeks to collaterally attack the effects of a tax sale\n\nrather than utilize the statutory remedy that was available to it but that also\n\ncarried with it a limitations period. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54, 34.08. As\n\nthe court in Security State Bank pointed out, a collateral attack may be brought at\n\nany time, and it is not limited to a definite time period after the tax judgment has\n\nbeen rendered or the sale has occurred. 397 S.W.3d at 723. But allowing a\n\nlienholder who acquired its interest with notice of the tax judgment and sale to\n\ncollaterally attack the tax judgment at any time in the future, unfettered by any\n\napplicable limitations period, would serve to undermine the public policy in favor\n\nof imposing limitations on causes of action. Cf. id.\n\n      Texas law favors limitations of actions. See Strauss, 221 S.W.3d at 789\n\n(“Statutes of limitations serve to further the policy that one must diligently pursue\n\nlegal rights at the risk of losing them if they are not timely asserted.”).

The Texas\n\nLegislature considered limitations to be sufficiently important in the context of\n\nfinality of tax sales to provide for a one-year limitations period in which to levy\n\nany challenge. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54(a). Further recognizing that\n\nthis one-year limitations period might work an injustice to parties who did not\n\nreceive actual notice of the delinquent tax lawsuit or sale, the legislature also\n\nexpressly provided for the tolling of limitations for parties so situated. See id.\n\n\n      12\n         We cite these merely for example. There are many, many more. Indeed,\na search on the Texas Legislature’s website using “limitations” as the keyword (in\naddition to “statute” as a secondary key word and “statute of limitations” as the\nexact phrase being sought) showed that for more than two decades, not a single\nregular legislative session has passed without consideration of proposed\nlegislation relating to limitations in some form or manner.

By that\n\ntime, American was still within the applicable limitations period to file suit against\n\nPirkle. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54(a)(1), 34.08(b). At that point in time,\n\nAmerican had more than seven months to decide whether to pay the deposit and\n\nfile the challenge, or to pay the property taxes and toll the limitations period\n\n      13\n         Prior to September 1, 1997, the tax code provided a three-year\nlimitations period to bring a tax sale challenge. See Act of May 24, 1979, 66th\nLeg., R.S., ch. 841, § 1, sec. 33.54(a), 1979 Tex. Gen. Laws 2296, 2296, 2332\n(amended 1997) (current version at Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.54 (West 2015)).\nThe 75th Legislature shortened that period of time to one year and retained the\ntolling provision for those who were not served with citation in the foreclosure\nsuit, but added the provision that prohibits a person from challenging the validity\nof a tax sale unless he or she deposits a certain amount into the registry of the\ncourt or files an affidavit of inability to pay. Compare id., with Act of May 22,\n1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 1136, § 1, sec. 33.54(a), § 4, sec. 34.08(a), 1997 Tex.\nGen. Laws 4299, 4299–302 (current version at Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54,\n34.08). The bill analysis explained the public-policy reason for shortening the\nlimitations period from three years to one, stating:\n\n             Currently . . . the Property Tax Code provides a three-year\n      period following the tax sale in which the procedural methodology of\n      the foreclosure can be contested. . . . The potential of such a claim\n      can effectively forestall redevelopment of the property until the three-\n      year limitations period elapses, causing abandoned properties to\n      abound.

The parties were cast as\n\nadversaries in litigation seventy-five days later—when Pirkle filed suit against\n\nAmerican on April 1, 2013—and still American had almost six months left of the\n\none-year limitations period to make a decision on whether to challenge the tax\n\nsuit or to pay the property taxes, thereby extending the limitations period even\n\nfurther. See id.\n\n       In this circumstance, where American had more than ample opportunity to\n\ncomply with the tax code and challenge the tax sale during the applicable period\n\nof limitations—or to take the necessary action to toll the applicable limitations\n\nperiod altogether—it would be contrary to public policy to permit American to\n\nignore the applicable statutes governing tax sale challenges and, instead, to\n\ninsist that it be allowed to collaterally attack the tax sale at whatever juncture, on\n\nwhatever timeframe,14 it fancied. Applying the standards of Gandy and HSBC,\n\nthe strong public policy in Texas that favors the imposition of limitations on the\n\ncommencement of actions—specifically, limitations on actions challenging\n\ndelinquent-property-tax sales—balances against permitting the assignment of\n\nSF3’s due-process claim to American under these circumstances.\n\n       14\n         The legislature has evidenced a strong desire that the statutory scheme\nof requiring a deposit be made prior to asserting a challenge to the tax sale be\nfollowed. As explained in the analysis of the 1997 amendments to the tax code,\n“Finally, this bill seeks to forestall frivolous claims of faulty process by requiring\nall taxes, penalties, interest, and costs on the property to be deposited into the\nregistry of the court at the time such a claim is made . . . .” Senate Comm. on\nIntergovernmental Relations, Bill Analysis, Tex.

Butler, Economic Analysis for Lawyers 11, 571 (2d ed. 1998)\n\n                                       30\n\f(observing that “the concept of risk aversion is the basis for many important\n\nweights in economics, finance, and law” and that economists assume that most\n\npeople are risk averse “concerning gambles that affect a significant proportion of\n\ntheir wealth”). The assessment of risk, though not readily quantifiable, is an\n\nappreciable consideration for those engaging in business transactions.         See\n\nMark Moller, Procedure’s Ambiguity, 86 Ind. L.J. 645, 708 (2011) (distinguishing\n\nbetween the risk-averse, who avoid bets that present quantifiable odds of a\n\nterrible loss, and the uncertainty-averse, who avoid bets where the odds are\n\nunknown). One of the most critical determinants in the willingness of a private\n\ninvestor to purchase property at a tax sale is uncertainty. See Alexander, supra,\n\nat 763. Few title companies will insure title derived from a tax sale. Id. at 748.\n\nBecause the risk of potential claims against property purchased at a tax sale\n\nmight prevent or hinder prospective buyers from participating in tax sales, the\n\nTexas Legislature has reduced that risk by providing for full and clear title to\n\nthose who purchase property at tax sales. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 33.54(c),\n\n34.08(b). With greater certainty about the strength of the title they acquire, those\n\nwho are risk-averse have more incentive to purchase property at tax sales.\n\n      Absent from the facts of this case is any compelling reason to allow an\n\nassignment of a cause of action that would only serve to create more litigation\n\nand uncertainty with regard to the effect of tax sales, especially when the\n\nlegislature has expressed unambiguous intent that it wants tax-sale purchasers\n\nto take free and clear of all preexisting liens. See id.\n\n                                          31\n\f      To allow American to stand in the shoes of SF3 to assert SF3’s due-\n\nprocess violations would further serve to thwart public policy and the intent of the\n\nTexas Legislature that unless a challenge is made within the limitations period\n\nand using the statutory framework that was promulgated for the purpose of\n\nwarding against frivolous claims, tax-sale purchasers receive free and clear title\n\nto the property purchased. Thus, the well-established public policies in favor of\n\nstability and certainty of the purchaser’s title at a delinquent-tax sale weigh\n\nagainst permitting the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under\n\nthese circumstances.\n\n            (4.)   Public Policy Disfavors Promoting Litigation\n\n      Allowing American to pursue SF3’s claim for due-process violations would\n\nalso serve to promote litigation, rather than end it. In both Elbaor and Gandy, the\n\nsupreme court held that an assignment of a cause of action that serves to\n\npromote litigation rather than end it violates public policy and should not be\n\nenforced. Gandy, 925 S.W.2d at 705–15; Elbaor, 845 S.W.2d at 250.\n\n      While SF3 could have asserted its due-process violations through a\n\ncollateral attack on the judgment, it did not choose to do so. Instead, SF3 sold its\n\ninterest to American, which took the interest with constructive notice of the\n\nrecorded constable’s deed that vested “good and perfect title” to the property in\n\nPirkle, subject only to the provisions for challenge and redemption under tax\n\ncode section 34.01(n). Allowing SF3’s due-process violations to be litigated by\n\nAmerican through collateral attack, notwithstanding limitations or any other\n\n                                        32\n\fstatutory restriction that would otherwise apply, would create not only a viable\n\nthreat of litigation but also a threat that would last in perpetuity.\n\n      As Pirkle points out in his brief, permitting American to pursue SF3’s due\n\nprocess violation claim risks “establish[ing] a dangerous precedent” by providing\n\n“an incentive to predators to peruse tax sale records for defects in notice to\n\nlienholders, acquire the lien at a discount, and then to foreclose on the lien\n\nwithout any protections to the property tax sale purchaser.”18 We agree. To\n\npermit the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim in this circumstance would\n\nwork to encourage litigation, rather than to curb it.\n\n             (5.)   Collateral Attacks are Disfavored\n\n      Collateral attacks are disfavored because they run counter to the strong\n\npublic policy of the law to give finality to judgments. H.E.B., L.L.C. v.

Consequently, only a void judgment\n\nmay be collaterally attacked. Browning, 165 S.W.3d at 346.\n\n      While Security State Bank permitted a collateral attack on a tax suit\n\njudgment by a lienholder who did not receive notice of the lawsuit, we can find no\n\n      18\n          This is not merely a theoretical concern. In Acirema, N.V. v. Lilly, a\nlienholder took by transfer and assignment in 1996 all rights to property that had\nbeen sold at a tax sale in 1994. No. CIV. A. 1:96–0559, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">876738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1–\n2 (S.D.

The\nsubsequent lienholder sought to have the tax deed set aside, asserting a due-\nprocess violation as to its predecessor in interest who had received no notice of\nthe original, first attempt at a tax sale in 1989. Id. at *4. The court declined to\nreinstate the deed of trust, however, partly because the lienholder failed to avail\nitself of statutory remedies. Id. at *4–5.\n                                           33\n\fcase where the right of collateral attack has been extended to subsequent\n\nlienholders, such as American, who took their interests with notice. The holding\n\nof Security State Bank was narrowly drawn, encompassing only the party whose\n\ndue process rights were denied. See 397 S.W.3d at 724–25 (concluding that the\n\nbank’s suit was a proper collateral attack based upon a due-process violation\n\nthat rendered the tax judgment and tax sale void as to it; finding the bank was not\n\nbound by the judgment, but the judgment valid to other parties; holding that the\n\nbank was entitled to have the tax judgment set aside as to its lien interest; and\n\nsetting aside the tax judgment and sale as to the bank’s interest).\n\n      And while Security State Bank supports the proposition that the delinquent\n\ntax judgment in this case was void as to SF3, it does not support the contention\n\nthat the judgment should be void as to American. Cf. id. American took its\n\ninterest with constructive notice of the constable’s deed at a time when it could\n\nhave directly attacked the judgment.         The strong public policy disfavoring\n\ncollateral attacks on judgments therefore militates against permitting the\n\nassignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under these circumstances.\n\n            (6.)   Considerations of Comity\n\n      Through an elaborate scheme that has been revisited and amended over\n\nthe years, the Texas Legislature has clearly expressed a desire to resolve tax-\n\nsale challenges pursuant to statute, not collateral attack. See Tex. Tax Code\n\nAnn. §§ 33.54, 34.08. Unlike the parties involved in the cases that American\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\fcites,19 at no point in this series of circumstances was American ever deprived of\n\na due process right, i.e., the opportunity to avail itself of statutory remedies to\n\nchallenge the sale.20\n\n      When the legislature has exercised its authority to provide a statutory\n\nremedy that, if followed, would have fully addressed every due process concern\n\n\n      19\n          In addition to Security State Bank, American also relies on Kothari v.\nOyervidez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 810 (Tex.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n1991, no writ). All three cases are distinguishable, however, because the\ncomplaining parties in those cases were the actual lienholders at the time the\ntax-suit judgment was rendered. First State Bank-Keene, 155 F.3d at 733–34,\n737 (holding that under Texas law, because the FDIC was not made a party to\nthe tax suit, its lien interest was not disposed of and the tax sale purchasers took\nthe property subject to that lien); Kothari, 373 S.W.3d at 802–04, 811 (reversing\nsummary judgment because the summary judgment record did not address\ncritical facts concerning notice and filing that were necessary for the court to\ndetermine as a matter of law whether the appellant was entitled to foreclose his\nliens on the property); Murphee, 817 S.W.2d at 851, 854 (affirming judgment for\nrecord lienholder who was not made a party to the tax suit).\n      20\n         American is not asking this court to merely follow Security State Bank\nand the line of cases that, applying the principles of due process, carve out a\ntolling provision for lienholders who were not served with notice of the delinquent\ntax lawsuit. In those cases, had the courts not intervened and permitted a\ncollateral attack on the tax-sale judgment, valuable due-process rights would\nhave been denied to otherwise assiduous lienholders who held existing property\nrights. What American instead asks this court to do is take these cases one step\nfurther. American asks this court to carve out another exception for a special\nclass of litigants—subsequent lienholders who take, with eyes wide open,\nassignments with constructive notice of the properly-recorded constable’s deed,\nand, thereafter, armed with actual knowledge of the tax sale well within the\napplicable period of limitations, nevertheless proceed to turn a blind eye to the\nstatutory mandates in place to assert a challenge to the tax sale in a proper and\ntimely manner.\n\n                                        35\n\fpresent in this circumstance, there is little justification for the courts to intervene\n\nto create new rights and remedies that would allow lienholders to side-step\n\nlegislative mandates.     The due-process analysis in Acirema is particularly\n\ninstructive:\n\n      Where the plaintiff alleges that the deprivation of his property interest\n      was unauthorized by state law, the state need not provide\n      predeprivation process but instead need only provide a\n      postdeprivation remedy. Assuming, arguendo, that the increased\n      cost of redemption did constitute a deprivation, the amended statute\n      which provides for notice—and under which Equitable did indeed\n      receive notice—provided a postdeprivation remedy of which\n      Equitable did not avail itself. Thus, plaintiff’s challenge to the\n      sheriff’s sale has been effectively dealt with by the state legislature\n      in its amended statutory provisions.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">876738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at * 5 (citations omitted).\n\n      Similarly, American seeks predeprivation process when it had full post-\n\ndeprivation remedies available to it. American asks this court to alter the system\n\ndevised by the Texas Legislature and to substitute instead the right to litigate\n\nanother party’s due process violations by collateral attack on the tax sale\n\njudgment. To do so would not only reward American for sleeping on its rights but\n\nalso encourage similar behavior by others who would follow American’s lead in\n\nthe conduct of their business affairs in the future. Principles of comity weigh\n\nagainst permitting the assignment of SF3’s due-process claim to American under\n\nthese circumstances.21\n\n\n      21\n          We note that the Fifth Circuit, in In re Paxton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"40579\"><a href=\"/opinion/40579/herrington-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (5th Cir.\n2006), stated that it found no reversible error when a bankruptcy court and then a\ndistrict court found that a mortgage-interest assignee could pursue its assignor’s\n                                          36\n\f   3. Conclusion\n\n      Regardless of whether SF3 was named and served with citation in the tax\n\nsuit, American was provided ample notice and opportunity to challenge the\n\nvalidity of Pirkle’s deed in compliance with the statutory scheme designed for just\n\nthis situation.   Instead, American, aware of the tax code and its provisions\n\n(having cited portions of the code to Pirkle in its January 15 letter), simply chose\n\nto ignore its statutory remedies. Applying long-standing notions of equity and\n\npublic policy, as set forth above, we hold that American has no standing to assert\n\nSF3’s due-process violations under the circumstances presented in this case.22\n\nWe overrule this part of American’s first issue, and in light of our disposition here,\n\nwe hold that American’s purported lien was not enforceable against Pirkle.\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not err by denying American’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on its cause of action for judicial foreclosure.\n\n\n\n\ndue process claims. However, the court did not elaborate on how the lower\ncourts reached this conclusion or the underlying rationale beyond the district\ncourt’s finding that “a valid assignment confers upon the assignee standing to\nsue in place of the assignor,” and the lower courts apparently did not publish\nopinions to explain their reasoning. Id. And the court did not explain whether the\nlower courts reached this conclusion under federal law or Louisiana law or\naddress whether there were other statutory remedies to address pre-deprivation\nprocess or any post deprivation remedies available to the parties involved. Id.\nTherefore, we do not consider Paxton to determine the outcome of this appeal.\n      22\n         This holding should not inhibit assignments of liens in the future. Rather,\nassignees are simply encouraged to exercise the due diligence that is expected\nof any party involved in a real-estate transaction, i.e., to consult the deed records\nprior to acquiring an interest in property.\n\n                                         37\n\fB. Unconstitutional Taking Claim and Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n      In its second issue, American complains that the taxing authorities are\n\nliable under its takings cause of action, a claim that American contends was\n\ntimely asserted, and that the trial court erred by granting the taxing authorities’\n\nplea to the jurisdiction.\n\n      In its third-party petition against the taxing authorities,23 American asserted\n\nits takings claim based on three grounds: “(1) the taxing authorities performed\n\nan intentional act that proximately caused the extinction of Appellant’s interest in\n\nthe Property; (2) Appellant did not consent to the action; and (3) Appellant did not\n\nreceive adequate compensation for the taking.” The taxing authorities responded\n\nthat American had no standing to assert the claims, that the claims were time-\n\nbarred, and that the taxing authorities were immune from suit.\n\n      Section 2007.021 of the government code, the Private Real Property\n\nRights Preservation Act (PRPRPA) provides,\n\n      (a) A private real property owner may bring suit under this\n      subchapter to determine whether the governmental action of a\n      political subdivision results in a taking under this chapter. A suit\n      under this subchapter must be filed in a district court in the county in\n      which the private real property owner’s affected property is\n      located . . . .\n\n\n\n      23\n        The trial court had already ruled on American’s and Pirkle’s summary\njudgment motions and declined American’s motion for reconsideration when\nAmerican filed its third-party petition on March 7, 2014—more than a year after\nAmerican acquired its interest in the property and sent its first letter to Pirkle\nregarding the tax sale.\n\n                                        38\n\f      (b) A suit under this subchapter must be filed not later than the\n      180th day after the date the private real property owner knew or\n      should have known that the governmental action restricted or limited\n      the owner’s right in the private real property.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.021 (West 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n      Assuming, without deciding, that American had standing to bring suit\n\nagainst the taxing authorities,24 pursuant to PRPRPA, American was required to\n\nbring suit within 180 days of the date it knew or should have known that its rights\n\nin the property had been restricted or limited. See id. Setting aside the question\n\nof whether on October 31, 2012—the date American received its assignment\n\nfrom SF3—American should have known about the tax sale and constable’s\n\ndeed (which had been filed of record more than two months earlier), certainly the\n\nrecord establishes that as of January 15, 2013—the date American sent its letter\n\nto Pirkle—American actually knew that the tax sale had occurred. Therefore,\n\npursuant to section 2007.021(b), the very latest date on which American could\n\nhave filed its takings claim was July 15, 2013—180 days after January 15, 2013.\n\nAmerican filed its third-party petition on March 7, 2014.\n\n      American does not dispute that its takings claim was subject to PRPRPA’s\n\n180-day limitations period, but it argues that its claim was nevertheless timely\n\n\n       24\n            The PRPRPA defines an “owner” as “a person with legal or equitable\ntitle to affected private real property at the time a taking occurs,” and “private real\nproperty” as “an interest in real property recognized by common law . . . that is\nnot owned by the federal government, this state, or a political subdivision of this\nstate.” Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.002(2), (4) (West 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                          39\n\fbecause the claim was not “ripe” until the trial court ruled on the summary\n\njudgment motions, declaring that the tax sale extinguished American’s rights in\n\nthe property under the deed of trust.25\n\n      To support this contention, American relies heavily upon Williamson\n\nCounty Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, a\n\nzoning-ordinance case in which the Supreme Court held that “a claim that the\n\napplication of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not\n\nripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has\n\nreached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the\n\nproperty at issue.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

American\n\nargues that since the trial court fits the general description of a government entity\n\n“with the authority to interpret and adjudicate the proper applications of statu[t]es\n\nand regulations,” its takings claim was not ripe for filing until the trial court\n\nentered its partial summary judgment on September 30, 2013, which “divested\n\n[American] of its rights in the [p]roperty.”\n\n      This argument wholly ignores the prior judgment issued by the same trial\n\ncourt more than a year earlier, on April 26, 2012, which granted the authority to\n\nconduct the tax sale. Once the tax sale occurred pursuant the authority of the\n\ncourt, tax code section 34.08 established that Pirkle took “free and clear title,”\n\n      25\n       American argues that “[b]ecause [American] filed its Third Party Petition\n158 days later, on March 7, 2014, the [t]axing [a]uthorities’ argument, that\n[American] asserted its claim outside the 180-day statutory period, must\nnecessarily fail.”\n\n                                           40\n\fsubject only to timely challenge pursuant to other Texas Tax Code provisions. At\n\nthe very latest, as soon as SF3 or American knew about the court-authorized tax\n\nsale, it also knew that governmental action had been taken which “restricted or\n\nlimited” its right in property. See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2007.021.\n\n      Furthermore, the facts of this case are quite different from circumstances\n\nwhere a party is awaiting a final decision from a zoning commission or other\n\nregulatory agency to determine whether the ultimate decision will be adverse to\n\nits property interest. Cf. Williamson Cnty., 473 U.S. at 186, 105 S. Ct. at 3116\n\n(stating that a takings claim is ripe when a final decision on the application of\n\nzoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to the property is obtained and\n\nstate procedures have been used for obtaining just compensation). In fact, the\n\nPRPRPA recognizes this distinction by providing two methods through which a\n\nproperty owner may assert a takings claim under PRPRPA:                (1) a section\n\n2007.021 “suit . . . to determine whether the governmental action . . . results in a\n\ntaking” or (2) a section 2007.022 “contested case with a state agency to\n\ndetermine whether a governmental action of the state agency results in a\n\ntaking.”26 Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2007.021–.022 (West 2008); BP Am. Prod.\n\nCo., 290 S.W.3d at 366 (holding that the former must be brought in district court\n\n      26\n         If a property owner asserts a takings claim by filing a contested case with\na state agency, it must exhaust all administrative remedies available within that\nagency and be “aggrieved by a final decision” in the contested case to be entitled\nto judicial review.

See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.\n\nC. Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In its final issue, American argues that the trial court erred by awarding\n\nattorney’s fees to Pirkle, contending that Pirkle’s counsel failed to segregate her\n\nfees between the various parties and the causes of action asserted at the August\n\n14, 2014 hearing on American’s motion for entry of final judgment. However, a\n\nreporter’s record of the August 14, 2014 hearing was not made.28 Without a\n\nreporter’s record of the hearing, we cannot determine whether American objected\n\nto the alleged failure to segregate. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; Green Int’l, Inc. v.\n\n\n      of the matter, was not named as a defendant in the [t]ax [s]uit by any\n      of the [t]axing [a]uthorities and was not provided any notice of the\n      [t]ax [s]uit proceedings.”\n\n             ....\n\n              By ignoring the statutorily mandated requirements for\n      instituting the [t]ax [s]uit, specifically by failing to identify and join the\n      lienholder of record in the [t]ax [s]uit, the [t]axing [a]uthorities took\n      action that caused the taking or that was substantially certain to\n      result in the complained-of taking.” [Emphasis added.]\n      28\n        The clerk of this court has contacted the trial court clerk to determine\nwhether the hearing was recorded, and the trial court clerk has indicated that no\nsuch record was made or filed. The clerk’s record contains only American’s letter\ndesignating the contents of the clerk’s record and does not contain a request by\nAmerican for the reporter’s record or a designation of the portions that it should\ncontain.
