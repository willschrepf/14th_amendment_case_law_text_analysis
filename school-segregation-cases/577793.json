The plaintiffs, four riverboat\ncasinos operating in Illinois, brought this RICO suit\n\n\n  Circuit Judges Flaum, Rovner, and Williams did not partici-\npate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\f2                                               No. 09-3975\n\nagainst five Illinois racetracks, charging that the owner\nof two of the tracks, in cahoots with Illinois’ then\ngovernor, Rod Blagojevich, had “bought” a pair of Illinois\nstatutes harmful to the casinos. Enacted in 2006 and\n2008 by large margins, these statutes, which are to\nremain in effect until the end of this year, require the\ncasinos to deposit 3 percent of their revenues in a segre-\ngated state fund—the “Horse Racing Equity Trust\nFund”—for disbursement to the racetracks within 10\ndays of receipt; the racetracks are directed to use the\nmoney to increase winners’ and runner-ups’ purses\nand improve the tracks. Ill. Pub. Act 94-804, effective\nMay 26, 2006; Ill. Pub. Act 95-1008, effective Dec. 15, 2008.\n   The plaintiffs asked the district court to impose, as\na remedy for the alleged violation of RICO, a construc-\ntive trust in their favor on the money received by the\nracetracks under these laws. The district judge issued\na temporary restraining order that required that any\nmoney paid by the state fund be placed in an escrow\naccount that the racetracks could not reach while the\nlitigation was pending. Later the judge ruled that the\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, barred equitable\nrelief, of which the imposition of a constructive trust is\na form. So he dissolved the temporary restraining order.\n  The casinos appealed. A panel of this court reinstated\nthe temporary restraining order pending appeal (so\nthe escrow remains in force and no money is being dis-\nbursed to the racetracks), and then reversed the district\ncourt (with one judge dissenting), holding that the Tax\nInjunction Act did not bar the casinos’ quest for equitable\n\fNo. 09-3975                                               3\n\nrelief in federal court. 638 F.3d 519 (7th Cir. 2011). We\ngranted rehearing en banc to reexamine that holding.\nThe merits of the suit were not before the panel and are\nnot before us. Moreover, upon the grant of rehearing\nen banc, the panel opinion was vacated only with regard\nto appeal No. 09-3975; the part of the panel’s opinion\nand order that relates to appeal No. 10-1019, which\nhad been consolidated with No. 09-3975, was unaffected\nby the grant of rehearing en banc and is unaffected by\nthe present opinion. And the temporary restraining\norder pending appeal remains in force.\n  The Tax Injunction Act forbids federal district courts\nto “enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or\ncollection of any tax under State law,” provided that\nan adequate remedy is available in the state courts,\n28 U.S.C. § 1341, and it is in this case. The Act thus does\nnot limit any substantive rights to enjoin a state tax\nbut requires only that they be enforced in a state court\nrather than a federal court. The requirement serves to\nminimize the frictions inherent in a federal system of\ngovernment, and is considered so important that the\nduty of federal courts to cede litigation seeking to\nenjoin state tax statutes to the state courts (a duty of\n“comity”—that is, of respect for another sovereign)\nextends beyond the limits of the Tax Injunction Act. Fair\nAssessment in Real Estate Ass’n, Inc. v. McNary, 454 U.S.\n100, 110 (1981). The Act is just a “partial codification of\nthe federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation.”\nNational Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n, 515 U.S. 582, 590 (1995); see also Levin v. Commerce\nEnergy, Inc., 130 S. Ct. 2323, 2331-33 (2010). The Supreme\n\f4                                                 No. 09-3975\n\nCourt has told us to withhold decision even in situations\nto which the Act does not apply, though we won’t have\nto take that step in this case.\n  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), had as a practical\nmatter stripped away the states’ sovereign immunity\nfrom equitable suits. So were it not for the Tax Injunc-\ntion Act and the related doctrine of comity, “ ‘state tax\nadministration might be thrown into disarray, and tax-\npayers might escape the ordinary procedural require-\nments imposed by state law. During the pendency of the\nfederal suit the collection of revenue under the chal-\nlenged law might be obstructed, with consequent\ndamage to the State’s budget, and perhaps a shift to the\nState of the risk of taxpayer insolvency.’ ” Rosewell v. LaSalle\nNat’l Bank, 450 U.S. 503, 527 (1981), quoting Perez v.\nLedesma, 401 U.S. 82, 128 n. 17 (1971) (separate opinion);\nsee also Hill v. Kemp, 478 F.3d 1236, 1246-47 (10th Cir.\n2007). The Act is “first and foremost a vehicle to limit\ndrastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere\nwith so important a local concern as the collection of\ntaxes.” Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, supra, 450 U.S. at 522.\nThe reason for this drastic limitation is that “it is upon\ntaxation that the several States chiefly rely to obtain the\nmeans to carry on their respective governments, and it is\nof the utmost importance to all of them that the\nmodes adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be\ninterfered with as little as possible. Any delay in the\nproceedings of the officers, upon whom the duty is de-\nvolved of collecting the taxes, may derange the opera-\ntions of government, and thereby cause serious detriment\nto the public.” Dows v. City of Chicago, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.)\n108, 110 (1871).\n\fNo. 09-3975                                               5\n\n   Not that enjoining a particular tax, depending on what\nit is, is certain to “derange the operations of govern-\nment.” But a general lowering of standards under the Tax\nInjunction Act could result in state fiscal policy being\nnickeled and dimed to death by an avalanche of suits\nby disgruntled taxpayers. (When the suit is not by tax-\npayers, but by persons objecting just to how the money\nis being spent, as in Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88 (2004), the\ndanger of interference with state tax administration is\ndiminished; Hibbs holds that such suits are outside\nthe Act’s scope.) The application of the Act should not\nturn on judges’ guesses about the importance of a par-\nticular tax to the legitimate operations of state govern-\nment. Even the plaintiffs acknowledge that the allegedly\ncorrupt origin of the statutes they attack does not bear\non whether the exactions that those statutes impose\nare taxes within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act.\nThe Act would be thwarted if a taxpayer could get a\nfederal court to enjoin the collection of a state tax just\nby presenting evidence of corruption in the process\nby which the taxing statute had been enacted. This princi-\nple has been recognized in analogous contexts, see, e.g.,\nCity of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499\nU.S. 365, 374-78 (1991) (state immunity from federal\nantitrust suits)—notably that of absolute immunity.\nPierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 553-54 (1967).\n  We are mindful that the state is not a party to this suit.\nBut the relief sought both is equitable and would thwart\nthe tax as surely as an injunction against its collection.\nThe taxpayers (the casinos) are seeking a constructive\ntrust of the tax revenues, which if imposed would result\n\f6                                               No. 09-3975\n\nin their recapturing the taxes they have paid. The tax\nwould be nullified. (If the tax statutes were not shortly\nto expire, the casinos would be seeking an injunction\nas well.)\n  The Act’s forum-selecting character argues com-\npellingly for a crisp rule distinguishing taxes from other\nexactions by states, such as fees charged for services\nprovided (or prices charged for the sale or lease of state\nproperty), transfers of damages awarded to a state to\nthe persons on whose behalf the state had sued (cf.\nTrailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1,\n5 (1st Cir. 1992) (“the accident-compensation statute is\nessentially a social welfare program and tort reform law\nto impose on motor vehicle owners as a class the cost of\nthe accidents they cause and to assure compensation for\naccident victims”) (emphasis added)), and fines. A crisp\nrule determining which court system has jurisdiction\nto decide a particular type of case is needful because\nuntil the proper forum for a lawsuit is determined, the\ncase cannot proceed; and if at any time until the decision\nresolving the litigation becomes final by exhaustion\nof appellate remedies it is discovered that the court\nrendering the decision lacked jurisdiction, the suit must\nstart over from scratch in the forum that has jurisdiction.\nA challenge to the constitutionality of the casino-tax\nstatutes brought by the casinos in the Illinois state\ncourt system against public officials rather than the\nracetracks has already been decided (adversely to the\ncasinos) by the Supreme Court of Illinois. Empress Casino\nJoliet Corp. v. Giannoulias, 896 N.E.2d 277 (2008). The\ncasinos brought a second suit in the Illinois courts, making\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                   7\n\nnew allegations of corruption. While we federal judges\nare continuing to debate the proper venue of this case,\nthe second state suit, too, has been decided on the merits,\nagain adversely to the casinos. Empress Casino Joliet Corp.\nv. Giannoulias, 942 N.E.2d 783 (Ill. App. 2011), leave to\nappeal denied (Ill. S. Ct., No. 112003, May 25, 2011).\n  As the casino-tax litigation illustrates, “administrative\nsimplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute . . . .\nComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up\ntime and money as the parties litigate, not the merits\nof their claims, but which court is the right court to\ndecide those claims.” Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 130 S. Ct. 1181,\n1193 (2010). “Functional approaches to legal questions\nare often, perhaps generally, preferable to mechanical\nrules; but the preference is reversed when it comes\nto jurisdiction.” Hoaglund ex rel. Midwest Transit, Inc. v.\nSandberg, Phoenix & Von Gontard, P.C., 385 F.3d 737,\n739 (7th Cir. 2004). And so “the more mechanical the ap-\nplication of a jurisdictional rule, the better. The chief\nand often the only virtue of a jurisdictional rule is clar-\nity.” In re Kilgus, 811 F.2d 1112, 1117 (7th Cir. 1987) (cita-\ntions omitted); see also Kuntz v. Lamar Corp., 385 F.3d\n1177, 1183 (9th Cir. 2004).\n   Although a jurisdictional rule should be simple and\nclear, where possible—and this is possible in regard to\nthe Tax Injunction Act—a number of decisions under\nthe Act, including the panel majority opinion, have\nflirted with open-ended, multifactor tests—open-ended\nbecause the relative weights of the factors are left to\njudicial discretion. Among the factors either urged by\n\f8                                              No. 09-3975\n\nthe casino plaintiffs or mentioned in the cases are\nwhether the legislature called the exaction a “tax” or\nsomething else (the Supreme Court of Illinois calls the\ncasino exaction a “tax,” but the plaintiffs insist that this\nis irrelevant—the legislature must use the word; it has\nnot done so, instead calling the casino exaction a “condi-\ntion of licensure”); whether the money generated by\nthe exaction is deposited in a “lock box” type of trust\nfund (the only real kind, according to the plaintiffs, who\ncall the Social Security Trust Funds a fraud); how\nquickly the money passes through the trust fund to the\nultimate beneficiaries; the price elasticity of the taxed\nbehavior; the amount of revenue collected by the\nexaction; whether that revenue is to be used for a tradi-\ntional public purpose; whether the benefit that the\nfiscal program confers on the people of the state is direct\nor indirect; whether the exaction is designed to benefit\none firm or a narrow group of firms (for example, race-\ntracks) by oppressing a competitor or competitors (for\nexample, casinos); whether enjoining its collection\nwould prevent the state from paying its bills or even\nthreaten it with insolvency; whether the persons or\nfirms subjected to the exaction are numerous or few,\nwhether the beneficiaries of the exaction are numerous\nor few, and what the relative size of the two groups\nis; whether the amount of revenue from the exaction\nthat is transferred to the intended beneficiaries is deter-\nmined by the legislature or is allowed to rise and fall with\nthe fluctuations in that revenue; whether the plaintiff\navoids naming state officials as defendants; whether\nthe exaction was based on the state’s taxing power or\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                 9\n\non some other power, such as the police power (even\nthough these are distinctions primarily relevant to the\nfederal Constitution, which unlike state constitutions\nwas designed, in order to protect state prerogatives, to\nbe a constitution of limited, specified powers); and, as\na kind of catchall, how much the exaction resembles\nwhat everyone would agree was a “tax,” or as Wittgenstein\nmight have wanted us to ask, how close a “family resem-\nblance” the exaction bears to an exaction acknowledged\nby all to be a “tax.” Is it a brother, or a third cousin?\n  The Supreme Court has not endorsed any multifactor\ntest for applying the Tax Injunction Act, and such a test\nwould be inappropriate quite apart from the need for\nclarity and simplicity in interpreting a forum-selection\nlaw. It is not a proper office of the federal courts to\n“reform” state fiscal policies by providing a federal\nforum for state taxpayers who object to the form or sub-\nstance of laws designed to raise revenues for state pur-\nposes, whether purposes approved or disapproved by\nenlightened social thinkers. The wisdom of a tax on\ncasinos to benefit racetracks is not a proper subject of\ninquiry by federal judges. “The federal balance is well\nserved when the several States define and elaborate\ntheir own laws through their own courts and admin-\nistrative processes and without undue interference\nfrom the Federal Judiciary. The States’ interest in the\nintegrity of their own processes is of particular moment\nrespecting questions of state taxation.” Arkansas v. Farm\nCredit Services of Central Arkansas, 520 U.S. 821, 826 (1997).\n  The only material distinction is between exactions\ndesigned to generate revenue—taxes, whatever the state\n\f10                                              No. 09-3975\n\ncalls them (for what is a “tax” for purposes of the Tax\nInjunction Act is a question of federal rather than state\nlaw, RTC Commercial Assets Trust 1995-NP3-1 v. Phoenix\nBond & Indemnity Co., 169 F.3d 448, 457 (7th Cir. 1999);\nWright v. Riveland, 219 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir. 2000); Ameri-\ncan Landfill, Inc. v. Stark/Tuscarawas/Wayne Joint Solid\nWaste Management District, 166 F.3d 835, 837 (6th Cir.\n1999))—and exactions designed either to punish (fines, in\na broad sense) rather than to generate revenue\n(the hope being that the punishment will deter, though\ndeterrence is never perfect and therefore fines generate\nsome state revenues), or to compensate for a service\nthat the state provides to the persons or firms on whom\nor on which the exaction falls (or, what is similar, to\ncompensate the state for costs imposed on it by those\npersons or firms, other than costs of providing a service\nto them): in other words, a fee. “If the fee is a rea-\nsonable estimate of the cost imposed by the person re-\nquired to pay the fee, then it is a user fee and is within\nthe municipality’s regulatory power. If it is calculated\nnot just to recover a cost imposed on the municipality\nor its residents but to generate revenues that the munici-\npality can use to offset unrelated costs or confer unre-\nlated benefits, it is a tax, whatever its nominal designa-\ntion.” Diginet, Inc. v. Western Union ATS, Inc., 958 F.2d\n1388, 1399 (7th Cir. 1992).\n  For examples of exactions held to be fees, see Hager\nv. City of West Peoria, 84 F.3d 865, 870-71 (7th Cir. 1996)\n(fees for permits for use of certain streets by heavy\ntrucks); Government Suppliers Consolidating Services, Inc. v.\nBayh, 975 F.2d 1267, 1271 n. 2 (7th Cir. 1992) (registration\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                11\n\nfees for waste collection vehicles), and Trailer Marine\nTransport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, supra, 977 F.2d at 4-6\n(annual fee imposed on owners of motor vehicles\nto fund compulsory accident compensation). For ex-\namples of nominal “fees” held to be taxes for purposes\nof the Act, see Hill v. Kemp, supra, 478 F.3d at 1243-46\n(revenue from sale of specialty license plates greatly\nexceeded cost of the plates and the excess was ear-\nmarked for purposes, such as promotion of adoptions,\ntied to the legend on the plate); Folio v. City of Clarksburg,\n134 F.3d 1211, 1217 (4th Cir. 1998) (city fee for fire pro-\ntection); Wright v. McClain, 835 F.2d 143, 144-45 (6th Cir.\n1987) (parolee’s payments to a victim compensation\nfund); cf. Diginet, Inc. v. Western Union ATS, Inc., supra,\n958 F.2d at 1399 (“franchise fee” imposed on use of a fiber\noptic network to generate revenues that are “use[d] to\noffset unrelated costs or confer unrelated benefits”).\nIn listing these cases, however, we do not mean to\nendorse their specific holdings, based as they often are\non questionable multifactor tests.\n  The line between a tax and a fee, and a tax and a fine,\nis sometimes fuzzy, and in a borderline case factors that\ndistinguish between rather similar-looking exactions\nmay be useful tools for determining on which side of the\nline the case falls. For example, a tax might be so totally\npunitive in purpose and effect that, since nomenclature\nis unimportant, it should be classified as a fine rather\nthan a tax. “The mere use of the word ‘tax’ in an act\nprimarily designed to define and suppress crime is not\nenough to show that within the true intendment of the\nterm a tax was laid. When by its very nature the imposi-\n\f12                                                No. 09-3975\n\ntion is a penalty, it must be so regarded.” Lipke v. Lederer,\n259 U.S. 557, 561-62 (1922) (citation omitted); see also\nRetail Industry Leaders Ass’n v. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180, 189 (4th\nCir. 2007); Denton v. City of Carrollton, 235 F.2d 481, 485 (5th\nCir. 1956); RTC Commercial Assets Trust 1995-NP3-1 v.\nPhoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., supra, 169 F.3d at 457-58.\nAnd so in Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S.\n767, 782 (1994), the Supreme Court held that a state mari-\njuana “tax” was actually a fine, noting among other\nthings that it was exacted only after the taxpayer had\nbeen arrested for the conduct that had given rise to the\ntax obligation and that because the taxed activity was\ncompletely forbidden “any legitimate revenue-raising\npurpose that might support such a tax could be equally\nwell served by increasing the fine imposed upon con-\nviction.”\n  Or imagine a fee that has aspects of a tax because\nthe revenue it generates is greater than is needed to\nfund the service for which the fee is the charge, and the\nsurplus goes into the state’s general funds. In Schneider\nTransport, Inc. v. Cattanach, 657 F.2d 128, 132 (7th Cir.\n1981)—a case indistinguishable from the present case—\nwe held that what was called a fee was actually a tax;\nwe said: “although not denominated as such, the\n[vehicle] registration fees are imposed for revenue-\nraising purposes, a characteristic of any tax. The fees\nare deposited in a segregated fund, the state transporta-\ntion fund, for transportation purposes, including high-\nway construction. The revenues from the fund ‘are depos-\nited into funds other than the general fund and are avail-\nable for the purposes for which such funds are cre-\n\fNo. 09-3975                                             13\n\nated’ ” (citations omitted). The First Circuit reached the\nopposite conclusion in San Juan Cellular Telephone Co. v.\nPublic Service Comm’n, 967 F.2d 683 (1st Cir. 1992); it\nheld that a fee imposed on phone companies to\ndefray the expenses of regulating them was not a tax\neven though the fee generated more revenue than\nneeded to meet those expenses and the surplus was\nused for other state purposes rather than returned to\nthe companies.\n  Fees for products (people buy electricity from public\nutilities) and bona fide user fees (a toll for crossing a\nbridge, for example) are not “taxes” in either lay or legal\nlingo. Similarly, bona fide user fees for wharfs and tug-\nboats aren’t taxes for the purpose of the Constitution’s\nimport-export duties clause, or the rule against discrim-\ninatory taxes on interstate commerce. But “sin taxes” are\nreal taxes and so are taxes that go into limited-purpose\nfunds, such as the FICA tax and the gasoline tax. We\nmustn’t write transfer payments and behavior-shaping\ntaxes out of the Tax Injunction Act just because it is\neasier with such taxes to identify winners and losers.\nThe Act would have a very limited reach if we did that.\n  The recent decision in Kathrein v. City of Evanston,\n636 F.3d 906, 912-13 (7th Cir. 2011), classified a city\n“demolition tax” as not being a tax for purposes of the\nTax Injunction Act, but instead as being a regulatory\ndevice (like the Prohibition-era tax on alcohol that we\nmentioned) because its sole purpose, the panel con-\ncluded, was to keep poor people in their homes. The tax\nwould deter demolitions and the modest fund generated\n\f14                                             No. 09-3975\n\nby it (a trivial $90,000 each year) would be used to subsi-\ndize those poor people and thus amplify the effect of\nthe tax in enabling them to keep their homes out of\nreach of the wrecker’s ball. We do not agree with that\ndecision. Taxes that seek both to deter and to collect\nrevenue when deterrence fails (liquor taxes are an ex-\nample) are commonplace, and these sin taxes often are\nan important component of state fiscal policy because\nthere are so many unrepentant sinners.\n  The exaction imposed on the casinos is not a fine or a\nfee, and is therefore (if there is to be a simple and clear\njurisdictional rule) a tax; the panel majority was\nexplicit that it was not a fee and no one suggests that it’s\na fine. It is instead an example of a state’s taking money\nfrom one group of firms and giving it to another group,\nin much the same way that federal income tax takes\nmoney from persons and firms mostly in the nonagricul-\ntural sector of the economy and Congress gives some of\nthe tax revenues to the tiny but influential agricultural\nsector in the form of farm subsidies: in other words, tax\nand spend, and the taxpayers and the recipients of the\ntax revenues needn’t be the same.\n  The fact that the casino exaction isn’t called a tax, is\nplaced in a trust fund, passes speedily from taxpayer to\nrecipient, is justified by reference to the police power of\nthe state rather than the state’s taxing power, etc., has\nnothing to do with any concern behind the Tax Injunc-\ntion Act. “Taxation” is unpopular these days, so taxing\nauthorities avoid the term. Legislatures are unpredictable,\nso trust funds are created to hold revenues generated by\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                 15\n\nspecific taxes, in order to avoid annual appropriations\nbattles. The politics of state taxation have naught to do\nwith the policy of the Tax Injunction Act. If in the guise\nof “interpreting” the Act the courts insist on greater\ncandor or directness in state taxing legislation as the\nprice for avoiding federal-court suits to enjoin state tax\ncollections, we shall make it difficult, given the politics\nof tax-and-spending legislation, for states to raise\nrevenues—we shall be doing just what the Supreme Court\nin Rosewell said it was the object of the Act to prevent\ndoing: throwing state tax administration into disarray.\n  Gambling taxes, including casino taxes, are not unique\nto Illinois. See Ind. Code §§ 4-33-12-1, -6(b)(6); N.J.\nStat. §§ 5:12-203(a), -205; cf. Md. Code, State Gov’t, §§ 9-1A-\n27(a)(5), -29. They are real taxes, not fees. Their aim is to\nraise revenue, not to cover costs. That the revenue is\nearmarked for a particular purpose is hardly unusual;\nthink of the social security tax. Congress does, it is true,\ndefine the exact benefits to which each social security\nrecipient is entitled. But the aggregate benefits vary with\nthe number of recipients, rather than being specified. The\nbenefits conferred by another earmarked federal tax, the\nfederal tax on gasoline, likewise fluctuate; the amount of\nrevenue generated by the tax varies from year to year\nbecause it’s a tax on gallonage and so depends on the\namount of driving and on the gas consumption of the\nvehicles driven. See, e.g., U.S. Energy Information Admin-\nistration, “Annual Energy Outlook 2011,” p. 10 (2011),\nwww.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/0383(2011).pdf\n(visited July 1, 2011).\n\f16                                             No. 09-3975\n\n   A tax, possibly of corrupt origin, levied on one set of\ngambling enterprises to subsidize another may seem a\nfiscal travesty. But what has that to do with the Tax\nInjunction Act? And, though we don’t think this\nmatters, we note that horse racing is a major activity in\nIllinois and one with economic significance for the state.\nIt employs more than 30,000 people and generates\nmore than $700 million in annual betting and some $15\nmillion in state and local government revenues. Ill. Pub.\nAct 94-804, § 1(3)-(4); Illinois Racing Board, “2010\nAnnual Report” 2, 6 (Mar. 2011), www2.illinois.gov/irb/\nDocuments/AnnualReports/2010_Annual_Report.pdf\n(visited July 1, 2011); Commission on Government Fore-\ncasting and Accountability, “Wagering in Illinois—2010\nUpdate” 53-60 (2011), www.ilga.gov/commission/\ncgfa2006/Upload 2010wagering_in_il.pdf (visited July 1,\n2011). And that’s just the beginning, because horse racing\nboosts the equine population of Illinois, which benefits\nbreeders, horse farms, feed companies, and other busi-\nnesses ancillary to horse racing. Bill Wright, “Where\nIllinois’ Economy Gets Its Horsepower,” Chicago Tribune,\nMar. 10, 2002, p. 6.\n   There is also Illinoisians’ sentimental affection for\nhorses which we noted in Cavel Int’l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500\nF.3d 551 (7th Cir. 2007), where we upheld against a com-\nmerce clause challenge the decision by the Illinois legisla-\nture—inspired by movie actress Bo Derek, id. at 559, a\nnotable horse lover—shutting down the last slaughter-\nhouse in the United States (which happened to be in\nIllinois) that was permitted to slaughter horses for human\nconsumption. States routinely subsidize favored activi-\n\fNo. 09-3975                                             17\n\nties—not by taxing the persons or firms engaged in the\nactivities, which would make the “tax” a fee and negate the\nsubsidy, but by taxing someone else. Are animals not\nappropriate objects of state subsidy? Cannot Citation,\nMan ‘o War, Seabiscuit, and Secretariat be distinguished,\nas objects of public solicitude, from roulette wheels and\none-armed bandits?\n   Casinos are recent additions to the legal gambling\nscene in Illinois; the first casino in the state opened in\n1991. Jerry Shnay, “Alton Riverboat Already Hitting\nJackpot,” Chicago Tribune, Sept. 25, 1991, at 4. They\ncompete with the racetracks and thus attract gamblers\naway from them. So at least it is widely believed, see\nIllinois Harness Horsemen’s Ass’n, Press Release, “Top\nState Horsemen Flee to Greener Pastures in Eastern\nStates” (Nov. 30, 2005), and William Nack, “A House\nDivided,” Sports Illustrated, July 10, 1995, at 52, 56,\nthough Douglas M. Walker and John D. Jackson, in their\narticle “Do U.S. Gambling Industries Cannibalize Each\nOther?,” 36 Public Finance Rev. 308, 322-24 (2008), present\ncontrary evidence—evidence that casino and other non-\nracetrack gambling increases the demand for racetrack\ngambling by increasing the demand for gambling in\ngeneral. What is not debatable is that, whether because\nof the advent of casinos or because of other factors, race-\ntrack attendance and revenues in Illinois have plum-\nmeted in recent years, along with the state’s horse popula-\ntion and commercial activities that are correlated with\nthe number of horses. Illinois Racing Board, supra, at 9;\nCommission on Government Forecasting and Account-\nability, supra, at 59-60; Will Buss, “Hoffman: Bill Will\n\f18                                            No. 09-3975\n\nHelp Fairmount,” Belleville News-Democrat, Mar. 27, 2008,\np. A1. The first of these sources shows horse-racing bets\nfalling from $1.2 billion in 1996 to $.7 billion in 2010,\nthough some of the drop is doubtless due to the economic\ncrisis that began in 2008; the 2007 total was $900 million.\n  Sixty percent of the subsidy created by revenues from\nthe casino tax is earmarked for the purses for winners\nand runners-up in the horse races, on the theory that\nbigger purses attract the owners of the better horses\nand the better the horses in a race the larger the at-\ntendance and therefore the more money is bet and so\nthe greater the track’s revenues are because they’re a\npercentage of the amount of money that is bet. The other\n40 percent is earmarked for physical improvements of\nthe racetracks. The subsidy is rationally designed to\npromote the horse racing industry in Illinois, which\nseems no less proper an objective than promoting a\nstate’s film industry by offering tax credits or other fin-\nancial incentives to filmmakers, a common form of\nstate subsidy. Horse racing and movies are two forms\nof entertainment. Are the taxes that provide the revenue\nto subsidize such activities not taxes at all, but in-\nstead—what?\n  In a laissez-faire or Social Darwinist society, as\ndreamed by Herbert Spencer (the target of Holmes’s\ncrack that “the 14th Amendment does not enact Mr.\nHerbert Spencer’s Social Statics,” Lochner v. New York,\n198 U.S. 45, 75 (1905)), the government would keep its\nhands off the competition between the casinos and the\nracetracks. The disappearance of racetracks, jockeys,\n\fNo. 09-3975                                             19\n\nhorses, bridles, blacksmiths, racetrack touts, and DVDs\nof National Velvet—replaced by croupiers, glassy-\neyed retirees at one-armed bandits, roulette wheels, and\nblackjack tables, all on riverboat casinos—would be\ncommended as progress. But American government is\nnot committed to the laissez-faire vision of society.\nWe find no hints of Social Darwinism in the Tax Injunc-\ntion Act. Congress and state legislatures frequently\nuse their taxing, spending, and regulatory powers to\nredistribute wealth from one group in society to another.\nThis is a familiar exercise of taxing power and whether\nunconstitutional in particular instances (in the Illinois\ncourts the casinos unsuccessfully attacked the casino tax\nas an uncompensated taking), it is still taxation, which\nis our only concern in this appeal. Federal payroll\ntaxes are earmarked for such expenditure programs as\nMedicare, social security, and unemployment benefits;\nthe federal gasoline tax is used to subsidize highway\nconstruction; other earmarked taxes are common. See\nSusannah Camic, “Earmarking: The Potential Benefits,” 4\nPitt. Tax Rev. 55, 60-61 (2006). Rarely are taxpayers\nclosely matched with the recipients of the spending that\nthe taxes support. If you die before reaching the age of\n62, you get no social security benefits even if you’ve\nbeen paying social security tax for 40 years.\n  Illinois’ casino tax is not an isolated example of taxing\none industry for the benefit of another. The federal\nAudio Home Recording Act of 1992 taxes digital media\nto subsidize prerecorded media, 17 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.\n(though the tax has, as many taxes do, a punitive purpose\nas well—to discourage illegal copying of recordings). The\n\f20                                                No. 09-3975\n\nIllinois Coal Technology Development Assistance Fund\ntaxes gas and electrical utilities to pay for the develop-\nment of coal technologies, 30 ILCS 730/3. And Ohio\ntaxes wine from all over the world to pay for research\non grapes in Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§ 924.51 et seq.,\n4301.43(B).\n   When the plaintiffs call the casino tax a “fee,” they do so\nbecause they want a word to describe what the casino\nexaction is: if it is not a tax or a fee (or a fine), what is\nit? The panel majority, emphasizing the adverse effect\nof the tax on the casinos, called it “a regulatory penalty\nor fee.” Fees for services are not taxes, but no services\nare rendered to the casinos in exchange for their having\nto give up 3 percent of their revenues. All the money\ngoes to the racetracks. The plaintiffs try to blur the dis-\ntinction by quoting from a previous opinion of this\ncourt that “courts faced with distinguishing a ‘tax’ from\na ‘fee’ ‘have tended . . . to emphasize the revenue’s ulti-\nmate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to\nthe public, of a sort often financed by a general tax,\nor whether it provides more narrow benefits to\nregulated companies or defrays the agency’s cost of reg-\nulation.’ ” Hager v. City of West Peoria, supra, 84 F.3d at 870,\nquoting San Juan Cellular Telephone Co. v. Public Service\nComm’n, supra, 967 F.2d at 685. The reference to “narrow\nbenefits” may seem to describe this case, since only\nracetracks received the proceeds of the casino tax. But\nthis is to ignore the words in the Hager opinion that\nfollow “provides more narrow benefits”: “to regulated\ncompanies or defrays the agency’s cost of regulation.” The\nrevenues from the tax on the casinos does not go to pay\n\fNo. 09-3975                                               21\n\nfor some service that the State of Illinois renders to\ncasinos, or, what amounts to the same thing, to some\nservice that is required by the existence of casinos, in the\nsame way that expenses incurred to regulate telephone\ncompanies were necessitated by those companies and\nhence were part of the regulatory costs (San Juan Cellular).\nThe casino tax goes to subsidize racetracks, and so it\nfalls within the rule that exactions of money earmarked\nfor designated purposes rather than collected just to\nswell the state’s coffers are taxes within the meaning of\nthe Tax Injunction Act even if imposed for a reason\nof which judges disapprove.\n  The plaintiffs point us to Bidart Brothers v. California\nApple Comm’n, 73 F.3d 925 (9th Cir. 1996), but that case\ninvolved an assessment of fees on apple producers to\nsupport advertising and other activities designed to\nboost apple consumption. The fees were to pay for\nservices to the payors of the fees. Taxes often are levied\non people or firms that will derive no benefit at all\nfrom them, as in the present case.\n  The practical reason for the difference in treatment\nunder the Tax Injunction Act between fees and taxes is\nthat enjoining the collection of a fee is less likely to\ndisrupt state programs than enjoining a tax. Fees are for\nservices and if the collection of the fees is enjoined, the\nstate can curtail the services. Cf. Ben Oehrleins & Sons &\nDaughter, Inc. v. Hennepin County, 115 F.3d 1372, 1383 (8th\nCir. 1997); San Juan Cellular Telephone Co. v. Public Service\nComm’n, supra, 967 F.2d at 686-87. But if the use of tax\nmoneys to subsidize racetracks is prohibited, the subsidy\n\f22                                               No. 09-3975\n\nprogram will be thwarted—unless the rule is to be that\nan earmarked tax, held to be enjoinable, can be replaced\nby a tax having a broader base and a suit against\nthe replacement in federal court would be blocked by\nthe Tax Injunction Act. This would inject the federal\ncourts deeply into the design of federal-injunction-proof\nstate taxes. It is another reason not to distort language by\ncalling the casino tax a fee.\n   It’s true that the plaintiffs are not seeking to enjoin\nthe casino tax in the narrow sense of “enjoin.” The money\nis being collected from the casinos for intended payment\nto the racetracks; it is being held in escrow pending\nthe outcome of this appeal; it will be paid to them if they\nprevail—but only if they prevail. A constructive trust,\nhowever, is an equitable remedy, just like an injunction.\nBontkowski v. Smith, 305 F.3d 757, 761 (7th Cir. 2002);\nBeatty v. Guggenheim Exploration Co., 122 N.E. 378, 380\n(N.Y. 1919) (Cardozo, J.); 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of\nRemedies § 4.3(2), pp. 589-90 (2d ed. 1993). If allowed in\ncases in which an injunction would be unlawful, a con-\nstructive trust in favor of the taxpayers would defeat the\npurpose of the Tax Injunction Act as effectively as an\ninjunction would. As we explained earlier, a construc-\ntive trust gives the tax money back to the taxpayers; the\nmoney goes in a circle. And so the Second Circuit has\ninvalidated in the name of the Tax Anti-Injunction Act,\n26 U.S.C. § 7421(a)—the counterpart, in federal taxation,\nto the Tax Injunction Act—the imposition of a construc-\ntive trust on moneys that would otherwise have been\nused to satisfy federal tax liabilities. SEC v. Credit Bancorp,\nLtd., 297 F.3d 127, 137-38 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\fNo. 09-3975                                               23\n\n  Other forms of equitable relief have been held to be\nforbidden by the Tax Injunction Act when, even though\nno equitable relief was sought against the state itself, the\nrelief sought would have indirectly but substantially\nimpeded state tax collection. In Sipe v. Amerada Hess\nCorp., 689 F.2d 396, 403-04 (3d Cir. 1982), for example,\nthe plaintiffs sought to enjoin their employers from de-\nducting unemployment taxes from their paychecks. And\nin RTC Commercial Assets Trust 1995-NP3-1 v. Phoenix\nBond & Indemnity Co., supra, 169 F.3d at 454-56, the\nplaintiff sought a declaration that a tax certificate that\nthe private defendant had purchased at a tax sale was\ninvalid. See also Blangeres v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 872\nF.2d 327, 328 (9th Cir. 1989) (per curiam); cf. California\nv. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 407-11 (1982);\nWright v. Pappas, 256 F.3d 635 (7th Cir. 2001).\n   There is one last point to consider. The Tax Injunction\nAct bars federal equitable relief only if the plaintiffs\nhave available to them a state remedy that is “plain,\nspeedy and efficient.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341; see, e.g., Rosewell\nv. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, supra, 450 U.S. at 512-15. There is\nsuch a remedy in this case; the casinos can ask an\nIllinois state court to impose a constructive trust on the\ntax receipts. See Village of Itasca v. Village of Lisle, 817\nN.E.2d 160, 170 (Ill. App. 2004); Selmaville Community\nConsolidated School Dist. No. 10 v. Salem Elementary School\nDist. No. 111, 421 N.E.2d 1087, 1091 (Ill. App. 1981).\nWhether they can seek a refund of the taxes they paid is\nless clear, because it is unclear whether the refund statute\ncited by the parties—the State Officers and Employees\nMoney Disposition Act, 30 ILCS 230/2a, the statutory\n\f24                                              No. 09-3975\n\nbasis for the casinos’ claims in Empress Casino Joliet Corp.\nv. Giannoulias, supra, 896 N.E.2d at 283—authorizes the\nrecovery of tax money that has already been disbursed.\nBut if the unlawfulness can be traced to the racetracks,\nthe casinos can seek damages from them. The Tax In-\njunction Act does not bar federal monetary relief. What\nthe federal courts must not do is freeze the state’s tax\nmoneys by imposition of a constructive trust.\n  The judgment of the district court is affirmed, but the\ntemporary restraining order against releasing money\nfrom the escrow is extended for 30 days from the date of\nthis decision to enable the plaintiffs to ask our Circuit\nJustice to continue the order pending the casinos’ peti-\ntioning the Supreme Court for certiorari.\n                                                  A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n  S YKES, Circuit Judge, with whom B AUER and K ANNE,\nCircuit Judges, join, dissenting. Anyone reading the\nen banc opinion might lose sight of the fact that this is\nnot the kind of lawsuit in which jurisdictional questions\nunder the Tax Injunction Act (“TIA”) typically arise. It’s\nnot a public-law suit against a state or local taxing author-\nity seeking a remedy against the enforcement of a tax\nstatute or otherwise interfering with the collection of\n\fNo. 09-3975                                             25\n\nstate or municipal revenue. It’s a RICO suit between\nprivate parties seeking a private-law remedy.\n  The TIA prohibits district courts from hearing actions\nto “enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or\ncollection of any tax under State law where a plain,\nspeedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts\nof such State.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341. The Act withdraws\nfederal jurisdiction over suits seeking forms of equitable\nrelief—declaratory and injunctive—against state and\nlocal tax assessments. California v. Grace Brethren Church,\n457 U.S. 393, 410-11 (1982). This lawsuit does not seek\nan equitable remedy against the assessment or collection\nof a tax. The plaintiffs have asked for a constructive\ntrust on a private account holding money alleged to be\nthe proceeds of a racketeering conspiracy. If they prevail\nand a constructive trust is imposed, the collection of\nstate revenue will not be imperiled. Not a penny of state\nmoney would be affected. The private-party defendants\nwould be prevented from reaping the benefits of the\nconspiracy, but the TIA does not block federal jurisdic-\ntion over suits to prevent private unjust enrichment.\n  To be sure, this case does involve allegations of public\ncorruption in the promulgation of a state subsidy\nprogram, but that’s not enough to trigger the TIA’s juris-\ndictional bar. The subsidy in question is structured in\nan unusual way, and it came into being under circum-\nstances that led to the indictment, impeachment, and\nremoval of the Illinois governor, and a long-running state-\ncourt constitutional challenge.\n  The plaintiffs, four riverboat casinos in Illinois, claim\nthat two Illinois gaming laws—the 2006 and 2008 Horse\n\f26                                                    No. 09-3975\n\nRacing Acts—were the product of a pay-to-play scheme\nbetween former Governor Rod Blagojevich and John\nJohnston, the owner of two Illinois horse-racing tracks.\nThe Acts imposed an unusual license requirement on\nthe four casinos (and only these four, by virtue of their\nbeing the most profitable in the state). The four casinos\nmust directly subsidize a select group of their competi-\ntors—five Illinois horse-racing tracks, including the\ntwo owned by Johnston—as a condition of their state\ngaming licenses. The Acts compel them to pay a\npercentage of their revenue into a segregated fund for\ndirect pass-through to the racetracks. It’s important to\nnote that the money paid into this fund is not state\ngeneral revenue and is not subject to appropriation;\ninstead, the money is held in trust for the sole benefit of\nthe five racetracks and is disbursed directly to the benefi-\nciary tracks soon after receipt.\n   More specifically, the 2006 Racing Act created, and the\n2008 Racing Act renewed, the Illinois “Horse Racing\nEquity Trust Fund,” a “non-appropriated trust fund\nheld separate and apart from State moneys” for the benefit\nof the horse-racing tracks. 230 ILL. C OMP . S TAT. 5/54.5(a)\n(2006) (repealed 2008) (the 2006 Act); 230 ILL. C OMP.\nS TAT. 5/54.75(a) (2011) (the 2008 Act).1 Under the Acts\nthe four casinos are required “as a condition of licensure”\nto “pay into the Horse Racing Equity Trust Fund . . . an\namount equal to 3% of the adjusted gross receipts\n\n1\n  Except for citations to the 2006 Act, which are hereafter cited\nas § 5/54.5 (2006), all subsequent citations to the Illinois Compiled\nStatutes are to the current edition.\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                27\n\nreceived by the owners [sic] licensee.” Id. § 10/7(a). The\nmoney paid into this fund “shall be distributed within\n10 days” of deposit directly to the beneficiary horse-\nracing racetracks; the racetracks must direct 60% of the\nmoney received to the purse and the remaining 40% to\nimprovements, marketing, and operating expenses. Id.\n§§ 5/54.5(b) (2006), 5/54.75(b). The Horse Racing Fund\nis administered by the state Racing Board in accordance\nwith the terms of the Acts, id. § 5/54.75(a), and the\nmoney in the Fund may not be transferred to the State’s\nGeneral Revenue Fund, 30 ILL. C OMP. S TAT. 105/8h(a).\n  As the panel opinion explained, the casinos paid the\n3% surcharge into a protest fund and waged a vigorous\nconstitutional attack on the Racing Acts in state court. See\nEmpress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Blagojevich, 638 F.3d 519, 524-\n27 (7th Cir. 2011). The state supreme court rejected this\nchallenge, see Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Giannoulias,\n896 N.E.2d 277 (Ill. 2008), and the money in the\nprotest fund was set to pay out to the racetracks. In the\nmeantime, however, Governor Blagojevich was indicted\non federal charges of public corruption, including\nsome relating to the pay-to-play scheme involving\nJohnston and the racetracks. Empress Casino, 638 F.3d at\n525. The Illinois House of Representatives quickly im-\npeached him and the Senate removed him from office.\nThe casinos then brought this federal RICO suit against\nBlagojevich, his campaign committee, Johnston, and the\ntwo racetracks he owns. Id. at 526. Tracing the allega-\ntions in the federal indictment, the casinos claimed that\nBlagojevich “sold” his support for the Racing Acts in\nexchange for campaign cash from Johnston. Id. at 522-23.\n\f28                                             No. 09-3975\n\n  To prevent the five racetracks from being unjustly\nenriched by the proceeds of the alleged racketeering\nconspiracy, the complaint also named as defendants the\nthree racetracks not owned by Johnston. The casinos\nsought a constructive trust on the money all five race-\ntracks received from the Horse Racing Fund. Id. at 526-27.\nThose funds are held in a private account owned by\nthe racetracks, not in the state treasury or in any state-\nowned or -administered account. The money in the\nprotest fund was paid out to the racetracks but is held\nin escrow under the terms of a temporary restraining\norder entered by the district court and kept in place by\norder of this court pending resolution of this appeal. The\nescrow continues to grow as the casinos periodically pay\nthe 3% surcharge, and the money is disbursed to the\nracetracks within ten days of deposit, as required by the\nActs. To be clear, the casinos did not name any state\nagency or governmental official as a defendant in this\naction and do not seek to invalidate the Racing Acts or\nobtain a remedy against the Horse Racing Fund.\n  The en banc opinion obscures these critical facts, which\nare necessary to bring the jurisdictional issue into\nproper focus. For example, my colleagues acknowledge\nthat “the state is not a party to this suit,” Majority\nOp. at 5, but in the very next breath say the casinos are\n“seeking a constructive trust [on] tax revenues,” and\nspeculate that the casinos “would be seeking an injunc-\ntion as well” if the Racing Acts “were not shortly to\nexpire,” id. at 5-6. This gives the impression that the\ncasinos are seeking equitable relief against the Racing Acts\nor a remedy that would operate on tax money owed to or\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              29\n\nheld by the State. They are not. As I have explained, the\ncomplaint does not name any state agency or any\nofficial responsible for enforcing the Racing Acts as a\ndefendant; nor have the casinos asked for injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief against the enforcement of the Acts\nor sought a constructive trust on tax money owed to or\nheld by the State.\n  The en banc opinion also warns that\n    [i]t is not a proper office of the federal courts to\n    “reform” state fiscal policies by providing a federal\n    forum for state taxpayers who object to the form or\n    substance of laws designed to raise revenues for\n    state purposes, whether purposes approved or disap-\n    proved by enlightened social thinkers. The wisdom\n    of a tax on casinos to benefit racetracks is not a\n    proper subject of inquiry by federal judges.\nId. at 9. This passage also suggests that this litigation\ntakes aim at a state tax law. Not so. This case does concern\nthe corrupt origins of the Racing Acts but does not chal-\nlenge their validity or the manner in which they are\nenforced. The district court has been asked to adjudicate\na racketeering claim, not to pass judgment on the fiscal\npolicy of the State of Illinois or the wisdom of compelling\ncasinos to subsidize racetracks. This case will not require\nthe federal judiciary to decide whether the purposes\nbehind the Racing Acts comport with enlightened\nsocial thinking. Justice Holmes will not roll over in his\ngrave; his Lochner dissent remains undisturbed. See id. at\n15 (citing Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 75 (1905)\n(Holmes, J., dissenting)). At the risk of repeating myself,\n\f30                                                 No. 09-3975\n\nno remedy is sought against the State, its tax policies, or\nits revenue-raising apparatus. A constructive trust would\nhave no effect on state revenue but would operate only\non funds received by the racetracks and held by them\nin private escrow in order to prevent their unjust enrich-\nment.\n  My colleagues do not meaningfully address this critical\nfact until the very end of the en banc opinion, see id. at 22-\n23, and their effort to explain it away is ineffective. It is\ntrue that the TIA’s jurisdictional bar is sometimes\napplied “even though no equitable relief was sought\nagainst the state itself,” but only if “the relief sought\nwould . . . indirectly but substantially impede[] state tax\ncollection.” Id. at 23 (citing Grace Brethren Church, 457\nU.S. 393; Wright v. Pappas, 256 F.3d 635 (7th Cir. 2001);\nRTC Commercial Assets Trust 1995-NP3-1 v. Phoenix Bond\n& Indem.

In each\nof the cases cited for this proposition, state or local\ntaxing authorities were parties to the litigation and the\nrelief sought would have impeded their receipt of taxes\nor otherwise depleted the public fisc.2 That is not\n\n2\n   See California v.

A constructive trust on the racetracks’\nprivate escrow would have no effect on state funds and\nwould not interfere with the State’s collection of taxes,\neither directly or indirectly. No state taxing authority is\na party. From all appearances, Illinois is indifferent to\nthis case.\n  What makes this case difficult is that the casino sur-\ncharge is unusual and therefore hard to classify. My\ncolleagues call it a tax. With respect, I disagree. Our\ndisagreement, however, does not arise from different\nviews on the essential principles underlying the TIA. The\ncentral concern of the TIA is to prevent federal-court\ninterference with the assessment and collection of state\n\n2\n   (...continued)\ndiscrimination because it would have impeded the County’s\ncollection of taxes; Cook County treasurer was a party); RTC\nCommercial Assets Trust 1995-NP3-1 v.

See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 105-\n06 (2004); Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, 450 U.S. 503, 527-\n28 (1981); Scott Air Force Base Props. v. Cnty. of St. Clair,\n548 F.3d 516, 520 (7th Cir. 2008); Levy v. Pappas, 510 F.3d\n755, 761-62 (7th Cir. 2007). My colleagues have ex-\nplained the TIA’s important role in preserving the federal-\nstate balance; the perils of federal-court interference\nwith state and local tax administration; and the\npreference for a “crisp” rule for applying the TIA’s juris-\ndictional bar to federal suits seeking equitable remedies\nagainst state and local tax measures. Majority Op. at 3-7.\nOn these points I agree. Under the TIA’s jurisdictional\nrule and the background prudential doctrine of comity,\nsuits for equitable relief against state tax assessment and\ncollection belong in state court. See Levin v. Commerce\nEnergy, Inc., 130 S. Ct. 2323, 2330-33 (2010). To the extent\nwe can discern a clear, simple rule for applying the\nTIA’s jurisdictional bar, we should. Complex and\ndiscretion-expanding multi-factor tests should be\navoided where possible, especially on matters of juris-\ndiction, for all the reasons compellingly explained in the\nen banc opinion.\n  Nothing in the panel opinion undermined these princi-\nples. We held that the TIA does not apply because the\n3% casino surcharge is more like a license fee than a\ntax, and a constructive trust on the money received by\nthe racetracks would not interfere with the assessment\nor collection of any state revenue. In the plain language\nof the TIA, the district court is not being asked to\n“enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or\ncollection of any tax under State law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341. The\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              33\n\nen banc rehearing has not altered the applicable legal\nprinciples, shed new light on the facts, or shaken my\nconfidence in our original conclusion. The TIA does not\napply here.\n  The en banc opinion divides up the universe of govern-\nmental exactions into three categories: fines, fees, and\ntaxes. See Majority Op. at 9-13. The casino surcharge\nis not a fine, so we must decide whether it is more like\na “fee” or a “tax.” “The question whether something\nis a ‘tax’ or not for purposes of the TIA is ultimately\none of federal law, even though we consult state law to\nunderstand exactly what a particular charge is.” RTC\nCommercial, 169 F.3d at 457 (citing Reconstr. Fin. Corp. v.\nBeaver Cnty., Pa., 328 U.S. 204, 207-10 (1946)). “The most\ncommon formula for classifying exactions under the\nTax Injunction Act [is to] ask[] whether the payment is\na tax to raise general revenue or is a fee incident to reg-\nulation.” Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez,\n977 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1992). This “formula” is drawn\nfrom an influential First Circuit opinion by then-\nJudge Breyer distinguishing for TIA purposes between\nrevenue-raising tax measures, which are covered by the\njurisdictional bar, and regulatory fees, which are not. See\nSan Juan Cellular Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Puerto\nRico, 967 F.2d 683 (1st Cir. 1992). Following this lead,\nmost courts look to the structure and purpose of the\ncharge at issue to determine whether it counts as a tax\nfor purposes of the TIA. See Hill v. Kemp, 478 F.3d 1236,\n1244-48 (10th Cir. 2007); Folio v. City of Clarksburg, 134\nF.3d 1211, 1217 (4th Cir. 1998); Hager v. City of W. Peoria,\n84 F.3d 865, 870-71 (7th Cir. 1996); Bidart Bros. v. Calif.\n\f34                                               No. 09-3975\n\nApple Comm’n, 73 F.3d 925, 930-33 (9th Cir. 1996); Trailer\nMarine, 977 F.2d at 5-6; San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 684-86;\nWright v. McClain, 835 F.2d 143, 144-45 (6th Cir. 1987).\n  Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that the\nprimary object of the TIA is to protect the flow of state\nand local revenue from federal-court interference, see\nHibbs, 542 U.S. at 106; Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. at\n410-11, and this also explains why the cases tend to\nfocus on whether the purpose of the challenged govern-\nmental exaction is regulatory or general-revenue-\nraising, see Hill, 478 F.3d at 1244-45 (noting that the\n“primary purpose of the special license plate scheme is\nrevenue rather than regulation and thus it qualifies as a\ntax”); Folio, 134 F.3d at 1217 (distinguishing between\n“broader-based taxes that sustain the essential flow of\nrevenue to state (or local) government and fees that are\nconnected to some regulatory scheme” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); Hager, 84 F.3d at 870-71 (drawing the\nsame distinction between general-revenue-raising and\nregulatory purposes); Bidart Bros., 73 F.3d at 930-33\n(same); Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5-6 (same); San Juan\nCellular, 967 F.2d at 684-86 (same); Schneider Transp., Inc. v.\nCattanach, 657 F.2d 128, 132 (7th Cir. 1981) (same). Finally,\nthe form of relief requested is an important part of\nthe inquiry. “[I]f the relief sought would diminish or\nencumber state tax revenue, then the Act bars federal\njurisdiction over claims seeking such relief.” Scott Air\nForce Base, 548 F.3d at 520 (citing Levy, 510 F.3d at 762);\nsee also Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5-6.\n  For the en banc court, the only payments that count as\n“fees” are those that “compensate for a service that the\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              35\n\nstate provides to the persons or firms on whom or on\nwhich the exaction falls” or those that “compensate the\nstate for costs imposed on it by those persons or firms,\nother than costs of providing a service to them.” Majority\nOp. at 10. This includes “[f]ees for products” (like elec-\ntricity from a public utility) and “bona fide user fees”\n(like toll-road payments). Id. at 13. This definition corre-\nsponds to one that we and other circuits have used\nto identify a “classic” or “paradigmatic” fee, which\ncourts generally agree is not covered by the TIA’s juris-\ndictional bar. See Hill, 478 F.3d at 1245; Hager, 84 F.3d at\n870-71; San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685. But it does\nnot follow (and the cases do not hold) that unless a gov-\nernmental charge is a “fee” under this “classic” or “para-\ndigmatic” definition, then it must be a tax. That’s what\nthe en banc court has concluded. Clear classification\nlines are helpful, for all the reasons my colleagues have\nnoted, but this kind of line-drawing shifts the focus\naway from the core “state-revenue-protective moorings”\nof the TIA. Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 106.\n   Some regulatory assessments do not fit the classic\ndefinition of a fee, but they don’t have the characteristics\nof a tax, either. Government-mandated payments come\nin many types and can be implicated in federal\nlitigation in a variety of ways. The TIA does not block\nfederal jurisdiction over all suits touching on any pay-\nment to state or local government; it withdraws fed-\neral jurisdiction over suits seeking equitable remedies\nagainst the assessment and collection of state and local\ntaxes. This directs our focus to whether the suit challenges\na law that serves a general-revenue-raising function and\n\f36                                                  No. 09-3975\n\nwhether “the relief sought ‘would . . . operate[] to reduce\nthe flow of state tax revenue’ or would tie up ‘rightful\ntax revenue.’ ” Levy, 510 F.3d at 762 (quoting Hibbs, 542\nU.S. at 106, and Rosewell, 450 U.S. at 527-28). The casino\nsurcharge at issue here is specifically structured so that\nit does not raise state tax revenue.\n  As I have explained, the 2006 and 2008 Racing Acts\nimpose the 3% surcharge on the State’s four highest-\nearning casinos—and only these four—as a “condition\nof licensure.” 230 ILL. C OMP . S TAT. 10/7(a). A different\nsection of the Riverboat Gambling Act levies taxes on\nall riverboat casinos, id. § 10/13; the money collected\nunder these provisions is specifically referred to as “tax\nrevenue” subject to appropriation by the Illinois\nGeneral Assembly. This “tax revenue” is earmarked for\nthe support of specific governmental functions (e.g.,\neducation, the criminal justice system) and is distributed\nto the counties in which the casinos are situated, to be\nused for those purposes. Id. § 10/13(b), (c-20), (d).\n  In contrast the 3% surcharge appears in the Riverboat\nGambling Act’s section on “Owners [sic] Licenses” and\nis never referred to as a “tax.”3 Id. § 10/7. The surcharge\n\n3\n   That the Racing Acts do not call the surcharge a “tax” is\nrelevant but not dispositive. As the en banc court rightly notes,\nlegislatures often avoid using the t-word, see Majority Op.\nat 14 (“ ’Taxation’ is unpopular these days, so taxing authorities\navoid the term.”), so the name given to the exaction may not\ndeserve much weight. That the Illinois Supreme Court called\nthe surcharge a “tax” doesn’t advance the discussion either; the\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                    37\n\nis paid into the “Horse Racing Equity Trust Fund,” which\nis established as a “non-appropriated trust fund held\nseparate and apart from State moneys” for the sole\nbenefit of the racetracks. Id. §§ 5/54.5(a) (2006), 5/54.75(a).\nThe money is disbursed very quickly and directly to\nthe beneficiary racetracks. Id. §§ 5/54.5(b) (2006), 5/54.75(b).\nThe State holds the money in trust for the racetracks;\nit may not be transferred to the State’s general revenue\nfund or otherwise commingled with public funds and\nmay not be allocated to any state agency or program or\nused to pay any state cost or expense. 30 ILL. C OMP. S TAT.\n105/8h(a). Illinois itself assumes no obligation to the\nracetracks; the statutory scheme does not establish an\nentitlement program or obligate the State to pay a\nsubsidy to the racetracks. Instead, the State acts as a\ntrustee for the mandated transfer payments from the\ncasinos to the racetracks.\n\n3\n   (...continued)\nstate supreme court also repeatedly referred to it as a “sur-\ncharge” and a “fee.” See, e.g., Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v.\nGiannoulias, 896 N.E.2d 277, 283-84, 285, 289-91 (2008). The state\nconstitution’s uniformity clause applies to taxes and fees, I LL .\nC ONST . art. IX, § 2, and the state supreme court used the terms\n“tax,” “fee,” and “surcharge” interchangeably throughout its\nopinion in Giannoulias. The Illinois General Assembly has\nplenary authority to enact the Racing Acts, but whether it\ninvoked its police power or its tax power in adopting the\nActs has some bearing on how the surcharge should be classi-\nfied. The General Assembly structured the surcharge as a\n“condition of licensure,” amending the provision of the\nRiverboat Gambling Act that pertains to gaming licenses—\nregulatory requirements that are tied to the State’s police\npower. See 230 I LL . C OMP . S TAT . 10/2(b).\n\f38                                              No. 09-3975\n\n  In short, the 3% casino surcharge is an off-budget\nregulatory device for relieving the competitive pressures\nexerted by riverboat gambling on the horse-racing tracks.\nI agree with my colleagues that the surcharge is not a\n“classic” regulatory fee; it does not compensate the\nState for services it provides to the casinos or otherwise\ndefray the costs of the State’s gaming regulatory appara-\ntus. But that doesn’t mean it’s a tax. The surcharge does\nnot raise revenue for the State or for any state program; its\npurpose is regulatory. To the extent the surcharge can be\ncategorized at all, it might appropriately be called a\n“compensation charge,” which is how we characterized it\nin Kathrein v. City of Evanston, 636 F.3d 906, 911 (7th Cir.\n2011), a decision issued shortly after the release of the\npanel opinion in this case and now criticized by the en\nbanc court. See Majority Op. at 13-14. Kathrein surveyed\nthe TIA caselaw and identified several types of payments\nto state and local governments that although not\nprototypical “fees,” are not properly classified as “taxes”\nfor purposes of the TIA. 636 F.3d at 911-12. One of the\n“non-tax” payments identified in Kathrein was a “compen-\nsation charge”—a charge “imposed upon those who cause\na negative externality, and its proceeds are used to com-\npensate those affected by the externality.” Id. at 911.\n  Kathrein cited the First Circuit’s decision in Trailer\nMarine as an example of this kind of charge—not a classic\n“fee” but not a “tax,” either. Id. Trailer Marine involved\na dormant Commerce Clause challenge to a special regis-\ntration fee imposed on “transitory” trailers entering\nPuerto Rican ports before permitting the trailers to be\nhitched to tractors for delivery of the transported goods\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              39\n\nwithin Puerto Rico. The fee was paid into a dedicated\nfund that provided no-fault compensation to persons\ninjured in motor-vehicle accidents. The court began its\nanalysis by noting that San Juan Cellular’s regulatory\nfee/revenue-raising tax distinction “does not provide\nmuch help in this case.” Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5.\nThis was because the purpose of the payment “is neither\nto raise general revenue for Puerto Rico nor to regulate\nconduct in the usual sense of that term,” but instead was\nincidental to a “social welfare program and tort reform\nlaw.” Id. Noting that “the legislature does not call the\nmeasure a tax and the money is collected largely as dedi-\ncated transfer payments for the beneficiaries” of the\naccident-compensation fund, the court held that the\nregistration fee “should not be treated as a tax for\npurposes of the . . . Tax Injunction Act[].” Id. at 5-6. Al-\nthough it was a “close issue,” the court said it was “at\nleast confident that allowing an injunction suit to be\nmaintained poses no threat to the central stream of tax\nrevenue relied on by Puerto Rico.” Id. at 6.\n  The same is true here—even more so, in fact. Allowing\nthis RICO suit to proceed will not pose any threat to tax\nrevenue relied on by Illinois. The State’s coffers will not\nbe depleted if the casinos prevail. Contrary to my col-\nleagues’ suggestion, the casino surcharge is not\nanalogous to a “sin tax” or other forms of taxation paid\ninto special-purpose funds, whether of the “lock box”\nvariety or not. See Majority Op. at 8, 12-15. The compari-\nson to Social Security taxes and taxes levied to sup-\nport agricultural subsidies is inapt. See id. at 13-14.\nThe Racing Acts do not create an entitlement program\n\f40                                                 No. 09-3975\n\nor even a traditional state subsidy. As I have noted,\nIllinois has not obligated itself to pay benefits to the\nracetracks and then enacted a tax as a source of revenue\nfor its racetrack-support program. Nor are the pay-\nments made to the racetracks properly characterized as\n“earmarks,” as my colleagues imply, id. at 12-15; the\nHorse Racing Fund is specifically designated as a “non-\nappropriated trust fund.” The 3% surcharge is not a tax\nlevied to fund a state spending program established for\nthe benefit of the racetracks. To the contrary, as this\nsubsidy program is structured, the casinos must share\na portion of their wealth with the racetracks quite\ndirectly, with the State simply serving as an agent for\nreceipt and disbursement of “dedicated transfer pay-\nments for the beneficiaries.” Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5.\n   For these reasons, I cannot join the en banc opinion.\nNeedless to say, I take no position on the merits of the\ncasinos’ case—or for that matter, on my colleagues’\nextended discussion of the policy justifications for re-\nquiring rich casinos to share their profits with strug-\ngling horse-racing tracks. See Majority Op. at 16-19.\nThese matters are not before the court. We have only a\njurisdictional question, and on that question I remain\nwhere I was when this case was decided by the panel:\nThe TIA’s jurisdictional bar does not apply. A construc-\ntive trust on the racetracks’ private escrow will not\n“freeze the state’s tax moneys,” as my colleagues have\nconcluded.4 See id. at 24. The casino surcharge is not\n\n4\n  My colleagues have suggested that our decision in Schneider\nTransport is “indistinguishable from the present case,” Majority\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                       41\n\nstructured as a tax, and a constructive trust on the race-\ntracks’ private escrow as a remedy for the alleged\nRICO violations will not interfere with the assessment\nor collection of any state revenue. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   (...continued)\nOp. at 12 (citing Schneider Transp., Inc. v. Cattanach, 657 F.2d\n128, 132 (7th Cir. 1981)), but I disagree. Schneider Transport was\na suit by a trucking company against the Wisconsin Secretary\nof Transportation seeking an injunction against the imposition\nof vehicle-registration fees on its fleet of trucks. 657 F.2d at 130-\n32. Truck-registration fees were deposited into the state’s\ntransportation fund and used for general transportation pur-\nposes, “including highway construction.” Id. at 132. We con-\ncluded that the fee was a tax for purposes of the TIA because\nit was “imposed for revenue-raising purposes, a characteristic\nof any tax.” Id. An injunction against the collection of the\nregistration fee would have depleted the state transportation\nfund, which paid for highway construction and other state\ntransportation needs. Here, in contrast, an injunction against\nthe racetracks’ private escrow would have no effect on the\npublic fisc.\n\n\n\n                               7-8-11\n\f",

Enacted in 2006 and\n2008 by large margins, these statutes, which are to\nremain in effect until the end of this year, require the\ncasinos to deposit 3 percent of their revenues in a segre-\ngated state fund—the “Horse Racing Equity Trust\nFund”—for disbursement to the racetracks within 10\ndays of receipt; the racetracks are directed to use the\nmoney to increase winners’ and runner-ups’ purses\nand improve the tracks. Ill. Pub. Act 94-804, effective\nMay 26, 2006; Ill. Pub. Act 95-1008, effective Dec. 15, 2008.\n   The plaintiffs asked the district court to impose, as\na remedy for the alleged violation of RICO, a construc-\ntive trust in their favor on the money received by the\nracetracks under these laws. The district judge issued\na temporary restraining order that required that any\nmoney paid by the state fund be placed in an escrow\naccount that the racetracks could not reach while the\nlitigation was pending. Later the judge ruled that the\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, barred equitable\nrelief, of which the imposition of a constructive trust is\na form. So he dissolved the temporary restraining order.\n  The casinos appealed. A panel of this court reinstated\nthe temporary restraining order pending appeal (so\nthe escrow remains in force and no money is being dis-\nbursed to the racetracks), and then reversed the district\ncourt (with one judge dissenting), holding that the Tax\nInjunction Act did not bar the casinos’ quest for equitable\n\fNo. 09-3975                                               3\n\nrelief in federal court. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2011). We\ngranted rehearing en banc to reexamine that holding.\nThe merits of the suit were not before the panel and are\nnot before us. Moreover, upon the grant of rehearing\nen banc, the panel opinion was vacated only with regard\nto appeal No. 09-3975; the part of the panel’s opinion\nand order that relates to appeal No. 10-1019, which\nhad been consolidated with No. 09-3975, was unaffected\nby the grant of rehearing en banc and is unaffected by\nthe present opinion. And the temporary restraining\norder pending appeal remains in force.\n  The Tax Injunction Act forbids federal district courts\nto “enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or\ncollection of any tax under State law,” provided that\nan adequate remedy is available in the state courts,\n28 U.S.C. § 1341, and it is in this case. The Act thus does\nnot limit any substantive rights to enjoin a state tax\nbut requires only that they be enforced in a state court\nrather than a federal court. The requirement serves to\nminimize the frictions inherent in a federal system of\ngovernment, and is considered so important that the\nduty of federal courts to cede litigation seeking to\nenjoin state tax statutes to the state courts (a duty of\n“comity”—that is, of respect for another sovereign)\nextends beyond the limits of the Tax Injunction Act.

The Act is “first and foremost a vehicle to limit\ndrastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere\nwith so important a local concern as the collection of\ntaxes.” Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, supra, 450 U.S. at 522.\nThe reason for this drastic limitation is that “it is upon\ntaxation that the several States chiefly rely to obtain the\nmeans to carry on their respective governments, and it is\nof the utmost importance to all of them that the\nmodes adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be\ninterfered with as little as possible. Any delay in the\nproceedings of the officers, upon whom the duty is de-\nvolved of collecting the taxes, may derange the opera-\ntions of government, and thereby cause serious detriment\nto the public.” Dows v.

(When the suit is not by tax-\npayers, but by persons objecting just to how the money\nis being spent, as in Hibbs v. Winn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136987\"><a href=\"/opinion/136987/hibbs-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), the\ndanger of interference with state tax administration is\ndiminished; Hibbs holds that such suits are outside\nthe Act’s scope.) The application of the Act should not\nturn on judges’ guesses about the importance of a par-\nticular tax to the legitimate operations of state govern-\nment. Even the plaintiffs acknowledge that the allegedly\ncorrupt origin of the statutes they attack does not bear\non whether the exactions that those statutes impose\nare taxes within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act.\nThe Act would be thwarted if a taxpayer could get a\nfederal court to enjoin the collection of a state tax just\nby presenting evidence of corruption in the process\nby which the taxing statute had been enacted.

The tax\nwould be nullified. (If the tax statutes were not shortly\nto expire, the casinos would be seeking an injunction\nas well.)\n  The Act’s forum-selecting character argues com-\npellingly for a crisp rule distinguishing taxes from other\nexactions by states, such as fees charged for services\nprovided (or prices charged for the sale or lease of state\nproperty), transfers of damages awarded to a state to\nthe persons on whose behalf the state had sued (cf.\nTrailer Marine Transport Corp. v.

A crisp\nrule determining which court system has jurisdiction\nto decide a particular type of case is needful because\nuntil the proper forum for a lawsuit is determined, the\ncase cannot proceed; and if at any time until the decision\nresolving the litigation becomes final by exhaustion\nof appellate remedies it is discovered that the court\nrendering the decision lacked jurisdiction, the suit must\nstart over from scratch in the forum that has jurisdiction.\nA challenge to the constitutionality of the casino-tax\nstatutes brought by the casinos in the Illinois state\ncourt system against public officials rather than the\nracetracks has already been decided (adversely to the\ncasinos) by the Supreme Court of Illinois.

Among the factors either urged by\n\f8                                              No. 09-3975\n\nthe casino plaintiffs or mentioned in the cases are\nwhether the legislature called the exaction a “tax” or\nsomething else (the Supreme Court of Illinois calls the\ncasino exaction a “tax,” but the plaintiffs insist that this\nis irrelevant—the legislature must use the word; it has\nnot done so, instead calling the casino exaction a “condi-\ntion of licensure”); whether the money generated by\nthe exaction is deposited in a “lock box” type of trust\nfund (the only real kind, according to the plaintiffs, who\ncall the Social Security Trust Funds a fraud); how\nquickly the money passes through the trust fund to the\nultimate beneficiaries; the price elasticity of the taxed\nbehavior; the amount of revenue collected by the\nexaction; whether that revenue is to be used for a tradi-\ntional public purpose; whether the benefit that the\nfiscal program confers on the people of the state is direct\nor indirect; whether the exaction is designed to benefit\none firm or a narrow group of firms (for example, race-\ntracks) by oppressing a competitor or competitors (for\nexample, casinos); whether enjoining its collection\nwould prevent the state from paying its bills or even\nthreaten it with insolvency; whether the persons or\nfirms subjected to the exaction are numerous or few,\nwhether the beneficiaries of the exaction are numerous\nor few, and what the relative size of the two groups\nis; whether the amount of revenue from the exaction\nthat is transferred to the intended beneficiaries is deter-\nmined by the legislature or is allowed to rise and fall with\nthe fluctuations in that revenue; whether the plaintiff\navoids naming state officials as defendants; whether\nthe exaction was based on the state’s taxing power or\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                 9\n\non some other power, such as the police power (even\nthough these are distinctions primarily relevant to the\nfederal Constitution, which unlike state constitutions\nwas designed, in order to protect state prerogatives, to\nbe a constitution of limited, specified powers); and, as\na kind of catchall, how much the exaction resembles\nwhat everyone would agree was a “tax,” or as Wittgenstein\nmight have wanted us to ask, how close a “family resem-\nblance” the exaction bears to an exaction acknowledged\nby all to be a “tax.” Is it a brother, or a third cousin?\n  The Supreme Court has not endorsed any multifactor\ntest for applying the Tax Injunction Act, and such a test\nwould be inappropriate quite apart from the need for\nclarity and simplicity in interpreting a forum-selection\nlaw. It is not a proper office of the federal courts to\n“reform” state fiscal policies by providing a federal\nforum for state taxpayers who object to the form or sub-\nstance of laws designed to raise revenues for state pur-\nposes, whether purposes approved or disapproved by\nenlightened social thinkers. The wisdom of a tax on\ncasinos to benefit racetracks is not a proper subject of\ninquiry by federal judges. “The federal balance is well\nserved when the several States define and elaborate\ntheir own laws through their own courts and admin-\nistrative processes and without undue interference\nfrom the Federal Judiciary.

For example, a tax might be so totally\npunitive in purpose and effect that, since nomenclature\nis unimportant, it should be classified as a fine rather\nthan a tax. “The mere use of the word ‘tax’ in an act\nprimarily designed to define and suppress crime is not\nenough to show that within the true intendment of the\nterm a tax was laid.

Similarly, bona fide user fees for wharfs and tug-\nboats aren’t taxes for the purpose of the Constitution’s\nimport-export duties clause, or the rule against discrim-\ninatory taxes on interstate commerce. But “sin taxes” are\nreal taxes and so are taxes that go into limited-purpose\nfunds, such as the FICA tax and the gasoline tax. We\nmustn’t write transfer payments and behavior-shaping\ntaxes out of the Tax Injunction Act just because it is\neasier with such taxes to identify winners and losers.\nThe Act would have a very limited reach if we did that.\n  The recent decision in Kathrein v. City of Evanston,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"206587\"><a href=\"/opinion/206587/kathrein-v-city-of-evanston/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 912-13 (7th Cir. 2011), classified a city\n“demolition tax” as not being a tax for purposes of the\nTax Injunction Act, but instead as being a regulatory\ndevice (like the Prohibition-era tax on alcohol that we\nmentioned) because its sole purpose, the panel con-\ncluded, was to keep poor people in their homes. The tax\nwould deter demolitions and the modest fund generated\n\f14                                             No. 09-3975\n\nby it (a trivial $90,000 each year) would be used to subsi-\ndize those poor people and thus amplify the effect of\nthe tax in enabling them to keep their homes out of\nreach of the wrecker’s ball. We do not agree with that\ndecision. Taxes that seek both to deter and to collect\nrevenue when deterrence fails (liquor taxes are an ex-\nample) are commonplace, and these sin taxes often are\nan important component of state fiscal policy because\nthere are so many unrepentant sinners.\n  The exaction imposed on the casinos is not a fine or a\nfee, and is therefore (if there is to be a simple and clear\njurisdictional rule) a tax; the panel majority was\nexplicit that it was not a fee and no one suggests that it’s\na fine. It is instead an example of a state’s taking money\nfrom one group of firms and giving it to another group,\nin much the same way that federal income tax takes\nmoney from persons and firms mostly in the nonagricul-\ntural sector of the economy and Congress gives some of\nthe tax revenues to the tiny but influential agricultural\nsector in the form of farm subsidies: in other words, tax\nand spend, and the taxpayers and the recipients of the\ntax revenues needn’t be the same.\n  The fact that the casino exaction isn’t called a tax, is\nplaced in a trust fund, passes speedily from taxpayer to\nrecipient, is justified by reference to the police power of\nthe state rather than the state’s taxing power, etc., has\nnothing to do with any concern behind the Tax Injunc-\ntion Act. “Taxation” is unpopular these days, so taxing\nauthorities avoid the term. Legislatures are unpredictable,\nso trust funds are created to hold revenues generated by\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                 15\n\nspecific taxes, in order to avoid annual appropriations\nbattles. The politics of state taxation have naught to do\nwith the policy of the Tax Injunction Act. If in the guise\nof “interpreting” the Act the courts insist on greater\ncandor or directness in state taxing legislation as the\nprice for avoiding federal-court suits to enjoin state tax\ncollections, we shall make it difficult, given the politics\nof tax-and-spending legislation, for states to raise\nrevenues—we shall be doing just what the Supreme Court\nin Rosewell said it was the object of the Act to prevent\ndoing: throwing state tax administration into disarray.\n  Gambling taxes, including casino taxes, are not unique\nto Illinois. See Ind. Code §§ 4-33-12-1, -6(b)(6); N.J.\nStat. §§ 5:12-203(a), -205; cf. Md. Code, State Gov’t, §§ 9-1A-\n27(a)(5), -29. They are real taxes, not fees. Their aim is to\nraise revenue, not to cover costs. That the revenue is\nearmarked for a particular purpose is hardly unusual;\nthink of the social security tax. Congress does, it is true,\ndefine the exact benefits to which each social security\nrecipient is entitled. But the aggregate benefits vary with\nthe number of recipients, rather than being specified. The\nbenefits conferred by another earmarked federal tax, the\nfederal tax on gasoline, likewise fluctuate; the amount of\nrevenue generated by the tax varies from year to year\nbecause it’s a tax on gallonage and so depends on the\namount of driving and on the gas consumption of the\nvehicles driven. See, e.g., U.S. Energy Information Admin-\nistration, “Annual Energy Outlook 2011,” p. 10 (2011),\nwww.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/0383(2011).pdf\n(visited July 1, 2011).\n\f16                                             No. 09-3975\n\n   A tax, possibly of corrupt origin, levied on one set of\ngambling enterprises to subsidize another may seem a\nfiscal travesty. But what has that to do with the Tax\nInjunction Act? And, though we don’t think this\nmatters, we note that horse racing is a major activity in\nIllinois and one with economic significance for the state.\nIt employs more than 30,000 people and generates\nmore than $700 million in annual betting and some $15\nmillion in state and local government revenues. Ill. Pub.\nAct 94-804, § 1(3)-(4); Illinois Racing Board, “2010\nAnnual Report” 2, 6 (Mar. 2011), www2.illinois.gov/irb/\nDocuments/AnnualReports/2010_Annual_Report.pdf\n(visited July 1, 2011); Commission on Government Fore-\ncasting and Accountability, “Wagering in Illinois—2010\nUpdate” 53-60 (2011), www.ilga.gov/commission/\ncgfa2006/Upload 2010wagering_in_il.pdf (visited July 1,\n2011).

Are animals not\nappropriate objects of state subsidy? Cannot Citation,\nMan ‘o War, Seabiscuit, and Secretariat be distinguished,\nas objects of public solicitude, from roulette wheels and\none-armed bandits?\n   Casinos are recent additions to the legal gambling\nscene in Illinois; the first casino in the state opened in\n1991.

Walker and John D. Jackson, in their\narticle “Do U.S. Gambling Industries Cannibalize Each\nOther?,” 36 Public Finance Rev. 308, 322-24 (2008), present\ncontrary evidence—evidence that casino and other non-\nracetrack gambling increases the demand for racetrack\ngambling by increasing the demand for gambling in\ngeneral. What is not debatable is that, whether because\nof the advent of casinos or because of other factors, race-\ntrack attendance and revenues in Illinois have plum-\nmeted in recent years, along with the state’s horse popula-\ntion and commercial activities that are correlated with\nthe number of horses. Illinois Racing Board, supra, at 9;\nCommission on Government Forecasting and Account-\nability, supra, at 59-60; Will Buss, “Hoffman: Bill Will\n\f18                                            No. 09-3975\n\nHelp Fairmount,” Belleville News-Democrat, Mar. 27, 2008,\np. A1. The first of these sources shows horse-racing bets\nfalling from $1.2 billion in 1996 to $.7 billion in 2010,\nthough some of the drop is doubtless due to the economic\ncrisis that began in 2008; the 2007 total was $900 million.\n  Sixty percent of the subsidy created by revenues from\nthe casino tax is earmarked for the purses for winners\nand runners-up in the horse races, on the theory that\nbigger purses attract the owners of the better horses\nand the better the horses in a race the larger the at-\ntendance and therefore the more money is bet and so\nthe greater the track’s revenues are because they’re a\npercentage of the amount of money that is bet. The other\n40 percent is earmarked for physical improvements of\nthe racetracks. The subsidy is rationally designed to\npromote the horse racing industry in Illinois, which\nseems no less proper an objective than promoting a\nstate’s film industry by offering tax credits or other fin-\nancial incentives to filmmakers, a common form of\nstate subsidy. Horse racing and movies are two forms\nof entertainment. Are the taxes that provide the revenue\nto subsidize such activities not taxes at all, but in-\nstead—what?\n  In a laissez-faire or Social Darwinist society, as\ndreamed by Herbert Spencer (the target of Holmes’s\ncrack that “the 14th Amendment does not enact Mr.\nHerbert Spencer’s Social Statics,” Lochner v. New York,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96276\"><a href=\"/opinion/96276/lochner-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1905)), the government would keep its\nhands off the competition between the casinos and the\nracetracks. The disappearance of racetracks, jockeys,\n\fNo. 09-3975                                             19\n\nhorses, bridles, blacksmiths, racetrack touts, and DVDs\nof National Velvet—replaced by croupiers, glassy-\neyed retirees at one-armed bandits, roulette wheels, and\nblackjack tables, all on riverboat casinos—would be\ncommended as progress. But American government is\nnot committed to the laissez-faire vision of society.\nWe find no hints of Social Darwinism in the Tax Injunc-\ntion Act. Congress and state legislatures frequently\nuse their taxing, spending, and regulatory powers to\nredistribute wealth from one group in society to another.\nThis is a familiar exercise of taxing power and whether\nunconstitutional in particular instances (in the Illinois\ncourts the casinos unsuccessfully attacked the casino tax\nas an uncompensated taking), it is still taxation, which\nis our only concern in this appeal. Federal payroll\ntaxes are earmarked for such expenditure programs as\nMedicare, social security, and unemployment benefits;\nthe federal gasoline tax is used to subsidize highway\nconstruction; other earmarked taxes are common. See\nSusannah Camic, “Earmarking: The Potential Benefits,” 4\nPitt. Tax Rev. 55, 60-61 (2006). Rarely are taxpayers\nclosely matched with the recipients of the spending that\nthe taxes support. If you die before reaching the age of\n62, you get no social security benefits even if you’ve\nbeen paying social security tax for 40 years.\n  Illinois’ casino tax is not an isolated example of taxing\none industry for the benefit of another. The federal\nAudio Home Recording Act of 1992 taxes digital media\nto subsidize prerecorded media, 17 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.\n(though the tax has, as many taxes do, a punitive purpose\nas well—to discourage illegal copying of recordings). The\n\f20                                                No. 09-3975\n\nIllinois Coal Technology Development Assistance Fund\ntaxes gas and electrical utilities to pay for the develop-\nment of coal technologies, 30 ILCS 730/3. And Ohio\ntaxes wine from all over the world to pay for research\non grapes in Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§ 924.51 et seq.,\n4301.43(B).\n   When the plaintiffs call the casino tax a “fee,” they do so\nbecause they want a word to describe what the casino\nexaction is: if it is not a tax or a fee (or a fine), what is\nit? The panel majority, emphasizing the adverse effect\nof the tax on the casinos, called it “a regulatory penalty\nor fee.” Fees for services are not taxes, but no services\nare rendered to the casinos in exchange for their having\nto give up 3 percent of their revenues. All the money\ngoes to the racetracks. The plaintiffs try to blur the dis-\ntinction by quoting from a previous opinion of this\ncourt that “courts faced with distinguishing a ‘tax’ from\na ‘fee’ ‘have tended . . . to emphasize the revenue’s ulti-\nmate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to\nthe public, of a sort often financed by a general tax,\nor whether it provides more narrow benefits to\nregulated companies or defrays the agency’s cost of reg-\nulation.’ ” Hager v. City of West Peoria, supra, 84 F.3d at 870,\nquoting San Juan Cellular Telephone Co. v. Public Service\nComm’n, supra, 967 F.2d at 685. The reference to “narrow\nbenefits” may seem to describe this case, since only\nracetracks received the proceeds of the casino tax. But\nthis is to ignore the words in the Hager opinion that\nfollow “provides more narrow benefits”: “to regulated\ncompanies or defrays the agency’s cost of regulation.” The\nrevenues from the tax on the casinos does not go to pay\n\fNo. 09-3975                                               21\n\nfor some service that the State of Illinois renders to\ncasinos, or, what amounts to the same thing, to some\nservice that is required by the existence of casinos, in the\nsame way that expenses incurred to regulate telephone\ncompanies were necessitated by those companies and\nhence were part of the regulatory costs (San Juan Cellular).\nThe casino tax goes to subsidize racetracks, and so it\nfalls within the rule that exactions of money earmarked\nfor designated purposes rather than collected just to\nswell the state’s coffers are taxes within the meaning of\nthe Tax Injunction Act even if imposed for a reason\nof which judges disapprove.\n  The plaintiffs point us to Bidart Brothers v. California\nApple Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710937\"><a href=\"/opinion/710937/bidart-brothers-a-california-corporation-v-the-california-apple/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1996), but that case\ninvolved an assessment of fees on apple producers to\nsupport advertising and other activities designed to\nboost apple consumption. The fees were to pay for\nservices to the payors of the fees. Taxes often are levied\non people or firms that will derive no benefit at all\nfrom them, as in the present case.\n  The practical reason for the difference in treatment\nunder the Tax Injunction Act between fees and taxes is\nthat enjoining the collection of a fee is less likely to\ndisrupt state programs than enjoining a tax. Fees are for\nservices and if the collection of the fees is enjoined, the\nstate can curtail the services. Cf. Ben Oehrleins & Sons &\nDaughter, Inc. v.

This would inject the federal\ncourts deeply into the design of federal-injunction-proof\nstate taxes. It is another reason not to distort language by\ncalling the casino tax a fee.\n   It’s true that the plaintiffs are not seeking to enjoin\nthe casino tax in the narrow sense of “enjoin.” The money\nis being collected from the casinos for intended payment\nto the racetracks; it is being held in escrow pending\nthe outcome of this appeal; it will be paid to them if they\nprevail—but only if they prevail.

This lawsuit does not seek\nan equitable remedy against the assessment or collection\nof a tax. The plaintiffs have asked for a constructive\ntrust on a private account holding money alleged to be\nthe proceeds of a racketeering conspiracy. If they prevail\nand a constructive trust is imposed, the collection of\nstate revenue will not be imperiled. Not a penny of state\nmoney would be affected. The private-party defendants\nwould be prevented from reaping the benefits of the\nconspiracy, but the TIA does not block federal jurisdic-\ntion over suits to prevent private unjust enrichment.\n  To be sure, this case does involve allegations of public\ncorruption in the promulgation of a state subsidy\nprogram, but that’s not enough to trigger the TIA’s juris-\ndictional bar. The subsidy in question is structured in\nan unusual way, and it came into being under circum-\nstances that led to the indictment, impeachment, and\nremoval of the Illinois governor, and a long-running state-\ncourt constitutional challenge.\n  The plaintiffs, four riverboat casinos in Illinois, claim\nthat two Illinois gaming laws—the 2006 and 2008 Horse\n\f26                                                    No. 09-3975\n\nRacing Acts—were the product of a pay-to-play scheme\nbetween former Governor Rod Blagojevich and John\nJohnston, the owner of two Illinois horse-racing tracks.\nThe Acts imposed an unusual license requirement on\nthe four casinos (and only these four, by virtue of their\nbeing the most profitable in the state). The four casinos\nmust directly subsidize a select group of their competi-\ntors—five Illinois horse-racing tracks, including the\ntwo owned by Johnston—as a condition of their state\ngaming licenses. The Acts compel them to pay a\npercentage of their revenue into a segregated fund for\ndirect pass-through to the racetracks. It’s important to\nnote that the money paid into this fund is not state\ngeneral revenue and is not subject to appropriation;\ninstead, the money is held in trust for the sole benefit of\nthe five racetracks and is disbursed directly to the benefi-\nciary tracks soon after receipt.\n   More specifically, the 2006 Racing Act created, and the\n2008 Racing Act renewed, the Illinois “Horse Racing\nEquity Trust Fund,” a “non-appropriated trust fund\nheld separate and apart from State moneys” for the benefit\nof the horse-racing tracks. 230 ILL.

The\nmoney paid into this fund “shall be distributed within\n10 days” of deposit directly to the beneficiary horse-\nracing racetracks; the racetracks must direct 60% of the\nmoney received to the purse and the remaining 40% to\nimprovements, marketing, and operating expenses. Id.\n§§ 5/54.5(b) (2006), 5/54.75(b). The Horse Racing Fund\nis administered by the state Racing Board in accordance\nwith the terms of the Acts, id. § 5/54.75(a), and the\nmoney in the Fund may not be transferred to the State’s\nGeneral Revenue Fund, 30 ILL. C OMP. S TAT. 105/8h(a).\n  As the panel opinion explained, the casinos paid the\n3% surcharge into a protest fund and waged a vigorous\nconstitutional attack on the Racing Acts in state court.

In the\nmeantime, however, Governor Blagojevich was indicted\non federal charges of public corruption, including\nsome relating to the pay-to-play scheme involving\nJohnston and the racetracks. Empress Casino, 638 F.3d at\n525. The Illinois House of Representatives quickly im-\npeached him and the Senate removed him from office.\nThe casinos then brought this federal RICO suit against\nBlagojevich, his campaign committee, Johnston, and the\ntwo racetracks he owns. Id. at 526. Tracing the allega-\ntions in the federal indictment, the casinos claimed that\nBlagojevich “sold” his support for the Racing Acts in\nexchange for campaign cash from Johnston. Id. at 522-23.\n\f28                                             No. 09-3975\n\n  To prevent the five racetracks from being unjustly\nenriched by the proceeds of the alleged racketeering\nconspiracy, the complaint also named as defendants the\nthree racetracks not owned by Johnston. The casinos\nsought a constructive trust on the money all five race-\ntracks received from the Horse Racing Fund. Id. at 526-27.\nThose funds are held in a private account owned by\nthe racetracks, not in the state treasury or in any state-\nowned or -administered account. The money in the\nprotest fund was paid out to the racetracks but is held\nin escrow under the terms of a temporary restraining\norder entered by the district court and kept in place by\norder of this court pending resolution of this appeal. The\nescrow continues to grow as the casinos periodically pay\nthe 3% surcharge, and the money is disbursed to the\nracetracks within ten days of deposit, as required by the\nActs. To be clear, the casinos did not name any state\nagency or governmental official as a defendant in this\naction and do not seek to invalidate the Racing Acts or\nobtain a remedy against the Horse Racing Fund.\n  The en banc opinion obscures these critical facts, which\nare necessary to bring the jurisdictional issue into\nproper focus. For example, my colleagues acknowledge\nthat “the state is not a party to this suit,” Majority\nOp. at 5, but in the very next breath say the casinos are\n“seeking a constructive trust [on] tax revenues,” and\nspeculate that the casinos “would be seeking an injunc-\ntion as well” if the Racing Acts “were not shortly to\nexpire,” id. at 5-6. This gives the impression that the\ncasinos are seeking equitable relief against the Racing Acts\nor a remedy that would operate on tax money owed to or\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              29\n\nheld by the State. They are not. As I have explained, the\ncomplaint does not name any state agency or any\nofficial responsible for enforcing the Racing Acts as a\ndefendant; nor have the casinos asked for injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief against the enforcement of the Acts\nor sought a constructive trust on tax money owed to or\nheld by the State.\n  The en banc opinion also warns that\n    [i]t is not a proper office of the federal courts to\n    “reform” state fiscal policies by providing a federal\n    forum for state taxpayers who object to the form or\n    substance of laws designed to raise revenues for\n    state purposes, whether purposes approved or disap-\n    proved by enlightened social thinkers. The wisdom\n    of a tax on casinos to benefit racetracks is not a\n    proper subject of inquiry by federal judges.\nId. at 9. This passage also suggests that this litigation\ntakes aim at a state tax law. Not so. This case does concern\nthe corrupt origins of the Racing Acts but does not chal-\nlenge their validity or the manner in which they are\nenforced. The district court has been asked to adjudicate\na racketeering claim, not to pass judgment on the fiscal\npolicy of the State of Illinois or the wisdom of compelling\ncasinos to subsidize racetracks. This case will not require\nthe federal judiciary to decide whether the purposes\nbehind the Racing Acts comport with enlightened\nsocial thinking. Justice Holmes will not roll over in his\ngrave; his Lochner dissent remains undisturbed. See id. at\n15 (citing Lochner v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96276\"><a href=\"/opinion/96276/lochner-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1905)\n(Holmes, J., dissenting)).

Complex and\ndiscretion-expanding multi-factor tests should be\navoided where possible, especially on matters of juris-\ndiction, for all the reasons compellingly explained in the\nen banc opinion.\n  Nothing in the panel opinion undermined these princi-\nples. We held that the TIA does not apply because the\n3% casino surcharge is more like a license fee than a\ntax, and a constructive trust on the money received by\nthe racetracks would not interfere with the assessment\nor collection of any state revenue. In the plain language\nof the TIA, the district court is not being asked to\n“enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or\ncollection of any tax under State law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341. The\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              33\n\nen banc rehearing has not altered the applicable legal\nprinciples, shed new light on the facts, or shaken my\nconfidence in our original conclusion. The TIA does not\napply here.\n  The en banc opinion divides up the universe of govern-\nmental exactions into three categories: fines, fees, and\ntaxes. See Majority Op. at 9-13. The casino surcharge\nis not a fine, so we must decide whether it is more like\na “fee” or a “tax.” “The question whether something\nis a ‘tax’ or not for purposes of the TIA is ultimately\none of federal law, even though we consult state law to\nunderstand exactly what a particular charge is.” RTC\nCommercial, 169 F.3d at 457 (citing Reconstr.

Finally,\nthe form of relief requested is an important part of\nthe inquiry. “[I]f the relief sought would diminish or\nencumber state tax revenue, then the Act bars federal\njurisdiction over claims seeking such relief.” Scott Air\nForce Base, 548 F.3d at 520 (citing Levy, 510 F.3d at 762);\nsee also Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5-6.\n  For the en banc court, the only payments that count as\n“fees” are those that “compensate for a service that the\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              35\n\nstate provides to the persons or firms on whom or on\nwhich the exaction falls” or those that “compensate the\nstate for costs imposed on it by those persons or firms,\nother than costs of providing a service to them.” Majority\nOp. at 10. This includes “[f]ees for products” (like elec-\ntricity from a public utility) and “bona fide user fees”\n(like toll-road payments). Id. at 13. This definition corre-\nsponds to one that we and other circuits have used\nto identify a “classic” or “paradigmatic” fee, which\ncourts generally agree is not covered by the TIA’s juris-\ndictional bar. See Hill, 478 F.3d at 1245; Hager, 84 F.3d at\n870-71; San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685. But it does\nnot follow (and the cases do not hold) that unless a gov-\nernmental charge is a “fee” under this “classic” or “para-\ndigmatic” definition, then it must be a tax. That’s what\nthe en banc court has concluded. Clear classification\nlines are helpful, for all the reasons my colleagues have\nnoted, but this kind of line-drawing shifts the focus\naway from the core “state-revenue-protective moorings”\nof the TIA. Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 106.\n   Some regulatory assessments do not fit the classic\ndefinition of a fee, but they don’t have the characteristics\nof a tax, either. Government-mandated payments come\nin many types and can be implicated in federal\nlitigation in a variety of ways. The TIA does not block\nfederal jurisdiction over all suits touching on any pay-\nment to state or local government; it withdraws fed-\neral jurisdiction over suits seeking equitable remedies\nagainst the assessment and collection of state and local\ntaxes. This directs our focus to whether the suit challenges\na law that serves a general-revenue-raising function and\n\f36                                                  No. 09-3975\n\nwhether “the relief sought ‘would . . . operate[] to reduce\nthe flow of state tax revenue’ or would tie up ‘rightful\ntax revenue.’ ” Levy, 510 F.3d at 762 (quoting Hibbs, 542\nU.S. at 106, and Rosewell, 450 U.S. at 527-28). The casino\nsurcharge at issue here is specifically structured so that\nit does not raise state tax revenue.\n  As I have explained, the 2006 and 2008 Racing Acts\nimpose the 3% surcharge on the State’s four highest-\nearning casinos—and only these four—as a “condition\nof licensure.” 230 ILL. C OMP . S TAT. 10/7(a). A different\nsection of the Riverboat Gambling Act levies taxes on\nall riverboat casinos, id. § 10/13; the money collected\nunder these provisions is specifically referred to as “tax\nrevenue” subject to appropriation by the Illinois\nGeneral Assembly. This “tax revenue” is earmarked for\nthe support of specific governmental functions (e.g.,\neducation, the criminal justice system) and is distributed\nto the counties in which the casinos are situated, to be\nused for those purposes. Id. § 10/13(b), (c-20), (d).\n  In contrast the 3% surcharge appears in the Riverboat\nGambling Act’s section on “Owners [sic] Licenses” and\nis never referred to as a “tax.”3 Id. § 10/7. The surcharge\n\n3\n   That the Racing Acts do not call the surcharge a “tax” is\nrelevant but not dispositive. As the en banc court rightly notes,\nlegislatures often avoid using the t-word, see Majority Op.\nat 14 (“ ’Taxation’ is unpopular these days, so taxing authorities\navoid the term.”), so the name given to the exaction may not\ndeserve much weight. That the Illinois Supreme Court called\nthe surcharge a “tax” doesn’t advance the discussion either; the\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                    37\n\nis paid into the “Horse Racing Equity Trust Fund,” which\nis established as a “non-appropriated trust fund held\nseparate and apart from State moneys” for the sole\nbenefit of the racetracks. Id. §§ 5/54.5(a) (2006), 5/54.75(a).\nThe money is disbursed very quickly and directly to\nthe beneficiary racetracks. Id. §§ 5/54.5(b) (2006), 5/54.75(b).\nThe State holds the money in trust for the racetracks;\nit may not be transferred to the State’s general revenue\nfund or otherwise commingled with public funds and\nmay not be allocated to any state agency or program or\nused to pay any state cost or expense. 30 ILL. C OMP. S TAT.\n105/8h(a). Illinois itself assumes no obligation to the\nracetracks; the statutory scheme does not establish an\nentitlement program or obligate the State to pay a\nsubsidy to the racetracks. Instead, the State acts as a\ntrustee for the mandated transfer payments from the\ncasinos to the racetracks.\n\n3\n   (...continued)\nstate supreme court also repeatedly referred to it as a “sur-\ncharge” and a “fee.” See, e.g., Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v.\nGiannoulias, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169840\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169840/empress-casino-joliet-corp-v-giannoulias/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283-84, 285, 289-91 (2008). The state\nconstitution’s uniformity clause applies to taxes and fees, I LL .\nC ONST . art. IX, § 2, and the state supreme court used the terms\n“tax,” “fee,” and “surcharge” interchangeably throughout its\nopinion in Giannoulias. The Illinois General Assembly has\nplenary authority to enact the Racing Acts, but whether it\ninvoked its police power or its tax power in adopting the\nActs has some bearing on how the surcharge should be classi-\nfied. The General Assembly structured the surcharge as a\n“condition of licensure,” amending the provision of the\nRiverboat Gambling Act that pertains to gaming licenses—\nregulatory requirements that are tied to the State’s police\npower. See 230 I LL . C OMP . S TAT . 10/2(b).\n\f38                                              No. 09-3975\n\n  In short, the 3% casino surcharge is an off-budget\nregulatory device for relieving the competitive pressures\nexerted by riverboat gambling on the horse-racing tracks.\nI agree with my colleagues that the surcharge is not a\n“classic” regulatory fee; it does not compensate the\nState for services it provides to the casinos or otherwise\ndefray the costs of the State’s gaming regulatory appara-\ntus. But that doesn’t mean it’s a tax. The surcharge does\nnot raise revenue for the State or for any state program; its\npurpose is regulatory. To the extent the surcharge can be\ncategorized at all, it might appropriately be called a\n“compensation charge,” which is how we characterized it\nin Kathrein v. City of Evanston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"206587\"><a href=\"/opinion/206587/kathrein-v-city-of-evanston/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911 (7th Cir.\n2011), a decision issued shortly after the release of the\npanel opinion in this case and now criticized by the en\nbanc court. See Majority Op. at 13-14. Kathrein surveyed\nthe TIA caselaw and identified several types of payments\nto state and local governments that although not\nprototypical “fees,” are not properly classified as “taxes”\nfor purposes of the TIA. 636 F.3d at 911-12. One of the\n“non-tax” payments identified in Kathrein was a “compen-\nsation charge”—a charge “imposed upon those who cause\na negative externality, and its proceeds are used to com-\npensate those affected by the externality.” Id. at 911.\n  Kathrein cited the First Circuit’s decision in Trailer\nMarine as an example of this kind of charge—not a classic\n“fee” but not a “tax,” either. Id. Trailer Marine involved\na dormant Commerce Clause challenge to a special regis-\ntration fee imposed on “transitory” trailers entering\nPuerto Rican ports before permitting the trailers to be\nhitched to tractors for delivery of the transported goods\n\fNo. 09-3975                                              39\n\nwithin Puerto Rico. The fee was paid into a dedicated\nfund that provided no-fault compensation to persons\ninjured in motor-vehicle accidents. The court began its\nanalysis by noting that San Juan Cellular’s regulatory\nfee/revenue-raising tax distinction “does not provide\nmuch help in this case.” Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5.\nThis was because the purpose of the payment “is neither\nto raise general revenue for Puerto Rico nor to regulate\nconduct in the usual sense of that term,” but instead was\nincidental to a “social welfare program and tort reform\nlaw.” Id. Noting that “the legislature does not call the\nmeasure a tax and the money is collected largely as dedi-\ncated transfer payments for the beneficiaries” of the\naccident-compensation fund, the court held that the\nregistration fee “should not be treated as a tax for\npurposes of the . . . Tax Injunction Act[].” Id. at 5-6. Al-\nthough it was a “close issue,” the court said it was “at\nleast confident that allowing an injunction suit to be\nmaintained poses no threat to the central stream of tax\nrevenue relied on by Puerto Rico.” Id. at 6.\n  The same is true here—even more so, in fact. Allowing\nthis RICO suit to proceed will not pose any threat to tax\nrevenue relied on by Illinois. The State’s coffers will not\nbe depleted if the casinos prevail. Contrary to my col-\nleagues’ suggestion, the casino surcharge is not\nanalogous to a “sin tax” or other forms of taxation paid\ninto special-purpose funds, whether of the “lock box”\nvariety or not. See Majority Op. at 8, 12-15. The compari-\nson to Social Security taxes and taxes levied to sup-\nport agricultural subsidies is inapt. See id. at 13-14.\nThe Racing Acts do not create an entitlement program\n\f40                                                 No. 09-3975\n\nor even a traditional state subsidy. As I have noted,\nIllinois has not obligated itself to pay benefits to the\nracetracks and then enacted a tax as a source of revenue\nfor its racetrack-support program. Nor are the pay-\nments made to the racetracks properly characterized as\n“earmarks,” as my colleagues imply, id. at 12-15; the\nHorse Racing Fund is specifically designated as a “non-\nappropriated trust fund.” The 3% surcharge is not a tax\nlevied to fund a state spending program established for\nthe benefit of the racetracks. To the contrary, as this\nsubsidy program is structured, the casinos must share\na portion of their wealth with the racetracks quite\ndirectly, with the State simply serving as an agent for\nreceipt and disbursement of “dedicated transfer pay-\nments for the beneficiaries.” Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5.\n   For these reasons, I cannot join the en banc opinion.\nNeedless to say, I take no position on the merits of the\ncasinos’ case—or for that matter, on my colleagues’\nextended discussion of the policy justifications for re-\nquiring rich casinos to share their profits with strug-\ngling horse-racing tracks. See Majority Op. at 16-19.\nThese matters are not before the court. We have only a\njurisdictional question, and on that question I remain\nwhere I was when this case was decided by the panel:\nThe TIA’s jurisdictional bar does not apply. A construc-\ntive trust on the racetracks’ private escrow will not\n“freeze the state’s tax moneys,” as my colleagues have\nconcluded.4 See id. at 24. The casino surcharge is not\n\n4\n  My colleagues have suggested that our decision in Schneider\nTransport is “indistinguishable from the present case,” Majority\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3975                                                       41\n\nstructured as a tax, and a constructive trust on the race-\ntracks’ private escrow as a remedy for the alleged\nRICO violations will not interfere with the assessment\nor collection of any state revenue. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   (...continued)\nOp. at 12 (citing Schneider Transp., Inc. v.

Schneider Transport was\na suit by a trucking company against the Wisconsin Secretary\nof Transportation seeking an injunction against the imposition\nof vehicle-registration fees on its fleet of trucks. 657 F.2d at 130-\n32. Truck-registration fees were deposited into the state’s\ntransportation fund and used for general transportation pur-\nposes, “including highway construction.” Id. at 132. We con-\ncluded that the fee was a tax for purposes of the TIA because\nit was “imposed for revenue-raising purposes, a characteristic\nof any tax.” Id. An injunction against the collection of the\nregistration fee would have depleted the state transportation\nfund, which paid for highway construction and other state\ntransportation needs. Here, in contrast, an injunction against\nthe racetracks’ private escrow would have no effect on the\npublic fisc.\n\n\n\n                               7-8-11\n\f</pre>",
