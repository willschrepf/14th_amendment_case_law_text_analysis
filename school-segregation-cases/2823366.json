Rose, all dark-skinned Cape Verdeans, &lt;br&gt;sued their quondam employer, Costa Brothers Masonry, Inc. (Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros.), alleging a discriminatory failure to rehire.  They now &lt;br&gt;appeal from an order granting summary judgment against them.  Their &lt;br&gt;appeal requires us to explore how courts charged with resolving &lt;br&gt;discrimination cases should choose between pretext analysis (an &lt;br&gt;approach first limned in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. &lt;br&gt;792 (1973)) and mixed-motive analysis (an alternative approach &lt;br&gt;limned later in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) &lt;br&gt;(plurality opinion)).  We conclude, as did the district court, that &lt;br&gt;the evidence thus far adduced does not trigger mixed-motive &lt;br&gt;analysis.  We also conclude, however, that under a properly &lt;br&gt;performed pretext analysis, the appellants' case should have &lt;br&gt;survived.  Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for &lt;br&gt;further proceedings. &lt;br&gt;I.  THE FACTS &lt;br&gt;  As the summary judgment standard demands, we take the &lt;br&gt;facts in the light most hospitable to the appellants, indulging all &lt;br&gt;reasonable inferences in their favor.  See Conward v. Cambridge &lt;br&gt;Sch. Comm., 171 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1999).  Mindful of this coign &lt;br&gt;of vantage, we deliberately omit from our narrative versions of &lt;br&gt;certain conversations and events that conflict with the appellants' &lt;br&gt;accounts. &lt;br&gt;  In 1995, Stone Building Company secured a contract to &lt;br&gt;construct a new high school in Mashpee, Massachusetts.  It engaged &lt;br&gt;Costa Bros. as the masonry subcontractor.  Because the job was &lt;br&gt;publicly funded, contractors and subcontractors were told that they &lt;br&gt;had to conform to specific equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules &lt;br&gt;and to issue weekly EEO summaries documenting the number of hours &lt;br&gt;worked by minority employees. &lt;br&gt;  A Portuguese immigrant, Domingos DaCosta, owns Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros.  On November 13, 1995, he retained Sebastian Ceribelli, a &lt;br&gt;Brazilian, as the masonry foreman for the Mashpee project.  DaCosta &lt;br&gt;and Ceribelli then hired a number of masons and laborers to work on &lt;br&gt;the job.  Those engaged on November 27 included five masons   the &lt;br&gt;appellants and two white males, George Choquette and George &lt;br&gt;Medeiros   and a dark-skinned Cape Verdean laborer, Glenn Spinola.  &lt;br&gt;These six men worked as a team until December 7, when Ceribelli &lt;br&gt;laid off all six due to winter weather conditions and lack of heat &lt;br&gt;in the workplace.  He vowed that he would recall them when the &lt;br&gt;heating quandary had been solved.  Other workers were laid off at &lt;br&gt;roughly the same time (although some, unlike the appellants, were &lt;br&gt;assigned to ongoing Costa Bros. projects elsewhere). &lt;br&gt;  On or about December 13, Costa Bros. resumed work on the &lt;br&gt;Mashpee project.  It recalled some masons (but not the appellants).  &lt;br&gt;Gilbert visited the job site the following week and asked Ceribelli &lt;br&gt;when he would be rehired.  Ceribelli responded, \"The way things are &lt;br&gt;going now . . . I wouldn't count on it.\" &lt;br&gt;  Rose sojourned to the site the next Saturday.  He noticed &lt;br&gt;masons working there and queried DaCosta about this circumstance.  &lt;br&gt;DaCosta replied, \"We're doing a little fixing up here.\"  Rose then &lt;br&gt;asked, \"Are we going to get called back?\"  DaCosta responded, &lt;br&gt;\"We're going to close in\"   a comment that Rose reasonably took to &lt;br&gt;mean that the building would be enclosed in order to create a &lt;br&gt;heated space in which masons could work. &lt;br&gt;  Having heard nothing further, Rose checked back two weeks &lt;br&gt;later.  He saw that the job site was fully heated and asked &lt;br&gt;DaCosta, \"Aren't we coming back?\"  DaCosta replied cryptically, &lt;br&gt;\"Well, I got my men.\"  When Rose inquired about what had happened &lt;br&gt;to the plan to recruit residents and minorities, DaCosta stated, \"I &lt;br&gt;don't need minorities, and I don't need no residents on this job.  &lt;br&gt;I got my men.\"  Rose complained that DaCosta had \"twelve new faces\" &lt;br&gt;working on the project, but DaCosta abruptly terminated the &lt;br&gt;conversation. &lt;br&gt;  In point of fact, Costa Bros. recalled a total of &lt;br&gt;eighteen workmen (masons and laborers) between December 13 and &lt;br&gt;January 25, and hired ten new ones in that span (none of whom had &lt;br&gt;worked previously for Costa Bros.).  All twenty-eight were white &lt;br&gt;males. &lt;br&gt;  Fernandes returned to the job site on numerous occasions &lt;br&gt;in December and January.  Each time, DaCosta told him that there &lt;br&gt;was no work available but to come back again.  After several weeks, &lt;br&gt;Fernandes asked Ceribelli why he and the other Cape Verdeans had &lt;br&gt;not been recalled.  Ceribelli replied that Costa Bros. \"had only &lt;br&gt;hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\" &lt;br&gt;  On January 30, DaCosta, James Byrne (the clerk of the &lt;br&gt;works), and a representative of the general contractor met with &lt;br&gt;Fernandes, Raoul Galvin (a civil rights activist), and others from &lt;br&gt;the local community regarding Costa Bros.'s compliance with EEO &lt;br&gt;requirements.  Galvin noted that Costa Bros. had hired more &lt;br&gt;workers, all of whom were white, but that it had no minorities &lt;br&gt;working at the site.  He implored DaCosta to rehire Fernandes &lt;br&gt;because \"whatever was going on at the time would stop if he at &lt;br&gt;least put one of [the Cape Verdeans] back to work.\"  DaCosta &lt;br&gt;indicated that he would honor this request. &lt;br&gt;  Fernandes reported for duty the following Monday but was &lt;br&gt;informed that there was no work available.  This experience was &lt;br&gt;repeated several times.  Costa Bros. finally restored Fernandes to &lt;br&gt;the payroll on March 26, albeit as a laborer rather than as a &lt;br&gt;mason.  On the same day, Ceribelli warned him to \"watch out\" &lt;br&gt;because DaCosta was \"going to be on [his] back.\"  This prediction &lt;br&gt;proved prophetic:  according to Fernandes, DaCosta \"followed [him] &lt;br&gt;around,\" constantly \"hollering and screaming\" at him. &lt;br&gt;  When Fernandes reported for work the next morning, &lt;br&gt;DaCosta instructed him to get an \"F block\" (or so he thought).  &lt;br&gt;Fernandes was unsure what an \"F block\" was and asked DaCosta (who, &lt;br&gt;as matters turned out, had wanted a standard \"half block\").  After &lt;br&gt;castigating Fernandes for his ignorance, DaCosta declared that he &lt;br&gt;was \"tired of . . . what's going on between you guys,\" and voiced &lt;br&gt;the opinion that \"[y]ou guys are trying to hurt me.\"  He then &lt;br&gt;proclaimed:  \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean &lt;br&gt;people.  This is my business.  It belongs to me.\"  At that &lt;br&gt;juncture, DaCosta fired Fernandes. &lt;br&gt;II.  TRAVEL OF THE CASE &lt;br&gt;  After pursuing administrative remedies, see 42 U.S.C.  &lt;br&gt;2000e-5(e); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  5, the appellants sued.  In &lt;br&gt;their complaint, they alleged discrimination on the basis of race &lt;br&gt;and color in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of &lt;br&gt;1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e to 2000e-17, and its state-law analogue, &lt;br&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4(1).  Costa Bros. denied the material &lt;br&gt;allegations of the complaint, and the parties spent the next year &lt;br&gt;conducting pretrial discovery.  From the record and the briefs, it &lt;br&gt;appears that the appellants' original claim was constructively &lt;br&gt;amended to include discrimination predicated on national origin, &lt;br&gt;and the case went forward on that assumption. &lt;br&gt;  In due course, Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment, &lt;br&gt;see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and the appellants filed an opposition.  &lt;br&gt;The district court heard oral argument, took the matter under &lt;br&gt;advisement, and thereafter granted the motion as to all claims.  In &lt;br&gt;its unpublished rescript, the court characterized DaCosta's &lt;br&gt;statement that \"I don't need minorities . . . on this job\" as a &lt;br&gt;stray remark, insufficient to trigger mixed-motive analysis.  &lt;br&gt;Although the court catalogued DaCosta's comment that \"I don't have &lt;br&gt;to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" in its recitation of the &lt;br&gt;facts, it did not mention this comment thereafter. &lt;br&gt;  Undertaking pretext analysis, the court focused on two &lt;br&gt;white masons who had been hired in January 1996   Piper and &lt;br&gt;Winters.  The court ruled that the Piper hiring did not assist the &lt;br&gt;appellants because Piper had special skills and they could not &lt;br&gt;establish that their qualifications were equivalent to his.  As to &lt;br&gt;Winters, the court accepted Costa Bros.'s explanation that it had &lt;br&gt;hired him on the recommendation of another employee, characterizing &lt;br&gt;what had happened as cronyism rather than discrimination.  The &lt;br&gt;court never discussed whether the record sufficed to support a &lt;br&gt;finding that this explanation was pretextual, nor did it explore &lt;br&gt;the numerous other employment decisions that Costa Bros. made in &lt;br&gt;the December-January time frame.  This appeal followed. &lt;br&gt;III.  DISCUSSION &lt;br&gt;  The appellants asseverate that the district court erred &lt;br&gt;in choosing a legal framework and that, even if the court marched &lt;br&gt;down an acceptable analytic path, it did not stay on track.  We &lt;br&gt;consider these arguments in sequence, pausing first to frame the &lt;br&gt;choice-of-approach issue.  We then briefly address the appellants' &lt;br&gt;state-law claim. &lt;br&gt;               A.  The Available Analytic Methods. &lt;br&gt;  A plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII &lt;br&gt;may proceed on a mixed-motive approach or on a pretext approach.  &lt;br&gt;For purposes of this case, it is important to understand the basic &lt;br&gt;difference between these two modalities. &lt;br&gt;  Mixed-motive analysis applies when the evidence shows &lt;br&gt;that an employer considered both a proscribed factor (say, race) &lt;br&gt;and one or more legitimate factors (say, competence) in making a &lt;br&gt;challenged employment decision.  See  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;241-42.  In that scenario, the plaintiff is not obliged to separate &lt;br&gt;out the relative import of each element that went into the &lt;br&gt;decision; rather, once the plaintiff proves that a proscribed &lt;br&gt;factor \"played a motivating part\" in the decision, the burden of &lt;br&gt;persuasion shifts to the employer, who will be held liable for &lt;br&gt;damages under Title VII unless \"it can prove that, even if it had &lt;br&gt;not taken [the proscribed factor] into account, it would have come &lt;br&gt;to the same decision regarding [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 242, 244.  &lt;br&gt;Even then, because Congress has reshaped mixed-motive analysis in &lt;br&gt;certain respects, the employee may be entitled to equitable relief &lt;br&gt;so long as he has proven that the proscribed factor played some &lt;br&gt;part in the decisional calculus.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m); &lt;br&gt;2000e-5(g)(2)(B); see also Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, &lt;br&gt;Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 259 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999); Carey v. Mt. Desert &lt;br&gt;Island Hosp., 156 F.3d 31, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1998). &lt;br&gt;  It is readily apparent that this mixed-motive approach, &lt;br&gt;uncabined, has the potential to swallow whole the traditional &lt;br&gt;McDonnell Douglas analysis.  To guard against this possibility, the &lt;br&gt;Court restricted its applicability to those infrequent cases in &lt;br&gt;which a plaintiff can demonstrate with a high degree of assurance &lt;br&gt;that the employment decision of which he complains \"was the product &lt;br&gt;of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.\"  Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247.  Under this formulation, access to the &lt;br&gt;mixed-motive approach ultimately depends on the quality of the &lt;br&gt;available evidence.  Most courts agree that Justice O'Connor's &lt;br&gt;seminal concurrence in Price Waterhouse furnishes the best device &lt;br&gt;for testing quality (and, thus, the best roadmap for segregating &lt;br&gt;mixed-motive cases from the mine-run of discrimination cases).  &lt;br&gt;After all, when the Supreme Court rules by means of a plurality &lt;br&gt;opinion (as was true in Price Waterhouse), inferior courts should &lt;br&gt;give effect to the narrowest ground upon which a majority of the &lt;br&gt;Justices supporting the judgment would agree.  See Marks v. United &lt;br&gt;States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).  The O'Connor concurrence fits &lt;br&gt;this profile.  Hence, we turn to it. &lt;br&gt;  \"What is required [to trigger mixed-motive analysis] is &lt;br&gt;. . . direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial &lt;br&gt;negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their &lt;br&gt;decision.\"  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., &lt;br&gt;concurring).  Because discrimination tends more and more to operate &lt;br&gt;in subtle ways, direct evidence is relatively rare; when it comes &lt;br&gt;to light, however, a plaintiff can use it to demonstrate \"that an &lt;br&gt;illegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular &lt;br&gt;employment decision.\"  Id. at 275.  It follows that plaintiffs may &lt;br&gt;use the Price Waterhouse mechanism in disparate treatment cases in &lt;br&gt;which they adduce direct evidence of a discriminatory animus, &lt;br&gt;whereas they must proceed under the conventional McDonnell Douglas &lt;br&gt;framework (commonly called \"pretext analysis\") in all other cases.  &lt;br&gt;See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1996). &lt;br&gt;  Under the pretext method, the plaintiff first must &lt;br&gt;establish a prima facie case.  See Texas Dep't of Comm'y Affairs v. &lt;br&gt;Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 802.  We shall return to the components of the prima facie case; &lt;br&gt;for now, it suffices to say that this requirement is \"not onerous.\"  &lt;br&gt;Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  If the plaintiff clears this modest &lt;br&gt;hurdle, the burden of production   but not the burden of persuasion &lt;br&gt;  shifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate, &lt;br&gt;nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  See &lt;br&gt;St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07 (1993); &lt;br&gt;Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55.  Once that occurs, the plaintiff must &lt;br&gt;show both that the employer's \"proffered reason is a sham, and that &lt;br&gt;discriminatory animus sparked [its] actions.\"  Conward, 171 F.3d at &lt;br&gt;19.  To this end, the full panoply of circumstantial evidence is &lt;br&gt;available, including but not limited to \"statistical evidence &lt;br&gt;showing disparate treatment by the employer of members of the &lt;br&gt;protected class, comments by decisionmakers which denigrate &lt;br&gt;[persons in the protected group], the incidence of differential &lt;br&gt;treatment in the workplace, and the deployment of . . . &lt;br&gt;replacements.\"  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).  The totality of the evidence &lt;br&gt;then is examined \"as part of an aggregate package of proof.\"  Id. &lt;br&gt;  A plaintiff, uncertain of what discovery will yield or &lt;br&gt;how a judge will react to certain proffers, may elect to proceed &lt;br&gt;simultaneously on both fronts (mixed-motive and pretext), cognizant &lt;br&gt;that the trial court, at an appropriate stage of the litigation, &lt;br&gt;will channel the case into one format or the other.  See Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247 n.12; Thomas v. National Football &lt;br&gt;League Players Ass'n, 131 F.3d 198, 202 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  &lt;br&gt;Consistent with the O'Connor concurrence, the court typically will &lt;br&gt;make that determination based on the availability or unavailability &lt;br&gt;of direct evidence.  See Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d &lt;br&gt;219, 232 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. &lt;br&gt;Cos., 968 F.2d 171, 181-82 (2d Cir. 1992). &lt;br&gt;  This ruling can have important effects on the outcome of &lt;br&gt;the litigation.  In a mixed-motive analysis, \"the burden of &lt;br&gt;persuasion shifts from the employee to the employer, who must then &lt;br&gt;affirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even &lt;br&gt;if it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.\"  &lt;br&gt;Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; accord Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 246 (explaining that, under a mixed-motive analysis, \"the &lt;br&gt;plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the &lt;br&gt;employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another\").  &lt;br&gt;This contrasts vividly with pretext analysis, under which the &lt;br&gt;employee retains the burden of persuasion throughout.  See Cumpiano &lt;br&gt;v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 153 (1st Cir. 1990). &lt;br&gt;                    B.  Mixed-Motive Analysis. &lt;br&gt;  With this preface, we turn to the appellants' contention &lt;br&gt;that the lower court erred in eschewing a mixed-motive analysis.  &lt;br&gt;Because this case comes to us on appeal from an order granting &lt;br&gt;brevis disposition, we afford de novo review.  See Conward, 171 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 18. &lt;br&gt;  As our earlier discussion indicates, direct evidence is &lt;br&gt;the touchstone for mixed-motive analysis.  Hence, the fate of the &lt;br&gt;appellants' present contention hinges on whether they adduced &lt;br&gt;direct evidence of Costa Bros.'s use of a proscribed factor (race, &lt;br&gt;color, and/or national origin) in the decisional process.  &lt;br&gt;Answering that question is more difficult than might appear at &lt;br&gt;first blush.  To be sure, Justice O'Connor furnished a trenchant, &lt;br&gt;universally accepted example of what is not direct evidence:  stray &lt;br&gt;remarks, such as \"statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by &lt;br&gt;decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.\"  Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Since &lt;br&gt;then, however, jurists have struggled in attempting to define the &lt;br&gt;term affirmatively.  This operose task not only has divided the &lt;br&gt;courts of appeals but also has created a patchwork of intra-circuit &lt;br&gt;conflicts.  Generally speaking, three schools of thought have &lt;br&gt;emerged. &lt;br&gt;  1.  The \"Classic\" Position.  Some courts adopt the &lt;br&gt;traditional definition of \"direct evidence\" for this purpose, &lt;br&gt;holding that the term signifies evidence which, if believed, &lt;br&gt;suffices to prove the fact of discriminatory animus without &lt;br&gt;inference, presumption, or resort to other evidence.  See, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Shorter v. ICG Holdings, Inc., 188 F.3d 1204, 1207 (10th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999); Haas v. Advo Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 732, 734 n.2 (5th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999); EEOC v. Wiltel, Inc., 81 F.3d 1508, 1514 (10th Cir. 1996); &lt;br&gt;Nichols v. Loral Vought Sys. Corp., 81 F.3d 38, 40 (5th Cir. 1996).  &lt;br&gt;Although only the Fifth and Tenth Circuits cling consistently to &lt;br&gt;this view, other tribunals have embraced it periodically.  See, &lt;br&gt;e.g., Carter v. Three Springs Resid'l Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 641 &lt;br&gt;(11th Cir. 1998); Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734, 736 &lt;br&gt;(7th Cir. 1994). &lt;br&gt;  2.  The \"Animus Plus\" Position.  The Fourth Circuit, &lt;br&gt;sitting en banc, recently defined \"direct evidence\" for this &lt;br&gt;purpose as evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of conduct or &lt;br&gt;statements that (1) reflect directly the alleged discriminatory &lt;br&gt;animus and (2) bear squarely on the contested employment decision.  &lt;br&gt;See Taylor, 193 F.3d at 232.  The D.C. Circuit takes the same view.  &lt;br&gt;See Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204.  The Ninth Circuit seems headed in &lt;br&gt;this direction.  See Lambert v. Ackerley, 180 F.3d 997, 1008-09 &lt;br&gt;(9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), petition for cert. filed, 68 U.S.L.W. &lt;br&gt;3292 (U.S. Oct. 20, 1999) (No. 99-681).  The Third Circuit at one &lt;br&gt;time was in the \"animus plus\" camp, see Walden v. Georgia-Pacific &lt;br&gt;Corp., 126 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. &lt;br&gt;1516 (1998), but that court is poised to revisit the question.  See &lt;br&gt;Hankins v. City of Philadelphia, 189 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 1999), &lt;br&gt;rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated, 188 F.3d 217 (3d Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999).  Two other courts of appeals have indicated occasional &lt;br&gt;approval of this approach, see, e.g., Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., 173 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999); Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, &lt;br&gt;Inc., 132 F.3d 431, 436 (8th Cir. 1998), but as the cases cited &lt;br&gt;herein indicate, both of these courts have flirted with other &lt;br&gt;formulations.  Courts endorsing the animus plus position do not &lt;br&gt;distinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence in the &lt;br&gt;classic sense but, rather, emphasize that the mixed-motive trigger &lt;br&gt;depends on the strength of the plaintiff's case.  See, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Kubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs., 181 F.3d 544, 553 (4th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999) (emphasizing that whether a case falls under the mixed-motive &lt;br&gt;or pretext rubric \"ultimately hinges on the strength of the &lt;br&gt;evidence establishing discrimination\") (citation and internal &lt;br&gt;quotation marks omitted); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (similar). &lt;br&gt;  3.  The \"Animus\" Position.  A few courts resolve the &lt;br&gt;direct evidence conundrum by the simple expedient of deleting the &lt;br&gt;\"plus\" from the \"animus plus\" formulation.  Those courts opine that &lt;br&gt;as long as the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) is tied &lt;br&gt;to the alleged discriminatory animus, it need not bear squarely on &lt;br&gt;the challenged employment decision.  The Second Circuit advocates &lt;br&gt;this position.  See, e.g., Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 898, 913 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182.  The &lt;br&gt;Eighth Circuit intermittently takes this stance, see, e.g., Kerns &lt;br&gt;v. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1999); &lt;br&gt;Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., 997 F.2d 444, 449 (8th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1993), and two other cases appear to fit somewhat loosely into this &lt;br&gt;category, see Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1303-04 &lt;br&gt;(11th Cir. 1999); Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 1344, 1348-50 (7th Cir. 1995). &lt;br&gt;  4.  The First Circuit's Position.  To complete our survey &lt;br&gt;of the legal landscape, we direct our gaze inward.  Although we &lt;br&gt;have dropped inconclusive hints here and there, see, e.g., Ayala- &lt;br&gt;Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, &lt;br&gt;421 (1st Cir. 1996), we have yet to choose among these conflicting &lt;br&gt;approaches.  Thus, the question is wide open in this circuit. &lt;br&gt;  5.  The Case at Hand.  This case does not require us to &lt;br&gt;fill the void, and we decline to do so gratuitously.  The &lt;br&gt;appellants contend that two comments attributed to DaCosta   \"I &lt;br&gt;don't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job\" and &lt;br&gt;\"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\"   &lt;br&gt;constitute direct evidence that a proscribed factor influenced &lt;br&gt;Costa Bros.'s hiring practices.  The employer demurs, asserting &lt;br&gt;that these are merely \"stray remarks\" and, in all events, lack &lt;br&gt;sufficient probative force to constitute direct evidence. &lt;br&gt;  We do not share the view that DaCosta's statements must &lt;br&gt;be classified as stray remarks.  As we have pointed out, DaCosta &lt;br&gt;was the ultimate decisionmaker, and both pronouncements pertained &lt;br&gt;to the decisional process.  He made the first statement when &lt;br&gt;refusing to rehire Rose; because it bore directly on a challenged &lt;br&gt;employment decision, it hardly qualifies as a stray remark.  See, &lt;br&gt;e.g., Deneen, 132 F.3d at 436; Diaz-Gandia v. Dapena-Thompson, 90 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 609, 616 (1st Cir. 1996).  DaCosta uttered the second &lt;br&gt;statement when cashiering Fernandez and, although this suit does &lt;br&gt;not challenge Fernandes's dismissal per se, see infra note 3, we &lt;br&gt;think that the comment, which in terms bears upon Costa Bros.'s &lt;br&gt;repeated refusals to rehire the appellants, sufficiently implicates &lt;br&gt;the decisional process to avoid classification as a stray remark.  &lt;br&gt;See Wichmann v. Board of Trustees, 180 F.3d 791, 802 (7th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999), petition for cert. filed, 68 U.S.L.W. 3154 (U.S. Sept. 3, &lt;br&gt;1999) (No. 99-411); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204. &lt;br&gt;  In the last analysis, however, this taxonomic triumph &lt;br&gt;constitutes a hollow victory for the appellants.  Despite the fact &lt;br&gt;that these statements cannot be brushed aside as stray remarks, &lt;br&gt;they are inherently ambiguous and, as such, do not directly reflect &lt;br&gt;the alleged animus.  The first   \"I don't need minorities and I &lt;br&gt;don't need residents on the job\"   may be interpreted either as an &lt;br&gt;admission of an exclusionary hiring practice (thus explicating the &lt;br&gt;true reason for DaCosta's actions) or as a benign response to a &lt;br&gt;specific inquiry reflecting DaCosta's (erroneous) perception that &lt;br&gt;he no longer had to make special efforts to comply with EEO &lt;br&gt;requirements.  The second   \"I don't have to hire you locals or &lt;br&gt;Cape Verdean people\"   may be interpreted either as a &lt;br&gt;discriminatory explanation for DaCosta's actions or as a response &lt;br&gt;to what he perceived as an unjustified attempt to impose some sort &lt;br&gt;of quota system upon his company. &lt;br&gt;  Under any of the three views we have delineated, these &lt;br&gt;statements do not rise to the level of direct evidence.  Courts &lt;br&gt;that take the \"classic\" position have contrasted direct evidence &lt;br&gt;with, inter alia, ambiguous statements, and have indicated that the &lt;br&gt;latter will not suffice.  See Maldonado v. U.S. Bank, 186 F.3d 759, &lt;br&gt;763 (7th Cir. 1999); Troupe, 20 F.3d at 736-37.  Courts that take &lt;br&gt;either the \"animus plus\" or \"animus\" position place great emphasis &lt;br&gt;on the strength of the proof of discriminatory animus.  See, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Fuller v. Phipps, 67 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (4th Cir. 1995); Thomas, &lt;br&gt;131 F.3d at 204; Fields v. New York State Office of Mental &lt;br&gt;Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, 115 F.3d 116, 122 (2d &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182.  In our judgment, &lt;br&gt;inherently ambiguous statements, without more, cannot supply the &lt;br&gt;strong evidence that these courts rightfully demand as a &lt;br&gt;prerequisite to mixed-motive analysis.  We conclude, therefore, &lt;br&gt;that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different &lt;br&gt;ways   one discriminatory and the other benign   does not directly &lt;br&gt;reflect illegal animus and, thus, does not constitute direct &lt;br&gt;evidence.  See, e.g., Carter, 132 F.3d at 641 (\"We have held that &lt;br&gt;statements that are open to more than one interpretation do not &lt;br&gt;constitute direct evidence of racial discrimination.\"); Troupe, 20 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 736-37 (similar).  Thus, DaCosta's statements do not serve &lt;br&gt;to unlatch the door to the mixed-motive approach. &lt;br&gt;                      C.  Pretext Analysis. &lt;br&gt;  Having determined that the district court appropriately &lt;br&gt;selected pretext analysis as the method of choice, we next examine &lt;br&gt;the court's execution of that analysis.  We again afford plenary &lt;br&gt;review.  See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18. &lt;br&gt;  1.  The Prima Facie Case.  Notwithstanding Costa Bros.'s &lt;br&gt;tendency to conceptualize this appeal as a reduction-in-force case, &lt;br&gt;the appellants' complaint squarely alleges a discriminatory failure &lt;br&gt;to rehire.  Because the appellants have not complained that the &lt;br&gt;layoff itself was discriminatory, the employer's focus on the &lt;br&gt;elements of a prima facie reduction-in-force case is misplaced.  &lt;br&gt;The proper focus is on failure to rehire, and the proper source for &lt;br&gt;the elements of a prima facie failure-to-rehire case is McDonnell &lt;br&gt;Douglas itself. &lt;br&gt;  Under that authority, a plaintiff alleging a failure to &lt;br&gt;rehire establishes his prima facie case by showing: &lt;br&gt;    (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) &lt;br&gt;  that he applied and was qualified for a job &lt;br&gt;  for which the employer was seeking applicants; &lt;br&gt;  (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was &lt;br&gt;  rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, &lt;br&gt;  the position remained open and the employer &lt;br&gt;  continued to seek applicants from persons of &lt;br&gt;  complainant's qualifications. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  Contrary to Costa Bros.'s &lt;br&gt;contention, a plaintiff need not show as part of his prima facie &lt;br&gt;case that the employer either recalled similarly situated non- &lt;br&gt;minority employees or otherwise treated employees of different &lt;br&gt;ethnic backgrounds more favorably.  See Perry v. Woodward, 188 F.3d &lt;br&gt;1220, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 1999); Conward, 171 F.3d at 19-20; Walker &lt;br&gt;v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1179 n.2, 1186 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. &lt;br&gt;denied, 120 S. Ct. 39 (1999); Walker v. St. Anthony's Med. Ctr., &lt;br&gt;881 F.2d 554, 558 (8th Cir. 1989); see also Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at  &lt;br&gt;155 n.2. &lt;br&gt;  Against this benchmark, we conclude without serious &lt;br&gt;question that the appellants established a prima facie case.  The &lt;br&gt;first prong is uncontroversial; all three appellants are Cape &lt;br&gt;Verdean and, as such, belong to a racial minority.  The second &lt;br&gt;element also falls easily into place:  all three performed &lt;br&gt;satisfactorily as masons prior to the layoff and plainly were &lt;br&gt;qualified to do the work. &lt;br&gt;  Turning to the third facet of the prima facie case, the &lt;br&gt;record establishes that all three appellants returned to the job &lt;br&gt;site at various times after the layoff and sought reinstatement.  &lt;br&gt;For the most part, Costa Bros. rebuffed these efforts.  The sole &lt;br&gt;exception   the time in March when DaCosta capitulated to external &lt;br&gt;pressure and hired Fernandes as a laborer, only to fire him on his &lt;br&gt;second day of work   hardly suffices to tip the balance.  Cf. &lt;br&gt;International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, &lt;br&gt;341-42 (1977) (explaining that subsequent changes in corporate &lt;br&gt;\"hiring and promotion policies . . . could not erase [the &lt;br&gt;company's] previous illegal conduct or its obligation to afford &lt;br&gt;relief to those who suffered because of it\").  This is especially &lt;br&gt;so since what transpired on that occasion plausibly can be &lt;br&gt;interpreted (drawing permissive inferences favorable to the &lt;br&gt;appellants) as further evidence of DaCosta's discriminatory &lt;br&gt;treatment of Fernandes.  After all, DaCosta had resisted rehiring &lt;br&gt;Fernandes for several weeks and had to be persuaded to do so by a &lt;br&gt;civil rights advocate.  Moreover, Ceribelli   the Costa Bros. &lt;br&gt;foreman   forewarned Fernandes that DaCosta would be \"on [his] &lt;br&gt;back,\" and the sequence of events that followed reasonably could be &lt;br&gt;seen as proof of the pudding. &lt;br&gt;  The appellants also fulfilled the final prima facie case &lt;br&gt;requirement.  In the relevant time frame (December-January), Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros. had an ongoing need for masons on the Mashpee project, hiring &lt;br&gt;and recalling many throughout the period.  For aught that appears, &lt;br&gt;the qualifications of the vast majority of these masons were much &lt;br&gt;the same as the appellants' qualifications.  No more is exigible.  &lt;br&gt;See Conward, 171 F.3d at 19. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros.'s efforts to dispute this element of the &lt;br&gt;prima facie case are unavailing.  In the district court, it &lt;br&gt;characterized its hiring practices as \"simply react[ing] to men who &lt;br&gt;appeared at the right place at the right time,\" and argued that it &lt;br&gt;had no need for additional help at the precise moments that the &lt;br&gt;appellants inquired.  On this chiaroscuro record, a jury might so &lt;br&gt;find   but it also might find this to be a self-serving fiction.   &lt;br&gt;  It may or may not be a coincidence that, of the nineteen &lt;br&gt;men whom DaCosta furloughed on December 7 and 8 (the three &lt;br&gt;appellants, plus Choquette, George Medeiros, Spinola, William &lt;br&gt;Ceribelli, Juliao Fernandes, Victor Fernandez, Martirio Neto, &lt;br&gt;Antonio Santo, Jose Silva, Artur Teles, Antonio DaSilva, Fernando &lt;br&gt;DaSilva, Miguel Silva, Joseph Pimenthal, Jose Claudino, and Dinos &lt;br&gt;Medeiros), all but five either were reassigned to another Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros. job or recalled in mid-December.  Likewise, it may or may &lt;br&gt;not be coincidental that four of the excluded five (the three &lt;br&gt;appellants and Spinola) comprised the entire complement of minority &lt;br&gt;employees who had toiled on the Mashpee project.  Moreover, the &lt;br&gt;fourteen men who were given an opportunity to work for Costa Bros. &lt;br&gt;either at Mashpee or on another project in mid-December included &lt;br&gt;two white masons (George Medeiros and William Ceribelli) and three &lt;br&gt;white laborers (Joao Bolarinho, Fernando DaSilva, and Artur Teles) &lt;br&gt;who had been hired, and then furloughed, on approximately the same &lt;br&gt;dates as the appellants. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros. attempts to blunt the force of this evidence &lt;br&gt;in three ways.  First, it notes that George Medeiros, though &lt;br&gt;recalled, only worked for four days.  The fact remains, however, &lt;br&gt;that he was recalled and the appellants were not.  Second, Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros. points out that one member of the excluded group (Choquette) &lt;br&gt;was a white mason.  That is true as far as it goes   but it does &lt;br&gt;not go very far:  the record is devoid of evidence that Choquette &lt;br&gt;applied for reinstatement at any time.  Third, Costa Bros. asserts &lt;br&gt;that it rehired Spinola in April 1996.  We think that this fact &lt;br&gt;possesses only marginal relevance here, inasmuch as Spinola's &lt;br&gt;recall occurred well beyond the December-January period during &lt;br&gt;which the appellants unsuccessfully sought reinstatement. &lt;br&gt;  In addition to the fourteen rehires just discussed, the &lt;br&gt;record indicates that Costa Bros. engaged a half-dozen new workers &lt;br&gt;for determinate positions during late December and January:  Carlos &lt;br&gt;Bolarinho (a laborer, hired on December 29); Piper (a mason, hired &lt;br&gt;on January 2); Winters (a mason, hired on January 10); Joaquim &lt;br&gt;Fernandes (a laborer, hired on January 18); Dan Cormier (a laborer, &lt;br&gt;hired on January 22); and Luis Amaro (a laborer, hired on January &lt;br&gt;23).  All were white.  Costa Bros. recruited four more white males &lt;br&gt;(Antonio Reboca, Joao Soares, Michael Oliveira, and Steven Downey) &lt;br&gt;on various dates between January 5 and January 25.  Although these &lt;br&gt;four were assigned to work on the Mashpee project, we cannot &lt;br&gt;accurately determine from the existing record which were masons and &lt;br&gt;which were laborers. &lt;br&gt;  These figures make the appellants' point emphatically.  &lt;br&gt;They create an ample evidentiary platform for a finding that, &lt;br&gt;during the relevant two-month period, Costa Bros. sought applicants &lt;br&gt;possessing qualifications similar to those of the appellants for &lt;br&gt;open positions.  Thus, the prima facie case was fully formed. &lt;br&gt;  2.  The Employer's Reason.  We proceed to the next step &lt;br&gt;of the McDonnell Douglas pavane:  Costa Bros.'s professed reason &lt;br&gt;for failing to rehire the appellants.  In its response to a &lt;br&gt;discovery request, Costa Bros. stated that it hired others in the &lt;br&gt;pertinent time frame because it \"needed masons or laborers and the &lt;br&gt;individuals [eventually hired] were available.\"  It also stated &lt;br&gt;that, apart from Piper and Winters, all the masons that it engaged &lt;br&gt;\"were currently working or had worked for Costa Brothers.\"  The &lt;br&gt;employer glossed these statements in its summary judgment papers, &lt;br&gt;maintaining that it \"simply reacted to men who appeared at the &lt;br&gt;right place at the right time and put them to work.\" &lt;br&gt;  As to Piper and Winters, Costa Bros. makes situation- &lt;br&gt;specific arguments.  Piper,  it says, had special skills as a &lt;br&gt;layout man, and Winters was recommended by Victor Fernandez, &lt;br&gt;another Costa Bros. employee. &lt;br&gt;  We assume, for argument's sake, that these reasons, in &lt;br&gt;the aggregate, constitute legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for &lt;br&gt;hiring others in lieu of recalling the appellants.  Accordingly, we &lt;br&gt;proceed to the third and final stage of the McDonnell Douglas &lt;br&gt;inquiry. &lt;br&gt;  3.  Pretext for Discrimination.  Once the employer &lt;br&gt;articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a challenged &lt;br&gt;employment decision, the plaintiff must be accorded a fair chance &lt;br&gt;to show that the stated reason disguised a discriminatory animus.  &lt;br&gt;See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d &lt;br&gt;343, 348 (1st Cir. 1993).  As long as the plaintiff offers evidence &lt;br&gt;of pretext, the trial court must not accept the employer's &lt;br&gt;proffered reason for the adverse employment action at face value, &lt;br&gt;no matter how plausible it may sound, but must proceed to the final &lt;br&gt;analytic step.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.  To that &lt;br&gt;end, we review the summary judgment record. &lt;br&gt;  We start with the employer's situation-specific reasons.  &lt;br&gt;The lower court accepted without further inquiry Costa Bros.'s &lt;br&gt;explanations of why it hired Piper and Winters.  We are not so &lt;br&gt;sanguine. &lt;br&gt;  That said, we cannot fault the district court's ruling &lt;br&gt;vis--vis Piper.  Costa Bros. asserts without contradiction that it &lt;br&gt;needed a layout man on the job and that none of the appellants &lt;br&gt;possessed this particular skill.  If true, this rationale suffices &lt;br&gt;to dispel any odor of unfair discrimination, see Hill v. Seaboard &lt;br&gt;Coast Line R.R. Co., 767 F.2d 771, 774 (11th Cir. 1985), and the &lt;br&gt;appellants neither contested the need for a layout man nor claimed &lt;br&gt;to possess the requisite skill set. &lt;br&gt;  Winters's hiring is more problematic.  The district court &lt;br&gt;characterized this event as cronyism, not discrimination (and &lt;br&gt;therefore lawful, though perhaps unsavory).  For this proposition, &lt;br&gt;it relied upon our opinion in Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52 (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1995).  Foster, however, cannot carry the weight that the &lt;br&gt;district court thrust upon it. &lt;br&gt;  In Foster, the trial court concluded that cronyism, not &lt;br&gt;race discrimination, had prompted a hiring decision.  See id. at &lt;br&gt;55.  We upheld that conclusion, ruling that \"in this case, cronyism &lt;br&gt;provides a sufficient alternative explanation\" for the decision.  &lt;br&gt;See id. at 56.  Withal, the district court made its finding not on &lt;br&gt;summary judgment but after a bench trial.  See id. at 54-56.  The &lt;br&gt;opinion does not stand for the proposition that a court, at the &lt;br&gt;summary judgment stage, may accept uncritically an employer's &lt;br&gt;articulation of cronyism as an explanation for its actions.  &lt;br&gt;Rather, the court must take the next step and determine, on whole- &lt;br&gt;record review, if the evidence raises a genuine issue of material &lt;br&gt;fact as to whether the proffered explanation is the real reason for &lt;br&gt;the employer's decision or, conversely, a pretext for &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  See, e.g., Conward, 171 F.3d at 19; Mullin v. &lt;br&gt;Raytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696, 699 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. &lt;br&gt;Ct. 44 (1999). &lt;br&gt;  At any rate, the district court's error goes well beyond &lt;br&gt;its failure to probe the facts surrounding Winters's enlistment.  &lt;br&gt;In the circumstances of this case, the court should have cast the &lt;br&gt;net of its inquiry more widely and assessed all the recalls and &lt;br&gt;hirings that had transpired during the months of December and &lt;br&gt;January.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05; Conward, 171 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 20. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros. seems to concede that, in the usual case, &lt;br&gt;this would be the proper focus.  Nevertheless, it maintains that &lt;br&gt;the appellants directed the lower court's attention to Piper and &lt;br&gt;Winters, and thus have waived the right to claim that the court &lt;br&gt;should have considered a broader array of hiring decisions.  We &lt;br&gt;examine this line of defense. &lt;br&gt;  In fairness, the appellants did place heavy emphasis on &lt;br&gt;the arrival of Piper and Winters.  Yet, we cannot say that they did &lt;br&gt;so to the exclusion of the broader comparative group.  The &lt;br&gt;appellants' complaint alleges, without limitation, that on three &lt;br&gt;dates in January 1996, \"the defendant hired other outside white &lt;br&gt;employees for the mason positions previously held by plaintiffs.\"  &lt;br&gt;The appellants followed up on this averment in the course of &lt;br&gt;pretrial discovery; they sought the race and national origin of all &lt;br&gt;employees who were (a) laid off on December 7, 1995, and (b) hired &lt;br&gt;(or rehired) thereafter.  When Costa Bros. moved for summary &lt;br&gt;judgment, the appellants' opposition noted that \"[d]efendant also &lt;br&gt;admits that numerous employees [who] were white and/or Portuguese &lt;br&gt;were hired at the project as masons,\" thus conceptualizing the &lt;br&gt;comparative group as comprising more than merely Piper and Winters.  &lt;br&gt;They also assailed the employer's contention that DaCosta had hired &lt;br&gt;his \"own men,\" positing that this was not a legitimate, &lt;br&gt;nondiscriminatory reason for failing to recall the appellants &lt;br&gt;because this group included no minorities.  Finally, at oral &lt;br&gt;argument on the summary judgment motion, the appellants' counsel &lt;br&gt;attempted to focus the court on the issue of pretext, urging that &lt;br&gt;the \"regular crew\" and \"special skills\" explanations \"weren't the &lt;br&gt;reasons that [DaCosta] wasn't hiring minorities\"; that \"when [Rose] &lt;br&gt;went back to this site the place was full . . . and none of the &lt;br&gt;faces that he saw on the job site when he returned there were any &lt;br&gt;employees he had seen previously\"; and that \"the reasons given [by &lt;br&gt;DaCosta] were false . . . . the whole place was re-employed and &lt;br&gt;[Piper and Winters] weren't the only [new] people.\" &lt;br&gt;  In sum, the appellants persistently attempted to refer &lt;br&gt;the district court to a larger comparative group.  The court, just &lt;br&gt;as persistently, refused to countenance such a comparison.  Waivers &lt;br&gt;are not lightly to be inferred, and in these circumstances, we are &lt;br&gt;reluctant to deprive the appellants of their day in court.  &lt;br&gt;Although the question is not free from doubt, we conclude that the &lt;br&gt;appellants adequately preserved the argument that the proper &lt;br&gt;comparative group consists of all workers recalled or hired during &lt;br&gt;December and January. &lt;br&gt;  We turn to this comparison.  Costa Bros. tries valiantly &lt;br&gt;to head off a detailed inquiry by insisting that, in the relevant &lt;br&gt;period, it hired only persons who had been part of its regular &lt;br&gt;complement.  Without more, this professed policy cannot justify the &lt;br&gt;entry of summary judgment.  Indeed, such a praxis   in DaCosta's &lt;br&gt;phrase, the exclusionary use of \"my own men\"   cuts both ways.  &lt;br&gt;Common sense teaches that when a work force is lily white (or &lt;br&gt;nearly so), practices that have the effect of excluding outsiders &lt;br&gt;may serve to discriminate against minorities in a devastatingly &lt;br&gt;effective manner.  Accordingly, the very existence of such a policy &lt;br&gt;sometimes constitutes evidence of discrimination.  See, e.g., EEOC &lt;br&gt;v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 606 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1995); Thomas v. Washington County Sch. Bd., 915 F.2d 922, 925 (4th &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1990).  Given the contradictions and ambiguities that permeate &lt;br&gt;this record, the question of whether DaCosta's stated preference &lt;br&gt;for hiring \"my own men\" is a pretext for racial discrimination is &lt;br&gt;for the factfinder at trial, not for the judge on a Rule 56 motion. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros. also presses a \"same actor\" argument.  See &lt;br&gt;LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 847 (1st Cir. 1993).  It &lt;br&gt;observes that Ceribelli hired Rose and Gilbert on the basis of &lt;br&gt;friendship and suggests that declining to rehire them based on &lt;br&gt;racial animus makes no sense.  But it was DaCosta, not Ceribelli, &lt;br&gt;who rebuffed Rose and Gilbert when they applied for reinstatement.  &lt;br&gt;A jury rationally could conclude, therefore, that, in Ceribelli's &lt;br&gt;own words, he had \"only hired a few minorities because of local &lt;br&gt;pressure,\" and that DaCosta   who owned the company   precluded any &lt;br&gt;further minority hiring once that pressure subsided. &lt;br&gt;  Having cut a passable swath through the tangle of &lt;br&gt;arguments advanced by the employer, we now focus on the adequacy of &lt;br&gt;the appellants' proof of pretext cum animus.  We previously &lt;br&gt;concluded that DaCosta's statements that (1) \"I don't need &lt;br&gt;minorities, and I don't need residents on this job.  I got my men,\" &lt;br&gt;and (2) \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" &lt;br&gt;were amenable to differing interpretations, one benign and one &lt;br&gt;discriminatory.  See supra Part III(B).  Although this ambiguity &lt;br&gt;defeated the attempt to characterize the statements as direct &lt;br&gt;evidence (and thus defeated the claim that the lower court erred in &lt;br&gt;refusing to engage in a mixed-motive analysis), see id., the &lt;br&gt;question differs under pretext analysis. &lt;br&gt;  In that mode, an inquiring court does not ask whether the &lt;br&gt;plaintiff has adduced direct evidence of discrimination, but asks &lt;br&gt;instead whether the evidence presented, regardless of its &lt;br&gt;character, suffices to raise a genuine issue about the &lt;br&gt;pretextuality of the employer's explanation for the challenged &lt;br&gt;employment decision.  In the course of this latter exercise, the &lt;br&gt;court, at the summary judgment stage, must interpret the evidence &lt;br&gt;in the light most flattering to the nonmovant, resolving all &lt;br&gt;ambiguities in that party's favor.  See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18; &lt;br&gt;Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347.  Thus, the fact that DaCosta's comments &lt;br&gt;were susceptible to conflicting interpretations helps the &lt;br&gt;appellants at this juncture. &lt;br&gt;  To all intents and purposes, that ends the matter.  The &lt;br&gt;evidence that we recounted in connection with the appellants' prima &lt;br&gt;facie case suffices to put the question of pretext into issue, and &lt;br&gt;DaCosta's statements, taken in the light most favorable to the &lt;br&gt;appellants, add the necessary element of racial animus.  See  &lt;br&gt;Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 171 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1998)(citing cases).  In other words, there is room on this record &lt;br&gt;for a rational factfinder to infer that Costa Bros.'s failure to &lt;br&gt;recall the appellants was motivated by a proscribed racial animus &lt;br&gt;rather than by random availability of workers or loyalty to members &lt;br&gt;of its regular crew. &lt;br&gt;  If more were needed   and we doubt that it is   the &lt;br&gt;record is replete with other evidence that points to the same &lt;br&gt;conclusion.  For instance, Ceribelli, when asked why minority &lt;br&gt;workers had not been recalled, responded that Costa Bros. \"had only &lt;br&gt;hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\"  In the same &lt;br&gt;vein, DaCosta's repeated allusions to \"you guys\" and terms of like &lt;br&gt;tenor reinforce the inference of racial animus.  Then, too, the &lt;br&gt;circumstances surrounding Fernandes's abortive return to work lend &lt;br&gt;further support. &lt;br&gt;  We glean another relevant item of proof from George &lt;br&gt;Medeiros's affidavit.  Medeiros, a white mason, had been laid off &lt;br&gt;along with the appellants on December 7.  Later that month, he &lt;br&gt;inquired about reinstatement.  According to Medeiros: &lt;br&gt;    Mr. Ceribelli told me to call Domingos DaCosta &lt;br&gt;  at the company office, and inform him that I &lt;br&gt;  am looking for work as a bricklayer and mason, &lt;br&gt;  and specifically inform him that I am a &lt;br&gt;  Mashpee resident and am white.  I did what Mr. &lt;br&gt;  Ceribelli asked me to, and the next day &lt;br&gt;  [December 15] was hired to work on the Mashpee &lt;br&gt;  High School Project. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;(Emphasis supplied.) &lt;br&gt;Although the appellants do not choose to catalog this statement as &lt;br&gt;direct evidence of racial discrimination   a choice on which we &lt;br&gt;take no view   we believe that it speaks volumes in a pretext &lt;br&gt;analysis.  We realize that a factfinder will have to pass upon &lt;br&gt;Medeiros's credibility, but that is precisely the point.  The &lt;br&gt;evidence, taken as a whole, creates a genuine issue of material &lt;br&gt;fact as to whether Costa Bros.'s explanations are canards, designed &lt;br&gt;to mask a discriminatory animus. &lt;br&gt;                     D.  The State-Law Claim. &lt;br&gt;  We need not separately discuss the merits of the &lt;br&gt;appellants' state-law claim.  The McDonnell Douglas framework &lt;br&gt;applies to disparate treatment claims brought under Chapter 151B, &lt;br&gt;but the appellants' burden is somewhat lighter in one respect.  &lt;br&gt;\"While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus [racial] &lt;br&gt;animus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of the &lt;br&gt;pavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.\"  Mullin, 164 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 699 (citing Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, &lt;br&gt;Inc., 646 N.E.2d 111, 116-17 (Mass. 1995)).  We already have &lt;br&gt;concluded that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether &lt;br&gt;Costa Bros.'s stated reasons for its actions are a pretext for &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  See supra Part III(C).  A fortiori, we must reach &lt;br&gt;the same conclusion with respect to the appellants' state-law &lt;br&gt;claim.  See Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. Corp., 150 F.3d 21, 26-27 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1998). &lt;br&gt;IV.  CONCLUSION &lt;br&gt;  We need go no further.  In the circumstances of this &lt;br&gt;case, sufficient evidence exists to permit a rational finder of &lt;br&gt;fact to infer that the employer's articulated reasons for not &lt;br&gt;rehiring the appellants are merely a coverup for racial &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  Consequently, we vacate the order granting summary &lt;br&gt;judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vacated and remanded.  Costs to appellants.&lt;/pre&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",

Rose, all dark-skinned Cape Verdeans, &lt;br&gt;sued their quondam employer, Costa Brothers Masonry, Inc. (Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros.), alleging a discriminatory failure to rehire.  They now &lt;br&gt;appeal from an order granting summary judgment against them.  Their &lt;br&gt;appeal requires us to explore how courts charged with resolving &lt;br&gt;discrimination cases should choose between pretext analysis (an &lt;br&gt;approach first limned in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. &lt;br&gt;792 (1973)) and mixed-motive analysis (an alternative approach &lt;br&gt;limned later in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span> (1989) &lt;br&gt;(plurality opinion)).  We conclude, as did the district court, that &lt;br&gt;the evidence thus far adduced does not trigger mixed-motive &lt;br&gt;analysis.  We also conclude, however, that under a properly &lt;br&gt;performed pretext analysis, the appellants' case should have &lt;br&gt;survived.  Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for &lt;br&gt;further proceedings. &lt;br&gt;I.  THE FACTS &lt;br&gt;  As the summary judgment standard demands, we take the &lt;br&gt;facts in the light most hospitable to the appellants, indulging all &lt;br&gt;reasonable inferences in their favor.  See Conward v. Cambridge &lt;br&gt;Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762534\"><a href=\"/opinion/762534/thomas-conward-v-the-cambridge-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1999).  Mindful of this coign &lt;br&gt;of vantage, we deliberately omit from our narrative versions of &lt;br&gt;certain conversations and events that conflict with the appellants' &lt;br&gt;accounts. &lt;br&gt;  In 1995, Stone Building Company secured a contract to &lt;br&gt;construct a new high school in Mashpee, Massachusetts.  It engaged &lt;br&gt;Costa Bros. as the masonry subcontractor.  Because the job was &lt;br&gt;publicly funded, contractors and subcontractors were told that they &lt;br&gt;had to conform to specific equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules &lt;br&gt;and to issue weekly EEO summaries documenting the number of hours &lt;br&gt;worked by minority employees. &lt;br&gt;  A Portuguese immigrant, Domingos DaCosta, owns Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros.  On November 13, 1995, he retained Sebastian Ceribelli, a &lt;br&gt;Brazilian, as the masonry foreman for the Mashpee project.  DaCosta &lt;br&gt;and Ceribelli then hired a number of masons and laborers to work on &lt;br&gt;the job.  Those engaged on November 27 included five masons   the &lt;br&gt;appellants and two white males, George Choquette and George &lt;br&gt;Medeiros   and a dark-skinned Cape Verdean laborer, Glenn Spinola.  &lt;br&gt;These six men worked as a team until December 7, when Ceribelli &lt;br&gt;laid off all six due to winter weather conditions and lack of heat &lt;br&gt;in the workplace.  He vowed that he would recall them when the &lt;br&gt;heating quandary had been solved.  Other workers were laid off at &lt;br&gt;roughly the same time (although some, unlike the appellants, were &lt;br&gt;assigned to ongoing Costa Bros. projects elsewhere). &lt;br&gt;  On or about December 13, Costa Bros. resumed work on the &lt;br&gt;Mashpee project.  It recalled some masons (but not the appellants).  &lt;br&gt;Gilbert visited the job site the following week and asked Ceribelli &lt;br&gt;when he would be rehired.  Ceribelli responded, \"The way things are &lt;br&gt;going now . . . I wouldn't count on it.\" &lt;br&gt;  Rose sojourned to the site the next Saturday.  He noticed &lt;br&gt;masons working there and queried DaCosta about this circumstance.  &lt;br&gt;DaCosta replied, \"We're doing a little fixing up here.\"  Rose then &lt;br&gt;asked, \"Are we going to get called back?\"  DaCosta responded, &lt;br&gt;\"We're going to close in\"   a comment that Rose reasonably took to &lt;br&gt;mean that the building would be enclosed in order to create a &lt;br&gt;heated space in which masons could work. &lt;br&gt;  Having heard nothing further, Rose checked back two weeks &lt;br&gt;later.  He saw that the job site was fully heated and asked &lt;br&gt;DaCosta, \"Aren't we coming back?\"  DaCosta replied cryptically, &lt;br&gt;\"Well, I got my men.\"  When Rose inquired about what had happened &lt;br&gt;to the plan to recruit residents and minorities, DaCosta stated, \"I &lt;br&gt;don't need minorities, and I don't need no residents on this job.  &lt;br&gt;I got my men.\"  Rose complained that DaCosta had \"twelve new faces\" &lt;br&gt;working on the project, but DaCosta abruptly terminated the &lt;br&gt;conversation. &lt;br&gt;  In point of fact, Costa Bros. recalled a total of &lt;br&gt;eighteen workmen (masons and laborers) between December 13 and &lt;br&gt;January 25, and hired ten new ones in that span (none of whom had &lt;br&gt;worked previously for Costa Bros.).  All twenty-eight were white &lt;br&gt;males. &lt;br&gt;  Fernandes returned to the job site on numerous occasions &lt;br&gt;in December and January.  Each time, DaCosta told him that there &lt;br&gt;was no work available but to come back again.  After several weeks, &lt;br&gt;Fernandes asked Ceribelli why he and the other Cape Verdeans had &lt;br&gt;not been recalled.  Ceribelli replied that Costa Bros. \"had only &lt;br&gt;hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\" &lt;br&gt;  On January 30, DaCosta, James Byrne (the clerk of the &lt;br&gt;works), and a representative of the general contractor met with &lt;br&gt;Fernandes, Raoul Galvin (a civil rights activist), and others from &lt;br&gt;the local community regarding Costa Bros.'s compliance with EEO &lt;br&gt;requirements.  Galvin noted that Costa Bros. had hired more &lt;br&gt;workers, all of whom were white, but that it had no minorities &lt;br&gt;working at the site.  He implored DaCosta to rehire Fernandes &lt;br&gt;because \"whatever was going on at the time would stop if he at &lt;br&gt;least put one of [the Cape Verdeans] back to work.\"  DaCosta &lt;br&gt;indicated that he would honor this request. &lt;br&gt;  Fernandes reported for duty the following Monday but was &lt;br&gt;informed that there was no work available.  This experience was &lt;br&gt;repeated several times.  Costa Bros. finally restored Fernandes to &lt;br&gt;the payroll on March 26, albeit as a laborer rather than as a &lt;br&gt;mason.  On the same day, Ceribelli warned him to \"watch out\" &lt;br&gt;because DaCosta was \"going to be on [his] back.\"  This prediction &lt;br&gt;proved prophetic:  according to Fernandes, DaCosta \"followed [him] &lt;br&gt;around,\" constantly \"hollering and screaming\" at him. &lt;br&gt;  When Fernandes reported for work the next morning, &lt;br&gt;DaCosta instructed him to get an \"F block\" (or so he thought).  &lt;br&gt;Fernandes was unsure what an \"F block\" was and asked DaCosta (who, &lt;br&gt;as matters turned out, had wanted a standard \"half block\").  After &lt;br&gt;castigating Fernandes for his ignorance, DaCosta declared that he &lt;br&gt;was \"tired of . . . what's going on between you guys,\" and voiced &lt;br&gt;the opinion that \"[y]ou guys are trying to hurt me.\"  He then &lt;br&gt;proclaimed:  \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean &lt;br&gt;people.  This is my business.  It belongs to me.\"  At that &lt;br&gt;juncture, DaCosta fired Fernandes. &lt;br&gt;II.  TRAVEL OF THE CASE &lt;br&gt;  After pursuing administrative remedies, see 42 U.S.C.  &lt;br&gt;2000e-5(e); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  5, the appellants sued.  In &lt;br&gt;their complaint, they alleged discrimination on the basis of race &lt;br&gt;and color in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of &lt;br&gt;1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e to 2000e-17, and its state-law analogue, &lt;br&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4(1).  Costa Bros. denied the material &lt;br&gt;allegations of the complaint, and the parties spent the next year &lt;br&gt;conducting pretrial discovery.  From the record and the briefs, it &lt;br&gt;appears that the appellants' original claim was constructively &lt;br&gt;amended to include discrimination predicated on national origin, &lt;br&gt;and the case went forward on that assumption. &lt;br&gt;  In due course, Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment, &lt;br&gt;see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and the appellants filed an opposition.  &lt;br&gt;The district court heard oral argument, took the matter under &lt;br&gt;advisement, and thereafter granted the motion as to all claims.  In &lt;br&gt;its unpublished rescript, the court characterized DaCosta's &lt;br&gt;statement that \"I don't need minorities . . . on this job\" as a &lt;br&gt;stray remark, insufficient to trigger mixed-motive analysis.  &lt;br&gt;Although the court catalogued DaCosta's comment that \"I don't have &lt;br&gt;to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" in its recitation of the &lt;br&gt;facts, it did not mention this comment thereafter. &lt;br&gt;  Undertaking pretext analysis, the court focused on two &lt;br&gt;white masons who had been hired in January 1996   Piper and &lt;br&gt;Winters.  The court ruled that the Piper hiring did not assist the &lt;br&gt;appellants because Piper had special skills and they could not &lt;br&gt;establish that their qualifications were equivalent to his.  As to &lt;br&gt;Winters, the court accepted Costa Bros.'s explanation that it had &lt;br&gt;hired him on the recommendation of another employee, characterizing &lt;br&gt;what had happened as cronyism rather than discrimination.  The &lt;br&gt;court never discussed whether the record sufficed to support a &lt;br&gt;finding that this explanation was pretextual, nor did it explore &lt;br&gt;the numerous other employment decisions that Costa Bros. made in &lt;br&gt;the December-January time frame.  This appeal followed. &lt;br&gt;III.  DISCUSSION &lt;br&gt;  The appellants asseverate that the district court erred &lt;br&gt;in choosing a legal framework and that, even if the court marched &lt;br&gt;down an acceptable analytic path, it did not stay on track.  We &lt;br&gt;consider these arguments in sequence, pausing first to frame the &lt;br&gt;choice-of-approach issue.  We then briefly address the appellants' &lt;br&gt;state-law claim. &lt;br&gt;               A.  The Available Analytic Methods. &lt;br&gt;  A plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII &lt;br&gt;may proceed on a mixed-motive approach or on a pretext approach.  &lt;br&gt;For purposes of this case, it is important to understand the basic &lt;br&gt;difference between these two modalities. &lt;br&gt;  Mixed-motive analysis applies when the evidence shows &lt;br&gt;that an employer considered both a proscribed factor (say, race) &lt;br&gt;and one or more legitimate factors (say, competence) in making a &lt;br&gt;challenged employment decision.  See  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;241-42.  In that scenario, the plaintiff is not obliged to separate &lt;br&gt;out the relative import of each element that went into the &lt;br&gt;decision; rather, once the plaintiff proves that a proscribed &lt;br&gt;factor \"played a motivating part\" in the decision, the burden of &lt;br&gt;persuasion shifts to the employer, who will be held liable for &lt;br&gt;damages under Title VII unless \"it can prove that, even if it had &lt;br&gt;not taken [the proscribed factor] into account, it would have come &lt;br&gt;to the same decision regarding [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 242, 244.  &lt;br&gt;Even then, because Congress has reshaped mixed-motive analysis in &lt;br&gt;certain respects, the employee may be entitled to equitable relief &lt;br&gt;so long as he has proven that the proscribed factor played some &lt;br&gt;part in the decisional calculus.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m); &lt;br&gt;2000e-5(g)(2)(B); see also Higgins v.

Mt. Desert &lt;br&gt;Island Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757871\"><a href=\"/opinion/757871/michael-d-carey-v-mt-desert-island-hospital-michael-d-carey-v-mt/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1998). &lt;br&gt;  It is readily apparent that this mixed-motive approach, &lt;br&gt;uncabined, has the potential to swallow whole the traditional &lt;br&gt;McDonnell Douglas analysis.  To guard against this possibility, the &lt;br&gt;Court restricted its applicability to those infrequent cases in &lt;br&gt;which a plaintiff can demonstrate with a high degree of assurance &lt;br&gt;that the employment decision of which he complains \"was the product &lt;br&gt;of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.\"  Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247.  Under this formulation, access to the &lt;br&gt;mixed-motive approach ultimately depends on the quality of the &lt;br&gt;available evidence.  Most courts agree that Justice O'Connor's &lt;br&gt;seminal concurrence in Price Waterhouse furnishes the best device &lt;br&gt;for testing quality (and, thus, the best roadmap for segregating &lt;br&gt;mixed-motive cases from the mine-run of discrimination cases).  &lt;br&gt;After all, when the Supreme Court rules by means of a plurality &lt;br&gt;opinion (as was true in Price Waterhouse), inferior courts should &lt;br&gt;give effect to the narrowest ground upon which a majority of the &lt;br&gt;Justices supporting the judgment would agree.  See Marks v. United &lt;br&gt;States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 193 (1977).  The O'Connor concurrence fits &lt;br&gt;this profile.  Hence, we turn to it. &lt;br&gt;  \"What is required [to trigger mixed-motive analysis] is &lt;br&gt;. . . direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial &lt;br&gt;negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their &lt;br&gt;decision.\"  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., &lt;br&gt;concurring).  Because discrimination tends more and more to operate &lt;br&gt;in subtle ways, direct evidence is relatively rare; when it comes &lt;br&gt;to light, however, a plaintiff can use it to demonstrate \"that an &lt;br&gt;illegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular &lt;br&gt;employment decision.\"  Id. at 275.  It follows that plaintiffs may &lt;br&gt;use the Price Waterhouse mechanism in disparate treatment cases in &lt;br&gt;which they adduce direct evidence of a discriminatory animus, &lt;br&gt;whereas they must proceed under the conventional McDonnell Douglas &lt;br&gt;framework (commonly called \"pretext analysis\") in all other cases.  &lt;br&gt;See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 95 (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1996). &lt;br&gt;  Under the pretext method, the plaintiff first must &lt;br&gt;establish a prima facie case.  See Texas Dep't of Comm'y Affairs v. &lt;br&gt;Burdine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 802.  We shall return to the components of the prima facie case; &lt;br&gt;for now, it suffices to say that this requirement is \"not onerous.\"  &lt;br&gt;Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  If the plaintiff clears this modest &lt;br&gt;hurdle, the burden of production   but not the burden of persuasion &lt;br&gt;  shifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate, &lt;br&gt;nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  See &lt;br&gt;St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 506-07 (1993); &lt;br&gt;Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55.  Once that occurs, the plaintiff must &lt;br&gt;show both that the employer's \"proffered reason is a sham, and that &lt;br&gt;discriminatory animus sparked [its] actions.\"  Conward, 171 F.3d at &lt;br&gt;19.  To this end, the full panoply of circumstantial evidence is &lt;br&gt;available, including but not limited to \"statistical evidence &lt;br&gt;showing disparate treatment by the employer of members of the &lt;br&gt;protected class, comments by decisionmakers which denigrate &lt;br&gt;[persons in the protected group], the incidence of differential &lt;br&gt;treatment in the workplace, and the deployment of . . . &lt;br&gt;replacements.\"  Mesnick v.

National Football &lt;br&gt;League Players Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184382\"><a href=\"/opinion/184382/thomas-valerie-v-natl-ftbl-leag-plyrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 202 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  &lt;br&gt;Consistent with the O'Connor concurrence, the court typically will &lt;br&gt;make that determination based on the availability or unavailability &lt;br&gt;of direct evidence.  See Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d &lt;br&gt;219, 232 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. &lt;br&gt;Cos., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586295\"><a href=\"/opinion/586295/james-p-ostrowski-v-atlantic-mutual-insurance-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 181-82 (2d Cir. 1992). &lt;br&gt;  This ruling can have important effects on the outcome of &lt;br&gt;the litigation.  In a mixed-motive analysis, \"the burden of &lt;br&gt;persuasion shifts from the employee to the employer, who must then &lt;br&gt;affirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even &lt;br&gt;if it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.\"  &lt;br&gt;Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; accord Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 246 (explaining that, under a mixed-motive analysis, \"the &lt;br&gt;plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the &lt;br&gt;employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another\").  &lt;br&gt;This contrasts vividly with pretext analysis, under which the &lt;br&gt;employee retains the burden of persuasion throughout.  See Cumpiano &lt;br&gt;v. Banco Santander P.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 153 (1st Cir. 1990). &lt;br&gt;                    B.  Mixed-Motive Analysis. &lt;br&gt;  With this preface, we turn to the appellants' contention &lt;br&gt;that the lower court erred in eschewing a mixed-motive analysis.  &lt;br&gt;Because this case comes to us on appeal from an order granting &lt;br&gt;brevis disposition, we afford de novo review.  See Conward, 171 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 18. &lt;br&gt;  As our earlier discussion indicates, direct evidence is &lt;br&gt;the touchstone for mixed-motive analysis.  Hence, the fate of the &lt;br&gt;appellants' present contention hinges on whether they adduced &lt;br&gt;direct evidence of Costa Bros.'s use of a proscribed factor (race, &lt;br&gt;color, and/or national origin) in the decisional process.  &lt;br&gt;Answering that question is more difficult than might appear at &lt;br&gt;first blush.  To be sure, Justice O'Connor furnished a trenchant, &lt;br&gt;universally accepted example of what is not direct evidence:  stray &lt;br&gt;remarks, such as \"statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by &lt;br&gt;decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.\"  Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Since &lt;br&gt;then, however, jurists have struggled in attempting to define the &lt;br&gt;term affirmatively.  This operose task not only has divided the &lt;br&gt;courts of appeals but also has created a patchwork of intra-circuit &lt;br&gt;conflicts.  Generally speaking, three schools of thought have &lt;br&gt;emerged. &lt;br&gt;  1.  The \"Classic\" Position.  Some courts adopt the &lt;br&gt;traditional definition of \"direct evidence\" for this purpose, &lt;br&gt;holding that the term signifies evidence which, if believed, &lt;br&gt;suffices to prove the fact of discriminatory animus without &lt;br&gt;inference, presumption, or resort to other evidence.  See, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Shorter v. ICG Holdings, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158469\"><a href=\"/opinion/158469/shorter-v-icg-holdings-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span>, 1207 (10th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999); Haas v. Advo Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762037\"><a href=\"/opinion/762037/ron-haas-v-advo-systems-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span>, 734 n.2 (5th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999); EEOC v. Wiltel, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716751\"><a href=\"/opinion/716751/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-and-ellie-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1508</span></a></span>, 1514 (10th Cir. 1996); &lt;br&gt;Nichols v. Loral Vought Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715861\"><a href=\"/opinion/715861/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1027-68-empl-prac-dec-p-44050-ellis-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 40 (5th Cir. 1996).  &lt;br&gt;Although only the Fifth and Tenth Circuits cling consistently to &lt;br&gt;this view, other tribunals have embraced it periodically.  See, &lt;br&gt;e.g., Carter v. Three Springs Resid'l Treatment, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749848\"><a href=\"/opinion/749848/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1635-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45148-11-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 641 &lt;br&gt;(11th Cir. 1998); Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666886\"><a href=\"/opinion/666886/kimberly-hern-troupe-v-the-may-department-stores-company-doing-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 736 &lt;br&gt;(7th Cir. 1994). &lt;br&gt;  2.  The \"Animus Plus\" Position.  The Fourth Circuit, &lt;br&gt;sitting en banc, recently defined \"direct evidence\" for this &lt;br&gt;purpose as evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of conduct or &lt;br&gt;statements that (1) reflect directly the alleged discriminatory &lt;br&gt;animus and (2) bear squarely on the contested employment decision.  &lt;br&gt;See Taylor, 193 F.3d at 232.  The D.C. Circuit takes the same view.  &lt;br&gt;See Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204.  The Ninth Circuit seems headed in &lt;br&gt;this direction.  See Lambert v. Ackerley, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></span>, 1008-09 &lt;br&gt;(9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), petition for cert. filed, 68 U.S.L.W. &lt;br&gt;3292 (U.S. Oct. 20, 1999) (No. 99-681).  The Third Circuit at one &lt;br&gt;time was in the \"animus plus\" camp, see Walden v. Georgia-Pacific &lt;br&gt;Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746874\"><a href=\"/opinion/746874/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1761-47-fed-r-evid-serv-1158-linda-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 513 (3d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. &lt;br&gt;1516 (1998), but that court is poised to revisit the question.  See &lt;br&gt;Hankins v. City of Philadelphia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765879\"><a href=\"/opinion/765879/no-98-1327/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1999), &lt;br&gt;rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765752\"><a href=\"/opinion/765752/no-98-1327/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span> (3d Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999).  Two other courts of appeals have indicated occasional &lt;br&gt;approval of this approach, see, e.g., Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., 173 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999); Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, &lt;br&gt;Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749827\"><a href=\"/opinion/749827/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-397-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45108-ruth-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 436 (8th Cir. 1998), but as the cases cited &lt;br&gt;herein indicate, both of these courts have flirted with other &lt;br&gt;formulations.  Courts endorsing the animus plus position do not &lt;br&gt;distinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence in the &lt;br&gt;classic sense but, rather, emphasize that the mixed-motive trigger &lt;br&gt;depends on the strength of the plaintiff's case.  See, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Kubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764906\"><a href=\"/opinion/764906/richard-kubicko-v-ogden-logistics-services-a-joint-venture-between-ogden/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 553 (4th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999) (emphasizing that whether a case falls under the mixed-motive &lt;br&gt;or pretext rubric \"ultimately hinges on the strength of the &lt;br&gt;evidence establishing discrimination\") (citation and internal &lt;br&gt;quotation marks omitted); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (similar). &lt;br&gt;  3.  The \"Animus\" Position.  A few courts resolve the &lt;br&gt;direct evidence conundrum by the simple expedient of deleting the &lt;br&gt;\"plus\" from the \"animus plus\" formulation.  Those courts opine that &lt;br&gt;as long as the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) is tied &lt;br&gt;to the alleged discriminatory animus, it need not bear squarely on &lt;br&gt;the challenged employment decision.  The Second Circuit advocates &lt;br&gt;this position.  See, e.g., Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 898, 913 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182.  The &lt;br&gt;Eighth Circuit intermittently takes this stance, see, e.g., Kerns &lt;br&gt;v. Capital Graphics, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764466\"><a href=\"/opinion/764466/janet-r-kerns-v-capital-graphics-inc-doing-business-as-clarinda/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1011</span></a></span>, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1999); &lt;br&gt;Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610655\"><a href=\"/opinion/610655/dean-radabaugh-v-zip-feed-mills-inc-tom-batcheller-don-kjelden/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 449 (8th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1993), and two other cases appear to fit somewhat loosely into this &lt;br&gt;category, see Wright v. Southland Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></span>, 1303-04 &lt;br&gt;(11th Cir. 1999); Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 1344, 1348-50 (7th Cir. 1995). &lt;br&gt;  4.  The First Circuit's Position.  To complete our survey &lt;br&gt;of the legal landscape, we direct our gaze inward.  Although we &lt;br&gt;have dropped inconclusive hints here and there, see, e.g., Ayala- &lt;br&gt;Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, &lt;br&gt;421 (1st Cir. 1996), we have yet to choose among these conflicting &lt;br&gt;approaches.  Thus, the question is wide open in this circuit. &lt;br&gt;  5.  The Case at Hand.  This case does not require us to &lt;br&gt;fill the void, and we decline to do so gratuitously.  The &lt;br&gt;appellants contend that two comments attributed to DaCosta   \"I &lt;br&gt;don't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job\" and &lt;br&gt;\"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\"   &lt;br&gt;constitute direct evidence that a proscribed factor influenced &lt;br&gt;Costa Bros.'s hiring practices.  The employer demurs, asserting &lt;br&gt;that these are merely \"stray remarks\" and, in all events, lack &lt;br&gt;sufficient probative force to constitute direct evidence. &lt;br&gt;  We do not share the view that DaCosta's statements must &lt;br&gt;be classified as stray remarks.  As we have pointed out, DaCosta &lt;br&gt;was the ultimate decisionmaker, and both pronouncements pertained &lt;br&gt;to the decisional process.  He made the first statement when &lt;br&gt;refusing to rehire Rose; because it bore directly on a challenged &lt;br&gt;employment decision, it hardly qualifies as a stray remark.  See, &lt;br&gt;e.g., Deneen, 132 F.3d at 436; Diaz-Gandia v. Dapena-Thompson, 90 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 609, 616 (1st Cir. 1996).  DaCosta uttered the second &lt;br&gt;statement when cashiering Fernandez and, although this suit does &lt;br&gt;not challenge Fernandes's dismissal per se, see infra note 3, we &lt;br&gt;think that the comment, which in terms bears upon Costa Bros.'s &lt;br&gt;repeated refusals to rehire the appellants, sufficiently implicates &lt;br&gt;the decisional process to avoid classification as a stray remark.  &lt;br&gt;See Wichmann v. Board of Trustees, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764846\"><a href=\"/opinion/764846/theodore-f-wichmann-v-board-of-trustees-of-southern-illinois-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 802 (7th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1999), petition for cert. filed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3154</span></span> (U.S. Sept. 3, &lt;br&gt;1999) (No. 99-411); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204. &lt;br&gt;  In the last analysis, however, this taxonomic triumph &lt;br&gt;constitutes a hollow victory for the appellants.  Despite the fact &lt;br&gt;that these statements cannot be brushed aside as stray remarks, &lt;br&gt;they are inherently ambiguous and, as such, do not directly reflect &lt;br&gt;the alleged animus.  The first   \"I don't need minorities and I &lt;br&gt;don't need residents on the job\"   may be interpreted either as an &lt;br&gt;admission of an exclusionary hiring practice (thus explicating the &lt;br&gt;true reason for DaCosta's actions) or as a benign response to a &lt;br&gt;specific inquiry reflecting DaCosta's (erroneous) perception that &lt;br&gt;he no longer had to make special efforts to comply with EEO &lt;br&gt;requirements.  The second   \"I don't have to hire you locals or &lt;br&gt;Cape Verdean people\"   may be interpreted either as a &lt;br&gt;discriminatory explanation for DaCosta's actions or as a response &lt;br&gt;to what he perceived as an unjustified attempt to impose some sort &lt;br&gt;of quota system upon his company. &lt;br&gt;  Under any of the three views we have delineated, these &lt;br&gt;statements do not rise to the level of direct evidence.  Courts &lt;br&gt;that take the \"classic\" position have contrasted direct evidence &lt;br&gt;with, inter alia, ambiguous statements, and have indicated that the &lt;br&gt;latter will not suffice.  See Maldonado v.

Woodward, 188 F.3d &lt;br&gt;1220, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 1999); Conward, 171 F.3d at 19-20; Walker &lt;br&gt;v.

Ctr., &lt;br&gt;881 F.2d 554, 558 (8th Cir. 1989); see also Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at  &lt;br&gt;155 n.2. &lt;br&gt;  Against this benchmark, we conclude without serious &lt;br&gt;question that the appellants established a prima facie case.  The &lt;br&gt;first prong is uncontroversial; all three appellants are Cape &lt;br&gt;Verdean and, as such, belong to a racial minority.  The second &lt;br&gt;element also falls easily into place:  all three performed &lt;br&gt;satisfactorily as masons prior to the layoff and plainly were &lt;br&gt;qualified to do the work. &lt;br&gt;  Turning to the third facet of the prima facie case, the &lt;br&gt;record establishes that all three appellants returned to the job &lt;br&gt;site at various times after the layoff and sought reinstatement.  &lt;br&gt;For the most part, Costa Bros. rebuffed these efforts.  The sole &lt;br&gt;exception   the time in March when DaCosta capitulated to external &lt;br&gt;pressure and hired Fernandes as a laborer, only to fire him on his &lt;br&gt;second day of work   hardly suffices to tip the balance.  Cf. &lt;br&gt;International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, &lt;br&gt;341-42 (1977) (explaining that subsequent changes in corporate &lt;br&gt;\"hiring and promotion policies . . . could not erase [the &lt;br&gt;company's] previous illegal conduct or its obligation to afford &lt;br&gt;relief to those who suffered because of it\").  This is especially &lt;br&gt;so since what transpired on that occasion plausibly can be &lt;br&gt;interpreted (drawing permissive inferences favorable to the &lt;br&gt;appellants) as further evidence of DaCosta's discriminatory &lt;br&gt;treatment of Fernandes.  After all, DaCosta had resisted rehiring &lt;br&gt;Fernandes for several weeks and had to be persuaded to do so by a &lt;br&gt;civil rights advocate.  Moreover, Ceribelli   the Costa Bros. &lt;br&gt;foreman   forewarned Fernandes that DaCosta would be \"on [his] &lt;br&gt;back,\" and the sequence of events that followed reasonably could be &lt;br&gt;seen as proof of the pudding. &lt;br&gt;  The appellants also fulfilled the final prima facie case &lt;br&gt;requirement.  In the relevant time frame (December-January), Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros. had an ongoing need for masons on the Mashpee project, hiring &lt;br&gt;and recalling many throughout the period.  For aught that appears, &lt;br&gt;the qualifications of the vast majority of these masons were much &lt;br&gt;the same as the appellants' qualifications.  No more is exigible.  &lt;br&gt;See Conward, 171 F.3d at 19. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros.'s efforts to dispute this element of the &lt;br&gt;prima facie case are unavailing.  In the district court, it &lt;br&gt;characterized its hiring practices as \"simply react[ing] to men who &lt;br&gt;appeared at the right place at the right time,\" and argued that it &lt;br&gt;had no need for additional help at the precise moments that the &lt;br&gt;appellants inquired.  On this chiaroscuro record, a jury might so &lt;br&gt;find   but it also might find this to be a self-serving fiction.   &lt;br&gt;  It may or may not be a coincidence that, of the nineteen &lt;br&gt;men whom DaCosta furloughed on December 7 and 8 (the three &lt;br&gt;appellants, plus Choquette, George Medeiros, Spinola, William &lt;br&gt;Ceribelli, Juliao Fernandes, Victor Fernandez, Martirio Neto, &lt;br&gt;Antonio Santo, Jose Silva, Artur Teles, Antonio DaSilva, Fernando &lt;br&gt;DaSilva, Miguel Silva, Joseph Pimenthal, Jose Claudino, and Dinos &lt;br&gt;Medeiros), all but five either were reassigned to another Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros. job or recalled in mid-December.  Likewise, it may or may &lt;br&gt;not be coincidental that four of the excluded five (the three &lt;br&gt;appellants and Spinola) comprised the entire complement of minority &lt;br&gt;employees who had toiled on the Mashpee project.  Moreover, the &lt;br&gt;fourteen men who were given an opportunity to work for Costa Bros. &lt;br&gt;either at Mashpee or on another project in mid-December included &lt;br&gt;two white masons (George Medeiros and William Ceribelli) and three &lt;br&gt;white laborers (Joao Bolarinho, Fernando DaSilva, and Artur Teles) &lt;br&gt;who had been hired, and then furloughed, on approximately the same &lt;br&gt;dates as the appellants. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros. attempts to blunt the force of this evidence &lt;br&gt;in three ways.  First, it notes that George Medeiros, though &lt;br&gt;recalled, only worked for four days.  The fact remains, however, &lt;br&gt;that he was recalled and the appellants were not.  Second, Costa &lt;br&gt;Bros. points out that one member of the excluded group (Choquette) &lt;br&gt;was a white mason.  That is true as far as it goes   but it does &lt;br&gt;not go very far:  the record is devoid of evidence that Choquette &lt;br&gt;applied for reinstatement at any time.  Third, Costa Bros. asserts &lt;br&gt;that it rehired Spinola in April 1996.  We think that this fact &lt;br&gt;possesses only marginal relevance here, inasmuch as Spinola's &lt;br&gt;recall occurred well beyond the December-January period during &lt;br&gt;which the appellants unsuccessfully sought reinstatement. &lt;br&gt;  In addition to the fourteen rehires just discussed, the &lt;br&gt;record indicates that Costa Bros. engaged a half-dozen new workers &lt;br&gt;for determinate positions during late December and January:  Carlos &lt;br&gt;Bolarinho (a laborer, hired on December 29); Piper (a mason, hired &lt;br&gt;on January 2); Winters (a mason, hired on January 10); Joaquim &lt;br&gt;Fernandes (a laborer, hired on January 18); Dan Cormier (a laborer, &lt;br&gt;hired on January 22); and Luis Amaro (a laborer, hired on January &lt;br&gt;23).  All were white.  Costa Bros. recruited four more white males &lt;br&gt;(Antonio Reboca, Joao Soares, Michael Oliveira, and Steven Downey) &lt;br&gt;on various dates between January 5 and January 25.  Although these &lt;br&gt;four were assigned to work on the Mashpee project, we cannot &lt;br&gt;accurately determine from the existing record which were masons and &lt;br&gt;which were laborers. &lt;br&gt;  These figures make the appellants' point emphatically.  &lt;br&gt;They create an ample evidentiary platform for a finding that, &lt;br&gt;during the relevant two-month period, Costa Bros. sought applicants &lt;br&gt;possessing qualifications similar to those of the appellants for &lt;br&gt;open positions.  Thus, the prima facie case was fully formed. &lt;br&gt;  2.  The Employer's Reason.  We proceed to the next step &lt;br&gt;of the McDonnell Douglas pavane:  Costa Bros.'s professed reason &lt;br&gt;for failing to rehire the appellants.  In its response to a &lt;br&gt;discovery request, Costa Bros. stated that it hired others in the &lt;br&gt;pertinent time frame because it \"needed masons or laborers and the &lt;br&gt;individuals [eventually hired] were available.\"  It also stated &lt;br&gt;that, apart from Piper and Winters, all the masons that it engaged &lt;br&gt;\"were currently working or had worked for Costa Brothers.\"  The &lt;br&gt;employer glossed these statements in its summary judgment papers, &lt;br&gt;maintaining that it \"simply reacted to men who appeared at the &lt;br&gt;right place at the right time and put them to work.\" &lt;br&gt;  As to Piper and Winters, Costa Bros. makes situation- &lt;br&gt;specific arguments.  Piper,  it says, had special skills as a &lt;br&gt;layout man, and Winters was recommended by Victor Fernandez, &lt;br&gt;another Costa Bros. employee. &lt;br&gt;  We assume, for argument's sake, that these reasons, in &lt;br&gt;the aggregate, constitute legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for &lt;br&gt;hiring others in lieu of recalling the appellants.  Accordingly, we &lt;br&gt;proceed to the third and final stage of the McDonnell Douglas &lt;br&gt;inquiry. &lt;br&gt;  3.  Pretext for Discrimination.  Once the employer &lt;br&gt;articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a challenged &lt;br&gt;employment decision, the plaintiff must be accorded a fair chance &lt;br&gt;to show that the stated reason disguised a discriminatory animus.  &lt;br&gt;See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d &lt;br&gt;343, 348 (1st Cir. 1993).  As long as the plaintiff offers evidence &lt;br&gt;of pretext, the trial court must not accept the employer's &lt;br&gt;proffered reason for the adverse employment action at face value, &lt;br&gt;no matter how plausible it may sound, but must proceed to the final &lt;br&gt;analytic step.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.  To that &lt;br&gt;end, we review the summary judgment record. &lt;br&gt;  We start with the employer's situation-specific reasons.  &lt;br&gt;The lower court accepted without further inquiry Costa Bros.'s &lt;br&gt;explanations of why it hired Piper and Winters.  We are not so &lt;br&gt;sanguine. &lt;br&gt;  That said, we cannot fault the district court's ruling &lt;br&gt;vis--vis Piper.  Costa Bros. asserts without contradiction that it &lt;br&gt;needed a layout man on the job and that none of the appellants &lt;br&gt;possessed this particular skill.  If true, this rationale suffices &lt;br&gt;to dispel any odor of unfair discrimination, see Hill v. Seaboard &lt;br&gt;Coast Line R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454947\"><a href=\"/opinion/454947/39-fair-emplpraccas-1656-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35526-andrew-l-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span>, 774 (11th Cir. 1985), and the &lt;br&gt;appellants neither contested the need for a layout man nor claimed &lt;br&gt;to possess the requisite skill set. &lt;br&gt;  Winters's hiring is more problematic.  The district court &lt;br&gt;characterized this event as cronyism, not discrimination (and &lt;br&gt;therefore lawful, though perhaps unsavory).  For this proposition, &lt;br&gt;it relied upon our opinion in Foster v. Dalton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709035\"><a href=\"/opinion/709035/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1402-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43789-sharon-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1995).  Foster, however, cannot carry the weight that the &lt;br&gt;district court thrust upon it. &lt;br&gt;  In Foster, the trial court concluded that cronyism, not &lt;br&gt;race discrimination, had prompted a hiring decision.  See id. at &lt;br&gt;55.  We upheld that conclusion, ruling that \"in this case, cronyism &lt;br&gt;provides a sufficient alternative explanation\" for the decision.  &lt;br&gt;See id. at 56.  Withal, the district court made its finding not on &lt;br&gt;summary judgment but after a bench trial.  See id. at 54-56.  The &lt;br&gt;opinion does not stand for the proposition that a court, at the &lt;br&gt;summary judgment stage, may accept uncritically an employer's &lt;br&gt;articulation of cronyism as an explanation for its actions.  &lt;br&gt;Rather, the court must take the next step and determine, on whole- &lt;br&gt;record review, if the evidence raises a genuine issue of material &lt;br&gt;fact as to whether the proffered explanation is the real reason for &lt;br&gt;the employer's decision or, conversely, a pretext for &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  See, e.g., Conward, 171 F.3d at 19; Mullin v. &lt;br&gt;Raytheon Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760463\"><a href=\"/opinion/760463/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1174-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45696-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 699 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. &lt;br&gt;Ct. 44 (1999). &lt;br&gt;  At any rate, the district court's error goes well beyond &lt;br&gt;its failure to probe the facts surrounding Winters's enlistment.  &lt;br&gt;In the circumstances of this case, the court should have cast the &lt;br&gt;net of its inquiry more widely and assessed all the recalls and &lt;br&gt;hirings that had transpired during the months of December and &lt;br&gt;January.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05; Conward, 171 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 20. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros. seems to concede that, in the usual case, &lt;br&gt;this would be the proper focus.  Nevertheless, it maintains that &lt;br&gt;the appellants directed the lower court's attention to Piper and &lt;br&gt;Winters, and thus have waived the right to claim that the court &lt;br&gt;should have considered a broader array of hiring decisions.  We &lt;br&gt;examine this line of defense. &lt;br&gt;  In fairness, the appellants did place heavy emphasis on &lt;br&gt;the arrival of Piper and Winters.  Yet, we cannot say that they did &lt;br&gt;so to the exclusion of the broader comparative group.  The &lt;br&gt;appellants' complaint alleges, without limitation, that on three &lt;br&gt;dates in January 1996, \"the defendant hired other outside white &lt;br&gt;employees for the mason positions previously held by plaintiffs.\"  &lt;br&gt;The appellants followed up on this averment in the course of &lt;br&gt;pretrial discovery; they sought the race and national origin of all &lt;br&gt;employees who were (a) laid off on December 7, 1995, and (b) hired &lt;br&gt;(or rehired) thereafter.  When Costa Bros. moved for summary &lt;br&gt;judgment, the appellants' opposition noted that \"[d]efendant also &lt;br&gt;admits that numerous employees [who] were white and/or Portuguese &lt;br&gt;were hired at the project as masons,\" thus conceptualizing the &lt;br&gt;comparative group as comprising more than merely Piper and Winters.  &lt;br&gt;They also assailed the employer's contention that DaCosta had hired &lt;br&gt;his \"own men,\" positing that this was not a legitimate, &lt;br&gt;nondiscriminatory reason for failing to recall the appellants &lt;br&gt;because this group included no minorities.  Finally, at oral &lt;br&gt;argument on the summary judgment motion, the appellants' counsel &lt;br&gt;attempted to focus the court on the issue of pretext, urging that &lt;br&gt;the \"regular crew\" and \"special skills\" explanations \"weren't the &lt;br&gt;reasons that [DaCosta] wasn't hiring minorities\"; that \"when [Rose] &lt;br&gt;went back to this site the place was full . . . and none of the &lt;br&gt;faces that he saw on the job site when he returned there were any &lt;br&gt;employees he had seen previously\"; and that \"the reasons given [by &lt;br&gt;DaCosta] were false . . . . the whole place was re-employed and &lt;br&gt;[Piper and Winters] weren't the only [new] people.\" &lt;br&gt;  In sum, the appellants persistently attempted to refer &lt;br&gt;the district court to a larger comparative group.  The court, just &lt;br&gt;as persistently, refused to countenance such a comparison.  Waivers &lt;br&gt;are not lightly to be inferred, and in these circumstances, we are &lt;br&gt;reluctant to deprive the appellants of their day in court.  &lt;br&gt;Although the question is not free from doubt, we conclude that the &lt;br&gt;appellants adequately preserved the argument that the proper &lt;br&gt;comparative group consists of all workers recalled or hired during &lt;br&gt;December and January. &lt;br&gt;  We turn to this comparison.  Costa Bros. tries valiantly &lt;br&gt;to head off a detailed inquiry by insisting that, in the relevant &lt;br&gt;period, it hired only persons who had been part of its regular &lt;br&gt;complement.  Without more, this professed policy cannot justify the &lt;br&gt;entry of summary judgment.  Indeed, such a praxis   in DaCosta's &lt;br&gt;phrase, the exclusionary use of \"my own men\"   cuts both ways.  &lt;br&gt;Common sense teaches that when a work force is lily white (or &lt;br&gt;nearly so), practices that have the effect of excluding outsiders &lt;br&gt;may serve to discriminate against minorities in a devastatingly &lt;br&gt;effective manner.  Accordingly, the very existence of such a policy &lt;br&gt;sometimes constitutes evidence of discrimination.  See, e.g., EEOC &lt;br&gt;v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195936\"><a href=\"/opinion/195936/eeoc-v-local-1066/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1995); Thomas v. Washington County Sch. Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548949\"><a href=\"/opinion/548949/patricia-a-thomas-v-washington-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 925 (4th &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1990).  Given the contradictions and ambiguities that permeate &lt;br&gt;this record, the question of whether DaCosta's stated preference &lt;br&gt;for hiring \"my own men\" is a pretext for racial discrimination is &lt;br&gt;for the factfinder at trial, not for the judge on a Rule 56 motion. &lt;br&gt;  Costa Bros. also presses a \"same actor\" argument.  See &lt;br&gt;LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 847 (1st Cir. 1993).  It &lt;br&gt;observes that Ceribelli hired Rose and Gilbert on the basis of &lt;br&gt;friendship and suggests that declining to rehire them based on &lt;br&gt;racial animus makes no sense.  But it was DaCosta, not Ceribelli, &lt;br&gt;who rebuffed Rose and Gilbert when they applied for reinstatement.  &lt;br&gt;A jury rationally could conclude, therefore, that, in Ceribelli's &lt;br&gt;own words, he had \"only hired a few minorities because of local &lt;br&gt;pressure,\" and that DaCosta   who owned the company   precluded any &lt;br&gt;further minority hiring once that pressure subsided. &lt;br&gt;  Having cut a passable swath through the tangle of &lt;br&gt;arguments advanced by the employer, we now focus on the adequacy of &lt;br&gt;the appellants' proof of pretext cum animus.  We previously &lt;br&gt;concluded that DaCosta's statements that (1) \"I don't need &lt;br&gt;minorities, and I don't need residents on this job.  I got my men,\" &lt;br&gt;and (2) \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" &lt;br&gt;were amenable to differing interpretations, one benign and one &lt;br&gt;discriminatory.  See supra Part III(B).  Although this ambiguity &lt;br&gt;defeated the attempt to characterize the statements as direct &lt;br&gt;evidence (and thus defeated the claim that the lower court erred in &lt;br&gt;refusing to engage in a mixed-motive analysis), see id., the &lt;br&gt;question differs under pretext analysis. &lt;br&gt;  In that mode, an inquiring court does not ask whether the &lt;br&gt;plaintiff has adduced direct evidence of discrimination, but asks &lt;br&gt;instead whether the evidence presented, regardless of its &lt;br&gt;character, suffices to raise a genuine issue about the &lt;br&gt;pretextuality of the employer's explanation for the challenged &lt;br&gt;employment decision.  In the course of this latter exercise, the &lt;br&gt;court, at the summary judgment stage, must interpret the evidence &lt;br&gt;in the light most flattering to the nonmovant, resolving all &lt;br&gt;ambiguities in that party's favor.  See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18; &lt;br&gt;Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347.  Thus, the fact that DaCosta's comments &lt;br&gt;were susceptible to conflicting interpretations helps the &lt;br&gt;appellants at this juncture. &lt;br&gt;  To all intents and purposes, that ends the matter.  The &lt;br&gt;evidence that we recounted in connection with the appellants' prima &lt;br&gt;facie case suffices to put the question of pretext into issue, and &lt;br&gt;DaCosta's statements, taken in the light most favorable to the &lt;br&gt;appellants, add the necessary element of racial animus.  See  &lt;br&gt;Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197958\"><a href=\"/opinion/197958/hodgens-v-general-dynamics-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 171 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1998)(citing cases).  In other words, there is room on this record &lt;br&gt;for a rational factfinder to infer that Costa Bros.'s failure to &lt;br&gt;recall the appellants was motivated by a proscribed racial animus &lt;br&gt;rather than by random availability of workers or loyalty to members &lt;br&gt;of its regular crew. &lt;br&gt;  If more were needed   and we doubt that it is   the &lt;br&gt;record is replete with other evidence that points to the same &lt;br&gt;conclusion.  For instance, Ceribelli, when asked why minority &lt;br&gt;workers had not been recalled, responded that Costa Bros. \"had only &lt;br&gt;hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\"  In the same &lt;br&gt;vein, DaCosta's repeated allusions to \"you guys\" and terms of like &lt;br&gt;tenor reinforce the inference of racial animus.  Then, too, the &lt;br&gt;circumstances surrounding Fernandes's abortive return to work lend &lt;br&gt;further support. &lt;br&gt;  We glean another relevant item of proof from George &lt;br&gt;Medeiros's affidavit.  Medeiros, a white mason, had been laid off &lt;br&gt;along with the appellants on December 7.  Later that month, he &lt;br&gt;inquired about reinstatement.  According to Medeiros: &lt;br&gt;    Mr. Ceribelli told me to call Domingos DaCosta &lt;br&gt;  at the company office, and inform him that I &lt;br&gt;  am looking for work as a bricklayer and mason, &lt;br&gt;  and specifically inform him that I am a &lt;br&gt;  Mashpee resident and am white.  I did what Mr. &lt;br&gt;  Ceribelli asked me to, and the next day &lt;br&gt;  [December 15] was hired to work on the Mashpee &lt;br&gt;  High School Project. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;(Emphasis supplied.) &lt;br&gt;Although the appellants do not choose to catalog this statement as &lt;br&gt;direct evidence of racial discrimination   a choice on which we &lt;br&gt;take no view   we believe that it speaks volumes in a pretext &lt;br&gt;analysis.  We realize that a factfinder will have to pass upon &lt;br&gt;Medeiros's credibility, but that is precisely the point.  The &lt;br&gt;evidence, taken as a whole, creates a genuine issue of material &lt;br&gt;fact as to whether Costa Bros.'s explanations are canards, designed &lt;br&gt;to mask a discriminatory animus. &lt;br&gt;                     D.  The State-Law Claim. &lt;br&gt;  We need not separately discuss the merits of the &lt;br&gt;appellants' state-law claim.  The McDonnell Douglas framework &lt;br&gt;applies to disparate treatment claims brought under Chapter 151B, &lt;br&gt;but the appellants' burden is somewhat lighter in one respect.  &lt;br&gt;\"While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus [racial] &lt;br&gt;animus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of the &lt;br&gt;pavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.\"  Mullin, 164 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 699 (citing Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, &lt;br&gt;Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span>, 116-17 (Mass. 1995)).  We already have &lt;br&gt;concluded that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether &lt;br&gt;Costa Bros.'s stated reasons for its actions are a pretext for &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  See supra Part III(C).  A fortiori, we must reach &lt;br&gt;the same conclusion with respect to the appellants' state-law &lt;br&gt;claim.  See Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756418\"><a href=\"/opinion/756418/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-430-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45627-daniel-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26-27 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1998). &lt;br&gt;IV.  CONCLUSION &lt;br&gt;  We need go no further.  In the circumstances of this &lt;br&gt;case, sufficient evidence exists to permit a rational finder of &lt;br&gt;fact to infer that the employer's articulated reasons for not &lt;br&gt;rehiring the appellants are merely a coverup for racial &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  Consequently, we vacate the order granting summary &lt;br&gt;judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vacated and remanded.  Costs to appellants.&lt;/pre&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",
